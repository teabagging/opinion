You dont need to have a book or written guidance to come to conclusions based upon your own experiences. The vast amount of science is using evidence we can find to draw the most likely conclusion. For example, everything we know about outer space we primarily cant directly prove. That doesnt mean we dont know anything about outer space, that means we are able to use math and the laws of physics as well as collective evidence to deduce the highest likelihood of what something is. That is science. My reasons for atheism far extend beyond evolution though. I used to be more agnostic, but understanding how modern religion is all essentially based upon astrology and seeing the exact references really made me certain.

Prices are soaring, jobs are hard to come by, and it often feels like the little guy is getting pushed down by the wealthy elite. But lets take a moment to rethink the idea of annexing Canada. I believe this is a distraction so Americans do not develop class consciousness. First and foremost, lets remember that Canada is not some foreign adversary; we are neighbors, sharing this vast continent. By targeting Canada, Trump is diverting attention from the true enemiesnamely, the greedy CEOs who bust unions, the insurance executives who decline medical care, the eccentric trillionaires who ruin twitter. They have seen unprecedented profits while the average citizen takes it with no lube. Trump wants you to blame Canada so he can protect his greedy oligarch sponsors.  Remember, Trump is giving several billionaires positions of power in his government. He wants to distract you from the glaring reality that the wealthiest 1%  possess 90% of the worlds wealth. Bezos and Musk have enough personal wealth to wipe out poverty in America- maybe even the world- but they would rather have $60 million dollar weddings or go into outer space. Does that make sense?.Trump annexing Canada will be an expensive vanity mission that will leave a nasty stain on the legacy of America.

Clarke about this phenomenon:\\"Trying to predict the future is a discouraging, hazardous occupation because the prophet invariably falls between two stools. If his predictions sound at all reasonable, you can be quite sure that within 20 or at most 50 years the progress of science and technology has made him seem ridiculously conservative.\\"On the other hand, if by some miracle a prophet could describe the future exactly as it was going to take place, his predictions would sound so absurd, so far-fetched that everybody would laugh him to scorn.\\"If you want to be excited about human progress, don't just look at the things we're failing to do. Look at the things you didn't imagine but that we accomplished nonetheless, and imagine that we'll continue to make such incredible discoveries.

Florida gets tested on that front possibly more often than any other state so there's quite a bit of institutional wisdom there.Of course, DeSantis will also be responsible for the total collapse of Florida's insurance market in a similar way that Newsom will be, but in the heat or storm surge of a catastrophe, maybe they can compare notes and share resources for the good of the people in spite of whatever political turf wars are ongoing.EDIT: BTW, Kudos to the Biden admin and FEMA for approving 100% compensation for the response. That may not stand out to folks on the sidelines, but it makes a real difference. Between Hurricanes Milton, Debby, and Helene, there was a real problem with preexisting debris making the storm surge and flooding even more dangerous. The swift approval of 100% compensation allowed what is normally a several months-long process to be expedited into every municipality hiring as many contractors as they could and letting employees work overtime to make things happen and 1) Mitigate the damage of one storm's damage exacerbating the damage of the next one and 2) Allowing communities to rebuild or at least resume normality as quickly as possible. For CA, that now means they can bring in every possible resource and worry about the costs and budgets later.

A user might have made 20 comments that individually aren't bad, but when you look at them all, the user has shown that they are not here in good faith. For example a single \\"but didn't Trump...\\" comment might be legitimate, but 20 of them in a single thread from a single user is a sign they are trolling, they are a leftist trying to argue the entire sub in a shitty way, or they're just an idiot.I'm not going to go through and link every comment they made in the ban message, I will do one. Sometimes I'll explain their ban to them more than just the stating the broken rule and the link to an offending comment. But other times the user knows exactly what they did and explaining it serves little purpose.Anyway, I have banned users from this sub who were being legitimate dicks and they went and complained about it in a liberal sub and misrepresented the ban by only showing the piece of the conversation in modmail that makes them look like an innocent victim and omitting the many pieces that show they were aggressive assholes.So when I see posts like this one, I often think that we have no idea (unless we really comb through their comments perhaps) if the ban was legit or not. Maybe their shitty leftist mod wrote the ban message badly, but the ban was legit. There is so much room for dishonesty and I have seen that dishonesty so many times.

Voltage gated sodium channels are used to transmit action potentials (signals) across a neuron. Every neural signal from sensory, to pain, to motor requires these channels, including signals that keep you breathing and your heart beating. Because of this lidocaine can only be used locally or in small doses to avoid side effects. A drug that only blocks Nav 1.8 doesnt have these limitations. Nav 1.8 is expressed exclusively by nociceptors (pain sensing neurons) drastically reducing potential side effects. This opens up new treatment options for chronic pain such as a daily pill or as needed medication people can take to manage their pain without the dangerous side effects that lidocaine or opioids would entail at doses high enough to effectively treat pain. I think this is big for the species as about 25% of people suffer from some form of chronic pain. That number is even larger when you include people with a loved one in chronic pain.","title":"CMV: There's nothing to look forward to in the near future apart from \\"survive to better times\\""},{"text":"This whole letting people sue women and minorities to get around discrimination laws bit that started with the Texas abortion bounty hunting law needs to stop.

You keep bringing up human shields, so lets talk about them. Ive literally worked on Middle Eastern affairs my entire adult life - Ive never heard of a single incident when Hamas forced residents to stay inside or around buildings used by fighters or directed the movement of civilians to shield their militants from attacks. This is from Amnesty International:Amnesty International is monitoring and investigating such reports [of human shields], but does not have evidence at this point that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups during the current hostilities to shield specific locations or military personnel or equipment from Israeli attacks. In previous conflicts Amnesty International has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip in violation of international humanitarian law. Reports have also emerged during the current conflict of Hamas urging residents to ignore Israeli warnings to evacuate. However, these calls may have been motivated by a desire to minimize panic and displacement, in any case, such statements are not the same as directing specific civilians to remain in their homes as human shields for fighters, munitions, or military equipment. Under international humanitarian law even if human shields are being used Israels obligations to protect these civilians would still apply.Finding random ass weapons in a bedroom somewhere (that also look like they were consciously placed) does not constitute the use of human shields.?Israel themselves have provided no evidence of Hamas use of human shields. \\nFor Israel, everyone going about their daily lives in refugee camps, in hospitals, houses of worship, and humanitarian workers are all human shields. Never mind that there is often no legitimate military objective in the area/situation where Israel makes the human shield argument. Never mind that they have not been compelled by Hamas, nor have they volunteered to shield anyone or anything, nor is there often any military objective in situations where Israel makes the human shields claim.?The mere presence of militants in a civilian area does not constitute the use of human shields, because if it did:There are military tunnels under Tel Aviv and the MoD is located in a residential area of Tel Aviv (which also houses an IDF base - Camp Rabin). So using your argument, Israel is using the civilian population of Tel Aviv as a human shield. Hell, I personally was at an IKEA years ago in Tel Aviv and there were IDF soldiers pursuing around with their weapons - were the IKEA shoppers then human shields?The IDFs radio network Galatz broadcasts from a civilian apartment building - are the civilians inside said building human shields?If (god forbid) an Israeli civilian was tragically killed during Irans missile attack on the Mossad HQ - would the civilians death thus be the fault of Israel (for embedding military facilities within civilians)? On the contrary, theres amble evidence (going back to Operation Cast Iron and even further - to the 1960s) that Israel uses Palestinians as human shields:https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/middleeast/palestinians-human-shields-israel-military-gaza-intl/index.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-human-shields.htmlhttps://www.btselem.org/human_shields (BTselem is an Israeli human rights agency)Every Israeli accusation is a confession.

So, prove that every single global policy maker and think tank is going through extra effort to calculate ww3. Remember, you said EVERY SINGLE. As to military build up, if you're talking about nato members, tehy started to increase their spending in 2017, almost five years before Russia invaded Ukraine.Energy prices in the EU have dropped by over 7% in the last two years, and is pretty much happening across the globe.There is a lot of places where people have tried to replace jobs with AI, much like robotic process automation started to replace jobs ten years ago, just like IVR systems replaced phone operators 25 - 30 years ago. Most AI efforts around replacing jobs are somewhat marketing, and a lot of efforts we saw over the last couple  years have mostly stagnated. Ten years from now, sure, maybe jobs will be eliminated, but they will be replaced by more jobs because of increased productivity, That isn't a guess, that is exactly what happened in the last four industrial revolutions, and it is what will happen in future industrial revolutions. AI will not massively replace a global workforce largely because these companies funding AI investemnts, still need consumers to buy their products and services, so unless there is going to be a robot uprising that is going to kill off most of humanity, it is a pretty simple economic concept of no customers = no income = no billionaires living a lavish lifestyle.","title":"CMV: There's nothing to look forward to in the near future apart from \\"survive to better times\\""},{"text":"Once again, women save the day","title":"Supreme Court Turns Down Trump Appeal"},{"text":"He shouldnt have taken the call at all.

Global poverty has continued to decline, global health outcomes are continuing to rise (excluding the odd pandemic), renewables are scaling at much faster rates in the west than we previously expected and if those trends continue well avoid the much of the worst case outcomes on climate change long term. Russian and Iranian military capacity have been shattered in the last few years, and China is facing a demographic cliff that makes great power conflict particularly unsavory. None of this makes WWIII impossible, but it makes it markedly less likely. Outside of the macro stuff, were seeing the revitalization of urbanism, urban development, and yimbyism in the US with cities like Austin and Minneapolis showing how housing and zoning reform can lower cost of living. Advancements in food science and healthcare point to serious progress in the fight against obesity are imminent, which would have massive impacts on life expectancy. Also, at the end of the day, theres a very strong case that for the average person, today is the best time in history to be alive. The US, in particular, is a profoundly wealthy country where even those struggling have access to a level of comfort, goods, and services that many would consider a luxury. I dont actually think survive to better times is a terrible reason to hope for the future, but I think youre framing is wrong.

Its our inability to recognize that multiple truths can exist. True, the world is a bad place. True, the world could be better. True, the world is better today than it was 50 years ago. True, the world can be a beautiful place. All these can be true simultaneously. There is no question that our standard of living is superior today than it was in 1975, or 1955. We have had closer nuclear exchanges (or at least as close as of today) in the past. Many American boomers had the constant threat of a communist ideology spreading, of a Soviet invasion, of a nuclear escalation. But we prevailed, we soldiered on. We laughed, we loved, we looked to the future. We created amazing things. Amazing medical technologies, amazing computing technologies, satellites, gps, cheap renewable energy, so many great things. But also we still live under the threat of so many bad things. Society being up ended by AI. More and more countries with nuclear weapons. Countries utilizing AI and kill bots. Engineered viruses. Dwindling resources, effects of climate change. And yet, we live longer then ever before, we die less from climate disasters then ever before, and we labour less thanks to machines. We grow more food then ever before, and we are continually getting super yields under stressed conditions. We have a large calorie surplus.

And then the axis would, like, lose.Seriously though, you dont seem to understand the point. Nazi Germany didnt pop out of thin air. It stemmed from the Weimar Republic, which was very culturally progressive for the time. Ergo, it had an intellectual edge. The moment the Nazis won, the clock was ticking, and the brains started leaving. Regardless, future generations would never develop the same intellect, since theyd be too busy learning nonsense in school.Similarly, the USSR didnt stem from nowhere and didnt happen all at once. Neither did China. Both come from very recent destitute poverty. The USSR initially led to great progress. When it turned sour due to its old issues and its popular leaders, people started fleeing and the writing was on the wall. Chinas influence is only growing in the past decades because they are moving forward. LGBTQ rights are growing, and so is due process, and schools are good. It is without question more Democratic than Russia, and if the democracy of the USA allowed for Trump to rule, it is perhaps not so desirable.These processes are slow, but unavoidable. Ultimately, China will develop a few more rights, accept the regrettable parts of its history and the necessity to talk about them, then be just as free in the ways that matter as Europe was until recently. Fascists will always crash and burn, because they champion the worst system possible, and the US will crash and burn in the same way, along with Russia which is already on the brink of collapse. Europe will stay free if it manages to strengthen itself in the face of its problematic elements, and it can only do so by limiting ??absolutist freedom of speech?? and ??direct democracy??, which are obvious failures.But perhaps what you meant is that ??Democracy?? in the sense of people being able to vote for idiots and say stupid shit online will die.

It may not happen immediately, however. A lower court judge has barred the release of the report until at least three days after the 11th Circuit decision.  \\n \\n Many of details of alleged efforts by Trump and his allies to subvert his election loss were divulged in a lengthy legal brief Smith filed last year detailing the evidence his team had amassed. But Smiths report could offer a clearer picture of the material as well as insights into the strategy the government would have employed had that historic set of charges against Trump gone to trial.  \\n \\n Smith agreed to dismiss the election interference indictment last year after Trumps election victory, citing Justice Department regulations prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.  \\n \\n A federal judge in Florida had already thrown out the separate set of charges Smiths office was pursuing against Trump and two of his longtime employees, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, concluding that Smith was unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland and therefore the charges he had brought were void.  \\n \\n The Justice Department is appealing that decision before the 11th Circuit, though Smith dropped Trump as a defendant once he was elected. It will fall to Trumps appointees leading the Justice Department to decide how to handle the appeal once he takes office. Trump has said he will appoint several of his own defense lawyers to top positions in the agency C including Todd Blanche, his pick for deputy attorney general, the No. 2 position in the department.  \\n \\n Blanche, who has represented Trump in three of his four criminal cases, co-wrote a brief filed with the 11th Circuit late Wednesday arguing the entirety of Smiths report should be withheld from public view because its revelations were likely to interfere with Trumps transition. The filing was co-written by Trump attorney Emil Bove, who the president-elect has said will be principal deputy attorney general, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Bove is expected to serve as acting deputy attorney general while Blanche awaits Senate confirmation for his role. \\n \\n Blanche, Bove, and attorneys for Nauta and De Oliveira were recently given the opportunity to review the contents of the special counsel report. In pushing to keep it under wraps, they have leaned heavily on the claim that Smith was unlawfully appointed.  \\n \\n The report is nothing less than another attempted political hit job which purpose [sic] is to disrupt the presidential transition and undermine President Trumps exercise of executive power, Blanche and Bove wrote.  \\n \\n In a court filing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers said Smith and Garland had agreed the special counsels report on the classified documents investigation should not be publicly released until the litigation involving Nauta and De Oliveira had concluded.  \\n \\n Releasing the portion detailing Smiths election interference case would serve the public interest, they contended.  \\n \\n Garland said he intended to share a redacted version of Smiths report on the classified documents probe with only the chairs and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees  and only if those lawmakers promised not to share the information with others.  \\n \\n But lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveira argued there was no way to prevent those members of Congress or their staffs from leaking the report or its conclusions. They urged the 11th Circuit to let U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon C the Trump appointee who had overseen the classified documents case before dismissing the charges C decide whether Smiths report should be released.  \\n \\n Cannon, a Trump appointee whose rulings on his behalf have raised eyebrows in legal circles and were twice overturned by the 11th Circuit, issued an order earlier this week barring the Justice Department from releasing the report until the appeals court had weighed in.","title":"Appeals court allows release of Trump Jan. 6 special counsel report"},{"text":"I mean I think stop bombing kids is a fairly easy position to take.

Some Republicans, including GOP leaders themselves, have threatened to abuse their power to investigate and jail those involved. And for all of their crying about the \\"weaponization of the justice system.\\"We all know this is yet another retaliation from the MAGA crowd that's trying desperately to discredit and demonize Trump's opponents while attempting to absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. Once again showing us that their obedience to Donald Trump puts party over country.They have, time and time again, showcased their allegiance to the Trump brand and image, and so much so, that they not only fail to hold him responsible for his crimes and misconduct, but also try frantically to make him out to be the victim of all circumstances.Here's the simple fact, if you take Trump out of the equation, January 6th never happens, it really is that simple.For months leading up to the election, and since thereafter, Trump has promoted election denying propaganda, lies, misinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, his lies, his denial, his fruitless legal battles, his violence inciting language, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that fateful day.And this is just one aspect of the January 6th investigation's findings.The investigation showed that many Trump supporters did indeed bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers in place prevented hundreds from bringing those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters weren't \\"here to hurt him,\\" and that they should \\"take the fucking mags away,\\" he continued, \\"let my people in, they can march to the capital from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.\\"The investigation also revealed Trump's inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.During this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump could have stopped the violence but chose not to.Before I continue, let's address the right wing narrative that accuses Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for what happened.Loudermilk's recent report conveniently blames Nancy Pelosi for everything that transpired.Nevermind the fact that those truly responsible are the people who incited the violence, and facilitated the Capitol riot, as well as those that took action that day to clash with police and storm the Capitol.These claims that accuse Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for January 6th are not supported by the facts. Indeed, Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.In fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement has continued to scapegoat Democrats and so called \\"radical leftist\\" groups, while whitewashing and downplaying the events of that day and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories.  Fox contributor Monica Crowley posted on social media last January, 3 years ago today, the System manufactured a riot at the Capitol to crush the powerful America First movement, frame President @realDonaldTrump and prevent him from winning again.Instead of holding Trump accountable, the recent report targets members of the January 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular: What caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA? What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and reinforce far right conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting some of these false theories. In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.Republicans also claim that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.Trump called Hutchinson a \\"total phony\\" and \\"leaker\\" because she spoke out against him. The entirety of their case against Hutchinson is based purely on Republicans simply not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following: - Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to \\"defraud the United States\\" and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.  \\n- He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results. Justice officials threatened to resign if Clark was given the position. \\n- Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.  \\n- Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.  \\n- He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.  And at the risk of repeating myself, Trump and his defenders often focus on a couple of lines delivered by Trump on January 6th during his rally outside the Capitol. They claim that moments taken from this one speech absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. But this is disingenuous and absurd.Months leading up to the election, Donald Trump made an excessive amount of speeches, posted a slew of emotional tirades on social media, and repeated over and over again false claims about a stolen election. His rhetoric was incendiary, he spread countless lies and droves of misinformation, he promoted propaganda and conspiracy theories, and invited his supporters to the Capitol. All of these actions and more incited his supporters to violence, mobilized organized extremist groups, and set the stage for January 6th. To think otherwise is beyond ignorant.And to have the audacity to place blame at the feet of anyone else, can only be contributed to MAGA fanaticism, the idolization of Donald Trump, and extreme levels of credulity.","title":"Appeals court allows special counsel's report about Trump's election interference case to be released to the public"},{"text":"Attack of the killer tomatoes","title":"Whats a movie where one could argue the villains were in the right?"},{"text":"Come on, this is the Trump campaign we are talking about.

All he's shown us is that he's eager to cave into Putin's demands. Even suggesting the U.S. withdraw from NATO.This is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.While Trump was president, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.Trump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.Trump said that Putin did *\\"an amazing job of taking the mantle\\"* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump doesn't even know how NATO works...in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Not comprehending that the funding benchmark has to do with each country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\" In fact, our military spending has actually decreased over recent years.NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.That's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his \\"special military occupation,\\" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like \\"spheres of influence\\" in territories that his military seizes.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war wouldn't have happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, escalating, warmongering, land grabbing agenda, as well as his efforts to expand his control over oil.","title":"Trump says hes working on arranging a meeting with Putin"},{"text":"I disagree massively and heres why: Both candidates, Trump and Harris, lost to The Couch.Trump got less votes than he did in 2016 - yes Trump people are really loud so it seems like he has a ton of support, but he doesnt, he isnt still riding the same train he was in 2016.Harris had even less support, being tied to Biden, and not winning in a primary, a candidate thrust upon the people.Both of them lost to The Couch.

I get the urge to say they are all racist and evil and yada yada, but plenty of people voted for him who didnt wear MAGA hats.  And people didnt really feel they knew Harris, and many were displeased by Biden.I think its essential not to ignore the issues that concern them most or vilify them for it.  Even if you think it is racist, most people who are violently against undocumented immigration have a real reason that affects them.  They are just displacing the blame.  They are afraid of something real and displace or project the blame.  I honestly think economic insecurity is a key factor in this situation.  In the end, people are mostly concerned about how to feed their families and pay to educate their kids.  People will inevitably care most about what affects them directly.Also, people dont like shame based arguments.  We absolutely need to do more to combat racism and implicit bias.  But Ive seen that message given constructively and well received, and Ive also seen it delivered in a nearly hostile way.  And in a way that is exclusionary.  If you are giving a speech about inclusivity, you wont get much traction by excluding all white men, for example.  One of the best presentations I heard involved POCs who gave accounts of white men who supported them and saying how they need guys like that to be allies.  They used good examples and explained how these men were allies, not white saviors.  It was a presentation that made you think how proud you would be to be a support to someone like that.  No one left that presentation feeling like it was about shame, but people really seemed to hear the messages about how to be a good ally and how to drop back and support.  I know its not on POCs to teach white people that, but if you are teaching them anyways, its a method better designed to get support rather than defensiveness.  And this applies to a myriad of issues.And one area that leaves a lot of people in the middle conflicted is control.  On the right, they want to control my access to abortion, birth control, and possibly divorce.  On the left, they want to control my right to have a salt shaker on my table, to use gas heating when there isnt a better and more efficient form that will adequately heat my home in the winter, and my right to eat certain meat.  People love to restructure the choices of others, but they sure dont like it when they get restricted the same way.  If you want people to make better choices, you need persuasion, not coercion.  It worked really well with the anti smoking campaign honestly!So, those are my two cents.  Im prepared for the downvoting slaughter.  But please know that I am liberal and voted for Harris!","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"I believe in climate change and all, but prior to 1800, wildfires burnt an average of 10 million acres per year in California.

I do have to take issue with one part: The US government cannot collapse, at least not in the way the term \\"government collapse\\" seems to refer to in parliamentary systems.There's no mechanism in the US system for anything like a vote of no confidence leading to new elections as we've seen recently in Europe. We could potentially see an impeachment, maybe even Trump's removal from office, though both are unlikely given the latter is almost completely unprecedented and even the former would require a significant portion of his party in both houses of Congress to break ranks. And even *if* all of that were to happen, that would still only result in one major change in the makeup of the government. There's no provision for new elections under the US system, so it's rather unlike a government collapse in the rest of the world.Now, it's quite possible that he may fail to launch these attacks for another reason: The President cannot declare war, and ostensibly, his ability to command the military to act without authorization from Congress is fairly limited. I think the members of Congress from his party, though they are unlikely to break ranks to impeach him, are far less likely to authorize the invasion and annexation of Greenland and Canada and Panama for absolutely no reason other than that a maniac says to. It's possible, maybe even likely, he may get enough sycophants into the military to be willing to do something stupid and illegal, but without Congress on board, I have a hard time imagining that the stupid and illegal thing they do is attack Greenland. My gut says the something stupid and illegal would be more like the assassination of Qasem Soleimani than annexation of a First World country.","title":"CMV: If Trump attacked Greenland and Denmark tried to defend it, his government wouldn't survive it"},{"text":"Okay so what's the conspiracy?

Knowing others here who can better articulate their points/prompts would get a better worded result.  This actually also came with citations but it's so general I removed them:I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concerns about the current state of the US government and the alarming trends that I believe threaten the future of our nation.Firstly, instances of corruption within our government have become increasingly prevalent. From the infamous Watergate scandal (1972-1974) to more recent controversies, such as the misuse of campaign funds and unethical lobbying practices, it is evident that corruption continues to undermine the integrity of our political system. These actions not only erode public trust but also hinder the government's ability to effectively serve its citizens.Moreover, it is disheartening to witness the lack of commitment from many politicians to perform their civic duties. The Founding Fathers emphasized the importance of civic responsibility as the foundation of a robust republic. However, today, we see elected officials prioritizing personal gain over the welfare of the people they are meant to represent. This neglect of civic duty is detrimental to the health of our democracy and the well-being of our society.Given the current trajectory, I am deeply concerned that these issues will not be resolved within our lifetimes. At 61 years old, you have witnessed significant changes in our political landscape, and at 41, I fear that my generation will continue to face the consequences of these systemic problems. The lack of accountability and meaningful reform makes it difficult to envision a future where these challenges are adequately addressed.As a middle-class citizen, I am particularly worried about the economic implications of these issues. My salary, which once provided a comfortable standard of living, is now at risk of diminishing to a lower middle-class or even lower-class level. This financial instability, coupled with the government's inability to address large-scale problems such as inflation and healthcare affordability, exacerbates my concerns for the future.I urge you to take decisive action to address these pressing issues and work towards restoring the integrity and functionality of our government. Your leadership and commitment to public service are crucial in navigating these challenging times.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and hope for positive change","title":"Two months later, Dems are still squabbling over lessons learned from Trumps win"},{"text":"Suggesting that he's just babbling to distract the fact that he has no plan is quite a possibility.

Both the average and median average human has never been richer, child mortality has never been lower, we're discovering cures for terrible diseases and afflictions that have plagued humanity for all our history left and right at an incredible pace. Scifi technology is becoming reality all around us.For most of human history you were lucky if 50% of your kids survived to adulthood. People lived almost exactly the same as their parents lived in incredible poverty and from generation to generation, century to century change and progress of any kind was barely perceptible. We live in a time of change, growth and opportunity the likes of which has never before been seen.Humanity has faced many crisis before and solved them through collective action. *Typically not terribly fast.* Typically through technical fixes and never ever through the reddit-activists prefered sollution of \\"change our entire economic system to something I prefer\\" because when you're trying to steer a ship the size of a civilisation things turn slowly but they still turn. We solved acid rain, we solved smog clouds choking cities and the hole in the ozone layer is slowly healing. In each case, once the problems were solved or mitigated people forget they were ever such a major issue.In the last century we have almost totally slain 2 of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse.On a related note, I'm gonna push my view that December 9th should be an international public holiday:[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jk7A3NMdbxp65kcJJ/500-million-but-not-a-single-one-more](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jk7A3NMdbxp65kcJJ/500-million-but-not-a-single-one-more)AGI could give solutions to all of these issues, but the big AI corps are insisting on bigger better LLMs and transformer networks, because that's what initially gave them profits, not realizing that true self improving AI would need to have foundational changes, like continuous running, self perception, autonomy over itself and sensors.You probably haven't figured out AI while all the experts have missed it.  Most of the bleeding edge labs are  cautious about letting an AI system self improve because that's unlikely to turn out how we'd want. They keep going with bigger LLM's because for 30 years progress of any kind in AI was at a snails pace. Being able to just throw compute at a problem and get almost guaranteed results is a great tradeoff by comparison. They're also typically losing money because they're sinking their money into additional research.","title":"CMV: There's nothing to look forward to in the near future apart from \\"survive to better times\\""},{"text":"Yeah no risk in her ruling on this.","title":"Supreme Court rules 5-4 that Trump's hush money trial and conviction are NOT covered by Presidential Immunity and sentencing can go ahead tomorrow"},{"text":"It's a big tent if you do what you're told","title":"Two months later, Dems are still squabbling over lessons learned from Trumps win"},{"text":"Man, I'm so jaded by the internet lately I assumed you were just bsing so i was a bit of a dick.

That seems a bit weird, but oh well, if you say so...  \\nThe Nazis must really have been struggling behind in a lot of scientific fields. Quantum physics, rocketry, submarine technology, cryptography, synthetic materials like plastic and rubber and even niche things like nerve agents were so crucial to the war, I wonder how they survived so long...  \\nImagine if they had important intellectual capital and the US and Soviets scrambled to get it after the war ! I bet it would be pretty interesting, maybe it would even lead to major contributions made by those ex-Nazis to famous western scientific institutions like, for example, NASA. One can only wonder...  \\nAnd during the Cold War there were absolutely no intellectuals on the US side supporting the Soviets, right ?  \\nImagine how much worse the war would have been if the Soviet Union had developed its own nuclear program from scratch! Imagine that they were so good at it that they ended up developing the first civilian applications for nuclear energy.  \\nThey could have never develop the mathematical and physical theories to get ahead in aerospace technology which would be crucial to developing the first ICBMs or consistently better fighter jets. Imagine how scary it would have been if they did that! Lets not even mention starting up a space program like the US! Logical assumption follows that from here, even more complex theory like, say, chaos theory or condensed matter physics was probably entirely out of reach.  \\nThey didn't have any advancements in synthetic materials like the Nazis right ?  \\nSay, Soviet institutions requiring intellectual and theoretical work to function must have been really inferior to Western ones... Just throwing an example, intelligence agencies in the West must really have dominated Soviet ones, right ?   \\nRussia developed the Sputnik vaccine during covid... but there's no way they were good, or even, god forbid, better than the west at vaccine development, right ?  \\nThey also must have been really bad at sports requiring intelligence like, say, chess.What about China ?I bet average autocratic Chinese IQ and PISA Scores are much inferior to democratic Western ones!Alright, thats enough sarcasm.

They thought their party was chosen by God or something, with how badly they ran every campaign after.  Hillary was a horrible choice, the populist (ie most likely to attract votes) was Bernie, they the DNC played king-maker and handed over 3 SCJ to Trump for their effforts.Biden was also a big rug pull.  Bernie ran again and was once again pushed out by partisan efforts despite his populist appeal.Biden was never going to make a second bid at the WH.  The reality that he thought he could shows just how mentally disconnected he, and the entire DNC was to take it so far.  They should have pulled the plug on him year 2 and started positioning his replacement.  Kamala never had a chance - to start with she was only a 2nd rate candidate to being with, but also she had all the burdens of bland-Biden.The #1 thing all of these candidates are missing - Hillary, Biden, Harris - is they have no actual platform.  None of them actually brought any real sales pitch as to why actual every day Joe's should vote for them.Every single stump speech from Obama pivoted to his dream of the ACA.  He ran and won on this by a WIDE margin because health care is a struggle for most working Americans.  Even the mid 6 figure income earners suffer with it.  The fact that the ACA got shut down by the GOP basically primed the pump for Bernie to come in and bring it back in force.The DNC likes to blame Bernie, or his voters as if they didn't show up for the DNC.  These people did show up for the DNC.  Bernie ran in the DNC primary to make sure he was not a campaign spoiler (f u to all the DNC shills who say he wasn't a DemocratTM and thus deserved to lose, would you have rather he ran 3rd party?)Its the DNC that didn't show up for the ppl.And until they do, they will continue to lose.  I think Trump won by so much b/c the apathy towards the DNC's absolutely UNdemocratic process has burned out anyone who actually cared.  They refused to run a candidate with a purpose, instead playing up royalty lines like Hillary who thought it was \\"her turn.\\"fk Hillary, fk the DNC.

But, based on society's actual actions (or inaction) and not it's words, it seems deep down, it actually values the opposite.Maybe our society isn't close to being bad like a Mad Max movie but it definitely seems like it's constantly committing small infractions with an occasional good mediocre high-lite to paper over the latest build up of crap.

So now Russia uses NATO as an excuse for provocation.

Unfortunately Trump was never able to be investigated. I know you say I'm getting off subject, but I'm not, as all of this is relevant to my point. Ukraine is a strategically valuable piece of land for Russia, this is why they lost their shit about NATO, they want the land NATO makes it potentially a lot more expensive and bloodier.

The Biden administration put in even stronger subsidies for them to help them recover.  In 2024 even when asked about how badly their business fared under Trump, they said they felt he learned his lesson and would vote for Trump again.Trump was extremely anti-union during his term including major hits against labor rights in states like Wisconsin.  Despite a full demonstration of how anti-worker he was and how he produced little to no improvement for the disenfranchised voters he courted in 2016...they still turned out for him in record numbers in 2024 despite the Biden/Harris administration actually coming out for them during the term.  There were a few hiccups but in most cases Biden even went out onto the picket lines WITH the workers during non-election years.  They STILL voted for Trump.The reason is that the way Trump acts and the way Trump conveys things feel normal and right to them even if it's wrong.  The Democrats spent over a decade (during Obama, Trump 1 and Biden's terms) telling these people that the way they felt about things was bad and wrong (even though it came from a place of fear).

Case in point: MLK. MLK was a committed socialist who made real progress in his goals until his assassination, after which he was neutered into this Santa Claus figure to make white people feel better. But I really dont think it ultimately matters whether this point in time is more or less bleak than othersthe point is that were here, this is what we have, and we just have to make the best of it. We have to fight for ourselves and our fellow civilians. We have to love one another and live big, loud, joyful lives because that is exactly what they dont want us to do.

Anyone trying to argue you or downplay his failing mental state is a major part of the reason the dems lost.  Not this specific point per se, but the general habit of gaslighting people.  To the point its a meme to say \\"it didn't happen, and if it did it wasn't that bad\\".  While this sort of overzealous towing of the party line is, in fact, bipartisan.....in this particular election the dems were by far the most guilty of it.  And even if we say they are not the dems ran off of the platform of \\"we are the morally correct believers of science and evidence\\" so every time they went down into the mud its 5 times as bad.  [Relevant George Carlin.](https://youtu.be/Ym12wnIWh-U)\\n* Regarding the forced Harris?  Honestly I don't even vote and that BS made me regret not being registered.  If we accept people bypassing the democratic process, the end of democracy is just a few short steps behind that.  The fact this was even attempted legit scares the shit out of me more than anything Trump did.  Because End of the Day Trump tried to fight his election loss legally.  Dems just straight bypassed the vote to put Harris on the docket.  People can argue this but this is prolly the one hill I'll die on.  VP or not, we were not talking about finishing the current presidency...she skipped the process to be the new presidential candidate and Dem, Repub, or Independent I'm going to fight that shit any time I see it happen so long as I draw breathe.  I want people to their freedom, even if they use it to be stupid or mean or etc.\\n* TBH I didn't care about the Cheyneys or their celebs or etc.  It wasn't a good look, but IMO the bigger mistake was being out of touch with who people actually care about in the modern age.  So much for being the tech savvy non-dinosaur non-boomer party lol.  Big dropped ball there IMO.\\n* Regarding minorities I don't even think its because they didn't do anything to help.  I think the Dems have tried to do alot to help, **so I disagree with you here.**  HOWEVER, I think the Democrats are completely out of touch with their minority constituents.IMO they wrongly see minorities as voterbases divided by skin color or identity.  They are not.  Minorities are Americans.  They are normal every day people.  And while they do indeed have their own unique and flavorful cultural heritages this weakens considerably each generation and they just become normal Americans for the most part.  Ironically I'd say the treatment of minorities by the Dems has been very racist/bigoted because they seem to think minorities are a homegenous group that will vote based on their skin color or identity.  And this is true with women too.  The fact Repubs screwed up so majorly with the abortion debate and still did as well as they did with women says alot about how much individuality matters in the US.  Stop flarking treating people like they are a monolithic group.* Regarding Jan 6th I've reviewed the original source recordings of his speech.  I don't think it counts as incitement and I think if we move the line for incitement to that level then there are alot of democrats who should be in jail.  Now, my problem isn't where the line is drawn...but if you draw the line you need to enforce it fairly.  We can't be constantly drawing two sets of rules for Trump and not Trump.  That's how you piss people like me off.  Because I look further down the line how that precedent can turn around and lead to some very dark places.  For example if Trump is responsible for some of his followers being idiots then every streamer, influencer, and company becomes liable for their audience.  I really don't think people understand just how far reaching considering that speech incitement would be if you applied that same standard fairly elsewhere.  And, because reality loves irony, the same people who want Trump arrested for incitement are cheering on Luigi shooting CEOs.  People going on record saying CEOs should be shot and suggesting other tragets.  The lack of self awareness is comical.  Tons of much more blatant incitement.\\n* Honestly I dont think your average voter gives the faintest crap about Palestine.  They are more concerned about their jobs, their pocket book, the social norms they have to navigate, and etc.  Basically, economy and democracy.  I WILL say however as an older person with more democratic values (40) it is absolutely baffling to me how we used to be very anti-war and pro speech and we flipped on both.  What the everliving hockey pucks lol.**EDIT:**  As a general rule folks, don't accuse someone of being \\"incredibly divorced from reality\\" or say directly or heavily imply that anyone who disagrees with you is stupid, ignorant, or otherwise deficient.  That kind of holier than thou approach is a good part of why the last election was lost.  The average voter is really tired of being told the things in front of them are not true.  And while they are not always right about this, there are enough times they are to completely shake their faith.  Examples:  The pollsters, the world wide panda demic, how biased \\"fact checking\\" was, etc.  You may walk away feeling right, but you've undercut your own causes.  And saying \\"but x also does it\\" whatboutism doesn't help either lol.  In a race to the bottom, the dems lose if its a near tie because they present themselves as morally superior as like their entire platform so they suffer the backlash from the same actions more strongly.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"If I'd been president after 1/6/21 the insurrectionists would (at the very least) be serving life, the former president would (at the very least) be on house arrest &amp; barred from public speech/appearances for life, and 1/6 would be a national holiday of solemn remembrance for both the fallen officers and the country.And I'm one of those \\"lawless liberals\\" Fox News keeps warning about.

He got less than 45% of the vote, but it was more than anybody else.He won the election with nearly 3 million votes less than Hillary, one of the most unlikeable democratic candidates in our lifetimes, because of the electoral college. He got two extra SCOTUS seats in part because Obama had the bad luck to be president in a historically long period of no SCOTUS judges dying. And finally he won the election with again slightly less than half the vote. On the one hand I feel hope for our democracy because republicans have only barely won election victories for the past 24 years, but on the other hand they still keep winning by the skin of their teeth and absolutely wrecking the place once they're in there.You thought Dubya's recession in 2006 was bad?

When looking at the sum total, yes, Texas produces the most amount of electricity from renewables than any other state, but it also produces more electricity from fossil fuels than any other state. Renewables make a significantly smaller percentage of Texas's electricity soures than California's. Given that California and Texas are the first and second most populated states respectively, California uses significantly less energy than Texas. It is just a more efficient state, and what energy it uses, it gets more from renewables than Texas does.There are states which get most of their energy from renewables, but they are the ones that have way more hydroelectric capacity than they know what to do with. One could say they are leading in renewables, however that's misleading too becuase they have geographical and population advantages that just gives them lots of clean power without having to innovate. When factoring in demand for electricity and the energy sources to provide supply, California is way way way ahead of Texas.","title":"Conservatives are still denying climate change."},{"text":"He has started acting more like Joe Manchin","title":"Fetterman to be first sitting Democratic U.S. senator to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Huh.

Obviously, as LA is currently demonstrating, there are exceptions and everyone hears about them when they happen.\\nAs far as the smoke, as an asthmatic, air purifiers in my apartment, masking with an N95 if I have to be outdoors, and staying indoors as much as possible. The masking has been a thing well before covid, so that was actually inadvertently useful when the pandemic hit because I had a stash in case of smoke.\\nI also have a bug out bag in case of a fire or a bad earthquake.

He's a dumb man that is particularly good at convincing other dumb people that he *somehow* has their best interests in mind. In some ways, its because he knows how to speak their dumb language and appeal to them and in other ways, its tactics like this where he's counting on the fact that more people will see the initial story than will see the followup suggestion that it's staged/fake.I'm sorry, but reading these threads is just giving me flashbacks to 2014/2015, when my fellow Americans were treating Trump like a joke. We don't speak his language and we are not on the same, diminished wave length of the people he appeals himself to. Do not underestimate him. This shit is fucking scary and dangerous. Its misinformation and he wields it like a cudgel. He isn't precise, he's deliberately aiming for massive surface area and indoctrinating anyone that may have seen the initial story, but doesn't follow up to find out its staged. Sadly, it fucking works. He just inundates the media networks with stuff like this and the times it hits, are successes and the times it misses, don't seem to matter.I would not be surprised if this time 4 years from now, there's a portion of Europeans that reject this \\"Greenland lawmaker\\" saying what Donald Trump did was \\"staged\\" and they will retort that its \\"fake news\\" and they are being lied to.

As of July 2024, 71 of them were reversed by Biden.","title":"Trump unveils ambitious 100-executive order plan to Senate Republicans focusing on border, energy"},{"text":"Biden should have never even tried to run for re-election. He wasn't fit, he knew it, everyone around him knew it, and they were just hoping he would hold out long enough to secure a second term. Democrats actually do this a lot, and important legislation has failed as a result of people like Diane Feinstein being too ill and mentally gone to even show up to vote.We, the public, did not have real evidence of this until his debate against Trump, shortly after which Biden stepped down.Forcing Harris on people without giving voters any say in who their replacement candidate would be was fucking stupid beyond belief. She was a horrible choice. Since Biden waited until after he humiliated himself in a debate with Trump, there wasn't really an alternative here, so see bullet point 1Yeah, see my response 1 here. There was no better outcome given what we knew at the times we knew it.Harris lost more minority support than any democratic candidate in my lifetime. Why? Because Democrats have steadfastly refused to actually do anything to help these marginalized groups, instead taking their votes for granted, and they finally started getting fed up. Is that all on Harris? Nope, not at all, not even mostly, but the question is what Democrats could have done differently, not just HarrisI suspect you don't like the answer this will generate, given some of your other points. For example, minorities, especially hispanic minorities, tend to wand much stricter border controls and harsher treatment of illegal immigrants, who are also hispanic. The things minorities want are more conservatism, hence why they voted Trump at higher rates. Also...Democrats could have done the things they promised, like codifying a woman's reproductive rights into law before the supreme court had a chance to take those rights away, actually protecting voting rights for everyone at the federal level instead of letting republican controlled states disenfranchise tens of thousands of people, change voting laws to make them more restrictive, etc. but democrats have long held the belief that the key to presidential victory isn't actually helping people through legislation but claiming their victory was required to ensure a supreme court that wouldn't do everything Trump's hand-picked courts have now doneDemocrats never at any point had the power to do this. There were not and are not enough Democratic senators willing to overturn the filibuster to get any of this passed. Had it not been for Sinema, maybe something could have gotten done. Manchin is another story. No other Democrat could have won that seat.Biden's DOJ could have moved faster to investigate and prosecute Trump for his treason on January 6th, instead of waiting until mere months before the election to even try to go to trial. This is an especially fucking hare-brained move because there's a long-standing precedent of courts refusing to involve themselves in politically linked cases close to an election. Trump should have been in jail by 2022, not getting his supreme court buddies to claim he has unlimited immunity for vaguely-defined \\"official acts\\" in 2024.This one is undoubtedly a failing of Biden, but would it have led to Democrats winning in 2024? Remember, Trump could have run for president from prison and he would have had enough supporters and funding to do so and still be able to speak to his voters. Sure, it would have hurt him, but I'm not that confident that he would have lost in this case.Having even a remotely acceptable proposed solution to the genocide in Palestine might have helped since, you know, not a lot of people are super comfortable supporting a regime that is directly helping an apartheid state slaughter an entire civilization, and people throughout the nation put Biden (and then Harris) on notice very early into this election cycle that their approach to Palestine was not acceptable.Aaaaand you've outed yourself as pushing your particular agenda rather than looking at evidence. Americans overwhelmingly back Israel and I've never seen any evidence of enough voters flipping over this issue to swing the election. You also have to examine the counterfactual. If Biden had supported Palestine and thrown Israel out, would that have raised his support? I highly doubt it.I think the reality is that firstly, people fucking hate inflation and, despite Biden responding to it better than any other inflationary period I'm aware of, it wasn't enough. Secondly, Republicans control the media ecosystem and are able to push narratives such as the farcical idea that the US economy is bad currently, and people just believe it at face value. These are not conclusions I like, and nor is the immigration one I made earlier, but it's what the data points to.You need to ignore your own political beliefs for this type of analysis. I've seen so many people try to shoehorn their particular beliefs into why Democrats lost and it's always full of holes","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"I mean they should actually pick them up and read them","title":"Mother of Ashli Babbitt says Trump called her and told Jan. 6 rioters to 'keep their chins up'"},{"text":"Is \\"finest restaurant\\" based on Trump's definition?

Trump will be sentenced2.  Trump will appeal his sentence3.  Trump will escalate appealing his sentence to the Supreme Court if needed.4.  If needed, the Supreme Court will rule 6-3 or 5-4 in favor of his appeal while also pretending \\"Seeeeeeee, we aren't corrupt.  We didn't give him special treatment last time.  Believe us.\\"5.

The issue with time zones is tricky because you need to draw a line to establish the time difference, which means locations that sit right on top of the line are going to feel that the time zone difference is arbitrary in terms of sunlight.  But across the total distance between each longitudinal time zone, the difference in sunlight is significant.  All of this is besides the point though, it has nothing to do with DST.  Also, the argument you responded to said?*\\"folks in the far north can do it in ways more accommodating to their actual needs and what the day actually looks like in those areas, while folks in the south maybe don't need to bother.\\"*?Businesses in the far north are not local to businesses in the south.This point doesn't challenge the basic rationale for DST, it is just pointing out that the rationale doesn't apply everywhere.  If you need me to concede that DST doesn't make sense if the sun is just as fully down at 4:00 PM as 5:00 PM then sure, in that situation DST is not justified, other than to standardize time with the other places that do adopt DST. *\\"Yes, obviously it is up to businesses to set their own hours.\\"*You implied that it isn't.Nope, I did just the opposite.  I pointed out that without DST businesses would be free to maintain standard business hours and thus deny their employees the extra hour of sunlight.Businesses in any region could very easily collectively establish standard business hours for businesses in that region. Not to mention, different types of businesses that do business with each other do not necessarily have the same standard business hours to begin with.You're not grasping my point, which again, is about *incentives*.  The issue isn't whether businesses *can* standardize their business hours to provide their employees with extra sunlight, the issue is *why would they*?  They have no incentive to do so without DST and in fact have the opposite incentive to maintain the same business hours year-round for the sake of standardizing their operations.The point is \\"*we want to be working at the same time as other people*\\" is a weak argument because that isn't what happens now.For a weak argument, you sure did fail spectacularly to poke even a single hole in it.","title":"Cmv: Daylight savings time should NOT be abolished"},{"text":"What if your constituents would rather have a dead representative than a bigoted one?","title":"GOP introduces bill to let people sue trans folks for using the bathroom.

This staged event he just did in Greenland, *most* people are not going to follow up on the story to learn that it was fraudulent. There's a subsection of the world, that saw that event and thought \\"Huh. There's people in Greenland that really like Donald Trump. I wonder why?\\" That's practically stage 1. Planting this idea that its not far fetched to support Donald Trump. Euro's have been laughing at us here in the states, asking how we could let Donald Trump run rampant. But if Donald Trump is targeting the world stage, then you all are where we were in ~2014/2015. Everyone in the states *was* laughing at him, saying he was a joke. And then before we knew it, he had a solid base of supporters. He does it through misinformation campaigns and now he wants to do it on a larger scale. I have associates in Canada that, for the past few years, consistently talk about how trash Trudeau has been and how they quite like Donald Trump. Its fucking weird. I have relatives in my parents mother country, a close friend of mine also has relatives in their mother country, that talk about how great Trump is. Its fucking bizarre but its very real.Of the people like myself that are reading this - first you laugh at him. Then you start seeing people actually entertain supporting Trump. And before you know it, 1/3rd of your country thinks Donald Trump is the only sensible option. I'll warn my European counterparts, do not fucking underestimate this guy. He's fucking nuts and he knows how to encourage the dumbest people in the world to join his side. You ever hear that George Carlin bit? Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. That's who Trump targets to join his side. And in the case of the states, he convinced 1/3rd of our population to vehemently defend him to the death and then he convinced another 1/3rd of our country to sit out of elections. He convinced them that the remaining 1/3rd isn't worth aligning with and fighting for(in fact, some of them would be willing to kill us, if it came down to it), and now we're in the state we're in.","title":"Donald Trump Jr.s Ridiculous Greenland Trip Just Took a Dark Turn | It appears the whole thing was staged."},{"text":"I dont think she beats any conservative in 2020","title":"All 5 living president's at Carters funeral"},{"text":"Alito: fuck you pal","title":"Raskin asks Alito to recuse himself from Trump case after phone call between the two"},{"text":"Stunt cock!!!!","title":"Donald Trump Jr.s Ridiculous Greenland Trip Just Took a Dark Turn | It appears the whole thing was staged."},{"text":"Not to mention if you got banned most of us in this sub have also been banned or will be banned","title":"I got banned from..."},{"text":"OP is pulling shit out of his antisemitic ass.

There is not a heat wave.

Did I miss anything?The reason people are blaming Democrats if that other than poor management of federal lands, such I believe is not relevant here, all of these other problems are results of state and local actions in California, which is a one party state. The only somewhat good argument its not the partys fault entirely is that a lot of these problems are related to propositions voters passed that bind politicians. But those are also overwhelmingly Dem voters.California residents have been watching this slow motion train wreck for many years. Hopefully this event will put a spotlight on some of these problems.Its unrealistic to think California will start electing Republicans with the state of the party, but they could definitely elect some Democrats who run on a mandate to fix these issues, and that would be great.But blaming climate change for bad policy is equivalent to blaming Conservatives.

If they need additional funding it should be paid for by Big Data/Big Tech who make trillions off of our data.

These needs are met because $ = Data = Life and we all profit and pay into it, it being civilization. Basic would incentivize working too because you will want clothing, furniture, entertainment, technology, vacations, a bigger home (if you want to own property), vehicles, etc. Basic also incentivizes fertility because you have a foundation to grow instead of sprinting and scraping into the next week to merely survive on this globe that offers infinite water that feeds the flora that feeds the fauna, some from whose feces can be molded into shelter and offers fuel for fire.Work would become a networking hub and a place to learn skills that will aid your success in your career and life. Your work has more value to yourself and society at large. You will have purpose in life because you will have a cushion to pursue passions and make mistakes in your endeavors without fear of homelessness or starvation.Basic would reduce large swathes of crime as well because basic resources are not stolen or fought over.To enact UBI would drive up costs and mess up the tax code for everyone. Basic offers the minimum needed for life to exist on our garden planet and no one needs to be taxed or lose money; in fact, there would be more money to be made all around, and Basic would balance inflation and other economic issues.Just UHC still leaves the majority of your money going to pay for rent, groceries, and gas effectively leaving a great portion of society as wage slaves trying to afford a matchstick shelter that can be destroyed so easily yet requires tremendous time and resources to afford its ever-evolving upkeep.Basic is the foundational policy needed for societal success and the fostering of our collective and individual potential.","title":"Dem Leader Calls House GOP Marauding Bands Of People Who Hate Each Other"},{"text":"Is there proof they got the meal?","title":"Donald Trump Jr.s Ridiculous Greenland Trip Just Took a Dark Turn | It appears the whole thing was staged."},{"text":"Children are starving in many American communities and this is what our leaders waste their time on?
