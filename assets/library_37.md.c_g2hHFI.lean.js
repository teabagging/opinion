Okay, cool. Here is what that means:- Credit card transaction fees become more ubiquitous and jack up from [at most 3.3%](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/credit-card-processing-fees/) to a significantly higher degree.\\n- Credit card annual fees become more ubiquitous and increase.\\n- By the same token, credit card borrowing limits get much tighter.\\n- Add onto that, you are not getting a credit card unless you have an exceptional credit score.\\n- And if that is not enough, when you do get a card, expect that you will have to maintain cash security to have access to that credit.You and pretty much no one else on earth is getting any significant line of credit without collateral at 10%.

On top of that, potentially [60% of people rely on credit cards to buy groceries](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/many-families-are-taking-debt-pay-groceries).

Which doesn't actually track by any real definition of bodily autonomy.Bodily autonomy is not and has never been \\"I can do whatever I want whenever I want wherever I want with no consequences\\". The only people who have ever tried to push that definition are people desperate to strip women of their rights to an abortion *or* people who want to insist the legality of abortion means men must never be expected to pay child support. But the definition is nonsense and based entirely on a desired result rather than an actual understanding.You cannot go rob a bank and insist that you must be set free because your bodily autonomy demands you be allowed to rob a bank. Hell, to make it clearer, it's typically a crime to try and perform some backalley abortion despite it being a pretty obvious medical decision and most people don't have a problem with this (as long as legal abortion is available). Your definition would not only require that all crimes forever be made legal, but also that all actions never receive a single bit of negative consequences. I *should* be able to stab my boss and destroy my office but keep my job.

The dominant political energy in America really since the Great Recession has been moderate anti-systemism. What does that mean? People don't really like the status-quo. They are discontented, but they also aren't all that ideologically predisposed to some alternative system. Progressives tried to build a system of \\"managed revolt\\" but people disliked it because it just seemed like \\"the system.\\" I wouldn't see people want leftism or conservatism either. There is just widespread discontent thats relatively smeared across the political spectrum. Liberals might just sort of be able to sit back and wait for people to lose their patience with Trump and hope they will then be allowed to start implement their policies again but I wouldn't pretend that the current Democratic approach is popular either. There are some easy wins for Democrats. The country tends to lean socially to whoever imposes on them least. If the Democrats abandon prescriptive social beliefs and just champion not liking social conservative prescriptivism that would be popular. The problem with this though is Democrats would never be able to do this. Progressive infighting would break out and independent cultural actors aren't going to take marching orders from the party. They should probably try but I'm somewhat skepticalOn the economic side I think the situation is more incoherent. Americans want good things but not bad things basically. Might as well try to be the rain god. I agree with Noah Smith that getting deeply entranced in the rhetoric of class is mostly just an excuse for progressive to indulge their obsession with moralism and wouldn't actually be all that successful. Everyone who likes left-wing rhetoric is already left-wing. Democrats could take a populist approach to economics but I think it should acknowledge that if purely for political popularity points the goal should not be sectoral interventions but more broadly rewarding labor in concrete ways that translate to higher salaries and making sure everyone knows it was you who did it.","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"Biden.

She didn't defend Biden's record on the economy, nor did she distance herself from it. This means she didn't get a bump for the good, but lost voters for the bad. She ran with Liz to get those centrist Republican votes, but did not bother to fire up the base. The base was not inspired and sat home. Attacking them, calling names and belittling them will only hasten the demise of the entire party. We know this is the case, because the margins that Harris won by in Connecticut and New Jersey are surprisingly low. The blue base didn't show. If you wish to believe this is sexism and racism, do so with the understanding that you are now actively undermining the party, and helping to push more people to sit out the elections. Most people vote with their wallet. They want a simple answer to the problems they face. Why did the price of food go up? Inflation due mostly to greed. The simple fix, increase competition by breaking up large food producers and grocery stores to foster more competition. Democrats didn't run on this. So Trump blamed immigrants and people voted for the guy who had an answer, despite how wrong it is.","title":"Weak turnout in key cities hurt Harris in the 'blue wall' states More people voted in 2024 than in 2020 in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but that growth came from pro-Trump areas."},{"text":"That would be dope!","title":"Donald Trump set to recognise African state as official country (Somaliland), says ex-Tory minister after holding talks"},{"text":"I'm at a point I'm no longer sure if i'm reading r/politics or r/facepalm","title":"Trump Casts TV Doctor Dr. Oz in New Administration | Oz will have control over the countrys Medicaid and Medicare programs."},{"text":"Keep getting another guys feces on your wiener bro.

And I agree. Choosing to not vote is literally the worst option if you are serious about living in a democracy. Its table stakes. Don't like either major candidate? Fine, then vote third party or write a name in, literally any name. Just show up on election day. Its all you need to do in order to enjoy living in a democratic society. If you didn't vote out of protest, then you are essentially giving up the only real advocacy you have. You are saying that the decision is too hard and you want other people to decide for you. And sure enough people will. If enough people sit out, then I assure you we will lose our democracy. Because one day enough people will decide (consciously or through manipulation) that we don't really want to be a democracy anymore. And when that happens, all the protest voters and all the people who were \\"unmotivated\\" to vote will look around in shock and blame everyone but themselves. This system only works when people show up. Anyone telling you otherwise are lying to you or they are lying to themselves.You can't blame this on the republicans or the democrats or anyone else. Even if the democrats ran a \\"perfect campaign\\" the decision to get up off the couch and vote is still on the people. There is no perfect campaign that will \\"motivate\\" people to vote. That has to be a decision at the individual level.  Noone is going to knock on your door and drag your ass to the polling booth. If you can't bring yourself to vote for a \\"lesser evil\\" just know that there are enough people in this country who will vote for the greater evil and they are voting purely out of fear and or greed. Sitting out gives those people all the power. Hell, even if your candidate loses, and you feel your vote was wasted, it was not. Big voter turnout sends messages to politicians. It establishes trends, influences future strategies, and will impact future legislation.This isn't even about Red vs Blue, this is about the basic process of democracy.

Brushing him off as just a simple snake oil salesmen misses the weird duality of this guy and his ability to appeal to the public.What does this mean for healthcare? Well, Oz and Halverson, a former Kaiser Permanente CEO, proposed a \\"Medicare Advantage for All\\" plan. It's sort of a mutated Medicare for All plan that still keeps the insurance companies in play, as the ACA does. You can read some critiques of a similar proposal in the comments at [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2787446](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2787446) including a conservative one that basically says this gives you the worst of both worlds, public government administration and private insurance middlemen. It's possible that Oz has changed his mind on this plan but it would definitely a way for Trump to keep his promise to 'kill ACA' and replace it with a plan that he and those who adore him will claim is better.Whether or not it will be better/worse than ACA will depend on the implementation details.

However, how trustworthy is America Debunk? The site appears to rely heavily on cherry-picked clips and Trumps own narrative rather than independent verification. Just because a clip is longer doesnt automatically mean its accurate or unbiased. A truly balanced perspective would include fact-checks from multiple independent sources, like AP Fact Check (https://apnews.com/hub/fact-checking) or Reuters Fact Check (https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/). For example, the claim about Trump being misquoted regarding abortion bans is misleading. Trump has openly supported restrictions at the federal level, as reported by major outlets and confirmed in full Interviews. Example: https://www.npr.org/2023/09/17/trump-abortion-ban-interview. The broader issue isnt just the medias portrayal but Trumps inconsistent and vague rhetoric on such topics. While some media outlets may selectively edit clips for headlines, independent investigations often debunk false claims Trump himself has made. For instance, his repeated assertion that the 2020 election was stolen has been thoroughly disproven by bipartisan reviews, state audits, and court rulings. Fact-checkers like Politifact (https://www.politifact.com/) and state-led investigations have shown theres no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The idea that all mainstream media lies isnt productive, its better to cross-reference information across diverse sources, including those you don't agree with. I don't think it's clever to assume that people who disagree are brain dead. Critical thinking means questioning all sources, including America Debunk. The best approach is to check facts from multiple angles, not rely solely on a site with a clear political bias. If Trumps record and context are strong enough, they should hold up to scrutiny from any credible source.","title":"What exactly made you vote trump and what do you think is he going to do now?"},{"text":"Good question-I wondered that myself","title":"Trump Sentencing In Hush Money Case Indefinitely Adjourned"},{"text":"No, I get your point.

Here is my opinion - none of it is meant to sound judgemental, especially since I don't know specifically what kind of manipulation we are talking about. Anyway, I would say:1) No, we cannot reasonably expect it if the system does not encourage it; however, that's not to say that there aren't reasons why you might want to hold yourself to a higher moral standard anyway - more below.2) sometimes yes, but I think we have to be very careful with this logic. If you imagine a very poor society, someone in that society could use that logic to justify becoming a violent criminal who directly or indirectly brings harm to other equally disadvantaged people in their society. Both unfairness and necessity are difficult to quantify, and you can almost always come up with some mental gymnastics if you want to.If you lie on a job application, for example - you may not have any qualms about cheating the company, but you're gaining an unfair advantage over other honest candidates. I think practically, there are few completely \\"victimless\\" crimes where it's just you vs an immoral organisation.3) because there is value in upholding your own moral principles, whatever they may be - the ability to \\"sleep at night\\" and influence the way that people around you behave for the better. To put it differently, you could say that you don't owe it to the organisation, but rather, you owe it to yourself.If someone is principled until they come under pressure to betray their principles, then by definition they are not principled. Often, we are able to develop our principles and live for a long time before they are tested in a way where we really have to decide whether we will make sacrifices to uphold them. What you are describing is the opposite - you are starting in a position where you are immediately encouraged to act against certain moral standards. However, it is still the same question - do you consider these to be your principles, or not?Another way to think of it could be - these organizations exist because there are unprincipled people at the top. One day, you may reach the top. If you betray your principles now, when you get to the top, you may not be any different to the people who are there now. Perhaps it is more meaningful to you to uphold a better standard, than to simply succeed in the existing system.","title":"CMV: Manipulation should be used as a tool."},{"text":"It's to make people look like conspiracy idiots by the time there actually *is* fraud.","title":"Trumps Nov. 26 Hush Money Sentencing Called Off, Court Says"},{"text":"LOL I mean go ahead lady, for once do something in the public interest.","title":"MTG says she will expose sexual harassment claims against Republicans if Gaetz report released"},{"text":"How do you do that?","title":"Trumps vows for revenge take on new seriousness"},{"text":"The havoc hes going leave his family when hes gone.

But in my eyes news shouldnt be a commidity. Based on some of what i have watched alot of US 'news' is opinion based due to the fact they need to run 24 hours. Say what you want about Irish media but there are no 24 hours news channels. It gives time for shows like Prime Time Investigates, which can go undercover and do proper investigative journalism and ofc there are daily news. The Six One being the main one with some more indepth looks later in the evening. 24 news means the constant need for stories or views to make money. More highly exaggerated 'opinions news' so not actually news. Other Irish channles will have politicians on to discuss decisions made or journalists to talk  more indepth on politicla issues etc. But they arent considered news. Just a more so political analysis show and ability to ask tough questions at times. Most 24 news channels are just regurgitating the same stuff or even pushing the boundaries to get people to watch as the 'news' channels need to make money. The more outrageous the claims t he more people will tune in. 24 news shouldnt exist. It should be a few Anchormen giving the headlines with on the ground peple expanding on it and then back to studio. THere is no need for a 24 hours minute by minute cycle. THe moment i turned of Fox was when the auld lad was pushed by the cops during a protest a few years ago and smashed his head open on the ground. The 5 o clock (MY time) news reel showed it and commented on it, and hour later it was ignored and never mentioned again.

Talking about things like LGBTQ+ topics isnt about pushing anything on kids, its more about teaching them empathy and kindness. Its not like teachers are telling kids to change who they are. Its just about making sure that kids who feel different dont feel left out or bullied. Studies have shown that schools with inclusive policies have less bullying and create safer environments for all students, which I think is a good thing. Source: https://www.glsen.org/research On illegal immigration: I understand the frustration about resources, but I think blaming illegal immigrants for those issues isnt entirely fair. Most of them come here to work hard or escape really dangerous situations, not to cause harm. In fact, research from places like the Cato Institute has shown that immigrants, legal or not, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Source: https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-crime And when it comes to resources, its worth noting that immigrants, even undocumented ones, contribute billions to the U.S. economy through taxes and spending. Source: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research Sure, helping homeless veterans and struggling Americans should absolutely be a priority, but its not like helping immigrants means we cant help them too. These problems come more from how budgets are spent than from whos in the country. About people who just walk in: I totally agree that immigration should be fair, but the U.S. immigration system is so broken that for a lot of people, theres no legal way to come in, even if theyre fleeing violence or poverty. Asylum laws, for example, are extremely restrictive and make it nearly impossible for many to apply legally. Reports from Human Rights Watch show that even people with legitimate claims are often turned away or forced to wait in dangerous conditions for years. Source: https://www.hrw.org Can you imagine being in that position? To me, it seems like we could do better without abandoning the idea that the U.S. is a place where people come to find safety and opportunity. On what kids should focus on: You mentioned that kids should be worrying about kid things, like ice cream and Christmas, not about adult issues. I actually agree with that! But keeping kids from learning about the diversity of the world around them doesnt make those issues go away. If anything, teaching kids kindness and understanding early on can help them feel safer and more confident, even if their home life or community is complex. Its not about burdening kids,? its about equipping them with tools to navigate the world. The CDC has found that inclusive environments improve mental health for all kids, which sounds like something we should want for every child.

Credit card rates are so high for a reason - its unsecured debt with no collateral and it has extremely high default rates (compared to other secured lending). At 10%, it basically means nobody gets a credit card unless you have phenomenal credit and at that point its not profitable for the banks anyway since everyone is paying it off every month if theyre smart with money. Even at 25-27% APR, the margins on credit card debt for banks usually end up around 8-10% (for a well run bank - Ive seen it much lower) - because so many of them default. They usually securitize vast amounts of credit card debt and sell it to high yield funds a couple times a year, because they dont want to deal with chasing charge offs. Banks dont want to give you a credit card. Its a product they use to get you to be a customer so youll be more likely to use them for deposits, mortgages, auto loans, home equity, etc. Ive run banks for most of my life, banks do not want to be in the business of credit cards long-term.\\nCould they survive and still make a small profit if it were capped at like, 18-20%?

Forced gestation involves direct physical intrusion into someones body, whereas post-birth care often involves external obligations. However, the distinction in degree doesnt eliminate the shared principle: both involve bodily resources being used to sustain a dependent life.You argue that parents have options post-birth (e.g., adoption), which limits or removes their bodily obligations. However, this doesnt negate the principle of responsibility, they must arrange care, or theyre held accountable. Why should gestation, the earlier stage of that responsibility, be treated differently?I see consent is a big part of your argument, but responsibility for outcomes of ones actions often supersedes ongoing consent. For example:If I hit a pedestrian, I cant refuse to render aid because I didnt consent to the accident. Im obligated to help because I created the situation. Consensual sex inherently carries the possibility of conception, just as driving carries the possibility of accidents. Once a dependent life exists, isnt the obligation to mitigate harm just as binding?\\nWe generally try not to violently force people do or act a certain way by force except in extreme circumstances. There is a distinction between strong incentives and force. We use force when we arrest someone for a violent crime. We use incentives when we issue fines for a late payment or fire someone for being lazy at work. That's why work and modern debt practices are different from slavery or indebted servitude. In the first instance people have the freedom to come up with a way to pay their monetaryYou argue that forcing gestation involves violent force through the threat of arrest, while parenting obligations dont. However.Neglect Laws: Parents who fail to provide care or arrange alternatives face legal consequences, including imprisonment. While this enforcement doesnt directly compel specific bodily acts, it enforces the broader obligation to care for the dependent child.Similarly, anti-abortion laws enforce a broader obligation to sustain life, albeit through gestation. If society accepts enforcement mechanisms for neglect post-birth, why is it unjust to enforce obligations during gestation?You then argue hat gestation involves unique physical risks that outweigh those of parenting. This is truebut degree alone doesnt negate the principle. Consider....FA firefighter who knowingly starts a fire is obligated to rescue anyone trapped inside, even if its dangerous. The severity of the risk doesnt absolve their responsibility for the situation they caused.Your argument suggests the real debate isnt about bodily autonomy itself but about weighing the rights of the fetus against the mothers autonomy. This is where we likely differ. My argument isnt that gestation isnt a greater bodily autonomy violation; ,ts that responsibility for the dependent life created may justify that violation in certain cases. The moral and legal frameworks we use post-birth to enforce care should apply consistently to gestation unless a meaningful distinction can be demonstrated.The distinction youve drawn between gestation and post-birth care is valid in terms of degree, but not in principle. Both involve obligations to sustain a dependent life. The challenge lies in justifying why responsibility begins only after birth, rather than at the moment the dependent life is created. If the principle of responsibility for harm caused overrides consent in other contexts, why should gestation be an exception?","title":"CMV: Requiring Parents to care for their children is as much of a Bodily autonomy violation as Forced gestation"},{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable.

How does that jive with your statement?(edit)You appear to have been reading this website [\\"Any individual location will have significantly more variability than the globe as a whole. A single ice core is also subject to uncertainties around elevation changes and other perturbations to the ice core over time.\\"](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-greenland-ice-cores-say-about-past-and-present-climate-change/). From my experience, any website that says \\"factcheck\\" is lying (high probability). A single ice core is also subject to uncertainties around elevation changesSo what! The ice core is not actually a thermometer of the local area, and an ice core from a higher elevation (while existing at a colder temperature, yes) is not recording that colder temperature. The temperature proxy is the ratio of isotopic concentrations expressed in per mil  units (D and 1?O), of H?1?O (0.2%) and HD1?O (isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen). The isotopic concentrations are already locked into the falling snow. Once fallen, the isotopic concentrations do not change either. Therefore, whether the snow (falling from an altitude of 10,000's of feet) lands at a high elevation or a low elevation does not change the isotopic concentration (assuming no melting of the ice, and flow of liquid water occurs, which *would* change the isotopic concentration.).The isotopic concentration is fixed at the point where the water evaporated (many 1000's of miles from the ice core), or where other rain fell (ie, some fractionation of the evaporated water) before the snow fell (100's - 1000's of miles from the ice core).Am I wrong? and other perturbations to the ice core over time.Yes, possible melting and water flowing away or evaporating. There are no other perturbation that affects the isotopic concentration of the ice core. Deuterium has a half-life of, let me look it up, infinity. 1?O has a half-life, well, also infinity.If ice melted and flowed away, your ice core is essentially useless as a temperature proxy, isn't it?","title":"A Thought About Life After January 20"},{"text":"because obviously she wants to catch a glimpse of MTGs snatch??","title":"Republicans move to ban first trans congresswoman from using female bathrooms"},{"text":"And probably no crime done.

Nancy Mace has likely never even met Sarah McBride.  As far as I know, McBride has not even mentioned Mace's name or given her any reason to target her.  And the theme of this election was supposedly that everyday people are suffering beyond belief, so much so that they felt they had no choice but to elect a rapist insurrectionist. And Liberals are in a bubble because we don't recognize how \\"things are so bad\\".  Things are \\"so bad\\" right now and what does someone who's supposed to be a more serious Republican in Nancy Mace do? Try and pass a bill that has no purpose beyond making one of their colleagues uncomfortable.  Its the definition of a cheap shot, of bullying.  They know McBride is new and doesnt have any connections in congress, and they know Democrats are weary about sticking up for transgender people because thats \\"woke\\".  So Mace just launches a broadsided deeply personal attack against someone who may not be able to defend themselves.  They aren't a serious party.  They are an \\"own the libs\\" party.  And then they turn around and whine about being \\"bullied and shamed\\" for supporting a rapist.  They're whole MO is \\"Its my god given right to bully people and the fact that you are telling me I cant do that means you're a bully!\\".The Westboro Baptist Church has a really unique business model.  They troll events by being as vile and offensive as humanly possible.  They keep going until they provoke a response.

It exists in relation to other rights. One cannot claim they are not required to pay for their negligence in an automobile incident on the basis that control of the wheel is the government unlawfully controlling their hands.  Are traffic laws a violation of body autonomy?While the gestational process has immediate and direct impacts to the womans body, external obligations are only tangentially related to a caregivers body. **After birth, a legally responsible caregiver must only assure that appropriate care is provided.  There is no requirement that this care needs to be actually provided specifically through a caregivers body.**Caregivers can, and often do, externalize these requirements.  This can be done through hiring support, by getting free support from others, depending on means.  Those with less means must work harder but this is not unlike any other obligation.  The wealthy dont need to work to pay rent, but those without means do.  Should everyone get free rent as a matter of bodily autonomy?  Is universal basic income a matter of bodily autonomy?If we stretch the definition of body autonomy in this way to include social expectations in a way that was never intended, then the term just is meaningless and your point is moot. A childs reliance on the caregivers body is in fact fundamentally different pre-birth.  We do not yet have an artificial uterus that will meet the needs of a developing fetus.  We can, however, provide nutrition and every other form of care without the parents body specifically doing it.  Certainly after breastfeeding is complete, which again isnt absolutely necessary, there is no direct physical connection to child raising and the comparison becomes strained at best.

It's about where you welcome and who your social network is. It's about what is seen as an acceptable career among people who went to college.A plutocrat is in the social elite as are Owners. A small-holder isn't. The guy who owns an auto-body shop hangs out mostly with people who didn't go to college, who don't practice the same kind of social elite signaling behaviors like \\"quiet luxury\\" or to some extent \\"cultural progressivism\\" they have a harder time speaking in the language of money. Secretarial labor usually has a foot in both camps. A receptionist might marry a truck driver or the well-paid IT guy. There is somewhat of a gender divide here but a lawyer marrying a truck driver is unusual.Teachers are completely welcome in the social elite. No one would bat in an eye if a lawyer married a middle-school teacher. White-collar America loves teachers for the most part. Yeah there is a distinctly conservative strain of disliking teachers but the Democratic Party treats teachers as cultural heroes except when it comes to paying them and teachers can speak the language of money. In fact I would argue a lot of conservatives dislike teachers because they are seen as part of the social elite rather than part of their working-class community and its values. So Teachers are in the social elite but not paid well. I would say they are in the lower end of the struggling academic class and have more overlap with working class communities but it's a high status job. An upper-middle class family isn't upset if their kid becomes a teacher usually. They are upset if they become a mechanic. The mechanic might be paid more but that doesn't really matter. With academics it's very black and white that they are social elites.","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"Finally, a decent headline for something.?","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene: GOP Covered Up Sexual Harassment and Assault Claims"},{"text":"Looks like Trump played it well.

And I am LITERALLY an Indian (South Asian) woman from California, born in the Bay Area, educated at UC Berkeley.  Kamala is literally my people, we are the same demographic ?? And everyone around me for some reason assumes that it must be really exciting for me to see Kamala run for president. \\"Wow Kamala 2024 must be so exciting for you!\\" No sir, it's actually an embarrassment to me.What do I admire about her? Freaking NOTHING. There's is absolutely nothing I admire or respect about her, she has NO skills, NO intelligence, no character, no principles, no children she's raised, no fixed values, no political acumen, literally NOTHING. I mean I'm racking my brain to try to come up with something and I'm literally drawing a blank.I can name a litany of things I admire and respect about the Obamas and the Clintons, despite disagreeing with their politics. Hell, I can even say some good things about GW Bush. I dislike Ted Cruz but I can still point to some things there that I respect. But Kamala? Absolutely nothing.As a woman, I cannot tell you how RELIEVED I am that this woman will not be our first female president. This type of vapid, low IQ, uneducated, lacking in values, morally bankrupt, opportunistic whre of a woman (forgive me, I'm sorry) is NOT who I want our little girls to look up to. This is NOT the woman to represent our gender. If Kamala was elected this time around, we would never have had another female president for another 100 years because she would have been so incompetent and insufferable throughout her term. I see her loss as a huge victory for women everywhere.They are many woman who embody strength, leadership, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, morals, principles, and values. That is the kind of woman who needs to be our first female president. I thank God that it wasn't Kamala.And as a woman \\"of color\\" (??) I cannot tell you how freaking relieved I am that this woman won't be out first Indian American president (except apparently she's not Indian anymore, she's \\"all black\\" lmao). Not that identity matters much, but she would have been a terrible reflection of our community. She's everything that Indian Americans are not. Indian Americans are hard working, no nonsense, PATRIOTIC, innovative people. We don't ask for handouts, we don't give a shit about DEI, we are here to work hard, contribute to society, and live by strong family and community values. We produces the Vivek's of the world, we do NOT claim the Kamala's (which seems fine by her, since she doesn't even claim her own ethnicity anyways).All a very long-winded way of me saying--in the most objective way possible--I have nothing positive to say about this woman. At all. I hope she falls away into oblivion.

Your argument requires legal incentives to be the equivalent of physical restraint and rape.Gestation is more invasive, but the principle is similar: Gestation directly involves the body in sustaining life. Post-birth care involves external obligations (working to provide for a child, physically feeding or sheltering them). These obligations are enforced by law, creating external pressureYou point two distinctions that disprove your view here:1. Indirect vs. Direct.2. Legal incentive vs. physical force.Addionally, a woman can be forced to gestate regardless of whether or not there are laws at all. Your argument requires a certain set of circumstances to be plausible while it still acknowledges differences between physical force and social incentives. Gestation isnt about \\"force\\" but about responsibility for dependencyIt depends on the gestatation. A woman can be raped and restrained through childbirth. A parent can't be restrained and still care for their children. I'm being very literal here. It is not physically possible to force someone to care for their children. It is physically possible to force a woman to conceive and give birth by force. That shows the two aren't equivalent.Just as parents cant walk away from a newborn without ensuring care, a pregnant person has created a life that depends on them.That assumes the pregnant person took steps to become pregnant. Being raped is no something they are responsible for.Post-birth parallel: Imagine a parent claiming, \\"I didnt consent to feed my baby.\\" Society would reject this because creating the life imposes responsibility, even if the care required is difficult or unwanted.And society accepts \\"I didn't consent to sex so I'm justified in terminating this pregnancy.\\"That further proves the two are not equivalent by your own logic.Gestation is a unique form of dependency, but the principle remains: creating life carries obligations until the dependency ends (e.g., through birth or transfer of care)..We don't have any obligations but arguably what the law requires. In most places, you aren't obligated to carry a pregnancy that was imposed on you by force. The law doesnt physically compel most obligations; it enforces them through consequences. Which is why your comparison is bad. It equates something that can be physically forced upon on a person with something that merely punishes them for not acting a certain wayIt's like the difference between a kid not being allowed to go to school because they are unvaccinated vs. the government going door-to-door forcibly vaccinating children. Not that same thing, but your argument dictates it is.The issue is whether the moral obligation to sustain a dependent life applies in both cases.There's no such thing as a moral obligation. That's a matter of opinion.  we accept that creating a dependent life imposes obligations (as it does post-birth), then the physical method of fulfilling those obligations (internal vs. external use of the body) is secondary to the principle of responsibility.We don't accept that. That is your opinion. But it also assumes being acted upon is the same as not acting.

In order to offset the loss of tax revenue, Trumps economic advisers are considering a plan that would punish the poorest Americans by making it even harder to access Medicaid, food stamps, and other federal programs, according to a Tuesday report from The Washington Post.According to seven sources who spoke to the Post, all of whom were familiar with the discussion taking place in Trumpworld, the president-elects advisers  including Republican lawmakers  are floating new work requirements and spending caps on social safety net programs.The proposals under discussion would likely increase inequality and hardship in America at a time when nearly 4 in 10 households are struggling to pay their bills. In this case, the cuts to Americas meager safety net would be used to finance an unusually direct transfer of wealth upward. A review of Trumps 2024 campaign tax promises by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found his proposals, taken together, would, on average, lead to a tax cut for the richest 5 percent of Americans and a tax increase for all other income groups.Among the options under consideration is imposing work requirements for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to 70 million low-income Americans. Medicaid enrollment is subject to strict income caps. The caps vary by state, but generally speaking, beneficiaries are not allowed to earn enough money to live. One state, Arkansas, previously enacted Medicaid work requirements, and quickly purged 18,000 residents health insurance coverage before a judge struck down the program.Under federal rules, states are required to conduct eligibility checks once per year to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are poor enough to keep their health insurance. Its well understood these checks often result in people being administratively purged from the program wrongfully, even though they qualify. Republicans are discussing having states do these eligibility checks multiple times per year.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/team-trump-tax-cuts-rich-medicaid-snap-cuts-1235172682/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/team-trump-tax-cuts-rich-medicaid-snap-cuts-1235172682/)","title":"Team Trump Wants the Poor to Suffer to Fund His Tax Cuts for the Rich"},{"text":" people who have already lost families in Gaza, have no real pathway to citizenshipSo how am I blaming people who have no pathway to citizenship, if I'm blaming people who voted for Trump?

(Understanding that there are almost 14,000 of them now, and I cant realistically read them all.) Theres a lot of voting for change, and little to nothing explaining what exactly that means,  especially with the White House having changed hands three times in the last eight years. In fact, as I think about it, there havent been consecutive Presidents of the same party since Reagan and Bush, 54 years ago. So maybe were just dissatisfied with Presidents in general, which makes it unclear to me what they think is best for them means. I agree that it can mean something other than economics, but the comments dont illuminate what that is. Then theres a lot of misinformation, misunderstanding the differences between the two parties, and, Im disappointed to say, just very frank prejudice. (Some of that is about transgender people, where I personally think the issues are a lot more complicated than either party is admitting. Thats another issue where I wish people would sit down, look at the science, look at the problemsgirls and womens sports, anyone?created by pretending that any of it is clear-cut, and figure out a way forward. But thats a topic for a whole posting on its own.) Here are some comments that I hope illustrate what I mean by voting against self-interest. Ive tried to omit the simple voting-for-change ones, understanding that I do realize people arent happy with the status quo: Oklahoma has been a lot more affected by natural disasters than Massachusetts has in the last 4 decades. Rich people dont invest in these types of areas, therefore, you rarely see investment and gentrification to the scale you see in Massachusetts.I see it as Mass has and OK doesnt, so they voted accordingly.This is the kind of pointless elitism and superiority complex that alienates people. Feel empathy for people in worse circumstances instead of ridiculing them.On the Indians, Im more confused than before. I thought it was a matter of, please leave us alone, which I certainly could understand, but clearly theres more to it than that. Id be happy to hear from someone who does understand it. I recognize that Im totally out of my depth here. I will say that its nice to be reading/writing on a well-moderated sub where people actually think before they speak. Im just going to say economic self-interest for the time being. Thanks for your comments, which have made me less certain of my own ideas about this stuff.

These obligations are enforced by law, creating external pressurewoman can be forced into gestation against her will.Gestation isnt about \\"force\\" but about responsibility for dependency. Just as parents cant walk away from a newborn without ensuring care, a pregnant person has created a life that depends on them.Post-birth parallel: Imagine a parent claiming, \\"I didnt consent to feed my baby.\\" Society would reject this because creating the life imposes responsibility, even if the care required is difficult or unwanted.Gestation is a unique form of dependency, but the principle remains: creating life carries obligations until the dependency ends (e.g., through birth or transfer of care)..Punishment for failure to act =/= having your body forcibly acted upon.The law doesnt physically compel most obligations; it enforces them through consequences. The issue is whether the moral obligation to sustain a dependent life applies in both cases. If we accept that creating a dependent life imposes obligations (as it does post-birth), then the physical method of fulfilling those obligations (internal vs. external use of the body) is secondary to the principle of responsibility.","title":"CMV: Requiring Parents to care for their children is as much of a Bodily autonomy violation as Forced gestation"},{"text":"This clown cost us a senate seat.","title":"Donald Trump gives Dr. Oz a role in his administration in another surprise pick"},{"text":"Instead of worrying about Donald Trump, Europeans and Canadians should follow the lead of Donald Tusk. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. While many are anxiously waiting to see what Trump will do, Polands Prime Minister has followed expert advice and called for a coalition of willing states to secure Ukraine and deter further Russian aggression.\\n \\nIts not hard to imagine such a coalition, pioneered by the states that have been clearest about the Russian threat and the need to secure Ukraine to forge a stable Euro-Atlantic security order. Poland could be joined by the Baltic states, Nordic Countries, the UK, France, Canada and the Netherlands. The UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force could be extended to form a vanguard, but ultimately the format matters less than the actions they take. By changing policy and facts on the ground, the coalition would spur others to join them and embrace Europeans and Canadians power to defend ourselves and our interests, regardless of what the US does.Here, we propose five things that a European-Canadian coalition of the willing should C and can C do: 1. **Arm Ukraine to Win:** The coalition can get Ukraine what it needs to win: from their own stocks, procurement on the open market as well as, most cost effectively, by technology transfer to and investment in Ukraines own defence industry. The coalitions focus should be on war-winning capabilities including long-range precision strike (with no restrictions on targeting), electronic warfare, command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, as well as emerging defence technologies that offset traditional Russian advantages, and core basics like artillery, 155mm ammunition, anti-air, anti-ship and anti-tank systems and munitions.2. **Seize ALL the frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraines victory:** Confiscating frozen Russian assets is economically feasible, legal under the international principle of countermeasures C and would establish a financial deterrent to future aggression. The $300 billion of frozen assets is four times US military aid to Ukraine since 2022 and roughly 75% of total Western assistance to date. Seizing the full amount would be the best way to get Ukraine the money it needs to defend itself and seriously degrade Russian morale. Canada has ready legislation and most of these frozen assets are in Europe. The coalition states should seize those in their jurisdiction without delay, to set a clear precedent that other NATO allies can follow. 3. **Extend air defence over Western Ukraine and use it to cover coalition troops on the ground:** Air defence assets based in coalition countries or sent to states bordering Ukraine can provide a shield over Western Ukraine and take some of the pressure off Ukrainian air defence assets. Russian missiles and drones are flying toward our borders and we cant take chances. Coalition states could then use this shield to put their own troops on the ground, as proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to help train Ukrainian forces, provide logistical and de-mining support and conduct other tasks that would demonstrate our commitment to Ukraines victory and security.4. **Provide real security guarantees, including mutual defence, to shepherd Ukraine into NATO:** Much as Sweden and Finland needed guarantees from strong partners while they waited for their NATO membership to be concluded, so too does Ukraine. The coalition can commit, now, to mutual defence with Ukraine in the intervening period after the end of the current hostilities. It can use that time to help drive interoperability and coordination, accelerating Ukraines path into the alliance, which it would strengthen. An unambiguous coalition commitment, backed up by growing capabilities, would deter future Russian attacks on Ukraine C and ourselves.5. **Show we can stand up for ourselves:** The coalition can commit to each spend at least three per cent of GDP on defence annually, and to joint procurement of the critical enablers that Europe and Canada lack, including through common borrowing. But the war, and our credibility, must be won on other fronts too. Europeans and Canadians economic advantage over Russia must be leveraged and strategically targeted to be meaningful. The coalition should move to tighten C and enforce C sanctions, but also work to defeat Russia economically, turning the screws to cripple its creaking war machine. China must be shown that its support for Russias war is unacceptable and that it cannot buy us off. Whatever the final composition of the Trump administration, and whatever policies or predilections it pursues, a coalition of willing states can set the Euro-Atlantic area on a more secure path. By taking the steps outlined here, Europeans and Canadians would show how we can pull our weight in NATO while simultaneously insuring against any decrease in US capability commitment in Europe.We can show how to be good allies as the US pivots to keep China in check, and demonstrate that deterring China in Taiwan begins with deterring Russia across Europe and defeating it in Ukraine. Time is of the essence and so we, the signatories of this letter, urge European states and Canada to embrace their power, quickly form a coalition of the willing and, together, take these steps C  for Ukraines security and our own.# Signatories**Toomas Hendrik Ilves,** President of Estonia (2006-2016); Professor, Tartu University**Egils Levits,** President of Latvia (2019-2023), European Court of Justice (2004-2019)**The Rt.

Your argument suggests that people can never be held responsible for any action since that would be a violation of their bodily autonomy. We couldn't ever jail criminals, enforce traffic laws, or even require someone to repay a debt since all of those would require that person to use their hands to make money. So right away we already make a lot of exceptions to the strict bodily autonomy concept you are arguing for. You're right that requiring parents care for their children is a violation of bodily autonomy, but it is not a violation to the same degree as a forced gestation. Just like having to go to work to make money to pay off a debt is also technically a violation of bodily autonomy, but not to the same extent as being forcibly enslaved.We generally try not to violently force people do or act a certain way by force except in extreme circumstances. There is a distinction between strong incentives and force. We use force when we arrest someone for a violent crime. We use incentives when we issue fines for a late payment or fire someone for being lazy at work. That's why work and modern debt practices are different from slavery or indebted servitude. In the first instance people have the freedom to come up with a way to pay their monetary debts through whatever legal means they want and the consequence is losing money. Whereas with slavery/debt slavery they have no choice in what job they do and the punishment is often physical and violent and the consequence is your health (i.e. literally your body). We tend to rank health very highly because you can always get another car or more money but you only have one life and you can't get that back. So back to your example. Yes parents are responsible for their children's well-being, but the parents have a lot of different options to fulfill that obligation. On one extreme they could labor over a farm to feed the child, and on the other end they could hire a nanny to do all the childcare, and on the extreme end they could even give the child up for adoption. At no point is the state using violent force to force a parent to keep the kid nor would they be punished for giving up the kid. Now yes...the parent is responsible for making those alternative arrangements...because again letting a kid die of starvation or abusing them in other ways is a violation of that child's bodily autonomy. Forced gestation is a much larger violation of bodily autonomy...because you are using force (i.e. threat of arrest) to make someone do a specific thing with their body which affects their health.  To me there is no question that forced gestation is a strong if not one of the strongest violations of bodily autonomy. Murder is probably the strongest violation of bodily autonomy, yet there are justified reasons to kill someone. So the question isn't what is bodily autonomy. The question is whether the fetus has a right to bodily autonomy, when does that happen, are there justified reasons to violate it, and to what extent does that need to be weighed against the mother's bodily autonomy. I think there is reasonable disagreement on these questions... but I don't think your argument actually challenges it that strongly.","title":"CMV: Requiring Parents to care for their children is as much of a Bodily autonomy violation as Forced gestation"},{"text":"That really doesn't capture the magnitude of what we are seeing.

It may seem mysterious or imprecise to people without an understanding of the math -- and it's not run-of-the-mill high school math, so that's most people. But it isn't mysterious. The polling before said it'd be close because of, fundamentally, a mis-assumption. There was an assumption that the ratio of early to election-day voters would stay consistent between 2022 and 2024, and that was, as it turns out, very wrong. In the states that a) mattered and b) had early voting, essentially all of the Democrats who were going to bother to vote voted early.  *That* is the sole reason for the incorrect projections. There was no inkling that 15+ million Democrats weren't going to bother voting when they didn't vote in the early polling. In 2022 they did.

It does a bad job at predicting who will identify as working class and a bad job at predicting the values or interests of people who do identify as such. Traditionally, class analysis was thought to have very robust answers as to both what constitutes the working class and how its members would behave. As Noahs article points out, much of this analytic value has evaporated.

Now all the sudden CRT just means \\"they are talking about parts of history we don't like\\" and used that talking point riling folks up as a way to basically censor teachers from teaching actual history.

Since the election, however, Biden has become more conciliatory, even receiving Trump with a big smile at the White House. Charlamagne spoke about this stark contrast with his co-hosts on The Breakfast Club on Thursday.I just dont understand the White House visit. Now granted, you know, Im glad its a peaceful transition of power, but what happened to the threat of democracy talk? What happened to the fascist talk? Charlamagne asked.

Theyre not calling him a fascist, Charlamagne remarked at the timeI would think that, you know, if you really believe that, then somebodys speech would be about how America effed up and how things are about to be really bad.

A Harbinger of Americas Collapse. (Gift Article)"},{"text":"Well that tends to happen when you alter the language. Women and Men used to be synonyms for Female and Male. The same way Human is a synonym for Homo Sapien Sapien. If you then change the meaning of the words \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\" to mean what you want them to mean, people will then use the other words to mean what they're actually trying to say. For instance, \\"women's bathrooms\\" used to mean specifically \\"female bathrooms.\\" The push to create women's bathrooms was quite literally an attempt by females, not the modern definition of women, to create safe spaces to do their business in public. Away from males. They were quite literally created for females during a time when \\"Woman\\" meant female. Now that you've gone and started using \\"women\\" to mean other things, they're returning to the word Female to say exactly what they meant. This place is for females. Not the modern definition of \\"woman\\" which doesn't even have a working definition. Same with sports. Nearly all leagues used to be \\"male\\" leagues. Because males dominated in every sport thanks to biological sexual dimorphism. So women, which used to mean \\"females,\\" got together and pushed for the creation of leagues that would separate males and females so females could actually compete and play sports in a fair environment where they wouldn't have to contend with males who have a natural advantage over them. At that time the men's leagues became \\"open\\" leagues where anyone, male or female, could compete as long as you actually could compete. Because that was the height of competition and physical prowess. \\"Women's\\" leagues became female only so nobody messed with females ability to play sports in a fair league. Now you have folks who get all the physical advantages of being a male coming into leagues and pushing females out of the leagues specifically created for females. You could end this whole thing by getting rid of Men's and Women's leagues and just having a single league where anyone could participate. But you and I both know that almost no females would ever make that league. Because biology says \\"fuck you and what you want\\" a lot. And when no females are able to make it into the leagues we'd be right back to where we started where females will then push for the creation of leagues that don't allow males so that females can actually have a chance to play the sports they love in a fair and competitive environment.","title":"Republicans move to ban first trans congresswoman from using female bathrooms"},{"text":"The threat to drain it seems to be doing the job just fine.","title":"Report: Top CIA, National Intelligence Watchdogs Resign Before Trump Takes Office"},{"text":"Sort of.

The interim responsibility remains enforceable.\\nSimilarly, during gestation, the parent (pregnant individual) is the only one who can provide care for the dependent life. There is no equivalent of a \\"nanny\\" or \\"adoption\\" for the unborn child because it cannot survive outside the womb.The lack of external alternatives during gestation reflects the biological reality that the fetus is entirely dependent on the pregnant individual for survival. This dependency doesnt make the obligation less valid; it simply highlights the uniqueness of the prenatal stage.If you were the only person capable of saving someone's life because of unique circumstances (e.g., youre the only person nearby who can perform CPR), you would still have a moral and often legal obligation to help. The lack of other rescuers doesnt absolve you of that responsibilityit intensifies it.One could argue that preventing pregnancy through abstinence or contraception is analogous to hiring a nanny or choosing adoption after birth. In both cases, proactive steps are taken to avoid being solely responsible for a dependent life. Once pregnancy occurs, however, the responsibility is already in effect.The existence of alternatives post-birth is not a valid justification for dismissing the obligation to care for a fetus, as the moral and legal principles of protecting dependent lives remain consistent.","title":"CMV: Requiring Parents to care for their children is as much of a Bodily autonomy violation as Forced gestation"},{"text":"Yes, this sadly says just as much about the American electorate as it does Trump.

Over 20 years, the operating losses would total $32 billion, or more than 100 percent of the investment.**According to a report by CoinDesk, Lummiss proposed Bitcoin Act of 2024 would also require the Treasury to revalue its gold stock and use the resulting capital gains to buy Bitcoin. We explained the mechanics of such a transaction in an article addressing the 2023 federal debt ceiling debate.**The current market price of gold is about $2,500 per ounce. The Treasury owns about 261.5 million ounces of gold. The Gold Reserve Act, amended in 1973, requires the Treasury to value its gold at $42.22 per ounce. At current market prices, the Treasury owns about $640 billion in gold but values it at a little over $11 billion.**If the law were changed to force the Treasury to revalue its gold, it could issue $629 billion in new gold certificates to the Fed in return for dollars. This accounting transaction would create $629 billion in newly-printed dollars for the Treasury to spend. Using an accounting adjustment to create $629 billion for the Treasury to spend on Bitcoin is inflationary and does nothing to enhance the value of the U.S. dollar.**From a risk exposure perspective, any federal government investment in Bitcoin would be leveraged speculation on the price of a notoriously volatile intangible asset*","title":"Ready for prime time': Trump trots out once-scorned economic plans"},{"text":"the want women to rely on men for survival again is their goal they need more meat for the meat grinder and are too lazy to improve themselves so women will sleep with them","title":"No DEI.

Hating on immigrants is a low hanging fruit from politicians profiting off of populism, that dont really care about the crimes immigrants commit or the legality of it, because if it were true they would advocate for easier, cheaper and more relaxed visa processes, as it would make it easier to trace people in case they do indeed commit crimes, offer better options for immigrants to integrate, work and to get them proper temporary housing, reform the prison system that would value reformation rather than punishment. I dont believe populists claiming they know easy solutions for complex problems as it's a slippery slope and when you use a minority or disadvantaged group to win your elections it's the lowest hanging fruit. Same as I dont believe conmans claiming I would win fortune f I just send them money. That's all. And I'm all about expelling the most dangerous people, especially murderers, terrorists and those who threaten secularity of my country - I live in Germany and know how it's like to have the opposite problem of the same coin. Then again, history teached me, that every politicians using a group of people as a scapegoat to win popularity, is not to be trusted, because politicians who do care, do it with laws, not screaming bigoted shit.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I've always wondered why Americans are unable to vote in their own self interest, but this last election was completely unbelievable.","title":"Hes not hurting the right people"},{"text":"They just need RED bathrooms and BLUE bathrooms.","title":"House Republican leaders poised to deny bathroom access to trans lawmaker Sarah McBride"},{"text":"The last \\"JB\\" I voted for was John B.

One of most common ideas is replacing property tax with cadastral tax that would, in case of rental properties, calculate the tax based off rental market value in area.Of course this may mean a rise of rental prices as tax will be moved onto tenants - that is why first steps of building more houses need to be financed from other sources. Both of those should stabilize the rental prices to not be affected as much (landlords being more likely to accept price drops if they need to pay for vacancy + existence of social housing giving an avenue of cheaper rent).For example, my grandmother's house is currently vacant because she's in a memory care unit and my dad and uncle have been dragging their feet with doing an estate sale and selling her house.That is where cadastral tax shines - you are able to exempt certain properties in some amounts as to not put the burden on regular people owning homes (such as exempting one primary residence and one seasonal, exempting newly bought house for a year to allow for transition between old and new primary residence etc.) but for properties that are used for profit, it would work as any other tax on business that covers externalities generated by that business.How many units of the type that you think should be used to solve homelessness are there?I think that there is a significant amount of homes that is left vacant due to it being used as investment, where the risk of renting leaves them vacant for prolonged amounts of time, but this is only based off anecdotal data - meaning that it's worthless until we will gather more detailed statistical data.What do you think the ideal vacancy rate should be?Ideal vacancy rate does not exist - the issue is that buying a house and leaving it vacant for a prolonged time to maximize profit is creating major issue with the housing market. Landlords are letting a crucial resource being underutilized because it is just more profitable. The aim is for them to not be able to do it without incurring costs.But I'm not really concerned with vacancy rates.As I said - it is a very alarming statistic that shows that there is an inherent issue, so that is why we should be concerned with it. But I agree that \\"confiscate the houses\\" is just a stupid idea that would create more problems than it solves. Building houses is the answer - but those homes need to be financed somehow. And vacant rentals are perfect for that - they exacerbate the issue with housing access and can pay for that. Same as any other business should pay for the externalities they create.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Well Ukraine kicked the ever loving shit out of Russia for quite a spell with not much more than a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook.

In particular the graduated income tax has long been targeted by conservative screeing as a Jealousy Law that your lazy ungrateful kids who couldn't cut it in a real job use to punish their dads who actually worked hard to succeed. Efforts to make it easier to file have been denied on the justification that increasing the visceral pain of the income tax would radicalize people against the entire concept.TEA stood for Taxed Enough Already.The issue of course is what to replace it with?Well thankfully we have 50 years of extremely bad history curricula. Historians have an enormous fucking problem with tariff apologetics and it percolates into our history lessons about our own country. Generally speaking most historians couldn't care less but those who do have the autarky bias, which is very common and normal for humans in general as Reason mag points out. People generally just assume it's better to produce your own stuff and relying on others is weakness.They look at Europe and America industrializing under tariffed protected markets, see bilateral trade as \\"economic dependency\\", see the US struggling to get a textile industry going domestically because British textiles are so cheap, until they tariff it to make local textiles more competitive and allow them to grow from profits, building the industrial sector. In a sort of cargo cult people affiliate the factories themselves, not the cheap goods they produce, as the source of industrialization's prosperity. They look at nationalist movements like in India making autarkic production of textile a key platform of anticolonialist activism.It all paints a clear picture: Trade makes you dependent on colonizers. Tariffs allow you to industrialize. But powerful nations which do not want to be locked out of your markets by tariffs promote free trade to expand their economic domination over weaker countries. Free Trade is, in their mind, an Orwellian Inversion, and in fact promotes subjugation not freedom.The result is American history books portray Henry Clay's American System as successful.","title":"Trump expected to nominate Lutnick for Commerce secretary"},{"text":"u/Resident_Warthog4711 C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.

Now that we no longer have to run down large animals and throw spears into their side it's opened up the ability to hunt successfully to females. Now you just need a decent rifle and a scope and anyone can reach out and kill an animal from 500 yards. Even a fucking 8 year old. Scientifically speaking, acknowledging the differences between people and taking in MORE data as with organ checklists is better, no?What does that even mean? Males come with certain organs, females come with certain organs. Are there a very small number of humans who thanks to birth defects and disorders have mixtures? Absolutely. My ID would solve that issue. In your specific case, the genitals that you ultimately ended up with would be on your ID. You'd have the necessary medical paperwork to file to confirm it. Whereas a trans person who doesn't have any sex disorders from birth and has simply internalized social norms and doesn't wish to conform to the social norms that match their sex would get their natural biological sex on the ID until they had bottom surgery at which point they could then change it. An \\"organ checklist\\" makes zero sense for an unconscious patient in need of emergency medicine. I can't go down the checklist with them can I? And I can't just rip off their pants or feel around down there to see what they have can I? No. I go buy their sex. Because sex is incredibly fucking important in the medical world because the bodies of males and females are fucking different. That why I had a patient almost go into a god damn coma from severe blood loss because Washington just let them say they were male and all I have to go off of when someone changes their secondary sex characteristics is the fucking ID they carry. This person was not born intersex. They did not have a medical history that showed any transition of any kind. He was wearing cloth binders on his chest to hide his breasts and was pretty god damn jacked. Looks like male. ID says male. Cool. Give him the thinners. Oh shit...BP is dropping crazy fast. Wtf happened? Oh shit there's blood pooling between his legs. Wtf? Oh shit get his pants off he must have an anal bleed or some kind of trauma down.....oh. Ooooooooooh it's a female. Well that would have been a contraindication for the dose of thinners we gave him.   You need to be more specific. What specifically is anti science?Saying sex has no importance is as anti-science as it gets. We are literally a sexually reproducing species who rely on opposite sexes coming together and engaging in the act of sex to continue on the species. We have natural differences between the sexes physically because, like most mammals, we are a sexually dimorphic species. There's a reason Serena Williams will never beat Nadal in 1v1 tennis. There's a reason why the fastest male athlete in the world will never lose a sprint to the fastest female athlete in the world. There's a reason the strongest female in the world will never come close to the strength of the strongest male in the world. Because of Sex. You saying gender matters more than sex is you saying that psychology and sociology, both soft sciences, is more scientific than the hard science of Biology. That's why it's anti-science. Biology is the study of natural life as it is. Psychology and sociology are focused on life 'as humans perceive it'. One is about objective reality. The other is about subjective interpretation. That's why psychology and sociology don't get included when talking about STEM. Because they're a half step away from being pseudo science like Astrology. Hell there's a good parallel right there. The modern concept of gender, compared to biological Sex, is similar to Astrology, compared to Astronomy. One is actual science. One is not.","title":"Republican introduces anti-transgender bathroom resolution at Capitol after first transgender woman elected to Congress"},{"text":"What is this cope?","title":"Donald Trump Has NOT Won a Majority of the Votes Cast for President"},{"text":"I see where you are coming from, but saying someone else did something bad, therefore I should be able to act poorly to is rejected by a lot of ethical frameworks, and for good reason.

There is a clear distinction: private property refers to assets like factories, land, and businesses that generate profit through the labor of others, whereas personal property includes things like your home, car or personal belongings. The key difference between private property and personal property is that private property is used explicitly to extract surplus value from workers' labor, while personal property is for individual use.This is a difference of scale, not a difference between categorically distinct types of property. A factory is a large-scale version of a home workshop and a farm growing cash crops is a large-scale version of the kitchen garden. The 'surplus value' you talk about is the synergistic result of economies of scale and it far from straightforward to break down into individual contributions. You are correct that agrarian society in late-medieval to early-modern England was particularly conducive to scaling, but scaling is a feature of all kinds of natural systems. Accordingly, your teleological account of private property as an intentional mechanism for owners to exploit workers is simplistic and mischaracterizes the growth and development of human societies and economies.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"The DNC is stuck in the 20th century with their $3B pop star budget.

Paying the penalty for E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault and defamation cases.\\n3. Inciting an insurrection\\n4. Promoting election fraud in Georgia\\n5. \\"Unindicted Co-Conspirator #1\\" in several other cases literally across the country\\n6. Committing election fraud in NY by way fraudulent activities intended to cover up a felony (I think I got that right-ish. It's not the crime, it's the numerous coverups which create the felony)\\n7. A subsection of #6 is that he/his legal team got busted trying to get Stormy Daniels to re-up her NDA in a less-than-legal way.\\n8.

What you *can* actually do is donate to local and national nonprofits like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), regularly call your elected representatives to tell them how you feel about various issues, work with local political orgs that pressure politicians into doing the right thing (the one where I grew up in Central Ohio is called B.R.E.A.D.; Building Responsibility, Ethics And Dignity) and attend their annual meetings (just a bunch of people in a giant auditorium to show the elected officials in attendance how many votes are at stake and gently pressure them to commit to reasonable policy goals surrounding things like publicly funded public transportation, free school lunches, addiction treatment services, low-cost housing initiatives, municipal ID initiatives, etc), volunteer with various get-out-the-vote initiatives for interim and annual local elections, etc.Make no mistake: being anxious and scared all the time because you're always doomscrolling doesn't help anyone.  You have to actually *do* stuff.  And trust me, something as simple as a monthly call to each of your elected representatives to say \\"Hey, just want you to know that as your constituent I support these initiatives and oppose those initiatives\\" can do a lot more than you might expect.","title":"Could Trump and his billionaire buddies turn America into an oligarchy?"},{"text":"Double duh.","title":"Democratic warnings about Trump were not simply campaign rhetoric"},{"text":"lol this rationale and mindset is why were in the situation to begin with.

I don't believe everyone is inherently entitled towards say, a resource, much less a productive asset, that was produced and purchased and is maintained by someone else. Does a farmer deprive his neighbor of his field by not letting him use it?This response to the claim that private property deprives people of access presumes that the property begins its existence as a privately-held asset. A field does not come into existence as privately-held property. Prior to its privation, a field simply exists, and anyone near the field can access it. So the privation of the field does precisely deprive people of access to it.Likewise, a river simply exists, and anyone can draw water from it. I purchase that river to charge a fee for water drawn from it. Water that was once freely available is now restricted. That's the *meaning* of privation. Private property would have no purpose or value if it did not deprive others of free access. **There is no privation without deprivation.** If you think otherwise, you're confused about the meaning of the word \\"private.\\"The possibility of private property depends on the existence of a state capable of enforcing private property rights, which is to say a state capable of enforcing *restrictions of access* as determined by property holders. Owning my car means nothing if anyone can take it for a drive at any time. Owning my phone means nothing if I can have no reasonable expectation that someone who takes it from me will be caught by police. So my property is only private insofar as the state will enforce my authority over it. Once again, the meaning of private property is *precisely* that its accessibility, usage and condition is determined by a private authority to the exclusion of all others, and the *public insitutions* of policing and law are necessary to guarantee this private authority. So private property is not at all a *natural* state of affairs, but an entirely conventional situation produced and maintained by the state. **There would be no private property without the state to guarantee it.** This is what distinguishes the private from the personal. Hunter-gatherer tribes distribute *personal* properties amongst their members despite no property being held *privately*: this is Harry's walking stick, that is Sally's fishing spear, over there is Megan's hut. If Harry started using Sally's fishing spear for a walking stick and sleeping in Megan's hut without asking, he would face social consequences. The tribe understands that certain items \\"belong\\" to certain people, but no one *owns* these items in the same way you and I own our cars or homes, because no one can fall back on the legal force of the state to enforce their sole authority over what is done with Megan's hut. Rather, what happens with the hut is determined by a thoroughly *social* process by the whole tribe. If it determines that it should belong to Sally and not Megan, then it belongs to Sally according to whatever parameters the tribe determines. At no point can Megan or Sally expect to be able to unilaterally contradict the will of the tribe to determine privately what happens to the hut, because there is no state to guarantee the private authority of individuals. Thus the distinction between property held personally or privately is a distinction in where the ultimate authority to determine what is done with a piece of property lies. As private property, that authority rests in a private individual. As merely personal property, that authority rests with the community.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Good ol Republican fascist party being fascists yet again.At this point I think they know exactly what they are and they are dumb enough and embolden enough and uneducated enough to speak their minds for all to hear","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene calls for a national divorce from Americans not on board with Trumps agenda"},{"text":"Looks like it is then.","title":"New York prosecutors say they will oppose dismissing Trumps hush money conviction"},{"text":"To be fair, if he had an *actual* judge in the classified documents case, he would be 100% under the jail right now.Aileen Cannon is the one you should be mad at.","title":"New York prosecutors say they will oppose dismissing Trumps hush money conviction"},{"text":"Or they are going to close ranks and bury anyone who doesn't march in step with them.
