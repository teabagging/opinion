Toxic positivity is also effectively weaponized against marginalized groups and used to deny their experience.  Toxic positivity (not positivity in general) does not make space for negative emotions, which are an essential part of the human experience.  Toxic positivity asks that negative emotions be suppressed or quickly changed rather than processed.  Suppression of emotions is not individually or socially health. [(Psychology Today: Suppressing Emotions.) ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/202212/suppressing-emotions-can-harm-you-heres-what-to-do)Processing negative emotions and being supported while doing so, strengthens relationships.   Many of the phrases that you have listed are not just \\"useless advice,\\" they are thoughtless words that imply to people that we do not see, recognize, or care about them. Toxic positivity is when after someone loses a child, someone else says \\"Look on the bright side, you can still have more.\\"  This is not merely annoying advice.  This is looking at someone who is sufferring loss, and telling them that their feelings are invalid, and that a child that they loved is easily replaceable.  Not only are the words discounting the sufferring of the mourner, they are also indicating that a person is easily replacable.  Toxic positivity invalidates the feelings of others and can cause disconnects in social groups and create more negativity overall. ([Perceived Emotion Invalidation predicts Daily Affect and Stressors)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9357853/)I also see toxic positivity weaponized against marginalized groups.   When people try to identify a very real issue, they are often told to look on the bright side, stop complaining, and smile more.  What's really often being said here is that your pain is making me uncomfortable, and I would really like for you to shut up about it. In no way am I arguing that toxic negativity is the better of the two.  I would argue that they both show an inability to process emotions in a healthy way and create isolation/destroy relationships.","title":"CMV: Toxic negativity is infinitely worse than toxic positivity."},{"text":"At least Manchin kept his seat to protect us from a worse fate","title":"47 demands Senate let him appoint cabinet nominees without a vote, bypassing confirmation process"},{"text":"Indoctrinated is what they are.","title":"They love to throw around the word uneducated."},{"text":"My educated friends are constantly asking me for a job and or reference","title":"They love to throw around the word uneducated."},{"text":"I couldn't remember where I knew him from.

This was thankfully replaced by birthing people / people who can give birth, which is actually better and less dehumanizing , but it all felt tone deaf. I get that trans men (edit: and non-binary people) also need abortion access, which they should absolutely have, but its not like these restrictions are independent of gender. They happen precisely because they target women and it was strange to insist that we not use the word woman during this time, as if that identity doesnt matter in this context.

There is also almost never liability on the sex worker for an outcome to the client.. whereas with a construction worker or a bartender their job can be lost or worse if they perform a skill wrong or serve incorrectly because they are regulated as a profession. While there are many different types of sex work, the baseline required skills for an in-person sex act is to have a body that one allows to be penetrated or provide some level of physical interaction with to get an end result of orgasm. You could say not every interaction ends in orgasm and not every live sex work involves physical sex, but that is generally the definition and the goal. Absent of a body being touched, it wouldnt typically qualify as in-person sex work, so the baseline is having a body. That same body cant call themselves a bartender or a construction worker simply by existing. In virtual sex work the transaction can often be the same. As a baseline there is an exchange for either viewing exposure or teasing. One could say virtual sex work could be compared to acting, and sure, if you are a good actor that is a skill, but then why not just get paid like an actor?.. probably not because what people are actually paying the premium for is not really acting ability, but rather the ultimate act that makes it a sexual video vrs something rated R with mature content.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"This will harm the party so bad it would probably cost them the next election as well.","title":"Muh Democratcy: Former Harris Aide Calls for Biden to Resign to Make Kamala President"},{"text":"And how many countrys are couped by the us thats not on this list?Sweden for example is doing everything the us asking for.Is it ok if we listen to all your internet traffic?

There's been a lot of people sitting on the sidelines due to getting priced out of houses due to the combination of high mortgage rates + high house prices (housing prices stagnated at the higher prices due to the extremely low supply of housing post rate increase). So if mortgage rates drop substantially again due to him forcing rate cuts, houses will get more affordable (for the short term) but will cause housing prices to climb again. With people getting locked into low rates, it artificially chokes housing supply because once rates go up, houses become much more unaffordable due to prices stagnating from the low supply. This is why houses now are roughly the same price at a 7% mortgage rate as they were at. 2-3%.

But it's equally poor feminism to claim it is inherently disempowering or *no one* can say they, personally, feel empowered doing sex work - which, yes, there are actual sex workers who personally find sex work to be empowering. Should feminism be about telling them they're actually wrong and are not allowed to find empowerment in that?Most forms of labor involve \\"selling our bodies\\" in one way or another. I've worked in physically demanding jobs like warehouse shipping and agriculture. Some of those jobs have permanently impacted my physical health for the worse. I almost died of carbon monoxide poisoning working at a coffee roastery. There are plenty of high risk jobs that millions of people do every day, some of which have very well documented high rates of physical and mental trauma, but we do not treat these jobs as especially dark, dangerous, flawed, or inherently \\"disempowering\\". You casually dismissed the risks of impact work can have on construction workers in one of your comments - these workers are at a higher risk of PTSD, depression, and anxiety than the general public, and is one of the professions with the highest rate of suicide. Why is sex work uniquely deserving of being treated as *categorically and inherently* dangerous, traumatizing, and without autonomy, even in the face of workers who will openly say they want to continue working, like doing their work, and just want actual protections so their work can be safer - compared to the other countless dangerous jobs people do, by choice or out of necessity?Are massage therapists exploited because they wouldn't go around giving massages to all of their customers if they weren't paid for it? Are OBGYNs sexually exploited when they touch or perform examinations of genitals/reproductive anatomy on patients who they wouldn't otherwise touch/see if not being paid to do it??In the same way that people may have found unhealthy coping mechanisms for PTSD, trying to own oneself sexually through economic means is similar in that regard. Consent cannot be garnered correctly wherein a transactional relationship is established.This is all work. There are many jobs I've done that I would not have done if I didn't need money. I'd gladly take back destroying my knee on a job, or the abusive bosses I've worked for, but the reality was I had to work because I have to pay money to have food, health care, clothes, and housing. No one should be forced into sex work, be made to feel it's their only option, be Unless you're willing to actually argue *any* work that is risky to people's mental or physical health is degrading, shouldn't be treated as a viable solution to making money, should not be embraced, shouldn't be treated as a reasonable job, etc, you're ultimately just creating a double standard and not actually taking the broad range of actual experiences, goals, and desires of sex workers seriously *or* the risks and traumas that countless workers in many other fields face.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"Trump is now in his \\"I am the senate\\" stage of things apparently.","title":"47 demands Senate let him appoint cabinet nominees without a vote, bypassing confirmation process"},{"text":"I disagree.

Just saying that to be clear about the point I'm trying to make. I don't agree when people try to present an idealized 'girlboss' view of sex work. However, I think sometimes that kind of rhetoric or adjacent rhetoric is employed to simply combat the very negative blanket statements people sometimes make about *all* of sex work. Which cannot be universally true if something else is sometimes true. I think they are trying to present an alternative way of conceptualizing what sex work is like for some people, and what sex work could be like if things improved. This is because anti-sex work views are often very dissonant from our understanding of work in general. For example-Are you considering sex work because you want to provide for yourself with means that are more easily accessible, as opposed to being rejected/unhappy in the normal corporate world?Is this a bad thing? Choosing a job out of comfort/convenience?That is not to say its abuse, or rape, but it is not normal relationship consent. It is not a hookup, or FWB, or relationship-established occurrence. It is the subjugation of one individual to service another. And regardless of what the subjugated party gains money or economic gain from it, it is still an entirely degrading act to force oneself into.That's just what work is. If you don't think the hinderance of ability to consent is so severe that it becomes rape, why is it still different enough that this is significantly different than other jobs? Can you not imagine a person for whom sex is not that emotional and they're willing to do it as a service? Why is it degrading any more than other work is also degrading? in a modern society, we shouldnt embrace the selling of ones body.So which type of revolutionary leftist theory to abolish work do you subscribe to?","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"They're telling her that they voted for both of them because they're \\"real\\".

The provider has the power typically and is exploiting the consumers need to collect a profit on the goods they have. Think Walmart and consumers. Workers are also exploited by the boss but at the very least, there is a theoretical possibility of a worker using the company to advance to a position that requires less effort for their earnings. In sex work the scenario is reversed. The buyer has the desired commodity, money, and holds all of the power. The provider begins their career with the maximum economic capital (being young) and can only decline in earning potential, with just a few exceptions. It's portrayed in a \\"girl boss\\" kind of light that implies that you will be empowered like a business owner when in reality any man with money is essentially the boss/business owner exploiting their worker. It isn't workers competing for the privilege of a job or consumers competing for the privilege of buying the product, it's the sex workers competing for the privilege of being given money by the Johns.

What would you think of a sex worker who only works on phone sex/sext services? Technically, there's no bodily involvement, only \\"mental\\" as you put it. What makes their work substantively different from, say, a customer service rep?Sex work certainly falls more into the \\"I am an object, not a mind\\" category of work that leaves people unhappy.2 problems here:1. You are dictating to people what makes them happy and thus removing their autonomy. How do you know that people suffer from this more than anyone else does from their jobs?\\n2. Again, where is the substantive difference between this and other types of work that could result in one feeling like an object? What about models? Assistants? Servers?The choice is valid, but it isn't goodGood is an entirely subjective assessment, and the moral value of sex work is very much predicated on judeochristian values. If people are going to cheat on their spouse, they will find a way to do it, sex worker or not. Is it ideal? No. But the blame is on the person who betrayed their partner.?It should be seen as something similar to bankruptcyWhat else should be seen as something similar to bankruptcy? Are stock brokers good? Debt collectors? For-profit prison operators? Lobbyists for the tobacco industry? Pharmaceutical sales reps pushing opioids? I'd argue that a lot of those jobs, which are/have been completely legitimate in most peoples' eyes, cause substantially more human suffering than the marriages that may be broken apart by a spouse willfully betraying their partner.This puts you on unsteady argumentative ground if you try to cherry-pick which jobs are okay and which aren't, especially if you're using indirect effects as evidence of whether something is \\"good\\" or not.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"The family conversation is that we're fucked, end of story.

Lots of people go into fields of work they regret or do long lasting harm to their bodies and even minds and we don't comment on those jobs or make posts about them.  Lots of the stigma about sex work is what makes the job harder for the sex workers.  Also in a society where sex work is legitimate and not judged by doing sex work, or even judged for using sex workers it would make people seeking intimacy or sex a lot easier and less frowned upon, which in turn I think would help curb this fast growing group of young incels who feel they are owed sex.

The Conservative party will have a lower floor in the Electoral College.- Ideologically, conservative parties are more willing to obey authority, and disparate and divided wings of the conservative party march in lockstep to advance each other's goals. Evangelicals do not mind if McConnell tells them to wait and be patient, and they'll soon get a court they want- Mechanically, it is easier to STOP legislation from passing, than it is to enact new legislation. This inherently favors Conservative ideologies and parties, as their ideology is far more composed of issues which they would prefer or can tolerate no change on. This happens because- - The Filibuster effectively makes the governing majority in the senate 60 votes. If you do not have 60 senators, you have a hung parliament, but conservatives can tolerate a hung parliament more than liberals can- - The President is elected separately from the legislature and has a veto power, this can conceivably halt a liberal congress dead in its tracks.- - The Legal Profession is naturally conservative which means the Judicial Review process inherently gives more power to cancel legislation (think CU striking the mccain feingold act) than to obligate it (think Brown or Obergefell obligating integration or recognition of marriage)Put simply this more or less requires bipartisanship to enact laws, but conservatives have less desire to enact laws. So by withholding bipartisanship completely, McConnell freezes the line and creates an attritional conflict which, over the long run, favors his party. Inevitably, an opportunity to appoint the court will come, and using the court has been their most powerful weapon.Liberals by contrast have a caucus that will grow much more restless if not acknowledged in legislation which is why so many liberal passed bills lately suffer from too many cooks spoiling the soup: everyone knows this is their only chance to get their special interest in, because the window to legislate is so small, and they *need to legislate* to win.All Mitch did was win a war of attrition where his side had institutional advantages.

I mean how much money are we willing to spend on combating the symptoms instead of the cause?But okay...let's say we do fix the actual source of the problem and start enforcing labor laws on the corporations. Well yeah food will become more expensive because the labor is more expensive. It would be disruptive for perhaps a long time. Staple food is an inelastic good...consumers can't simply stop eating when prices get higher. The demand curve is not as relevant here. There are a lot of reasons why farm work is nothing like the army or piggly wiggly or oil rig workers. 1) seasonal 2) zero growth opportunity 3) physically demanding 4) low paid 5) far from civilization. But those things almost don't even matter because there simply aren't enough legal citizens to work those jobs. But you're right, neither consumers nor retailers will tolerate $10 bread...which is why they will just buy bread from Mexico or somewhere else instead killing off the farming industry as a whole. I actually do think we should enforce labor laws for farm work...but we don't need to (and probably shouldn't) deport people. We should work to make the current workers legal and find ways to increase pay slowly to avoid shocks to they system. TBH, I'm not an expert here I don't know how to do this long term...but I do know that simply deporting people...even if we could do it magically, is not a solution.","title":"CMV: A pause on immigration should be wanted by the majority of the population and should be seen as an opportunity to create an actual Living Wage."},{"text":"Be best in windows 95 ms paint font?","title":"Melania Trump expected to skip Wednesday White House meeting with Jill Biden"},{"text":"Im saying that you cant assume that an error on one side of the spectrum is better than the other.

Such as a workplace? This is central to civil rights. An institution that tolerates racial harassment will naturally find itself excluding these groups, it essentially delegates the task to racist employees. Claiming non-discrimination afterwards when you allowed someone to be excluded for their skin color is ridiculous. Also stop claiming that protections from racial harassment, required by the civil rights act of 1964, somehow constitute special priviliges. We should also take steps to reduce effective discrimination that occurs naturally within an organization. Ie, a small company often recruits mostly from its own social network, which naturally creates a tendency for one ethnic group to dominate. This is fine because it's a small business - the rules and regulations around this don't reddit apply if you have under like 15 employees. But when a institution grows, it has an increasing responsibility to recruit broadly.  Race is a social construct, but biological sex is not. Policy must acknowledge that reality and uphold peoples basic freedom to live as they choose.I don't care what you believe. It's entirely orthogonal to the point. Should trans people receive reasonable accommodations where necessary, and should they be protected in places they have a right to be from sexual harassment? Whether the person who is sexually harassing a trans person honestly believes that trans people aren't real, or if they believe that sex is a complex phenomenon which contains within itself gender and sexual orientation - this is irrelevant. The behavior and harassment is all that is relevant. Making this about beliefs is absurd. Do institutions have the right to control for noxious behaviors or not?

The idea that God has it all under control and so there's no reason to take action is the major issue. Which is the truest issue with toxic positivity. It delays action, potentially even halting it altogether. Because in life most solutions come with cost. Replacing my car brakes needs money, seeing a specialist for my migraine's takes time, replacing my filter takes effort. Fixing climate change is going to require a change in the lifestyle many have become accustomed to. Toxic positivity says \\"everything's okay, so you don't need to pay the cost.\\"Which is what I'm alluding to. A young woman who is set to have an abortion because it is medically necessary will be scared and stressed and a toxicly positive idiot can convince them to stop thinking about the issue, all by simply convincing them there is no issue. It will all work out so it's not worth stressing about or taking action. You keep saying you can 'just ignore' the toxicly positive person, but you can also just ignore the toxicly negative one.

I'm not saying that those who engage in sex work are no longer deserving of rights or protections provided to all other people, but what I am saying is that the sex work industry does not see these women as people, and neither do their customers in most cases. In that way, they are, in a sense, selling their identity as human beings. Feminists like the idea of being the arbiters of sex, and in some ways women are exactly that, but what they fail to see, because they aren't men, is that men don't think the way they do.

Self-destruction and the destruction of others has already been discussed: Not all paths lead to success, some lead to destruction. Refusal to acknowledge that can cause just as much harm as negativity. More than ever in today's society we're encouraged to view the world in a negative and hopeless light.

In many ways it is mature, honest, and you don't sound self-righteous. So congrats for such a well rounded opinion.My view on sex work is that it lies in a grey area somewhere. Sex without love or connection isn't inherently bad, but because of sex's position in our collective psyche, it has a moral weight that can hardly be ignored.I've meet some guys at work that had relations with prostitutes. Usually, they were older, divorced or never married, and had a girl they contacted for sex. Usually, they stayed with the same girl, and this girl had a few regular clients. These guys explained to me that this transactional relation satisfied their sexual needs, without requiring the whole relationship shenanigans of marriage and common life. Living in a downtown area, I've also heard some prostitutes explain their work to me. They often have a limited clientel with whom they developped a relation of trust. The money allowed them to be independant, and they often had a part time job, often as a waitress, barmaid, and such for regular income.Personally, I find this to be a relatively positive type of sex work. Two parties gain from their transaction.Sadly, I understand this isn't the norm for many sex worker. Some are young and vulnerable when they are approached by pimps that Force them into the industry, while other sell their image and bodies to complete strangers to gain the highest possible materialistic comfort.For this reason, I'm ambiguous on this one, which probably aligns more with your point of view than it disagrees with, but I'd say that some instances of sex work are positive and mutually beneficial, and allows some woman to be liberated and independant in a way that some feminist would support.Yet, one would have to be a very naive feminist to believe all sex work is this way!","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"McConnell congratulating himself on being a master strategist is like Mussolini celebrating victory in Ethiopia.","title":"47 demands Senate let him appoint cabinet nominees without a vote, bypassing confirmation process"},{"text":"Generally people do attribute Beshear's success as Governor to him appearing authentic and competent to voters (at least that's how I've seen it described).

It doesn't mean accusing people or hurting people's feelings necessarily. But it does make it nearly impossible to decide on anything, since everything looks bad.1. More than ever in today's society we're encouraged to view the world in a negative and hopeless light.

From what I read it's not helping everybody but it's helping a lot of people who are part of this.I think when you say we are encourage to view the world in a negative light, you may mean in politics.

You've probably heard about the idea of \\"Renaissance men.\\" Men like Da Vinci who were simultaneously top of the fields of anatomy, science, art, engineering, etc. But as we as a society continued to grow, the body of knowledge grew too. For example, we learned much much more about the human body, to the point that you couldn't be a world-class medical expert while also having time to be an amazing artist and invent flying machines. These days, the body of medical knowledge has grown so much that doctors have developed extremely specific specialities - the doctor who treated your eye problems probably hasn't seen a kidney surgery since medical school, because there's just so much to know about eyes.Running governments or even specific subsets of government policy requires specialized knowledge too.Let's say you're appointed to the US-UK Relationship Committee. You'll need to very quickly learn British history, UK-US ongoing treaties, British government structure, the political nuances within that government (does the PM actually listen to the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Should the Shadow Foreign Secretary's policy paper about tariffs be taken seriously?). You'll also need to learn the ins-and-outs of whatever issues are being dealt with - the British want the US to buy semiconductors from their own partner, South Africa, but does that make sense for the US? So now your whole committee needs a full briefing on what semiconductors even are and why they're made where they are and what supply chain issues influence that production.And you can say oh the experts will educate the committee on all of this, but because it's impossible for these randomly selected people to know even 1% of what they're supposed to know, so they will get everything from this shadowy secondary group of experts. Which means that the experts can stand in front of them saying \\"Semiconductors are extremely easy and cheap to make, so we should recommend the establishment of semiconductor plants on the moon.\\" Effectively the government is actually being run by these secret entirely unelected experts rather than the randomly selected people in question.You also need someone to collate all of the committee results - let's say our UK-US committee agrees that semiconductors can be purchased more heavily in South Africa, while our entirely separate Advanced Tech Manufacturing committee says the opposite. And our China-US committee also wants more semiconductors. While our Environmental Protection committee says we should only source semiconductors made with a specific material. Now you need more committees or more experts to arbitrate.In our current system, obviously experts are still present but they are balanced by reporting to people who understand the basics and have a birds eye view, so they're better able to weigh expert opinions as well as take into account conflict between those opinions.","title":"CMV: Demarchy would be a better system than democracy"},{"text":"Its gotta really chap her ass to see this huge red wave and she lost yet again lol","title":"Democrat Ruben Gallego beats far-right Republican Kari Lake to win Arizona senate seat"},{"text":"  If the ARP is truly responsible for 3% of added US inflation, why would the US not peak higher than other OECD nations?Because they were far more affected by non-core inflation factors?

And I am reminded me of a story that happened recently with Musk's acquisition of twitter.   After he bought it he is in charge, but is he really?  One of the decisions he made as the new owner was to shut down a large data center.  So he told twitter managers to shut it down.  They said, \\"no, its impossible\\" when he pressed the issue, they insisted eventually saying that they could put a remediation plan in place and it would take 6 months.The point of the story is that that employees don't actually have to do what they are told.  Musk power over those twitter executives was theoretical.   Its only manifest if he can find a way to enforce his will, which he did by flying to the data center, and physically cutting cords with a knife. The chief problem is see with appointing people randomly, is I think a random person is very likely to get railroaded by the entrenched bureaucracy.  These government employees will remain employed from one administration to another, and will take action to further entrench themselves.  I think the randomly selected government will end up being nothing but a puppet.","title":"CMV: Demarchy would be a better system than democracy"},{"text":"As a general Gen X, WTAF??

When you consider manufacturing and industrial chains that go into building those power products, youd have to consider a lot of factors. On its face though, technically solar, wind, and geothermal are all cleaner, particularly in terms of operation alone. SMR tech and other kinds of newer, modern reactors may be able to be pretty efficient, and perhaps cleaner as well, but all that really depends on how good of a job we do with proper containment and disposal of the waste products. Thats the only problem we really cant circumvent. On the other hand, other sources like solar, wind, and hydro/geo can probably eventually be built in a way that has minimal environmental impact/cost, while promising totally clean energy production with no tricky waste products to deal with. That makes it hard to make the argument that nuclear power is truly the cleanest option. It needs to be made clear to people that it will be safe and environmentally sustainable, but we cant go around making claims like its the cleanest because thats really not true. It undermines the goal of seeing these technologies put to use by making an unrealistic claim, because people opposing it can point to that oversight as an example of why not to trust nuclear power.

Out of it flew all the evils, living winged creatures, thence they now circulate and do men injury day and night. One single evil had not yet escaped from the box, and by the will of Zeus Pandora closed the lid and it remained within. Now for ever man has the casket of happiness in his house and thinks he holds a great treasure; it is at his disposal, he stretches out his hand for it whenever he desires; for he does not know the box which Pandora brought was the casket of evil, and he believes the ill which remains within to be the greatest blessing,it is hope. Zeus did not wish man, however much he might be tormented by the other evils, to fling away his life, but to go on letting himself be tormented again and again.

I'd actually argue that talking about what is included in each service detracts from the point. I never looked at these numbers before today C it was just a logical assumption C but how exactly can you argue that the penalty enforcement system is more cost-efficient?no one goes to jail because they didn't pay the TV license. It's theoretically possible to go to jail for not paying a court issued fine but this happens astonishingly rarelyI know that Liz Truss shared some misinformation about it, but people are indeed put in custody (even if temporary, i.e., they're in jail, not prison) as a result of not paying. Sure, it's indirect, because technically it's their willing refusal to pay, but that's similar to saying no one died of COVID because they technically died of respiratory failure. That's a false cause fallacy and it's bordering on equivocation.Either way, my statement about the 60m being able to be put to better use isn't negated by that. The gist is that it's wasted money. Alternatively, you could frame this in a way favoring law enforcement, if you prefer:Police officers have more important things to do with their time than act as collections officers. or favoring the media as a service in general:This money could be used to fund projects that appeal to a wider audience.Because the license fee has existed since 1946 and the BBC remains an effective and well run media institution.Okay, but your entire argument in your original post hinges on the new media landscape, which has not existed since 1946. Paid streaming services have fundamentally altered the way that media is consumed and financed. Just because something has existed since 1946, that has no bearing on its prospective success.**Public funding is precisely what allows it to be an effective and well run media institution.** Netflix and the like operate on penetration/loss-leader pricing. They have to run on years of revenue loss so that they can \\"disrupt\\" the industry by undercutting existing systems. Then they replace (privatize) the service that already existed and once they have captive consumers, they increase their prices. The collective cost of streaming services now exceeds that of cable. A similar situation happened with Uber etc. as well (I think that particular situation may be different in the UK, but that's not the point).As I understand it, your argument would accelerate this change in media in the UK.Surely the fairest manner is to only charge the people that use it?Apart from my aforementioned argument about enforcement costs, **that's simply not how societies and public goods function**. Public goods do not operate in the same way that private, consumer goods do. Following this line of thinking would negate the purpose of any shared societal resource:* I should only pay for the parts of the road that I drive on\\n* I don't drive, so I shouldn't pay for roads at all\\n* I only drink bottled water, so I shouldn't pay for water sanitation\\n* I'll die before I reach retirement age, so I shouldn't contribute to the pension fundto name a few.I hope this demonstrates why I see this as egoistic and short-sighted.For simplicity of argument, let's isolate the problem to only be about news. I feel it's important to clarify, to understand what exactly the pain point is: **Do you agree that impartial, high-quality news is a public good?**If no, how exactly should this service be provided? Privatization leads to profit-chasing, which leads to sensationalism and polarization. In the age of misinformation, societies need a collective truth, and quality information is a public good.If yes, I truly do not understand the problem you would have with everyone sharing the costs of it. Perhaps the way I framed it wasn't optimal, either. To be clear, I am arguing purely from a conceptual standpoint, divorced from the precise projects being funded and payment structure. It could, e.g., be folded into existing tax structures instead of being a monthly fee, or it could take another form. As already mentioned, we could consider only news as the media in question for simplicity's sake, since I think that is the clearest case of the value of public media.","title":"CMV: Not paying the TV Licence fee is now a perfectly reasonable consumer choice (UK Post)"},{"text":"Probably more accurate to say they vote for or against *outcomes/cirumstances* rather than results. The distinction being results imply a much stronger causality. The distinction matters because:\\n* if voters can't discern causality (policy X led to Y improving to Y_1), then policy only matters insofar as it is sufficient to yield favorable outcomes in an absolute sense as judged by voters. \\n* if voters can be made to believe good outcomes are bad outcomes, then policy only matters insofar as it is sufficient to yield outcomes so favorable that propaganda has little chance of changing people's opinion of it. Point being voting based on outcomes renders policy moot in quite a few important contexts. Which isn't surprising because this is the same phenomenon that makes correlation not a good substitute for causality in terms of decision making. E.g. make a bad situation better to the best of your position's ability but not good in an absolute sense? They can't tell because the outcome is still bad which implies policy doesn't matter.","title":"Matthew Yglesias: A Common Sense Democrat manifesto - Not because its the only way to win but because its the BEST way to win in ways that can generate large majorities and effective governance that solves problems in durable ways."},{"text":"Its kinda simple.

I believe this article falls short in accurately and transparently addressing the gravity of the situation. Specifically, I am concerned by the reluctance to explicitly label the individuals displaying Nazi flags as Nazis or white supremacists. This incident is not only disturbing but warrants precise language. By failing to directly refer to the demonstrators as Nazis, the coverage potentially minimizes the dangerous ideology and history behind their actions. Clear, direct language is vital for responsible journalism, especially when covering hate groups.

To a certain extends politicians always stretch the truth, and to a certain extend, debate prep always tells you to ignore the question and say what you want to say, but it used to always be slightly tethered to reality.If we as voters decide to reward the politicians who promises us the magic wand, your own personal unicorn to cuddle with and a free dragon ride instead of costly airfare, that's a problem on its own. At that point, it really doesn't matter if Democrats are also able to find their own magical promises. Voting for magical free-floating solutions that won't happen because they can't because they literally don't exist is kinda pointless.So, to me the million dollar question is: How do we re-tether voting to reality? Trump literally had a free pass on his most outrageous things (\\"That's just how he speaks, he doesn't mean it\\") and simultaneously got to collect on a \\"concept of a plan\\" how to improve the voter's life. He failed to \\"Repeal &amp; Replace\\" Obamacare, or to let \\"Mexico pay for the wall\\", but somehow he is still perceived as the guy to \\"get things done\\".

Thank you for your thoughtful reply to my comment!I agree with a lot of what youve said, the only thing I have a comment on is you talking about how men are allowed to express sadness or loneliness due to lack of a relationship. While I certainly agree that there should *absolutely* be room for men to express sadness over lack of a relationship or loneliness, and I do not think its right to immediately jump to incel talk.However, thats not what is happening here. The 4B movement is a very small group of women compared to the general population, even just of left leaning women. OP isnt expressing sadness over feeling lonely, he is taking issue with a very small group of women choosing not to date.Maybe this has impacted his dating life, but even then I highly, highly doubt that this tiny group of women choosing to participate in this movement are the only ones in his community. While its ok to express loneliness in a general sense, where it crosses my line into entitlement of womens bodies is when you point to a specific woman, or a spesfic group of women, and say its their fault Im lonely!, and that is what I am seeing with this 4B movement.Overall its a very small number of women fully participating. And those that are participating its for their own safety and protection. So seeing men look at this tiny group of women trying to protect themselves, and taking it as a personal attack against their own dating lives. Especially when I see claims that itll hurt the left because a) they arent producing any left voting babies or b) they wont have sex with left leaning men, makes me realize how many men only have space for us in their lives and in their political party if we are willing to be sexually active with them, and that any small group of women who doesnt want to have sex or relationships are viewed as causing harm to themselves or others or even a whole political party.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

Essentially elevator pitch politics.\\n* Be a personality, preferably one that keeps ticking off the other side.\\n* Don't be seen as a politician, elite or established order.In short: most voters don't have the interest or attention span to keep up with politics, so the message needs to be short and something Average Joe can really connect with. It also requires someone like Bernie: someone who isn't seen as part of the established elite and knows how to drive home a message. Dems have a lot of good politicians, but those won't win the hearts of voters.The biggest issue the Dems seem to have, is that they always go for safe. People like Bernie are seen as way too radical and are shoved aside, while he's probably THE example of a candidate that could beat Trump at the polls convincingly.

If there's no demographic greater than 10% of voters that will accept a populist on the ticket, how the heck do you intend them to win a presidency? The DNC does not have the charisma to start a populist movement if they appear as the stereotypical liberal who doesnt care about peopleWhy do people keep confusing populism and charisma?  I would not really call Obama a populist, but he had charisma and won two elections fairly easily. Bernie wouldve easily won against Trump in both elections, is what Im saying.Bernie would have been annihilated in 2020.  Much of his base stopped approving of him.  Internationally he's a moderate labor candidate in an election that the ONLY labor issue that resonated with anyone was racists wanting to stop brown people from working.I'm sorry, but if you don't see how \\"alienate half of voters to make 10% of voters happy\\" is an ineffective way to win a presidency, I can't help you.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Dr. Jill Biden is smiling.Be best Melania.

Serious news sources are presented as equal as alternative ones on news agregator platforms, who appeal to alleged centrists, fed up with the left vs right rethoric.

At best, they may have watched the debate and part of the convention.  And the biggest news out of the convention was probably the protestors.People get their impression of \\"Democrats\\" from their everyday interactions.  And to the right and center, we are all \\"Democrats.\\"  They do not care that you claim to be \\"progressive,\\" or \\"Socialist,\\" or \\"Left.\\"  We are all the same.So when you look at for example, that Harris transgender prisoners ad. It's not about the prisoners.  The tag line is \\"Harris is for they/them.\\"  Because the thrust of the ad is not so much that gender reassignment surgery for prisoners is bad policy.  It's basically that left wing \\"wokeism\\" has gone amok.  The end is not \\"Check out this dumb ass policy,\\" or even \\"Harris likes transgender people\\"  The use of \\"they/them\\" there is deliberate.You only have to think back a couple of years where  everyone was adding their preferred pronouns to their social media profiles.  We all know a lot of people hated that shit.  It spawned a thousand lazy shitty jokes of \\"I identify as a watermelon\\" or whatnot.  I am not saying people should not have emphasized pronouns or whatever.  I think we should try to make the internet a safe space for trans people.  Just that we should be prepared to own what we do.The problem is that most of us online don't view ourselves as spokespeople for the DNC or any other group.  And the most actively online people are usually farther left than the mainstream and consider themselves \\"progressive\\" or just their own left wing thing rather than Democrats.So we are often just as willing to buy into right-wing FUD as Trump supporters are.  When they say \\"Democrats fucked up by doing X\\" people are like yeah, they sure did.  That is why it is so easy for them to divide and conquer.They take some of the worst takes and online excessive shit from anyone on the left, spin it in their favor, spit it back out, and half the left will agree with them.To me, the impression anyone objective would get from just cruising about online is that we do care a lot about pronouns, we do call Republicans bigots and racists constantly, reddit is a huge left wing echo chamber, and when we talk about comic issues, it's almost always from a Sociakist perspective where we attack people just fir being rich.  Like it's not \\"Elon Musk did a shitty thing.\\"  It's \\"Elon Musk is a billionaire so if course he is a shitty person who does shitty things.\\"The general reddit/internet left perspective is considerably farther left than middle America.  It's also not as unified as people think, it's just that they shut down any dissenting voices.  Don't get me wrong.  The right wing is no better.  That's the internet for you.  Everyone wants clicks and updates and ragebait works.  We don't have to get into why the internet can be bad, we all get it.But we are being incredibly delusional.  We have our own echo chambers, we spew tons of misinformation, we have a Bernie cult is honestly as scary as the worst of the Trump cult but no one says anything about them because they are on the same side, whereas any conservative not-particularly-Trumpy view will get down voted to hell.Internet left is not as that much different than internet right.  And internet left lost.  Even if you hate Harris and mainstream Democrats, you still lost.  You didn't even finish second.So yeah, the unpopularity of the \\"Democrat\\" message is really the unpopularity of the left on Social Media, not a speech Harris makes with Cheney.

Eventually, when a fascist movement runs out of external enemies, the leaders will look inward and declare certain group members to be enemies. The number of people considered to be Party members is quickly whittled down to only a core group, and then the movement implodes.You expressed doubt in the Leaders abilities? Enemy. You didnt stand when his anthem was played? Enemy. You didnt cheer as much as the guy next to you? Enemy. You didnt fly his flag outside your home during the prescribed time? Enemy. Your child says something in school that doesnt align to the Partys beliefs? Well, *someone* taught him to think for himself, and that person is now an enemy of the state; round up the parents.Having that enemy is always required for such movements becausewithout forced, brutal conformitythe People begin to focus on the leadership and what they *arent* providing (and theres *always* something not being done to the satisfaction of everyone because thats just the nature of any society; theres no such thing as a perfect government, and this is especially true in a society where nonconformist ideas arent allowed). This threatens the movement itself by opening minds to the possibility that others might be better suited for leadership.To be clear, this isnt restricted to fascist movements. I know we use that term as a catch-all these days (I do it, too), but Id argue that every *authoritarian* movement requires the constant purging of nonconformists from its ranks, and both history and current events agree.We need only look to Russia, North Korea, or Iran for proof; we dont even need Nazi Germany to prove this theory, although Nazi Germany is still an excellent example. First it was one class of Jewish people and the Nazis political opponents. Soon it was other groups who didnt fit into the Party. Finally, when all their external enemies were either locked up or had been murdered, they turned their attention inward (and, to be honest, they were doing this all along as well).This is why I believe a form of democracywith universal suffrageis the only long-term government that can survive (especially in the modern era). Sure, you can brutalize a population for a long, long time, but your authoritarian government will always be unstable; always one unforeseen event away from collapse. Democracy can deal with these collapses by not only anticipating them with rules written in stone, but by mandating that they happen at set intervals (elections) and ensuring that everyone agrees on the rules (i.e., mostly that everyone has a chance to govern every so often if they can win an election, so the focus becomes *politics*, not insurrection; its a peaceful form of war).I dont believe that the MAGA faithful value democracy. Their leader certainly does not. Although Ive disagreed with many leaders during my time on this Earth, this is really the first time weve had a *truly* anti-democratic movement (rather than one that merely *flirts* with authoritarianism) take power (twice), and i think version 2 is going to make version 1 look like a picnic.","title":"Biden wants Americans to \\"bring down the temperature\\"  but MAGA will not let that happen: In conversations with Republican voters, we learned why they shun unity"},{"text":"Its bodes very well for us in the coming years.

She wouldn't even have had to do it, just threaten it.  But she couldn't be bothered to even budge an inch toward that direction, instead sending ardent Zionists to the Rust Belt to scold voters who dared criticize our sainted Trump-loving genocidal fascist friend Bibi as he tries to get us to fight and fund a world war for the sake of avoiding his own corruption trial.  She wouldn't let a committed delegate of hers speak at the convention for 2 minutes to give a heavily-vetted and totally innocuous speech.If anyone had to try to explain why Harris seemingly chose to lose the election rather than even slightly inconveniencing Israel, there are only 4 things that come to mind:  stupidity/hubris, ideological rigidness, the party's wealthy donor class, or the pageantry of coddling the Honorable Joe Biden so that his ego wouldn't get bruised in between naps.And all four of these scream that Biden won't do a fucking thing to stop Bibi.  The lame duck period could last for 20 months instead of 2 and he still wouldn't.  The donors won't allow it.  Biden still thinks he is protecting the victimized Israel of the 1970's and not the rogue terrorist butcher-nation of today--a country that shoots and starves children as collective punishment and then calls them Hamas after they're found in mass graves.  On top of this, he has been a stubborn piece of garbage for his entire career, and he's not changing that with 2 months left.  On top of that, he's an outright racist when it comes to this issue (and other issues) and even if it were explained to him exactly what was happening--all of those clips of IDF soldiers gleefully stomping on food packages and riding the tricycles of children they just killed--he still would not be able to process why any Palestinian would harbor bad thoughts about Israelis or Jews, the good guys.  Ask him right now what Palestinian civilians should do, and if he isn't literally confused by the question, his first answer will be \\"the answer is not to commit terrorism!!!\\" and his second answer will be \\"Hamas treats its own people terribly, blame them,\\" and his third answer will be nothing, because every other thought is off the table for him.So Biden has as much of a chance of limiting Netanyahu in any way in the next 2 months as I have in doing so, since I'm 43,000,000th in the line of succession.","title":"Biden should use what remains of his presidency to act in the Middle East | Without domestic constraints, he is free to stop aligning US policy with the wishes of Benjamin Netanyahu"},{"text":"and the price of housing","title":"Harris did not lose because of young white men or immigration or wokeism.

Populists underperform in the DNC because the entire party is filled with educated and high income people who have a stake in the system staying the way it is. This brings me to the point that the *DNC will not survive at a national level if they do not adopt populist ideas*. That is to say, they will never get a majority in the house or senate, or the presidential ticket. You need to appeal to low educated and low income voters or else the country will literally elect an authoritarian. The DNC does not have the charisma to start a populist movement if they appear as the stereotypical liberal who doesnt care about people. The DNC doesnt have the conviction/character to actually have opinions on things which is what a populist movement requires.

The party absolutely had influence in 2016 as they do basically every election cycle. To say otherwise ignores multiple facets of the primary process. I'm not claiming it was rigged. I'm not claiming Bernie would have won. I'm just claiming the democratic establishment put their finger on the scale to influence the outcome.

Having a different world view around most American modern leftists invariably results in hysterical hateful attacksThere's so much wrong with what you just said here. First of all there's no such thing as leftist dogma. That's our problem. That's why we lose elections. We can't agree on anything as a group. We're constantly infighting.  We are a coalition of very disparate groups with completely different viewpoints. Republicans, by contrast, move in absolute lockstep. They are told what to think and they like it.   Take a step back and read through comments on this sub. Feel free to share ONE comment indicative of open minded reflection. Its a non stop hate fest on the American majority, calling them stupid and uninformedSo first of all, it's a statistical fact that the left is the American majority. It's very clearly a 60-40 split. That's why the right hasn't won a popular vote in decades until now when voter turnout is suddenly lower than it has been. Republicans know this perfectly well which is why they do everything they can to minimize voter turnout. If everyone shows up they lose every time. That's why they have to go through this whole pretend voter fraud nonsense. Your side is good at showing up at elections. My side is bad at showing up at elections. Therefore, making it as difficult or obnoxious as possible to vote is the rights only path to victory. No rational evaluation of the rights actions with regards to \\"voter fraud\\" could speak to any other reality. Are they really this obsessed with stopping the less than 500 invalid votes submitted per election? Especially when we're already detecting and stopping these votes with current anti-fraud measures.You have to abandon all intellectual honesty to somehow reach a conclusion other than the fact that the left is the majority and the right wins by suppressing legitimate votes.With regards to your second point, you're not entirely wrong. The factor that you seem oblivious to is that your comment is no less of a hate fest than the comments you're complaining about.  100% of the comments.  There's no evidence you possess you an open mind From anything you've written. In fact you are just spewing tired old rhetoric that we've all heard a million times. It wasn't true the first 999,9999 times it was said, and it's not true now. This sort of polarization, viewing politics as a team sport, is a problem on both sides. It doesn't mean that there aren't open-minded people on both sides just that they aren't the norm on either side. I would argue that they are far less common on the right. This is just the unfortunate state of politics at the moment. And if you want to blame someone, I would probably blame Rush Limbaugh for starting us down this path 30ish years ago.  As far as education, there is a difference between credentialism and educationCollege is a mix of both. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that everything that happens over the course of 4 years is education. Quite a bit of it is just testing your tolerance for bullshit.

Knowledge used for this OP view is with coming admin winner that cant run again.  \\nNext GOP wont have as easy a win, FL Gov Desantis found that out. Even with his far right policies he just isnt taken serious.GOP will have a hard time after this. Even in the first admin of the Orange, they only got tax for rich past with full congress for that first 2 years. Rest of that was in-fighting. Hoping this admin will be same, in-fighting with not much to show for it.Dems will have to watch how they do their primaries in the future. If Pete wins they dont have much recourse but to allow it. I wanted Pete to win back then. Part of the reason what happened currently is alot of complaining about there was no primaries and ppl got butt-hurt and apathy with the view to no vote as a stand.   \\nAnother is all the heard about free money to ppl (teachers, gov seats, basically everyone but common person not in those positions) that wasnt them and felt left out.Same happened in 2016 with the bernies and the email from dnc leaked with the dnc showing some questionable movement towards and against some candidates. Those voters hopped to 3rd party votes or just didnt vote.  \\nDems will have to play it straight with the primaries, this time and find a message that will ring to more ppl and not just teachers and gov seats. I would suggest they start taking up union ideas in a run to bring back not just higher min wage but how about breaks and lunches work. Many states, workers dont have any rights, can work 8+ hours without a break at...all and its legal. Same with need to guaranty min hours and health benefits not tied to hour status like pt/ft. Ya get the job, you get benefits, period.  \\nPpl need to pull out of the \\"small biz\\" heart strings, this is what big biz has been using as a shield to hide behind to dodge regulation. F the small biz, honestly! Congress can set rules for corp size for rules with all having to do min. This not doing anything needs to go.This will also depend on if the coming admin drags Pete through the mud on his progress for his current seat. If GOP thinks he will run and might have a shot, this will happen alot. Talking about any train wreck, bridge problem, etc. They will point to him on that when its further from the case.If he doesnt have a chance, I dont see it as being Gay, it would be from the coming admin dragging him through the mud on infrastructure collapsing and problems related to that. Never mind Orange's first admin, they removed checks and reg that helped to cause train wrecks, etc.Pete's best path is to channel Bernie policies on some level.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Nothing says DEI like promoting a minority cause shes a minority","title":"Former Harris staffer calls on Biden to resign, install Harris as first female president"},{"text":"Nah, the vote was fair.

But after the past week of agonizing over this latest defeat in part by reading/listening to late deciding swing State voters on their choice, the word that keeps coming up over and is \\"authenticity\\".  I think Harris ran a strong campaign, in that she nailed the \\"big moment\\" events we think of as, well, big moments.  She was disciplined.  The campaign worked to address what their polling was showing as voters concerns, whether that was getting to know her better, policy proposals, addressing past positions, etc.  And it seems like many had an at least somewhat positive impression of her, especially vs trump.  Seems like a formula for success!  And yet a hefty portion of these people still went for trump.  And yeah, \\"I think trump will be better for my finances\\" was a common assertion.  But I keep hearing the idea of \\"She sounds like a politician, and he's unfiltered/real\\" as a big point in his favor. I'm starting to wonder if the reality TV/podcast/YouTube type of content that dominates the viewing time of lots of voters - particularly younger voters - has kind of killed the appeal of a politician that comes off even slightly as a politician.  I mean, yeah, there's always been a bit of that.  The \\"I could have a beer with [insert politician here] thing isn't new.  But there didn't use to be such disgust or distrust of a politician for the sin of being a disciplined messenger.  For frankly acting professionally.  In an age where millions of people watch their favorite content creators way more than scripted entertainment, the \\"realness\\" of politicians seems to be more important than what they're saying to a significant segment of voters.I'm just starting to wonder if we need to rethink the communication and presentation skills that we should value for a national candidate.  I tend to think of Whitmer and Shapiro as strong candidates.  Newsom is popular within the party.  Beshear has a great record on paper.  And screw the haters, Harris did a great job with the hand she was dealt.  But they're all going to come off as \\"politicians\\" to these low engagement voters.

His big appeal would be the resume of a two term governor of a red State.  But even there, do we think the voters we need to win over are putting real value on experience?

Hmmm. Im looking at all the pictures of Donald Trump receiving NAACP awards in the 80s and 90s which they would totally do for someone that is known for their racism in the 1970s. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have been known for their ability to be purchased, but then youd accuse Trump of owning Black people. I also see him getting hugs and kisses from the women of The View as well including Whoopi before he became a politician, but obviously he bought them too. Your post incorrect x2.The SA case found Trump liable for the crime, not guilty. If he was convicted of rape in NY, hed have to report in as a sexual offender in every state - so your post is incorrect x3.The hold on Donald Trumps New York expansion is due to the garbage Judge Engorons ridiculous ruling which has already been ripped apart in questions from the NY Appeals Judges and will be overturned. Engoron will be censured and most likely disbarred. But it does give Liberals, like you, the ability to accuse DJT of crimes for the low/not informed person.

She believes that when the middle class is strong, America is strong.

VP Harris has made clear that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency. Thats why she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As President, she will fight to cut taxes for more than 100 million working and middle class Americans while lowering the costs of everyday needs like health care, housing, and groceries. She will bring together organized labor and workers, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and American companies to create good paying jobs, grow the economy, and ensure that America continues to lead the world.","title":"Kamala Harris ran the worst presidential campaign in modern American history"},{"text":"The entire war?

If this is an irreparable landslide, then what was Joe Biden winning by 7 million votes in 2020.If this is a referendum against the dems than surely 2020 was a referendum against maga, but maga just doubled down and won 4 years later largely on the same campaign they started with. So what happened? The answer that makes sense is that they messaged in better places. They marketed every flaw that Trump policy caused as if it were Joe Biden and they shamelessly did it from the moment Biden took office. We joke about how Jan 20th the second Trump is sworn in the economy that on January 19th they swear is shit, is gonna magically become the greatest ever, but it's true. They did it in 17, they did it in reverse in 21 where the second Biden took office they blamed everything on him, remember the COVID death count? Jan 20 they started asking Americans why Biden hadn't fixed COVID and pinned the millions of dead Americans on him less than an hour after he entered office without caring that it didn't make sense.They ran a 4 year smear campaign, false impeachment investigations that yielded no evidence but gave them headlines about looking for something that didn't exist, and they went where the people are to push that message. Democrats didn't play the game the same way, they went for traditional campaigning and that frankly didn't work in the digital age. Between the smear campaign and the lackluster ability to message a difference between Kamala and Biden, the campaign failed. Seriously, ask people on an individual basis about if they support some policies. Ask about tariffs by calling them foreign taxes and most Republicans will tell you they're bad. Ask about paid family leave raising the minimum wage, abortion access. Ask about housing policy, ask about foreign policy. Give them just the policy and 9/10 times people like the Dems policies better, just not the Democrats candidates because they wrap it up poorly when they're trying to sell it.Even in immigration. When you talk to people about Democrat plans for immigration reform vs Republican border security, most people agree with Dems, because their reform includes provisions for border security, but Republican plans don't include provisions for DACA. Or people who crossed legally and overstayed their welcome. You are losing it if you think otherwise.

If the powerful start eliminating the people who prop them up, as you can imagine it becomes inherently unsustainable. Fascism has two ways to refresh it's underclass to mitigate this: infinite conquest without ever losing as they stretch themselves increasingly thin over new territory, (thereby getting more people to exploit and eliminate) and shrinking the overclass, knocking people who were near the top lower on the pyramid (so there are fewer people to sustain and more people to do it, until the latter are eliminated again).The fall of fascism is inevitable given a long enough period of time.

America is not ready for a young gay man to run.Here's what I think you missed, an important difference with 2020: a meaningful Primary.In 2016, the DNC was very against Bernie Sanders and many argued in retrospect that the DNC would rather have Trump than Sanders.  They ran a flawed and unfair primary which had the very people who were supposed to be neutral, giving their full support and power to Hillary.In 2024, there was no meaningful primary and no one voted for Kamala.  Need I say more?2020 had a very well done Primary, the DNC enacted a lot of changes since 2016 to limit/prevent what they did with Hillary to happen again.  We saw candidates competing and we let the voters decide in a far more neutral space.  It allowed voters to see their voices heard on stage, one might think that debating pulls us all apart but it doesnt, it is a testing ground before going up against people from the \\"other party\\".  It's needed, and we have to get the skeletons out of the closet while we can rather than waiting until we go up against people that don't have the same values as other Democrats.Pete Buttigieg should be in the primary, if it is fairly run, then it will galvanize voters FAR MORE than pull us apart.  If he can win the primary, and other voters saw their voices heard, they will still show up because they believe that is was run fairly and they got to see the journey before the destination.An open, fairly won primary is the glue and motivation we have lacked this year.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Its gonna be a monarchy so technically we wont have to worry about an election anymore.

You need to **lead**. You see it often when the pay for politicians is a matter of discussion (easily clear six figure income for even moderately high up the chain). And Im not talking a small team of 8. A top politician from county level up becomes CEO levels of hierarchial oversight and that kind of responsibility and leadership does not befit every random person.I personally do not have that level of leadership training or experience. I was a team lead in retail overseeing a team of maybe a dozen or two people max but then switch careers into the more technical side of things. I think ineptitude and paralysis of government is bound to occur when selecting randomly. Consider a situation like covid, decisions made can affect the survival rate by 1% easily. Im not even saying that the US did well, but while these statistics look boring here with 1% swings, when brought to a country level we are talking tens of thousands of preventable deaths and its because you have a heroin addict at the helm. Or a fresh faced 18 year old with no experience, no leadership qualities completely out of their depth trying to steer dozens of people who do not respect them for being too young, inexperienced and incapable of leadership in even the most basic of sense.Another factor is that people's civic duty is weak as shit. Consider the popular opinion of jury duty, a basic tenet to allow for fair trials by your peers. And its looked at with complete and utter disdain. This is something that can at times just take a few days of your work life at max. You reckon people will muster the will and want to govern for X **years**?Most telling is that demarchy isnt practiced in strength anywhere in the world outside of smaller club houses or groups.As for your points1) Its not empty promises, its no promises, there is no guarantee ot proper leadership or even governance.2) Corruption would be easier btw as there is less repercussions long term (compared to career politicians). Already there is significant regulatory capture and for the average joe, it will be even easier to bribe them over since their equity should be lower than most current politicians.3) While populism wont be an issue, complete ineptitude would be. As in people who are completely out of their depth.4) Most people in politics groom themselves through decades of experience. Either businessmen - local council - further or Respectable job like lawyer, military, doctor whatever - climbing ranks of the party they support. All of them have experience up to that point leading, speaking, public works. They can all, in one way or another actually politician. You want people experienced in decision making. You are essentially hiring for a CEO position in terms of roles an responsibilities if not more and that is a high level executive role. Not for the average guy or gal. Next local election put yourself forward and compare yourself to the candidates in your local area. Youll be up against entrenched business owners who are tied deeply into the community.

What it misses though, is the following 2 years of data that we have now; that the US and other OECD nations peaked at roughly the same percentage, and the US fell much faster.

Letting the banks get away bailed out and with no serious consequences was the final straw. 2008 made it a blood feud and Obama got walked right into it by Reid and Pelosi, who basically knew their chickens were coming home. Remember, Obama wasn't one of them, he was the outsider with the surprise Iowa win, mostly just holding his own until Ted Kennedy, the last leader of the pre-shift Dems threw his support behind the kid. Obama's clean hands, powerful messaging, and McCains dirt won Obama that first election with what could best be described as a cynical skepticism, and the second doublecross of a shit ton of people losing their houses again, after having been warned by their previously laid-low parents they could never trust Ds. But the new generation basically don't have much of any memory of the causes, just the residual emotive energy of feeling sold out and up the river. Some people remember the charts of white Americans looking like they were doing substantially better than the rest of the country, not realizing that those numbers were skewed up by the small pack of millionaire and billionaire who were of course overwhelmingly caucasian. That's where the \\"culture war\\" started, where all the original anger was forged, and why it hit the fever pitch after the 08 bank and auto bailouts (they took our jobs AND you bailed them out too?) and how all these random talking points, irrational hate and distrust, deafness to postmodern outreach, the blind eye to Republican shenanigans that's turned into vocal endorsement to hurt the right ones, and that particular \\"unexplained\\" hatred of the OG establishment Ds (particularly Pelosi &amp; Schumer) still sticking around all tie together. So yes, amazingly complicated and crosslinked, with no real cultural memory left about how it all started, a few of the key culprits still around to invoke the irrational original anger, and not a lot of easy answers. Explaining how it all happened is damn near a book unto itself, and they don't care for or have time to listen to the party that sold them out, Even though most of the faces have changed And the renewed outreach has been genuine. FDRs original coalition was shattered, And all the working class people who used to stick together tenuously were divided. As demonstrated, it doesn't matter how big your plans are if nobody's willing to listen.This is also why Bernie Sanders was seen as the last hope at the end. Also an old style progressive who watched the liberals get seduced by money and who probably saw the Clinton upset coming before anyone else.

Because even if the voters don't know what exactly the RP's positions are here, they know what the RP says the DP positions are--and they're going to exact some penalty against the Dems for it.  And so how do Dem politicians respond to those attacks?  With a forceful defense of a maximalist position?

Ultimately, most groups decided it was not going to serve them in the long-term to force the Obama to publicly support something that only had a 30-40% approval rate back then when it was clear that he was privately for gay marriage. It ultimately paid off with a far friendlier Administration than the McCain one would have been and gay marriage being sanctified by the Supreme Court. As another example, [I don't think Hillary Clinton ever mentioned trans rights prior to 2016, but when she was Secretary of State, she quietly gave trans people access to easy passport gender changes.

See climate groups loudly and proudly bashing the Biden Administration even after he passed the world's largest climate bill because he had to deal with an energy crisis caused by Russia and Saudi Arabia, while giving small concessions to Democrats who serve in energy producing states. Biden is clearly for Climate Change action but also has to deal with the reality that most people don't care enough about the issue to have it affect their checkbook. He was never given that space to operate and in a sick joke, it just made him even more unpopular among people who actively hate climate change action and those who say it's their most important issue.\\nOr if we focus more locally, the top high schools in NYC are actually public schools where about half of the kids quality for free lunches.

Heres How Democrats Can Win Again."},{"text":"I dont think progressives are as susceptible to propaganda as conservatives.?From both a historical and a psychological perspective, I think this is entirely false. Humans are susceptible to propaganda. All of them. However, Progressives are not necessarily susceptible to the *same* propaganda. Propaganda is effective when it speaks to beliefs already held and builds on them. It is effective when it fits within existing views of social acceptability and core beliefs about how the world should work. The line between Propaganda and effective messaging is so incredibly thin as to be almost meaningless. Propaganda is usually just used as a pejorative word for effective messaging we don't like. But ultimately what Republican messaging excels at, and democratic messaging fails at, is appealing to the emotions. Progressives are just as emotional as conservatives. There is this entire veneer of \\"Intellectualism\\" spread over Democratic messaging that pretends like their voters are more informed, more rational, and make entirely reason based decisions. And on average, maybe. But that average isn't enough to win elections. Democrats desperately need to find messages that resonate emotionally. Because the Republicans have gone all in on fear, distrust, and anger, and those are very, very powerful emotions. They aren't very useful to actually running a government, so the democrats think they should be able to win by just having a better track record of running government. The problem is that is stupid. Because in America you don't actually have to do a good job once you win an election, you just need to convince people to vote for you one day every 2-6 years (Depending on your Office). And that gives you plenty of time to gaslight your way into it. Granted, the Republicans have a hard time as incumbents, because it is harder to convince people you are doing a good job when you are doing a bad job right now. But America has a short enough memory that enough voters immediately forget you did a bad job last time once you are out of office.","title":"President Biden Names Fifty-Sixth Round of Judicial Nominees"},{"text":"Step aside and give them more rope, I say.
