Wade and reproductive rights in a number of states.This was supposed to be the year that women ?[who for decades have voted at higher rates than men in presidential elections](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout#GGN)? could help break the ultimate glass ceiling by propelling a woman into the White House.Nope, I was wrong.Harris needed white women to secure a victory, and while she won the womens vote overall, more than half of white women backed Trump, compared to 45 percent for Harris,?[according to a CNN exit poll.](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0)?Thats consistent with Trumps performance among white women voters in 2020 in the match-up against Joe Biden, and in?[2016 election](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/)?when more white women voted for Trump than for?Hillary Clinton.I dont get it.

Bush in 2004.The Democrats bet big that abortion would get women and their allies out in droves, but it wasnt enough to counteract the enduring appeal of Trumps strong-man politics and resentment over high prices at the grocery store.Consider what happened in Arizona, Nevada, Missouri, and Montana, all states that had?[abortion measures](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/g-s1-32962/abortion-rights-amendments-2024-election)?on the ballot.

That means ideology and inflation shaped how people cast their ballots, more so than reproductive rights.Perhaps the biggest takeaway for presidential candidates: inflation is political kryptonite.I thought the abortion debate would drive a massive gender gap  not really. Harris didnt run up the score with women compared to Biden in 2020,?[according to preliminary analysis by the AP.](https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198)Meanwhile,?Trumps strategy of going after bros seemed born?out of desperation.

I'm not buying the attempt to kill him, atleast not within the narrative that \\"TPTB\\" want to assassinate Trump.The fact the bullet grazed his ear, coupled with perhaps one of the most impressive photo's taken of the decade, Trump raising his fist: the perspect illustration of \\"the people rising up and holding fast\\", it's almost comical.Was JFK part of the same club?Yes, and I don't know why it happened, there's probably some good, obscure, low budget documentary on youtube. Concidering the topic is so mainstream (it's one of the posters of \\"conspiracy\\", on a similar level as aliens), I doubt we'll ever get to the bottom of it.But I do agree: if JFK was in the club, why assassinate him? Even worse, if you concider the spiritual angle (God vs Lucifer/Satan), it makes absolutely no sense one of the illuminaties themselves would \\"take a hit\\" (quite litereally) for their greater cause. Their whole shtick is to trade eternal life for pleasures in this one, so almost by definition, they wouldn't trade their life for anything in the world. Their life is all they got...And yet he was in the club. I don't know how they did it, or what even happened. I can speculate within a wide spectrum, going from body doubles to even clones, to perhaps even the entire thing being staged.Whos to say Trump isnt also straying from agenda and TPTB want him offed like JFK?That's the problem, none of these politicians (not even JFK) have strayed that much from their agendas. Sure, they openly oppose some agendas, such a Trump openly opposing the woke ideology push.But that's what they do, and have been doing. They stay within these micro-systems of individual agendas: one is opposing the climate change agenda, the other the woke, the other transhumanist, etc...Yet none of these mainstream characters bring the whole thing together and call it for what it is. A spiritual war for humanities fate.This is being purposefully done to keep people's scope small, it's very comparable to when you say \\"Alex Jones\\", alot of people will respond: \\"They're making the frogs gay\\".And it's not AJ doesn't have a fair amount of points, it's that he intentionally keeps the scope so small. And when the scope does get big (such as with pizzagate), they completely omit any and all spiritual deception that's been happening.What do you think about the fact the same photographer that took the Bush reading to kids on 9/11 video being front and center with a shutter speed able to pick up the bullet as it passed?I mean, exactly, what are the odds?

The problem is that the people that watch MSNBC don't need the context, most of them already know it.But everything else, from ABC, CBS, NBC News, CNN, even NPR and PBS are all still doing the \\"both sides\\" thing. They report the talking point as if it is news. They will give credibility to something that is just objectively not true by reporting on it and then allowing it to be debated. They also frame what Trump says in ways he did not say it or just simply pretend he said something else that is coherent. That is all a massive problem.As for newspapers? Their relevance dips every single week as fewer and fewer people read them, and really read at all.

I thought it would be all settled at this point, but thanks to these morons who voted Trump back in, it's all back on the table.  After spending a day researching the history of all the ways the R's have tried to kill it over the last 14 years, this is my take.After many lawsuits over the years - including those pushed by Trump's team even though he lied about it during the campaign - their last try to knock it down through the courts was in 2021 and it got nowhere.  I think this avenue has dried up at this point.The other way is to repeal it through the legislature.  Even if the R's take the House, the problem for them is that such a repeal would take 60 votes in the Senate, which, even after this week's seat gains for them they still don't have (I think they'll have 54 or so).  So this means the only way they can really attack the ACA is through the \\"budget reconciliation\\" process which (as I understand it) allows certain bills out of the House to be passed by the Senate with a simple majority (51 votes) but only if they concern budgetary elements of a law.  So what they can do, and in fact what they *tried* to do back in 2017 - again, under Trump, who denied it later - is to basically cripple the program by pulling all the funding for premium support.  This would not have technically repealed it, but it would have sent the private insurance market into a \\"death spiral\\" that after a time would've had the same effect.  For some reason I don't quite understand, there were enough R's to block that vote in the Senate at the time (maybe there were still a few reasonable ones left then?)   If they tried again though, given the Maga mandate we see now, maybe they'd go ahead and pass it, which would basically be the end for me and many others because we'd essentially have no way to find (or afford) decent insurance in the private market.","title":"After Win, Trump Fans Admit Project 2025 Is the Agenda"},{"text":"I'm a white trans guy, and I think you hit the nail on the head here.

They used hate, fear, and guilt to try to force an outcome.  For American politics this is such a powerful slap in the face.  They lied, explicitly, in easy to verify ways, thinking they had a monopoly on the publics attention.  Their lies were so brazen that it was inevitable they'd be found out, it's literally things like cutting away half a sentence so that the meaning changes.  They ran identity based hate, accusing black men of being misogynist for not voting Kamala Harris.  They accused white women of being aggressively oppressed to the degree where the only reason they aren't voting Kamala is because their husbands would beat them.All of it portrays to this fantastical, reality free victim mindset that doesn't represent the vast majority of the public.  Most women don't consider themselves victims, of society, or the men in their lives, because most of them aren't.  I feel sympathy for those who are but your situation isn't the norm or the standard and if you think so, it's because you've been lied too.  If you think Trump hates black people, then you're in the same boat.  Trump doesn't give two shits about black people, or latinos, or white people, he clearly cares about money and winning, and while that's childish it's an easy read and the broad range of vaguely fascist propaganda reads on the state of the world that has become that standard in liberal echo chambers is so detached from reality it's literally offending any liberal who's there out of a sense of intellectualism, or because they believe in a thorough social safety net away, because it's so obviously about a religious fervor of \\"Were moral people, they're immoral, evil racist bigots\\" that's both detached from reality and the most ignorant brand of propaganda rabble rousing.You all collectively yawned when the Twitter files hit, but reality is that was a wake up call about how bad it's gotten.  This is barely short of the \\"ministry of truth\\" level bullshit and the explicitly lies, and frankly the bureaucratic stupidity that's creeping into more normal aspects of life, left no choice, to support the Democrats in this election would have been to support an attitude that the public is stupid and all they need is an identity politick message and they'll fall in line behind literally any agenda.  You lost because you backed power hungry, lying politicians as they said literally any immoral, racist, sexist bullshit that they thought would get them a little boost.

The Trump campaign's messaging has not been that they are strictly pro-life (though I think we all know that in reality they probably would vote that way) so voters feel like they can vote for Trump and for Abortion.National race messaging always plays a massive role in the outcome of local elections, even if it logically shouldn't.","title":"US pollsters taking heat C again C for failing to predict Trump triumph"},{"text":"Everyone's also conveniently memory-holed the fact that he kidnapped over 3,000-4,000 kids during the period when the family separation policy at the border was in place, and a third of them *still* have yet to be returned to their families.

So many are actually genuinely frightened as they have been indoctrinated about how this is Hitler and the Nazis 2.0. It's why there's been multiple attempts on his life. It's really sad how the globalists have lied, spun and smeared at every opportunity, to protect their own interests and pursue their twisted goals.Anyone who has read George Orwells 1984 will see there's a massive similarity. The character Emmanual Goldstein literally could be Trump. In the story, the people were told (indoctrinated) that this character was the enemy of the state and evil, and they were genuinely petrified of him. The reality was all Goldstein wanted to do was to save the people and take down the big brother state, so everyone had freedom and liberty. Trump never had to do any of this. He gains nothing except lawsuits, constant attacks, threats, hate, deformation of his character and losing a ton of money.Glad you guys made the right choice. I watched the whole election through the night and early hours of the morning here in the UK, and I haven't stopped smiling since. The whole of the western world is under attack. It's all constructed and diliberate. All of our countries in Europe are actually very different, yet we are all experiencing exactly the same issues and problems, and it's absolutely no coincidence.Even here in the UK, we are bombarded with anti Trump media and a very strong 1-sided narrative 24/7. Some here are genuinely very worried, but it is due to the indoctrination. It's scary that this is where we are in 2024. When you talk to these people, they are filled with rage and hate, but it's all empty soundbites and rhetoric with no actual substance. Goebbels, an actual real Nazi, could only dream of this level of propoganda we are subjected to.I'm disabled and actually got kicked out of a disability group I was part of because they were talking about how if Trump got in he is going to round up all the disabled and put them in concentration camps. I couldn't not speak up. It's pure insanity. These kind of people talk about fascism but actively engage in it.Nigel Farage and Reform are our last hope here. He's demonised daily and is constantly attacked for being Donald Trumps friend, along with talking about how immigration is impacting the country economically and socially.Anyway, here's to 'Garbage' 2024 prevailing! ??","title":"We have already had 4 years of Trump, so why are the liberals acting like this time is the end of the world, when last time all of their lives were markedly made better?"},{"text":"They probably do, though.","title":"The liberal tears are incredible"},{"text":"https://x.com/Kimberl82111287/status/1854189480082616527","title":"Are these celebrities gonna leave the US like they said before?"},{"text":"Not only the media but the consumer of the media to believe everything he/she is told.","title":"Trumps return to power raises serious questions about the medias credibility"},{"text":"but the two digits of 11 can be added together.

The truth is, the cancer was merely too widespread. Stage 4. You can see that by how even the polls in the last month couldn't see what was happening. Regardless of which candidate had run, and what campaign strategies they used, Trump and his surrogates would have created a different fictional narrative to defeat them. They thoroughly implemented the fascist playbook of propaganda and lies, by instilling fear, inciting anger, creating mistrust, and sowing confusion.Think of it like this. If you go into a business meeting where you get to pitch your ideas to a client. And your opponent in the same meeting lies, lies, lies, you can't beat them if they are an effective liar, and the client doesn't believe that they're being lied to.And that's the sad fact. Sure. Some people who voted for Trump knows what he is. But Republicans worked for decades to teach Americans to mistrust experts, mistrust the media, and don't believe anything Democrats say. That affected tens of millions of other voters. Including those who didn't even vote.So you want to lay blame?

The DNC is beholden to no one, and parties aren't regulated by the constitution or anything. The only way they change them is by regular voters starving them of money, openly and loudly decrying their choices, and not voting for their candidates. No one can say for sure if Bernie could've won in 2016, but Hillary never had a shot and anyone on the street knew it.

It's like they were all promised land in Cuba when the US finally takes over Cuba or something.From my extremely limited experience, I had a high school teacher whose family fled Cuba during the revolution and lost their property as a result. They were a White Ethnicity Cuban. They were the Democratic history teacher.I really wonder what their opinions are now. I feel like just with any displaced population that lost their property they really deep down want that property back. I think Cubans more so since they have been an enemy of the US for so long and these people have been here for 2-5 generations now. Republicans are bullish towards Cuba and perhaps they do believe they will be able to get their property back or something.Or is it Latino Americans generally that are trending Republican? Florida Cubans were certainly the first group that jumped on board that train.Latino Women are still Democratic compared to White Women who are solidly in the middle.  But Latin Men are almost a core block of Republican support, if a Woman is on the top of the Democratic Ticket. So what is it that Democrats offer with a man on the top of the ticket compared to a woman? Democrats need to ask Latino men this directly. I almost feel like Kamala Harris should still be out there doing town halls with white women and Latino men to find out what their beef is.But Florida is lost, unless the Democrats just flip and become bullish on Cuba too. Democrats got ahead of themselves by trying to end the embargo during the Obama years. If Democrats want to have any chance in Florida they have to offer something to the Florida Cubans in regards to Cuba. I don't know exactly what it is that the Florida GOP offers but the Democrats just need to be bullish on Cuba now. They need to be more bullish on immigration in general. It isn't a winning battle to try to solve immigration the Bush way at they have been. The Republicans basically want the states to have control of the immigration at the border, and effectively border security itself. So what is the alternative that Democrats can offer that isn't that or closing the border? Or should the Democrats just offer that. To stop immigration temporarily until the Congress can pass reform.","title":"Trump Just Became the First GOP Presidential Candidate to Win Miami-Dade Since '88"},{"text":"Why not?

By the time we're done counting, we're going to have much closer vote counts to 2020. I'd assume Trump around 76-77 million and Kamala around 73 million.

Moreover, if she had maintained Bidens vote count in swing states she would've lost most states even harder with the exception of maybe flipping Michigan and Pennsylvania being closer than it was. These appear to be the only states with a genuine argument for apathy/protest votes.The turn out is NOT lower where it actually matters. The news articles that said swing states had record turn out were genuinely correct, you were just wrong for thinking it was democrats and not republicans.

The Democrats after all, fought the Civil War to keep your slaves, created the KKK to terrorize Black people and anyone who supported them. Voted unanimously to not give Black people the right to vote, etc. In the 1960s, LBJ signed the welfare act after having it amended so that a household would be penalized if they were two parents in the household, thus rewarding black women for having more children and no husband in the house. And then began spinning the signing of this act as the Democrat Democrats being the saviors/supporters of Black people and minorities all throughout America.

If its not for you, I hope youll take into consideration the spirit in which it is offered to you and not be offended. I definitely mean well. ??Regardless of your belief system or lack of one, the Bible has a lot of passages that are just great practical life advice, too. Im specifically talking here about being unevenly yoked. In context, as it sits in the chapter, the verse is advising people that a believer shouldnt be married to a non-believer, because it causes extra strife in the household that could be insurmountable. (Marriage is already hard enough as it is, ammirite?) But you can apply to other situations, as well. The trick (this can save you a WAD of trouble later on) is being evenly-yoked, meaning equals bound together and both pulling as hard as you can in the same direction. That is hard to do that when you and your partner are diametrically opposed, and the same is true in other relationships, such as business partnerships, political affiliations, work groups, financial matters, etc. It is better to be involved with someone that you agree with on the BIG THINGS; the little things will work themselves out with a little grace and some give-and-take.ps Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.Trumps blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.There is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. With the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. The ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. Your family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.Democratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.","title":"Donald Trump protests break out in several cities: \\"Fascist clown\\""},{"text":"Im a legal immigrant.

I recently found out that a colleague, a black middle-aged woman, mother of 5 children, is a huge Trumper when we organized a trip to vote together with the students.  My ed team and other staff in the deans office also dissuaded the students from voting, almost preventing them from leaving the building.  They insisted on them having chaperones, which they didnt require, at all.  The 20something staff were so disaffected when I sent them to do one thing: take the students and help them to vote, they decided, instead to order pizza and bring it back to the building to eat it when the pizza place was actually closer to the voting place and they could have resumed the line to vote following their meal. It was across the street. They were totally consumed with eating, stayed in the cafeteria for two hours missing their opportunity to vote, and it was astonishing what poor example they set. Its weird and wild how idk what to call it-not entirely lazy but like crazy and lazy and stupid all at once they often are regarding teaching students civic engagement.The following day, I insisted they try again but sent someone else to vote with them (a retiree aged staffer and a 30 something staffer) because the younger staff couldnt manage to wait in line. Additionally, the behavior team had a strange group of middle-aged black men who were both sides-ing the kids upon their departure. So wild, too and astonishing because normally they cannot wait for us to leave on school field trips.  They were going back and forth with me on the walkie, insisting the students dont know what to do have no direction by the school counselor, also a bizarre bully of a person, Jewish decent, mid twenties, and the behavior management team as well as security(Security mind you is a retiree, a woman.) I just said very loudly and calmly,*THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO* One of the subs asked who would go, and I responded, YOU ARE GOING and bless his heart he said roger THATHad I gone on this outing, I would have never made it out of the building with my students, at all due to the anti education rhetoric many at my school espouses, weird qanon conspiracies and blatant misogyny and racism under the guise of improving the economy. My boss and his boss are not this way, but a fair amount of people in the building are. They also bizarrely couldnt manage to pick up pizzas that they ordered from across the street, asking an old man, a sub to walk to the restaurant and carry their food back to our building. Im just so sickened and baffled at so many people that just think that the economy (Goofy they think Trump will save it as well, because he fucked up the economy his first term.) is more important than anything else, even democracy, even basic human rights.Just to clarify, my students are legal adults and have full cognitive abilities, just some mental health issues.  I obliged, but even then they made it so difficult that two of my students just didnt vote after being excited to initially for the first time.

Hell, even many staunch democrats were willing to continue funding genocide if it meant getting a specific policy they personally benefited from.Yes, I realize the economy may technically be numerically better as a whole, but most of this only served to benefit the Bezoses of the world. So many people are actually struggling even more to pay higher prices on basic needs like rent and food.

Problems get solved through understanding and empathy, but the understanding and empathy have to first be for ourselves before we can extend it to everyone else. And of course, understanding and empathy in this world are often mistaken for excusing and justifying bad behavior, so we avoid it most of the time. Once I developed compassion for myself, I stopped getting angry at other people because I didnt need a scapegoat to take the pressure off of myself anymore.","title":"Can anyone explain to me why liberals are claiming trump will take away basic human rights?"},{"text":"Also the wrong side of tiktok like my daughter.","title":"I voted Trump and I'm receiving so much backlash."},{"text":"Again, no they're not.

Those are the behaviors of good citizens who are getting involved. They are doing FAR more than your average citizen is doing, and they should be commended for it. Also, just a side note, while many express their personal support for Harris, or whoever, most of them encourage people to simply vote, while they show their support for their preferred candidate.

The problem, insofar as it exists, is that there are people and lawyers who make a living out of being ADA gadflies.     They find a business that has defects, make an intentional scene, and then file a lawsuit against the business for violating the ada.   The cost of defense litigation and the possibility of attorney's fees means that they can usually extract a quick settlement.   The insurance company pays out 10 or 15 grand, the lawyer collects half of it, and the insurance company tells the business to fix the problem. I know that these cases exist because I've been a defense counsel on these cases. I don't think they are terribly common in the grand scheme of things.   The bill was a pretty extreme solution but I don't think that requiring some level of good faith effort to notify a business and seek an accommodation before filing a lawsuit is inherently unreasonable, much the same way that there is a procedure requirement of notifying the EEOC and getting a right to sue letter before filing a case of employment discrimination.","title":"After Win, Trump Fans Admit Project 2025 Is the Agenda"},{"text":"I feel bad for you.","title":"Just Stop Oil sprays orange paint on US embassy after Trump wins election"},{"text":"Interesting take, and I am sure the inherent design of reddit to create echo chambers probably exacerbates that hive mind in young people.

This varies and doesn't have to be one way at all costs.In the end the goal still is communism, but that should not be seen as something coming in a few decades...

Ironically, with all the talk that dems are against freedom of speech, this is the ultimate manifestion of that train of thought. Dems need to realize that some positions must be held aggressively. Sometimes, decisive action must be taken. Not every decision needs consensus to be valid or moral. It is a hard thing to say since to the wrong person, this train of thought can lead to authoritarianism, so it must be done with extreme caution.
