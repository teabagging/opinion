In some sense Mcbride represents all gender non-conforming people by being so prominent. It shouldn't have to be that way but it is. She will define what trans people are like to many people.

Governments react (incorrectly) by transferring wealth from the rich to the poor-- however those actions only further strengthen monopolies because it decreases entrepreneurship  by taking wealth from the well to do-- this eventually leads to socialism where large swaths of the population become dependent on government hand outs , and with fewer businesses that means fewer jobs - resulting in a permanent underclass The creation of a permanent underclass eventually leads to communism as the underclass starts to revolt and demand that all wealth be redistributed....which through out history has always leads to the destruction of the economy and the country.Long story short-  government involvement in capitalism leads to socialism which leads to communism  and the eventual destruction of the standard of living of every one involved.- As Vladimir Lenin once said, The goal of socialism is communism.","title":"CMV: Capitalism is one of the worst models for humanity to follow."},{"text":"Kamala raised 1 billion, still they didn't win.

I'm going to say outright that I hope folks here don't see this as just me engaging in circular firing squads, but genuine concern for this strategy. In 2016, when N.C. Republicans put in place bathroom restrictions, the response was immediate and severe. Boycotts, political recriminations and general resistance at all levels forced a partial repeal a year later. [Sarah herself took a selfie in a N.C. bathroom to make a point.](https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/ntqgaftgxnurppxqykuaav955xolgaygvobyxwnk7uyimrs74gngndcndleg7p24.jpg?w=824&amp;h=429&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;dpr=2) It took another five years for the next state to try it, and since then there hasn't been the same outcry or condemnation. My own state of Ohio is just had a bill restricting bathroom usage for public schools, including universities.Polling as well shows a dead heat between support and opposition for such restrictions.  Things have changed, and with sports and gender affirming care for trans youth bans likely to be coming down without much chance of failure, bathrooms and public facilities are likely the next target. Which brings us to Sarah's response to House Republicans. She has stated she will accept Johnson's rules, and crucially, that this issue is a distraction. I understand the point of this, setting aside my own feelings that public facility accommodation doesn't fall under what Mcbride describes as \\"real issues,\\" the fact is public sentiment has changed and coming off as a trans crusader is politically dangerous. But ceding ground on the issue won't prevent conservatives from drumming up support for such restrictions federally, and given the success they have had in controlling the narrative on trans issues, letting them have control over it completely won't work. Voters are already unlikely to punish them for this, and that will get worse once ads start playing. In essence it means you have to hope that voters get tired of what they see as overreach, but that hasn't played out in pretty much any context. Voter's didn't punish republicans for Dobbs in 2024, and for an example that's directly about trans issues, in the U.K. where this discussion happened a few years ago the result was overwhelmingly to abandon trans causes in general. Now even the Labour party supports restrictions on public facilities!Look once again I'm not asking Sarah to get arrested, that's unreasonable as hell. But whether she wishes for it to be so or not she is the first trans representative and member of Congress. She possesses the highest elected office a trans person has every achieved, and what she does will effect how future campaigns play out. However much praise she may receive from moderates for taking the \\"high road\\", it won't change the narratives at play, nor stop Republicans from viewing this as a winning issue. I don't see how a statement like she puts out changes it.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://www.270towin.com/maps/bRgO6.png","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/k7p9jmw7a72e1.jpeg?width=1213&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52b8126ea268b61eca0b8062155801415c97b63me tipping the mods","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Still proud to be a coastal elitist","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Sad the DT is in the 2010s-2020s yall wouldve loved Victorian era aristocracies","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Valid criticism.

The first attempt to block the sales was rejected overwhelmingly, and two more efforts also went down to defeat. Sanders, in making the case for stopping the sales, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged an all-out war against the Palestinian people.I mean, Bernie's got heart and I admire the fact that he's stuck to his principles for nearly fifty yearswhich is probably why America doesn't deserve himbut a bill like this was a non starter. He probably knows that too. So, instead, we've got senators on record who have shown that they're uncompromising when it comes to the U.S's involvement in this conflict.I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less. BUT, that doesn't mean I have to take an indiscriminate stance on this war. It doesn't mean I have to be unflinching and \\"pick a side.\\"Instead, I've chosen to try and understand this war from multiple historical perspectives. I've chosen to have have a more nuanced understanding of this conflict. . Even as a Jew, I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as \\"Zionism out of despair\\" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu's coalition of far right jingoists. Bibi has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, and his coalition has demonstrated that their political careers and their grip on power rests entirely on sustaining this conflict for as long as possible. While Hamas and the so called \\"axis of resistance\\" have been uncontestably violent, equally as obstinate and certainly share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict that has cost countless lives.My hope has been that others, especially our Representatives, take a more flexible stance on this war, that they understand it's complicated history, adopt a more nuanced perspective, and don't simply toe the party line or maintain some pigheaded position because it's what's in the best interests of *their* careersUnfortunately, I think this is too much to ask. Both Israelis in Palestinians have suffered at the hands of the other throughout this conflict, it's not black and white, cut and dry, and yes, it should be noted that Palestinians have suffered disproportionately since these two national identities began fighting over land.You're not a terrorist sympathizer for understanding that Palestinians have been continuously dispossessed of their land ever since Jewish settlers began evicting tenant farmers and buying land once reserved for Palestinians from absentee landlords in the early 20th century.It makes me uneasy to think about the fact that if I were to step foot in Israel for the first time in my life, I would have more rights and privileges than many Palestinians who have been living there for generations. However, this doesn't mean I naturally support the extreme, violent responses from Arab groups and Palestinians over the years, but I can at least recognize that this isn't some holy war between the forces of good and evil, or even a one-sided conflict.It's complicated. Did you know that there are a surprising amount of Palestinian Christians living in the middle east? Hell, there are even Palestinian Jews!It should also be noted that not all Israelis are extreme right, religious Zionists or advocates for genocide. The same goes for those who tend to support Israel too.So yah, it's complicated. Take for instance the fact that the closest Israelis and Palestinians came to establishing some measure of peace within recent history, was when prime minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat shook hands during the Oslo Accords negotiations.However, Rabin was later assassinated, and not at the hands of a Palestinian, but a far right Israeli extremist. Some even blame Netanyahu and his allies at the time, for inciting some of the violence that led to the attack.That should have been the end of Bibi's career. But he eventually made a comeback after multiple deadly attacks carried out by Palestinian militant groups allowed Netanyahu to position himself as Israel's protector.Ever since, Netanyahu has been able to maintain his position of authority by playing the central role of a strongman leader, using conflict as a means to stay in power.Just like it's becoming harder and harder for Israelis and Palestinians to settle their differences, it's also becoming more challenging for Americans to find common ground on this contentious topic.","title":"Senate rejects effort from Bernie Sanders to block some weapons for Israel over Gaza deaths"},{"text":"Yeah its called the DT ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/b28gsebq872e1.jpeg?width=980&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83debc6ca255d1eae142ed98a85e96c95ada8cd4","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Depends on how you define heavy with Latinos.

At the start of the invasion, in March 2022, Deutsche Welle found no evidence to support the accusation. In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that Russia had used \\"at least seven types of antipersonnel mines in at least four regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Sumy\\", but could not ascertain PFM-1 use in its briefing.And that's bizarre, because I've personally seen more than a few publicly available videos of Ukrainian sappers 'disarming' petal mines by hitting them with long sticks during the course of the invasion.Also - hilariously - one influential visiting Russian war-blogger stepped on one right after his arrival in one of the occupied territories and had to be carted off with most of one foot missing.

Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Warren never stood a chance.Yes, the question was about how much the black vote would stay with him.  If he only gets a relative plurality and either Pete or Amy pick up gains from his following that signals maybe they can gain more in later races.They stayed in the race and ate up precious debate time so that Biden couldn't make his usual gaffes or reveal that he's not as progressive as people believed, which people only thought because of the media and the other nonviable moderates muddying the waters.Bernie isn't some great debater either, so maybe they were protecting him from making his out of touch gaffes (l.  Biden never attempted to portray himself as being the progressive choice so that wouldn't protect him from him as he wasn't even attempting to do that.Doubt it. None of the states besides SC wanted Biden and he would have lost before SC in a limited primary. Polls also showed Bernie being the second choice of many of their supporters, which isn't surprising when people thought Buttigieg was a progressive.Yes, Biden didn't perform well in lily white Iowa and New Hampshire however still performed well in the initial Nevada results even with the moderate wing split.  The polls were clearly wrong seeing how when those candidates dropped their support almost uniformly went to Biden over Bernie.There was 7 before SC and 5 on ST, which is unusual when looking at historical primaries. It usually gets winnowed to 2 or 3 after a state or two.I guess I forgot about the non-factor Tulsi.  The 2004 New Hampshire Primary occured on January 27.  There were seven candidates that stayed after New Hampshire primary.  For the mini-Tuesday,  you still those seven candidates with only gradually dropping out shortly afterwards and around the time of Super Tuesday.Buttigeg and Klobuchar never stood a chance in SC. If Biden lost support there, most of it would go to Sanders because voters wanted a candidate that could beat Trump. That's why Bernie was the top second choice of Biden supporters.The point was to see how strong Biden was with the black vote and to see if they could win any of them over.She absolutely did and signed an agreement that gave Hillary defacto control over many of the DNC's functions, like choosing who is hired. This is extremely unusual and only comes into effect after a candidate is nominated. The agreement explicitedly was for the general election.  It literally was both public record and said \\"nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process\\" and that \\"all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary.\\"  Brazile was trying to sell her book by playing it up.Why would Sanders criticize caucuses when it's what their states want? It's literally their choice.The same is true for states deciding they wanted a closed primary, but he, his campaign, and his supporters couldn't shut up with their whining about how that was unfair.  Bernie didn't care about the system keeping poor people from voting when it benefited him, but if his college student base had their vote limited because registering as a Democrat was too much then it was a conspiracy.The DNC and state parties are fairly enmeshed, but the Iowa Democratic party refusing basic transparency with such a tiny 'win' in Hillary's favor shows what sham the primary was. From top to bottom, Hillary loyalists cheated the system to gain her just a single more pointless SDE.You haven't provided any details about how Hillary loyalists cheated besides the Bernie campaign whining about something.  What was the Iowa Democratic Party's response as I am sure they gave reasons. Hillary loyalists cheated the system to gain her just a single more pointless SDE.Hilarious, seeing Bernie supporters resorted to violence and threats when their attempt to steal more delegates from a state they objectively lost failed.","title":"Bernie Sanders Is Leading a Bold New Effort to Block Arms Sales to Israel: The senator has more allies than ever in his fight to hold Israel accountable and save lives in Gaza."},{"text":"Dude, [when I saw this, I was so fucking hyped, thinking they actually started doing what evpneone wanted, but never heard another ad again this wide spread again...](https://youtu.be/4O14Z9f07iU?feature=shared)","title":"Dems need to grow some balls and stop letting Republicans dictate the debate and the situation"},{"text":"I hope she's ashamed of herself for that bullshit.

Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Warren never stood a chance.He already had momentum from SC. This is a dumb conspiracy that ignores how them staying in previously didn't help Biden. They stayed in the race and ate up precious debate time so that Biden couldn't make his usual gaffes or reveal that he's not as progressive as people believed, which people only thought because of the media and the other nonviable moderates muddying the waters.If they had dropped earlier before Nevada it likely would have made Nevada more competitive if it was primarily Biden and Bernie. Bernie started to blow away the competition in the later rounds the early combined vote of Biden (18%), Pete (16%), Amy (10%), and Steyer (9%) being higher than Bernie's initial 34%.Doubt it. None of the states besides SC wanted Biden and he would have lost before SC in a limited primary. Polls also showed Bernie being the second choice of many of their supporters, which isn't surprising when people thought Buttigieg was a progressive.There was 6 before SC and 4 on ST. Like I said before SC there hadn't been any states that really showcased the black vote, so it was still unknown which way it would go. It wasn't known if black voters would be turned off by Biden's poor showing in New Hampshire and Iowa thus they may look at Pete or Amy even if still went to Biden overall. Instead, SC showed Biden him had them on lock with him winning 61% of their vote and neither Amy or Pete picking any noteable number up.There was 7 before SC and 5 on ST, which is unusual when looking at historical primaries. It usually gets winnowed to 2 or 3 after a state or two.Buttigeg and Klobuchar never stood a chance in SC. If Biden lost support there, most of it would go to Sanders because voters wanted a candidate that could beat Trump. That's why Bernie was the top second choice of Biden supporters.No, she didn't. The DNC is always going to be filled with party loyalists who else do you commits their time to running a political party. There were plenty of shit that favored Bernie that he kept his mouth quiet about. You know like how he whined about closed primaries being too restrictice but was dead silent about the even more restrictive caucus system that favored him.She absolutely did and [signed an agreement that gave Hillary defacto control over many of the DNC's functions](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774/), like choosing who is hired. This is extremely unusual and only comes into effect *after* a candidate is nominated. Why would Sanders criticize caucuses when it's what their states want? It's literally their choice.Without providing any actual details it isn't unknown what the procedure for the Iowa Democratic Caucus. However, the DNC doesn't run the Iowa Democratic Caucus so it isn't the result of DWS's actions.The DNC and state parties are fairly enmeshed, but the Iowa Democratic party refusing basic transparency with such a tiny 'win' in Hillary's favor shows what sham the primary was.

A capitalist (meaning financial investor) seeks to obtain the exchange-value of a commodity by selling it, while a consumer seeks to obtain the use-value of a commodity by buying it. Example: I buy a shovel and gain the ability to dig holes (use-value), while the investor who funded the production and distribution of the shovel accumulates money and turns a profit (exchange-value). When an economic arrangement is functioning correctly, use-value and exchange-value are in perfect alignment (both sides get what they want). But when they are thrown out of alignment for any reason, the economy starts to break down. A great deal of our current economic problems today are the result of economic leaders (including both politicians and private businessmen) focusing exclusively on exchange-value while neglecting or ignoring use-value. Unfortunately, this valuable insight is almost impossible to detect under the ideological constraints of modern neoliberal economic theory, as neoliberalism is geared towards turning a profit for investors, rather than providing the general public with what they need. A British Marxist by the name of David Harvey once solved a housing crisis in Chicago by focusing on this distinction, which all the other non-Marxist economists had been unable to solve because they couldnt break free from the ideological blinders which told them that the purpose of housing was to generate a profit for landlords, while David Harvey recognized that the true purpose of housing is actually to provide shelter to the residents who occupy the house. Sadly, due to widespread prejudice against Marxist economics, business leaders and politicians continue to be blind to this important point, and our economy continues to suffer for it.","title":"No No dont repeal Obamacare, repeal the Affordable Care Act."},{"text":"I suppose so.

Many casual readers of Huntington wrongly interpreted his thought and focused excessively on the word clash in the title of the book. They argue that Huntington advocated that the West clash with other civilizations to defend itself. A number of thinkers confused Huntingtons clash with Bernard Lewiss thesis that militant Islam would spark a global clash between Islam and the West.Huntington, in fact, warned emphatically against provoking the Islamic world and argued for caution and diplomacy in cleft countries such as Ukraine. He was adamantly opposed to crusading democracy promotion as a core component of U.S. foreign policy. On this subject, he wrote, The principal responsibility of Western leaders, consequently, is not to attempt to reshape other civilizations in the image of the West, which is beyond their declining power, but to preserve, protect and renew the unique qualities of Western civilization.Huntington argued that most civilizational blocs emerging in the postCCold War world would have natural leaders, what he called core states. Sinic civilization would be led by China, Orthodox civilization by Russia, and Western civilization by the United States. Since the Islamic world has no natural leader, a struggle for leadership would take place between Sunni and Shia and between the leading nations of the Middle East such as Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran.These core states are key to managing the challenges that would emerge in cleft nations such as Ukraine. Rather than sponsoring a proxy war in Ukraine and risking a bigger war, the leaders of the core states need to step back and acknowledge that both Russia and the West have legitimate claims in Ukraine and that a diplomatic solution is the only path forward. Whether that solution is a partition of Ukraine, a federation where the aspirations of both parts of the country are respected, or some other compromiseonly sincere efforts at diplomacy on the part of Russia and the United States can solve this problem.As the ISW paper illustrates, American policy toward Ukraine has been the opposite of what Huntington would have advised. It has been a crusading democracy promotion that led to a U.S.-backed coup dtat in Kiev, a refusal to recognize any legitimate Russian interests in Crimea and eastern Ukraine despite their deep historic ties, and the sponsorship of a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, the goals of which are unclear.As America is ravaged by a pandemic and its consequences, the American people are going to be far less willing to tolerate a meddling, universalistic U.S. foreign policy in parts of the world having little connection to our interests. The way forward is the Huntington model of recognizing the legitimate interests of other civilizational regions, combined with genuine U.S. diplomacy as the leading tool of American foreign policy.Dr. William S. Smith is the author of Democracy and Imperialism published by the University of Michigan Press.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

Awareness of the complex history that gives rise to conflict strengthens the hand of diplomacy.The hawkish think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently warned that Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to advance his strategic objectives in Ukraine. That ISW would focus on a nation that is largely irrelevant to American national interests and do so even in the midst of a terrible pandemic in the homeland is representative of the more general myopia of the American national security community. This myopia betrays a deeply flawed understanding of how the world order would be shaped at the end of the Cold War.Consider just a few examples of how American leaders fumbled certain specific challenges at the end of the Cold War. When the first postCCold War conflagration ignited in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. policymakers insisted that this artificial state be held together despite the intense ethnic and religious aspirations among the three major components of that fake country. The U.S. policy that emerged toward China was one of constructive engagement, naively assuming that the leader of a competing civilization with competing interests would want to Westernize. As Samuel Huntington pointed out, the Chinese believe that their economic success is largely a product of Asian culture which is superior to that of the West, which is culturally and socially decadent. In maybe the worst blunder of the postCCold War period, the United States assumed that once Iraqis had been saved from a dictatorial regime they would rally to the flag of democracy, disregard centuries of ethnic and religious tensions and quickly embrace Western rights, values and outlooks.What all these blunders have in common is the neglect of Samuel Huntingtons insight that the postCCold War world was arranging itself along ethnic, religious and civilizational lines. Nations were throwing off artificial Cold War alliances and rallying around common historical ties. We should have been able to predict that Turkey would gravitate into the Islamic world and away from NATOs interests, or that Orthodox Greece would be one of the most troublesome members of the European Union, or that Muslim Chechnya would seek independence from Orthodox Russia. As Huntington wrote, In the postCCold War world, the most important distinctions among peoples are not ideological, political, or economic. They are cultural.U.S. policy toward Russia has suffered deeply from failure to understand what most motivates the action of groups. Francis Fukuyama, who spoke for much of the foreign policy establishment, argued in 1989 that postCCold War Russia was trending toward a political system in which the people should be truly responsible for their own affairs, the higher political bodies should be answerable to the lower ones, and not vice versa, and that the rule of law should prevail over arbitrary police actions, with separation of powers and an independent judiciary. For many Western thinkers, it seemed inconceivable that Russia would choose the retrograde course of returning to its authoritarian and Orthodox roots.Since Huntingtons insights and predictions were far more prescient than Fukuyamas and those of many others, the U.S. foreign policy establishment should have heeded his advice when the crisis in Ukraine emerged. But, it did not.Huntington predicted the crisis in Ukraine. His theory that nations would return to their historical and cultural roots had a natural corollary: nations that were divided between civilizations, so-called cleft countries, were the places that would most likely generate great-power conflict. Consider that, in the former Yugoslavia, the United States, Germany, Russia and prominent Islamic nations all lined up to support different proxies in the conflict according to shared civilizational commonalities.By Huntingtons civilizational standard, Ukraine is a severely cleft country, divided internally along historical, geographic and religious lines, with western Ukraine firmly in the European corner and eastern Ukraine and Crimea firmly in the orbit of Orthodox Russia. Even though it was published years before the 2013 Ukrainian crisis, Huntingtons most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations, is rife with warnings about the dangers of the Ukrainian situation and predicts that Ukraine could split along its fault line into two separate entities, the eastern of which would merge with Russia. The issue of secession first came up with respect to Crimea.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

So national guard or the military will be deporting NOT ONLY 'foreigners illegally in the US' but anyone who LOOKS LIKE a foreigner. At least if they're Latin and not lily-white. The US did this back in the 40s as well. And deported actual citizens(!) to Mexico.

The Economic outlook was really bad and there was outrage against immigration. There were a ton of problems compounded over the years. Even Biden understood that the path to victory was to make the election about Trump and how much people hate him. Hes still unpopular even after the election. Instead he was the center of attention for a news cycle, then Harris had to start and gather a lot of attention. In that context, and according to the polling, Harris actually did greatly improve Dem margins just not by enough.?The other thing is that way more people voted in 2024 than 2016, the electorate was different.?","title":"Where did Hillary Clinton outperform Kamala Harris and vice versa?"},{"text":"?Lto or long term operation lcoe is the price of keeping an already built nuclear plant running, not the total cost.","title":"CMV: The USA can and should transition to 100% renewable electricity and its better than nuclear.

Safe to Very Likely D.Michigan has not elected a Republican Senator since 1994, which was a red tsunami year; no matter how close it looks for Large Gerald on paper, hes likely to hold on to his seat simply because the Republicans never quite pull off a win, even this year. Id put Michigan at Very Likely D.New Mexicos last Republican governor left the office hated by everyone, so Im going to say Very Likely D there too.New Jersey - if Phil Murphy could hang on in a bad year for Democrats, I am confident that Josh Gottheimer or Mikie Sherrill, whoever wins the primary, can defeat a MAGA in what should be a good year for us. Very Likely D.New York and Virginia should be Likely D unless someone of Zeldins caliber comes out against Kathy Hochul. I know shes unpopular, but New York does not like Trump or MAGA, so it would have to be someone who could convincingly carry off a sweater vest of moderation. Likely D for both, because I think Spanberger is a very, very formidable candidate, much more so than MacAuliffe was.

We need to not only talk economic policy - because yes, both Clinton and Harris did have platforms with change in them - but we need to talk SEISMIC policy shifts AND not run people with a mountain of negative propaganda already out about them. Whitmer can be that actually, by talking up her policies and how they spoke to a swing state that elected her twice - and the second time in a landslide against a MAGA candidate. Whitmer is probably the absolutely best bet the party has in 2028 as long as she runs on the kind of change she brought her state and doesn't run back to the middle on health care, minimum wage, sick leave, and things that affect our daily lives.

Then the awakening and unraveling happen. Which the short answer is essentially as the generation that formed the new institutions leaves power, new younger generations come in and slowly corrupt it. Eventually the corruption is so baked into the system that we reach a new crisis turning and then we reset. Each turning lasts about 20 years. And its pretty freaky how consistently we do see this pattern play out. According to that theory were in the last 4ish years of the crisis now. Which started in 2008 with the Great Recession.

The fact is, unless they caucus with the majority or the largest minority party, they're going to be irrelevant anyway. AFAIK, there are basically *no* true \\"independents\\" in the House *anyway*... they either caucus with Republicans or Democrats, or they end up being legislatively-irrelevant.Stage 2, increasing the House to 1200-1500 members, would occur in time for the 2040 election, and would require a massive construction project to basically demolish and rebuild the House chamber. Just getting the House &amp; Senate to *agree* on the architectural details and funding would probably span at least 4-6 years... with actual construction taking another 2-4 years.The point of staging the expansion is to avoid making perfection the enemy of good.

I honestly think we'd be lucky if the actual construction project were approved, funded, and completed within *25 years*. In contrast, the gallery could be given a relatively light makeover in fairly short order.Yeah, it would suck that the public would become effectively unable to sit in the gallery and watch the House in action... but let's be real.

It seems like theyd want to wait and see what Trump does once he gets in before taking any horrifying risks like that.

If these attacks on Russia continue, theres literally no limit to how bad this could get.?Its so fun how the Biden administration is using its lame duck months to skyrocket hostilities between nuclear superpowers and we dont even know whos really making these decisions because the presidents brain is cottage cheese.?These escalations happen as Ukrainians begin moving into a majority consensus that it is time to seek peace.

As usual people are more opposed to continuing the war the closer they are to the frontline, with 63 percent of the respondents in eastern Ukraine supporting peace talks and only 27 percent wanting to continue fighting.

Relying only on renewables creates massive challenges that cant be solved by simply building more.Intermittency:Wind and solar are great, but theyre not consistent. Overbuilding by 200% sounds like a solution, but what happens when the wind doesnt blow or the sun doesnt shine for days? Even with overbuilding, you still need huge amounts of storage to keep the grid running. And battery or hydrogen storage isnt nearly advanced or cheap enough to handle that level of demand. Nuclear fills in those gapsit provides steady, reliable power 24/7, no matter the weather.Cost:Sure, solar and wind are cheaper per MWh, but that doesnt tell the full story. When you account for all the extra storage, transmission upgrades, and redundancies needed to make 100% renewables work, the costs go way up. Nuclear has a higher upfront cost, but its stable, lasts for decades, and doesnt require overhauling the entire grid or wasting energy by overproducing.Land Use:Covering the country with solar panels and wind farms sounds green, but its not. These projects require massive amounts of land, disrupt ecosystems, and can hurt local communities. Nuclear, on the other hand, produces way more energy using a fraction of the space. Its much more efficient and less damaging overall.Time:Its true that nuclear plants take longer to build, but thats no reason to dismiss them. Were going to need long-term, stable energy sources to complement renewables for decades to come. Rushing into 100% renewables without reliable backup risks making the grid unstable.We dont need to pick between renewables and nucleartheyre better together. Solar and wind are great for scaling up clean energy quickly, but nuclear provides the reliability and stability that renewables cant offer alone. Overbuilding renewables sounds nice in theory, but in practice, its wasteful, expensive, and risks creating more problems than it solves.","title":"CMV: The USA can and should transition to 100% renewable electricity and its better than nuclear.

Josh Stein, a Democrat, will be the next governor, succeeding Roy Cooper, another Democrat.The bill would significantly restructure the state election board, the top authority over voting in North Carolina, wresting appointment power away from the governors office and handing it to the state auditor, who will be a Republican next year. The change would be likely to put the board, which currently has three Democrats and two Republicans, under G.O.P. control.The legislation would also significantly restrict the governors ability to fill vacancies on state courts, including the Supreme Court, by limiting the options to candidates offered by the political party of the judge leaving the seat. And it would curtail the ability of the attorney general  currently Mr. Stein, and next year Jeff Jackson, another Democrat  to challenge laws passed by the legislature.Beyond those proposals, the bill would make major changes to state election procedures. It would significantly shorten the time voters have after Election Day to address problems with their mail and absentee ballots  a process known as curing  and would require local election officials to finish counting provisional ballots within three days of the election.The State Senates passage of the bill on Wednesday sends it to Mr. Cooper, who has 10 days to sign or veto the legislation before it becomes law automatically. North Carolina does not allow its governors to veto parts of a bill, so he would have to reject the entire measure, including the hurricane relief provisions.","title":"North Carolina Republicans Push to Seize Power From Top Democrats"},{"text":"Jw does anyone have sauce on these dumb shits posting this.

I'm no authority and I think it's legitimate to argue to include women in the criteria. Though you'd have to argue Switzerland wasn't a democracy until the 1960s. Which brings me to an interesting point, much of the United States arguably was still an apartheid regime until around that same time, we're still very few generations removed from a solid quarter of the nation by population being undemocratic even by that standard I presented. In that context is it so surprising that we face such hair trigger reaction? Do we consider this a crisis of democratic rule, or the ghost of an authoritarian one?Ultimately my case for Male Suffrage is really that I'm arguing that the legislative body must be representative of the aggregate opinions and interests of all social classes to be democratic, even if it is still not representative of women. Universal Male Suffrage represents the triumph of the masses. Extending suffrage to women is as much of a social technology as it is a statecraft achievement, it requires a society to radically culturally recontextualize the role of women in it, and institutionally its effect on national policy is drastic, but much less drastic than finally subjugating the aristocracy and including the working class in legislation. The fact is that suffrage is insurance against exploitation which is why it's so essential to extend it to everyone, yes including women, it's insurance that the legislature cannot simply bilk you for cash to benefit somebody else without your say-so or an overwhelming enough majority. It drastically alters the conditions under which nations enter war, direct economic production, and so on, in ways which entirely transform society and in fact create the beltway for the cultural change that precipitates women's suffrage.","title":"Segregation Academies Across the South Are Getting Millions in Taxpayer Dollars"},{"text":"Im having a lot of fun today reading articles from after 2016.

For too long, power and wealth have been concentrated in the hands of conglomerates, special interest groups, and the ultra-wealthy, who control our government, our economy, and even our future. But we, the people, hold a power they cannot ignore: our dollars and our unity. United Stand 2025 is our plana bold, coordinated movement to reclaim our country from corporate dominance and demand the reforms we deserve. In most cases, this plan can be done from your phone in just an hour or less. Together, we can make history.Step 1: Healthcare Opt-Out for the HealthyIf you are healthy and can take the risk, cancel your private healthcare coverage. Insurance companies rely on premiums from healthy clients to cover their profits. If enough people step away, these companies will face unprecedented pressure, serving only high-cost clients. This could drive the government to finally step in and consider a socialized healthcare system, like those in other developed nations.Step 2: Set Your Tax Withholding to ZeroSet your tax withholding to zero on your paycheck, and save that money in a personal account. At tax time, youll owe the same amount, but throughout the year, youll have had control over your own earnings. If millions of Americans hold onto their tax dollars, the government will feel a shortfall and recognize that taxpayers are demanding reform. This step doesnt avoid your responsibility; its a call for accountability. Just remember to set that money aside to pay whats owed when the time comes.Step 3: Move Money from Banks to BrokeragesTransfer your funds out of traditional banks and into brokerage accounts. This takes your money out of the reach of banks that profit by using your deposits to make loans and investments, often in ways that dont benefit everyday Americans. With brokerages, your money remains secure but untouched by the banking system. As banks struggle to meet reserve requirements, they may have to sell assets, creating opportunities for you to reinvest directly. This is a way to weaken the grip of large financial institutions while gaining more control over your finances.Optional Step 4: Rent Moratorium for Corporate-Owned PropertiesIf steps 1-3 dont bring about reform discussions, we hold the next card. We pause rent payments to properties owned by conglomerates and real estate investment groups. This step is reserved for later, as a strategic escalation if reforms arent addressed. Its bold, but it has the power to push corporate landlords into action and to bring attention to the housing issues affecting millions of Americans.Why United Stand 2025 Will WorkWeve seen that the powerful respond to dollars, not just to votes. United Stand 2025 harnesses our collective financial power and directs it toward a common cause. By standing together in economic protest, we send a message that cant be ignored. This is a coordinated, strategic action to bring about real changeby the people, for the people.Join us in United Stand 2025 and be part of a historic movement to reclaim America.","title":"No No dont repeal Obamacare, repeal the Affordable Care Act."},{"text":"It's for the best.

They dropped out to give Biden post-SC momentum so he could win Super Tuesday.He already had momentum from SC.  This is a dumb conspiracy that ignores how them staying in previously didn't help Biden.  If they had dropped earlier before Nevada it likely would have made Nevada more competitive if it was primarily Biden and Bernie.  Bernie started to blow away the competition in the later rounds the early combined vote of Biden (18%), Pete (16%), Amy (10%), and Steyer (9%) being higher than Bernie's initial 34%.Most usually drop out way before, which is why it was weird that we had so many before SC and five on ST.There was 6 before SC and 4 on ST.  Like I said before SC there hadn't been any states that really showcased the black vote, so it was still unknown which way it would go.  It wasn't known if black voters would be turned off by Biden's poor showing in New Hampshire and Iowa thus they may look at Pete or Amy even if still went to Biden overall.  Instead, SC showed Biden him had them on lock with him winning 61% of their vote and neither Amy or Pete picking any noteable number up.DWS definitely did 'shit' to influence the 2016 primary, starting with filling the DNC with loyalists and likely having them join state parties. There was plenty of shenanigans going on that continually favored Hillary, from top to bottom.No, she didn't.  The DNC is always going to be filled with party loyalists who else do you commits their time to running a political party.  There were plenty of shit that favored Bernie that he kept his mouth quiet about.  You know like how he whined about closed primaries being too restrictice but was dead silent about the even more restrictive caucus system that favored him.Just look at how the Iowa Democratic party refused to allow Sanders' campaign to review the precinct tallies when Hillary 'won' by 0.25%. Blatant lack of transparency on an election so close it would usually result in an automatic recount and they wouldn't let people check the numbers.Without providing any actual details it isn't unknown what the procedure for the Iowa Democratic Caucus.  However, the DNC doesn't run the Iowa Democratic Caucus so it isn't the result of DWS's actions.","title":"Bernie Sanders Is Leading a Bold New Effort to Block Arms Sales to Israel: The senator has more allies than ever in his fight to hold Israel accountable and save lives in Gaza."},{"text":"Covid was merely the peak of it.","title":"Kamala is apparently better liked than the Democratic party in general (but it wasn't enough)"},{"text":"Well you see, Gaetz is white and has money.","title":"House Ethics panel has 'no agreement' on releasing Matt Gaetz report after meeting | A Democrat said he would force a vote on releasing the report as Gaetz, Trumps pick for attorney general, met with senators and Vice President-elect JD Vance on Wednesday."},{"text":"I don't really think this \\"turn\\" has anything to do with ideology.

Conscription wont teach them critical thinking skills, it will just teach them to follow orders.Another key element is the mental health aspect.

As for chess, go to chess.com. Set your account so that it only presents you with opponents with slightly higher ratings than yours (like from an identical rating to yours to maybe 50 points over your rating). You want to play opponents of similar skill and experience (or lack thereof) that challenge you without always getting your ass kicked. Also, you lose fewer ratings points when you lose to someone with a higher rating than yours (even if slightly higher) versus when you lose to someone with a lower rating than yours. Set your account so that all games you play are 2 or 3 minutes long per player with 1 second put back on the clock after each move (I play only 1 minute per player with 1 second put back after a move because I don't like watching paint dry). This will assure that you play lots of games in a short time, so you will rapidly improve. As you improve, the opponents you're presented with will automatically always have ratings slightly higher than yours. Pick one or two basic openings - e.g., Queen's Gambit (my favorite) or Ruy Lopez - and play them every time you have white like a broken record; you'll have seen it all within a fairly short time. You want to be in a decent overall position as things move into the middle game, and the commonly used openings have been tested over centuries to do just that. Lastly, Google something like basic overall chess principles and strategies for the early game. Follow them until you know what you're doing (they're simple stuff like fight for the middle squares in the early game, or trade pieces of equal value when you've got a nice lead going).","title":"Napolitano: Trump -- \\"We have never been closer to nuclear war\\""},{"text":"Hitler was appointed chancellor by Hindenburg.","title":"Democrats eat up whatever bullshit they hear, so do Europeans.

The patriarchy and men. The patriarchy is a social norm, and it truly would not be possible for it to survive without women supporting and perpetuating it. Women play a huge part in maintaining and enforcing gender roles. The role that Kardashians have played in the change of beauty standards is a huge example of this.2. The male gaze and men. The male gaze is a bit of a misnomer, but this is because our philosophical and political understanding of it has evolved over time to become more complex. Essentially it takes the patriarchal norms and divines how individuals are viewed, especially when analyzing visual media such as art, film, TV, and photography. The best example I can think of to show how our understanding of this has become more complex is Margaret Atwoods quote:  Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, its all a male fantasy: that youre strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you arent catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending youre unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.But to counter your original point, I will say that men are just as responsible as women for this rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards. 1. **Most men dont know what natural looks like.** Most men dont know anything about makeup and cant tell when a woman is wearing a full face or makeup, eyelash extensions, as long as its styled as natural. Ive heard plenty of stories about women being complimented on their not wearing makeup when theyre wearing eyeshadow that has glitter in it. Ive also heard plenty of stories where men claim they had fake boobs and boob jobs only to not recognize a fake pair - even when they can touch them. T which brings me to my second point: 2. **Most men dont care about authenticity, only passability.** They dont care if youre really wearing makeup or if thats your real nose. They care if youre *obviously* wearing makeup or your nose job is *obviously* fake. This is not new in our culture or even exclusive to men; look at white women and blonde hair for another example of this in action. 3. **Men were part of the process of platforming these changes.** Directors, photographers, doctors, agents, managers, influencers, producers, were all behind these changes, many of them men. Perhaps even a majority of them, though I dont have stats in front of me.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Good thing thats not what they campaigned on, at all.Crazy that democrats are being blamed for what republicans accuse them of.","title":"Sanders: Democrats cant hang your hat on identity politics"},{"text":"The shit-stain is just jealous that the turkey has a nicer wattle.","title":"DJT has vowed to unpardon Biden's final turkey and to abolish the practice"},{"text":"Social justice doesnt completely reduce to economics.

Huge parts of Canada are uninhabitable but that doesnt make it acceptable for people to illegally immigrate to these places and settle there. Claiming none of the empires owned the land is essentially saying states cant own land unless they are indigenous which is absurd and unworkable. Also, it means essentially no one in Europe can own land if indigeneity is required. Certainly not most of Spain, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Eastern Europe, and the Nordics. The Turks also cant own any land. Indigeneity is a useless and confused standard for land ownership.What definition/understanding of indignity are you using here? And yes, slavery was bad but that doesnt mean we should ignore all legal conventions.Thats a straw-man. My argument is that we should not accept the consequences of bad laws. For example, before he was assassinated, Abraham Lincoln had planned on ceasing land owned by white farmers in the south to compensate freed slaves because of how the pro-slavery laws in the south impacted them and stopped them from owning property. In your squatters rights scenario, I would not expect to own it. It would be stupid to invest so much with no guarantee. It belongs to whoever owns it. Regardless, the land wasnt abandoned.

I reject this report in its entirety.Mr Fetterman also said Mr Trumps selection of Mr Rubio for Secretary of State was a strong choice.Unsurprisingly, the other teams pick will have political differences than my own, Mr Fetterman said.He added: That being said, my colleague @?SenMarcoRubio is a strong choice and I look forward to voting for his confirmation.Several Democrat Senators have approved of Mr Trumps appointment of Mr Rubio.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/democrat-john-fetterman-endorses-three-of-trumps-picks/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/20/democrat-john-fetterman-endorses-three-of-trumps-picks/)","title":"Prominent Democrat John Fetterman endorses three of Trumps cabinet picks"},{"text":"No. Experience can be important.","title":"Ohio Democrat Marcy Kaptur extends tenure as longest-serving woman in US House with election win"},{"text":" is this for minors in school?

Hezbollah responded by attacking the occupied Golan. \\n Simply because Israel has the ability to target Hezbollah in ways that Hezbollah does not, doesn't mean that Israel is the one escalating\\nWhy not? Because I think to most people, that exactly means Israel is the one escalating. They are literally the only one's capable of escalating. Like you say. Do you think Lebanon has the right to live in safety and security, and they must eliminate the threat of Israel? Because I don't. I am consistent. I think Lebanon or Iran does not have the right to destroy Israel, even though Israel is a far more REAL existential threat to Lebanon and Iran than vice versa. Israel is behaving VERY much like other fascist regimes in history.I am simply consistent.  I don't think Nazi's had a right to holocaust the jews, even though they considered the Jews an existential threat to the only Aryan state in the world. I don't think Russia had a right to invade Chechnya, Georgia, or Ukraine just because they considered them existential threats to 'ethnically russian peoples'.

I do believe the OT is corrupted by demonic entities as well as many parts of the NT so I have an open mind to learn new information you present with a reliable source. There are numerous references to soul in the OT. My understanding is all people who died went to Sheol. They didnt need to convince Greeks to believe in Christ. When they heard about the amazing miracles He performed, they were very interested. There is a lot of important knowledge in John 12:20 if you want to explore Jesus words. He makes an allusion to the Prison Planet theory when He says the one who loves his life will lose it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life and this is right after He is told Greeks had come to see Him. If you are tethered to the prison planet, you never get to really live outside of it and escape. I dont waste too much of my time with Jewish traditions because Im not Jewish. I have studied the Bible cover to cover for years before I had better knowledge of how the world worked and now I have an ability to discern what is corrupted and what is loving and good from religious texts. If I believed in the cruelty of the God of the OT, I would be hopeless and severely depressed. Jesus was a rebel. He confronted everything the religious zealots of His days as a human taught and turned it to focus on love. This is why He was persecuted. The ones who end in - - chons infiltrated Christianity because they couldnt afford to lose their food sources. Even the so-called Gnostics were corrupted but they were right about the chons. Almost all Churches today teach a milquetoast version of Christianity that is at best useless and at worst dangerous.","title":"White Light"},{"text":"Yeah, they should continue the normalization of relegating women to second-class citizen status.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has discouraged the release of a House Ethics Report investigation covering similar ground, raising questions about how much information senators will have access to as they weigh whether Gaetz should have the position.  The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet Wednesday to consider releasing the report.\\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and the other Senate Democrats on the committee requested the evidentiary file on Gaetzs alleged sex trafficking in a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray on Wednesday. That would include interviews with a woman who said she was paid to have sex with Gaetz when she was 17. Gaetz has strongly denied the accusations, and the Justice Department did not bring charges against him. The Justice Department generally does not hand over to Congress sensitive case information in ongoing or closed investigations. The sex trafficking investigation would be likely to come up in a background check of Gaetz that the FBI would conduct ahead of the Senate confirmation process. The FBI typically summarizes aspects of the investigations to the committee.

Baristas sometimes are social elites but usually not. The son of someone making 250k a year working as a barista as they attend NYU is absolutely a social elite. The key is that they have no intention of working or defining their economic role as a barista in the long-term and understand how to navigate the social conventions of elite society. The social class of someone in their early 20s doesn't have much to do with their economic class. They maybe making less than a more experienced barista who is set on being a barista for life but they do not belong to the same social class. If your actual career is to be a barista you are part of the servant class. The servant class is expected to understand elite conventions enough to be pleasant and inoffensive to interact with. However it's not the same as being social equals. An adjunct professor making 40k could easily meet his old college friends making 500k on Wall Street and be completely accepted. The elite would not be mad if their kid was working as a professor either, or even a modestly successful artistic. A barista is not a job the elite would ever want to see their kids doing at 30.
