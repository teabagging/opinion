For many of cats adoption is life or death situation.It can be, yes. Unlike dogs, cats behaviors is primarily depends on their individual personality rather than their breed.Not true. Its not as stark and polarized as in certain dog breeds, but certain cat breeds do in fact have predictable impacts on their behaviors. I feed and TNR stray cats, I can confidently say that their personalities are extremely diverse and there are any type of stray cat. That's great! And what if one of those extremely diverse personalities isn't available in the shelter to adopt? There are many extremely affectionate fully socialized cats among the strays I feed and nobody adopts them despite my efforts.That's sad, but its not a problem of properly bred purebred cats. It's a problem of people not getting their moggies spayed and nuetered and allowing them to roam/treating them as throwaway. Put the blame on the source of those stray cats you can't get adopted out, not misdirecting it where it doesn't belong.Because many people prefer purebreed cats.Nope, because many people don't spay and neuter and consider cats throwaway, self-reliant animals. Because of high demand they are produced a lot. It's not okay to produce a lot of purebreed cats when there is overpopulation of homeless cats.Given that purebred cats produced by proper, responsible breeders most often do not end up homeless/contributing to the homeless overpopulation of cats, how do you make that conclusion?Also I'm not sure if this is a global thing but where I live many people view owning purebreed cats as prestigious thing.You're generalizing again. I have three purebred cats, two of which are not rescues (I have an additional two not purebred shelter cats, for a total of three rescued shelter cats and two purebred purchased ones. I've also foster volunteered, donated to shelters, and out of about thirty cats I've owned over my life, four have been purebreds that I purchased). None of the purebreds I have ever purchased have been for 'prestige' or to 'show off'. Let me ask you this: what is the aim of rescues/shelters? It's to reduce the homeless pet population and to eventually work toward a day where no cat (or dog, but we're talking about cats) is homeless, correct? So why are you vilifying cats that are *already living that ideal we're working toward?* That is, if i have a purebred cat that will *never* be homeless, *never* be in the shelter, *never* breed, *never* be abandoned or contribute to the homeless cat population on the street, why is that a *bad* thing, when that is the ideal goal for ALL cats?","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"Oh so nothing beyond making life more expensive for most Americans, got it weirdo","title":"NBC News Exit Poll: Voters express deep concern about America's democracy and economy"},{"text":"In their eyes Only guns are allowed to kill kids","title":"Sherelle Jacobs: Kamala Harris might be about to pull this off"},{"text":"*gulp* they went that way! -","title":"Sherelle Jacobs: Kamala Harris might be about to pull this off"},{"text":"Oh no.

HHS programs provide health coverage to millions of rural Americans: almost three million HealthCare.gov enrollees, more than 12 million Medicaid enrollees, and more than 14 million Medicare enrollees live in rural areas.  \\n...  \\nKey data from the ASPE report include the following:* Rural enrollees in Marketplace coverage are disproportionately benefitting from the improvements to the ACA enacted in the Biden-Harris Administration.  The improvements in the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act are saving rural enrollees an average of almost $1,000 per year, about 28% more than their urban counterparts.\\n* Since the Affordable Care Act became law the uninsured rate for rural Americans has dropped from 23.8% in 2010 to 12.6% in 2023 (about three million people).\\n* Almost 30 percent of rural residents were uninsured in states that have not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion versus less than 11 percent in states that have.\\n* Rural Americans who buy their health coverage through healthcare.gov will see their costs go up by an average of $87 every month if congressional inaction takes away a tax credit from struggling families.Link to full report:[Access to Health Care in Rural America: Current Trends and Key Challenges](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-care-rural-america)Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making sure that rural Americans are not left behind, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. HHS has taken many steps to invest in rural America, including helping rural hospitals stay open, investing in the health workforce, and extending mental health and substance use disorder support services. Now, we have new evidence that President Biden and Vice President Harris policies have made a difference when it comes to access to health care. We know that our actions are working and that more people have coverage C and the peace of mind that comes with it.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Releases New Report that Shows Gains in Health Care Coverage for Rural Americans"},{"text":"If you've ever wonder how anyone could be split between Trump and Harris considering the types of candidates that they are, this article is a clue.

However, the same poll shows a slight uptick in the favourable views of Trump among both Black and Latino voters. Given that a Trump victory in battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania may well hinge?[on his success in attracting minority voters](https://o-take-the-blame/), this is a tentatively encouraging sign for the Republicans.But elements of the data will be causing serious concern for the Democratic camp, too. They hint that Kamala Harris will have to overcome incredibly strong headwinds in order to snatch this election. Americans feel extremely negative about the status quo.?  \\n  \\nFox News voter analysis has also found that 70 per cent of respondents believe the US is on the wrong track. Only 13 per cent said they or their family were getting ahead in the current economy, while 63 per cent rated economic conditions as not so good or poor. One of the big criticisms of the Harris campaign has been her tactical decision not to emphatically distance herself from the Biden era, for fear that the consequent party infighting could scupper her campaign.She will be heartened, however, by the fact that the CNN polling at least suggests that the state of democracy is ranking as the single most important issue for voters C even more important than the economy.

And let's also say that this man isn't really a problem person, but *does* have a problem with intrusive bad thoughts that he actively works against, but the Ambien gives him no ability to fight that. No shame in that - it's more common than people think to have really *bad* intrusive thoughts that they quickly dismiss.This is the most charitable reading possible of the case. *Even if this were true, this man should not be an officer.* That would mean that this man has an underlying condition which should *not* be paired with total access to a firearm and the legal right to make a decision as to kill someone with it. At the very *least,* this man should be on medical leave. If the Ambien is fucking up his decision making capabilities *that* badly, then he needs to be pulled off the drug - and he will need the time and space away from being an officer necessary to do so safely. He will need to be pulled off the drug - slowly, to avoid withdrawl - and then fully examined and diagnosed and given replacement medication by his doctor to treat his underlying issues.

Thank them.Dont share things before checking your sources, he added.And finally, Let the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.More than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.States have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.In 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.Vice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.","title":"Obama urges patience with election results: It takes time to count every ballot"},{"text":"Probably the most dominating CL performance I have seen Celtic play against a big teamA little too young to have seen the Lisbon Lions","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 5, 2024 - ELECTION DAY"},{"text":"Boo Hoo.","title":"Small price to pay in order to save our democracy."},{"text":"I'll call that alternate reality and raise you the alternate reality where Trump tells his idiots to wear masks during COVID, makes millions on his own branded ones, tells them to get the vaccine, and skirts to re-election in 2020.","title":"AP VoteCast: Economy ranked as a top issue, but concerns over democracy drove many voters to polls"},{"text":"Just wait till the cost of goods we import skyrocket.

That wouldn't happen here, the public broadcaster basically has to report on anything that's gaining major traction on either political side.I don't think the BBC and CBC always get it right, but both countries seem to be way less susceptible to the polarization and reality denial we're seeing in the US (and they've been really trying in both countries).  I think the stabilizing force of a public broadcaster is one of the core reasons we haven't gone off the deep end in quite the same way.

This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.The most well know voices of the Austrian School include:Mises Institute:  https://mises.org/European Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.orgAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.comWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.Perhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.The NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principleHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.Proto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.This, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.Have fun going down this rabbit hole.","title":"Finally switched to the libertarian party."},{"text":"It's like alcohol.

The cat I currently have is an 11 year old orange tabby named Tucker who I adopted from the Humane Society.  Tucker lived in a house where the owners, who were hoarders, neglected him and his brother.  Eventually, they escaped together and after some time, ended up hiding under a shed after Tucker narrowly escaped having his right paw ripped off by a dog.  They both hid under a shed while the dog tried to get to them and were discovered by the owners of the shed soon afterwards. The Humane Society took them both and tried to nurse them to health, but Tucker's brother had severe signs of jaundice and died from liver failure just days after the shelter got them.For six months, Tucker was in foster care and the vets said his right paw would have to be amputated because the muscle was not reattaching to the ligaments.I adopted Tucker so that he would not have to spend the rest of his life in foster care and I do not regret the decision one bit.  When I adopted him two months ago, he was only 6 pounds and scared as hell.  Now that I have had him 2 months, his weight has reached a stable 10 pounds and he greets me at the door without me having to call him by name (He's usually running up to the door as soon as he hears my car pulling into the garage) and he cuddles in my lap or around my neck while I'm working on my art at my desk. Because I refused to have the leg amputated, Tucker not only has full control of that leg back, but has developed new muscle around the tear in his ligament that he is not just able to walk on that paw, but actively uses it when he plays and when he's catching the occasional housefly.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"I really had to wait for it!","title":"Dick Van Dyke, 98, Endorses Kamala Harris With Same Speech He Delivered at 1964 MLK Jr. Rally"},{"text":"Oh, good Lord, no!

That's a far cry from Thomas Paine, or any person who's given serious thought to individual liberties. Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. Like it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?Eventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? Fortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move.

For starters polling taken just after an assassination attempt is clearly going to skew the figures, similar to polling last year when Turmp was up on charges. When supporters see injustice, or worse a direct attempt on their guy's life, they're gonna be mad. A lot of respondents would simply be up for defending their counties interest with force against anyone.I find polls that delve into partisan animosity far more interesting.. In what should be a belief, support for partisan violence is fsr lower than what broader polling would suggest. As below-  Support for any type of partisan violence is low as fewer than 4% of Americans support violent crimes like assault or arson against political opponents.This one's interesting, and concerning given the numbers should really be 0%.. Slightly more D's support politically motivated murder than R's. Pretty wild that these numbers would indicate a few million people out there are ok with killing over political differences... In like manner, most Americans do not support politically-motivated murder. At 2.1%, Democrats show slightly higher levels of support for this type of partisan violence as compared to Republicans at 1.8%.Also interesting to see the demographics of people who support violence against their political opponents - the affluent, educated and presumably liberal is surprising, the extreme MAGA supporters not so much. I know who I'd back in a fight though... Support for partisan violence concentrates among young, male, wealthy, non-white, and more educated Americans, according to the report. Support for partisan violence for those under 30 is 5.8% as compared to 1.7% for those above 30, illustrating that young people support this type of violence at nearly three times the rate of the older age group. And among Republicans, MAGA Republicans support partisan violence 1.2 times more than other members of their partyAre colleges pumping their privileged students full of hate in the same way hard done by MAGA zealots indoctrinate themselves? Plenty more to look into, but I wanted to highlight a couple of the crazier findings...Food for thought [source](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/02/study-most-americans-do-not-support-partisan-violence)","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"I just voted blue along with my parents in rural mostly red small town wisconsin.

Provided we fund things properly and proceed safely. Not to mention possible medical breakthroughs that could really cure diseases and extend human longevity.Then.....we have the other party openly wishing we could go back to the 1700s.

Don't you love democracy?"},{"text":"[From 1992] \\"Many of the beings who have incarnated came to the United States because this is the land where you can make the most progress. This also happens to be a land where denial is pervasive. You believe that you live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, yet you live in the most controlled experimental society on the planet. The tyranny that has been set up here is rather interesting, because it is a tyranny without walls. As a country and a collective consciousness, the United States still has not reached an awareness that something is not right. The environment of the United States is actually much more controlled than that of the former Soviet Union, where the control was obvious. Because everyone is so frightened of giving up the system in the United States, they are going to be forced to give it up. The system is corrupt. It does not work. It does not honor life, and it does not honor Earth. That is the bottom line. If something does not honor life and does not honor Earth, you can bet it's going to fall and it's going to fall big time. Consciousness must change. This is part of the Divine Plan, and this opportunity and setup are not going to be missed. There has been an over involvement in the material world and a complete lack of understanding of the nonphysical world that exists all around you, so there will be a reprioritizing of what comes first in life. People will stand up once they have lost everything, who had never thought of standing up when they owned everything.Much of the political maneuvering going on, particularly in the United States, is purposely designed to separate you. Look at the New Age. Do you see how the New Age is separated? All kinds of things are said to keep you from discovering what you have in common. When people discover this, they will begin to get angry. As more and more of the methods of control and separation are revealed to you, the anger will build in the United States. Events will occur that may look as if the country is falling apart, yet they will serve the purpose of bringing people together. A new pride and a new sense of integrity will come about because this is what is designed for the times.\\" The material realm is one area that everyone relates to. Life in the United States translates into how much money you have in your pocket and how much money the government wants out of what you have in your pocket. Taxes will be the issue that will create both the greatest amount of havoc in the United States and the greatest amount of unification, because you all have taxes in common. You may not worship the same God, but you all pay taxes. With a few more taxes piled on top of one another, people will begin to examine the quality of their lives. You will see a lot of anger in this country, because many people will feel powerless. Anger is one of the first emotions that will occur when people finally understand the manipulation thats been going on and begin to get in touch with their feelings.\\" People who need to watch television are not tapping into the wealth of information within their minds and immediately accessible all around them. As a matter of fact, if you really want to evolve, do not read your newspapers, do not listen to the radio, and do not watch television. If you are able to be media free for periods of time and you disengage yourself from the frequency of chaos and anxiety and stress and hustle-bustle and temptations of all kinds that you dont need, you begin to get clear. You begin to listen to what is going on inside of yourself and to live in the world and not necessarily be lost in it. You become clear. We cannot emphasize this enough! The education system is another area where you are controlled. Most of what you are taught is false. You work hard, take loans out, and pay money to learn something that is antiquated before you even set foot in the door, particularly in the realms of scientific, mathematical, psychological, and medical exploration.\\"-Bringers of the Dawn- Teachings From the Pleiadians book; Chapter 8, Outside the Ultimate Tyranny-- 1992 [Channeled in 1988-1989]","title":"I ve never seen propaganda this heavy since the Iraq war!"},{"text":"Weird","title":"'Disqualifying': Critics Torch Trump After Ugly Last-Minute Attack On Nancy Pelosi"},{"text":"It ain't over until she's sworn in.","title":"Kamala Harris Pulled Off a Miracle"},{"text":"I was not aware of that speech and i had no idea how awesome Serling was outside of creating TZ.

One of the surprisingly unique things about Abrahamic religion in particular, so Judaism Christianity and Islam, is that it has this enduring quality and an ability to bind a community together. I don't think this is anywhere as evident as it is with the Jewish people. Beginning with the Assyrian invasion of the Northern nation of Israel around I think like 200 BCE, and then continuing into the Babylonian exile about 100 years later, the Jewish people found themselves a nation without a state. And as such they began to identify with this shared cultural heritage as opposed to a geographic location. And I say shared cultural heritage because around this time. In the world there really wasn't a concept of religion as separate from culture.So what ended up happening when the early Jewish religious texts were being curated, and this curation was happening in exile, you had a focus on building and enduring community and a resistance to assimilation. From an anthropological standpoint it's fascinating, it is not often that a group of people can maintain a cultural identity while being immersed in very different cultures. And while this is very evident with the early Jewish people, and the modern Jewish people for that matter, I believe a lot of that influence has impacted the growth of Christianity and Islam as well. Those religions tend to spread rather than adapt to new cultures as they encounter them. 2500 years of refining the recipe came up with something that resonates with people pretty well.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"V","title":"My friend went to vote today in IL (Democratic State) but when he went into the booth with his ballot it didnt pull up anything and said his ballot was recorded as No Vote Chosen and there was nothing they could do about it.

But I suspect that there is some legal leeway for the Admin to maneuver more freely when making rules regarding anything related to people who are below the federal poverty line than above. But here is the USDA's reasoning for the rule change:[Fees for Electronic Payment Services in the School Meal Programs](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/electronic-payments-fees)Although electronic payment services are convenient, CFPB found that the fees for using the services can significantly increase a familys total spending on the cost of school meals. Overall, CFPB estimates that these fees collectively cost families of students almost $100 million each year. This cost can disproportionately impact low-income families. For example, CFPB estimates that families receiving reduced price meal benefits may send $0.60 to payment processing companies for each $1 they spend on school lunch due to the frequency of deposits.^6 This financial burden on low-income families is compounded, because such families generally add money to their child(ren)s school meal account(s) more frequently compared to families who can afford to add greater amounts at a time.^7The ultimate goal of the Admin has been to make school lunches free altogether, they don't want to play around with junk fees either:Advancing a pathway to free healthy school meals for all is a priority set forth in the Biden-Harris Administrations White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health.Eight states have taken permanent actions to provide healthy school meals at no cost to all their students: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont.? But free school lunches is something they have been facing a significant amount of Congressional resistance over. So they use these stopgap measures, likely after a fair amount of legal review.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to End Online Junk Fees for Low-Income Families Paying for School Meals"},{"text":"Why only for low income families?","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to End Online Junk Fees for Low-Income Families Paying for School Meals"},{"text":" Even DeSantis - though hes just a smarter version of TrumpI think you mean shorter version of Trump","title":"Kamala Harris Pulled Off a Miracle"},{"text":"Id believe it when I see it.

For example, you can not find a cat with a build like a savannah at a shelter. When someone wants a larger shorthair cat, Savannah is pretty much the only choice. I would like to know why you think \\"looks\\" aren't valid, and what is included in looks? Is size bundled into your definition? Hair length? What if you like stripes, or what if you want an all black cat? I honestly don't believe there is anything unethical about desiring a specific look, just like it's not unethical to choose your shoes based on color and design.I also feel it would be unreasonable to expect someone to get a cat from a specific place just because those cats exist too. Getting what you want appearance-wise from a cat is absolutely not showing off and really has no link to ethics. Essentially when it comes to ethics is it fair to say you think someone showing off a cat is unethical? Ethically though, as long as the cat is not uncomfortable or being harassed, there really is no ethics violation. I am going to say that it is unethical to cast judgement on people for getting a cat from a breeder, the fact that other cats exist is entirely irrelevant.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"You think they would've figured out the whole \\"fees on poor kid's lunches\\" sooner","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to End Online Junk Fees for Low-Income Families Paying for School Meals"},{"text":"Uh, you might want to actually read the link you posted.NS has been calling the race too close to call for ages, including in the same source that the \\"gut\\" comment was from.You just posted a link saying that his latest simulations have Harris winning 50.015% of the time, so... still neck and neck.","title":"Nate Silver blinks - Kamala Harris suddenly becomes favorite to win in top election forecast"},{"text":"Not secretly friends my ass.","title":"US politics has been a stage for decades and Trump is fucking up the whole show"},{"text":"Good job voting!

Are you conflating left-wingers with what you call non-western men? Which group are we talking about? It is just happened, that Non-Western traditionalists dont have political power to have influence in Western politics and install their supremacy,I think you pretty much answered your own question. Western left-wingers are less vocal and less concerned about the beliefs of minority traditionalists by reason that they are not a relevant influence in their country's politics. That should not be confused with agreement with their views, it's just that concerns about their political influence are a low priority compared to the influence of christians in politics. The left-wing ideology greatly values secularism. This means simply that all religions should have equal freedom to practice their beliefs in the nation. So yeah...when one religious group is being oppressed by the actions or policies of another, then it is consistent with their beliefs to defend those minority groups.  so they fall into the category of oppressed ones, however the left-wingers fail to realize, that they are not their ideological allies. In fact they will be for Western equality until they will have the right to install their rules.I think most leftists recognize this. But part of the feature a secular laws is that they don't just protect minorities, they also prevent majority religions from \\"installing\\" their rules. So again, it is consistent to resist Christian influence in government because those same efforts prevent any other religions from overly-influencing the government. Look, we can reasonably discuss the merits of a secular society or not, but I don't think your characterization of left-wingers is fair. Their actions and views are consistent with regards to their secularist beliefs.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Thank you, Joe.","title":"Far from the race he once envisioned, Joe Biden closes out contest in Scranton"},{"text":"Guess Silver decided his \\"gut\\" was wrong.Until today, Silver was mocking Allan Lichtman and his 13 keys that was predicting a Harris victory by claiming with the polls tied Silver's gut was telling him that Trump would win.

It's right there in the word: false liberalism.-Wikipedia defines liberalism as, \\"A political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty, consent of the governed, political equality, right to private property and equality before the law.\\"  Paraliberalism is thus an ideology that seeks to invert liberalism in the guise of furthering its goals.  And this definition neatly encompasses the excesses of \\"woke culture.\\"  Let us address these in order.-A liberal believes in inalienable rights belonging to individuals.  A paraliberal believes that individual rights must bow to the collective interests of favored groups and society at large.-A liberal believes in, well, liberty.  Freedom of expression, association, action and transaction.  A paraliberal believes this is very dangerous and that people should be censored and cancelled (or worse, sometimes far worse) if they do not censor themselves.-A liberal believes in governance by consent of the governed.  A paraliberal views electoral victory as a mandate for tyranny for (at least) the remainder of the prescribed term - and an invitation to put a finger on the democratic scales going forward.-A liberal believes in political equality - one person, one vote.  A paraliberal believes in political equity - an apportionment of power among interest groups.-A liberal believes in private property, and with it market capitalism - risk and reward in equal measure, benefiting those who dare, innovate, and succeed.  A paraliberal believes in crony capitalism - the extraction of wealth from captured institutions into favored private hands.-A liberal seeks equal justice - the same punishment for the same crimes.  A paraliberal seeks equitable justice - the same total amount of punishment apportioned among favored and disfavored groups.-Thus \\"woke\\" paraliberals seek to undo everything that Western liberalism has accomplished under the guise of being the progressive vanguard of that very ideology.  As I'm sure you have gathered by now, it is not a belief system that I particularly care for.","title":"Armchair Warlord: I've never liked the term \\"woke.\\" Frankly, it means little and carries too many positive connotations.

This policy, effective school year 2027-2028, will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines C equal to $57,720 for a family of four C by ensuring they are not burdened by processing fees when purchasing school meals for their children.  Todays action is a first step. USDA will examine fees charged to families with a goal of eliminating online junk fees for all families regardless of income level to further remove barriers to access healthy meals. The U.S. Department of Agricultures Food and Nutrition Service issued a memo today to schools across the country about this policy. The school year 2027-2028 implementation date gives schools ample time to modify current systems or establish new contracts; however, USDA is encouraging schools to implement this requirement as soon as possible. The memo also reiterated USDAs longstanding policy that schools must offer all families a free and accessible method for making deposits to school meal accounts C and that schools must ensure families know about this option.  \\n...  \\nLast year, the Administration committed to bring down costs for Americans by cracking down on junk fees, which are hidden fees that increase costs for customers and bring financial stress on low-income families. And this year, USDA promised to bring relief to families of children who eat school meals, in response to a report from the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau which found that online school meal payments are raising costs for them. K-12 schools serve nutritious meals to about 30 million children every school day. While this policy applies to all students eligible for free or reduced lunch, it will most directly benefit the more than 1 million students who received reduced price school meals. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than $0.30 for breakfast and $0.40 for lunch. But some families end up paying more than that, by way of processing fees theyre charged when depositing money into their students school meals account using an online method. The policy announced today will ensure fairness for all students receiving meals at a reduced price, even when paying online. Schools may choose to use their own funds to cover the processing fees associated with online payment systems.  The memo also includes best practices schools can use to inform families of the payment methods available that do not add fees.*Healthy School Meals for All*Advancing a pathway to free healthy school meals for all is a priority set forth in the Biden-Harris Administrations White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health.   Eight states have taken permanent actions to provide healthy school meals at no cost to all their students: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont.?  Meanwhile, in other states, many schools in high-need areas provide free meals to all their students through the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. Last year, USDA gave an estimated 3,000 more school districts the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost by expanding the availability of CEP.*Support for Healthy Kids*USDA is committed to helping kids lead healthy lives. The Department has taken several actions to bolster programs that provide critical nutrition to infants and children. Specific to the school meal programs, USDA has provided a total of nearly $13.2 billion in extra financial support for schools across the country since 2021.  \\n...Statement from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack:USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grown and thrive, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. While todays action to eliminate extra fees for lower income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to End Online Junk Fees for Low-Income Families Paying for School Meals"},{"text":"They should be able to do both.

Trumps strongest voters have not watched any news other than Fox News for ten years. They do not know reality and are devoid of individual thought. This isnt meant to be rude, its simply true. Fox News viewers will tell you the world is hell with migrants everywhere, houses stolen, crime rates higher than ever, gangs killing people, children having gender reassignment surgeries in school - but then live every single day of their life without ever experiencing any of this beyond what the TV tells them is happening. None of it happens to them, yet they believe it is happening to everyone. Devoid of thought.Republicans like Trump have been creating this base for decades by creating they vs. them scenarios and defunding public education. If your voters cant think beyond what you tell them, they will always be your voters. With no thought and information control - republican voters will never have any opinions other than what they are fed. They certainly arent going to turn on CNN and see their dude struggling to walk and asking for naps during a campaign.","title":"Kamala Harris moves aheadjustin our final election forecast\\n"},{"text":"The people in this sub are 90% of the way to figuring things out but somehow still 100% off the mark.","title":"US politics has been a stage for decades and Trump is fucking up the whole show"},{"text":"She was Kate Hudson a Christian Rocker before becoming Katy Perry...She also did a very high profile voting for Hilary in 16 with camera crew and all","title":"Kamala Harris concert rallies: Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ricky Martin, more perform"},{"text":"I don't have much good to say about the Biden administration but their work on consumer protections and ending junk fees for subscription services and ticket fees has been outstanding.

I actually think rejecting the false choice of two corrupted parties is the best thing to strengthen true democracy over the long term. So here are some alternative suggestions:1. Support Local and Independent Candidates: Start by engaging in local politics, where independent and third-party candidates often have a better chance of success. 2. Advocate for Electoral Reforms: Promote and support reforms that increase voter choice and representation. This includes advocating for ranked-choice voting, open primaries, proportional representation, and campaign finance reform. 3. Build and Support Civic Education: Encourage and participate in civic education initiatives that focus on democratic principles, critical thinking, and media literacy.4. Get Involved in Community Organizing: Grassroots movements and community organizing are powerful ways to build change from the ground up. 5. Hold Elected Officials Accountable: Engage regularly with elected officials and let them know that supporting policies contrary to values and/or democratic principles will cost them your support.6. Support Independent Journalism and Media: Quality, independent journalism is crucial. Start supporting independent media outlets and amplifying fact-based reporting to counteract the influence of biased or corporate media.7. Participate in Non-Partisan Civic Organizations: Join or support organizations dedicated to democratic reform, transparency, and human rights. 8. Encourage Dialogue and Bridge-Building: Actively seek to understand diverse perspectives and create spaces for dialogue with those across the political spectrum. 9. Promote Ethics and Accountability in Government: Advocate for stronger ethical standards for government officials, including transparency in financial dealings, limits on lobbying, and term limits for elected positions.","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"Yep, that effect is called \\"herding\\" where they trend towards a central response so as not to be the blatantly wrong outliers.","title":"Kamala Harris Slashes Donald Trump's Lead Among Men in Final Poll"},{"text":"I did that even in my swing state.

I have good eyesight and was struggling to see as I filled out my ballot. There also did not appear to be bathrooms readily available to people while they waited or even once inside the voting area, which made me wonder how older folks and people who brought kids with them were handling that. They also were telling people in our long line that if they were not inside by the location's close (3 PM on weekdays during early voting), they would have to come back another time, which seems like pretty blatant voter suppression. I don't know if they have the same approach on Election Day (I sure hope not!), but we were pretty frustrated by that, given how incredibly long our line was - it kept growing as we stood there, too. Luckily, we were inside by 2:25 PM when we were there, so we got to vote after an hour or so of waiting outside in cold wind. As for St. Charles County itself, we had 2 early voting locations, both of which were pretty far north and in this location's case, west, with nothing down south or east in the county. I appreciate that we have early voting, but for a county as large in population and geography as ours, we need more locations that are more evenly distributed in the county.","title":"First Time Voter"},{"text":"If there were Epstein/Trump evidence, believe me, Harris would have released it to save her campaign.

Fortunately her disability isnt super debilitating (she was originally intended to be a breeding cat, she acquired nerve damage that would prevent her from giving live birth) but I would absolutely purchase a Bengal in the future if I couldnt rescue. Being able to not only mitigate my allergies, but being able to access some health history is a huge boon and offers peace of mind. I know what medical issues to keep an eye out for and she had been health tested as a kitten. As sad as it is, theres always a chance that you adopt a shelter cat that has significant health problems. I very much believe in rescuing (my dog is a rescue adoption!) but its easy enough for me to understand why someone may not want to gamble so much with genetics. Im close to a family that brought home two shelter kittens, both of which ended up dying just a couple of months post-adoption from health problems that no one knew about. It was *devastating* for the family. While theres obviously never a health guarantee simply from being aware of genetics, youre a lot more likely to take appropriate preventative care when you know what to look for.Consider that human adoptees are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to health history they could live their entire life not knowing that their family has a high history of cancer, possesses significant heart disease risk, or is genetically predisposed to carrying horrible diseases. While it obviously isnt an exact equivalence, its a good example of how knowing health history and predisposition can both save stress, money, and lives. I can look at my cat and know hip dysplasia is a distinct possibility as she heads into her sunset years, so I *proactively* take measures for preventative care.

And while the founding fathers of the United States were heavily influenced by the enlightenment and were largely deists, at the community level Christianity has always been very prominent.

The city experienced a boom as a result of increased oil drilling activity in the area but since then, oil companies have been importing more oil since it's cheaper, and the whole area and population has been in decline.At one point, the world's largest shopping mall was located in the area.  That shut down prior to Katrina.  The whole east New Orleans region is in decay.  It makes no sense to do any development out there that isn't industrial, and even then, it remains to be seen if the location is practical.  Plus Louisiana has a long history of enticing corporations to come to the state, then screwing them over.  Most recently they keep doing this with the film industry: one minute there's tax breaks, the next there isn't.   This often is the result of the alternation of republican and democratic governors.  When the republicans are in, they unleash fossil fuel industry restrictions and screw everybody else, including any deals previous administrations made with industries they deem \\"un-friendly\\" to the right.Right now, Louisiana has a governor that's more concerned with forcing schools to display the 10 commandments and taking children's scholarships away if they don't kneel for the national anthem, than they are in fostering a healthy business environment.The reason the park failed is precisely because they decided to build an amusement park in an area that was in decline - they ignored all the market research.   And then they proceeded to design a park in the swamps that had virtually no shade.  It was dumb from the start.  The only brilliant move made was getting Six Flags to buy it.","title":"A former Six Flags park is finally being demolished after Hurricane Katrinas devastation"},{"text":"Ah, ok lets do that then. And genuinely, I want to educate you here. The establishment has planned this since his initial run in 2015. None of this has happened by accident. They CATAPULTED him into the nomination with incessant media coverage. Albeit often negative, the coverage made him appear as an outsider, an unexpected curve ball. This is the basis of his appeal with his base. Hes not like other politicians!The elite knew they had to cull an organic grassroots uprising of dissent, so to do this, they nip it in the bud by getting out in front of these sort of uprisings by placing their agents there first. A self made billionaire outsider who tells it like it is; perfect for the dumb fuck American public. Also, theyll make him an intentionally divisive and controversial figure, brand him as intolerant to that his entire base is characterized as that by design as well. You see how the foundation of this culture war we are in today is being formulated with this? Once the public trusts the controlled opposition candidate, they can steer that movement wherever they want, and they effectively absorb and neutralize the organic effectiveness of a grassroots uprising. But they attack him so much, clearly hes not in the big club! Au Contraire. You see, thats the exact reason why you trust Mr Trump in the first place.  Youre not dazzled with his articulate political points. Youre not moved by his compelling speeches. You simply see him seemingly being attacked by the establishment, and thats enough to establish street credibility for you that he is not in the club. Never mind his previous term where he continued the policies of the cabal (and didnt challenge them worth a fuck at All). Never mind his Rothschild connections via his Sec. of Comm, Wilbur Ross (banker who fixed his bankruptcy fuck up in the 90s).At the end of the day, you took the bait and embraced an obvious PLANT, and fell for the kayfabe because you let your unchecked hope and optimism override your skepticism. Childish behavior.Because of that, because you set your skepticism aside, we now have to deal with this fucking mess. A bunch of former skeptics who once viewed the left right paradigm as a mechanism of control and the electoral process as merely a charade to provide us with illusion of choice, are now chode deep into a psyop.

We have some sick people, radical left lunatics, and  **it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the National Guard, or if really necessary by the military**, because they cant let that happen.\\" This turned into the closing argument of the Harris campaign, claiming that Trump had promised to unleash the military on his political opponents.
