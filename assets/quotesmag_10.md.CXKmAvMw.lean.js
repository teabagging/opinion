Hell, you might even ask the public if they care about it and they might nod their heads sagely, but they literally don't know what the defiit is 99% of the time. They don't even know what a tariff is most of the time.To the Democrats credit, they will get the dam back in shape, and the public will just walk right past them to vote for republicans because by then the republican talking point has moved to \\"lowering taxes (for the mega rich, not you)\\". After all, the deficit is managed, best leave it alone and go to talking point #2. The republicans then break the dam again.

My buddy and I used to ghost hunt. It was really just going to spooky places with a few voice recorders, walking around and asking questions. One night, we decided to leave  a voice recorder in a cemetery near where we were camping and planned to just grab it in the AM before we left. That night, I had  sleep paralysis, normally its just a silhouette of a person/demon that starts by watching me in the corner and then approachs me and holds me down and snarls at me. When morning finally came, we went to get the recorder, and it was not where we left it. It was like 10 feet away, so that was kinda strange, but grabbed it and left. Later, listening to it, a few hours into the recording, we heard movement, and something started scratching it, and the snarl we heard on the recorder was so similar to my paralysis demon and I got full body chills and started freaking out. Logically, there had to be an explanation of what this was, so I went to Google. Turns out my my paralysis demon was a raccoon that tried to steal my voice recorder, and it was pure coincidence that both things happened the same night.","title":"People who suffer from sleep paralysis, what do your demons look like?"},{"text":"Dont forget how the billionaires got richer during the pandemic and everyone else got screwed!","title":"Trump Losing in 2020 Was Always Part of the Script"},{"text":"Excellent.

After the initial panic, it was like someone turned a light on, literally and figuratively, and I thought Oh, sleep paralysis, itll go away. And it did!The worst episode, or scariest I guess, started when I fell asleep on my couch. At this point, my strategy when I realized I was temporarily paralyzed was to just go back to sleep which worked a treat, usually. This time, I had a VIVID waking dream that I had fallen off of the couch and wrapped my blanket around my neck in the process. To add to the sheer terror I was already feeling, I was still kind of aware that I was experiencing sleep paralysis, but it wouldnt fucking stop, and every time Id manage to move even just an inch, that would somehow cause the blanket to get tighter around my neck.

One can be sex positive while acknowledging the true, recent history of pornography in its current medium and how harmful it can be to both women and men.

However, I can logically apply what Ive learned about it through years of research to form an informed understanding. Or do you want to ban me from sharing what I know from an academic viewpoint?Yes, Im extremely familiar with the feminist movement of the 70s.

The fact is, you cannot just make wild claims that most women of a certain age hate other women. Thats one hell of a generalization.

He didn't want this to fall into German hands, because heavy water is incredibly rare and difficult to obtain in significant quantity, and it can be used to help refine weapons-grade Uranium.When he reached safety, he realized that he had screwed up. The bottle he was carefully transporting across multiple continents was not, in fact, heavy water, but a bottle of beer.Realizing his mistake, and knowing that he couldn't let the Germans get their hands on his bottle of heavy water, he got a message back to the Danish resistance.

I also think the clown that sat in the oval office and his cackling side-kick served a purpose. 1. Trump got the ball rolling with the \\"untested\\" vaccine. Had to get conservatives to at least accept it. Liberal, on the other hand were vehemently against it. Their body, their choice. Orange man a racist and a dictator for wanting them to jab, mask and do lockdowns.2. Get the Democrat candidate into office and low and behold! Liberals are fully on-board. Not only that, liberals were weaponized. Their ability to collectively protest and display righteous indignation dwarfs anything conservatives could ever hope to muster. Now, it no longer \\"your body your choice\\". Now it's you should lose your ability to work, privilege to travel, and you should cease to exist if you don't get vaxxed and wear your F'n mask! There is some PTSD associated with all that. Living overseas, it seems like the masses are ready to snap in line for the next go-around.3. Liberals were not bothered one bit that the Country would seem to be on auto-pilot if the office of President was so important to cause the meltdowns it caused when Trump was put into office. Completely blind to the Biden character being just about completely incapacitated. Conservatives were given a pillow they could punch and make fun of for 4 years. It almost seemed like it was a psyop to see how blind to the obvious bs they could make at least 50% of the US. I remember when MSM lost their shit for days when Trump had a small stumble once down a inclined walkway. Liberals got right in line and parroted the MSM line. Biden spent his 4 years stumbling, bumbling, mumbling every day...on camera, even overseas representing the USA. Not a peep from the left.4. Biden bows out and HANDS the candidacy for presidency to Harris and her joke VP choice Ensuring that Trump could win with no 2020 shenanigans needed. No protests this time. No fires. No dramatic 3am turnaround. nothing.  \\nSo...what's it going to be these 4 years? What will Trump and Musk do that will get conservatives moving in the needed direction?

Until this year.??Callahan, 67, cast his ballot for President-elect Donald Trump because of concerns about rising costs of living and fears that Democratic leaders didnt have a plan to fix the economy.?A longtime resident of Lynn, a suburb just four miles north of the liberal enclave of Boston, Callahan said he isnt sure whether Trumps policy proposals will lower prices at the pump, or in the grocery aisle. But hes hopeful the former president will at least make a change.Everything was too expensive. What we had wasnt working, Callahan said, as he stood on a cracked sidewalk lining a row of local take-out restaurants and convenience stores in the suburbs downtown.As the dust of the 2024 election settles, the rightward bent of voters like Callahan in historically liberal-leaning states has laid bare the sweeping nature of the Democratic Partys problems with its once trusty base of working-class voters.?Those challenges, felt predominately in the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan in Pennsylvania after the 2016 election, have now emerged in hundreds of former union and Democratic strongholds across the country, even in places like deep-blue Massachusetts.\\"This is the opening bit of the article, and it's pretty weird that, while the article talks about Dems losing the \\"working class\\", it starts out talking to a guy who lives in some suburb outside of Boston and tells us exactly nothing about him...including whether he is even working class, or what the article understands \\"working class\\" to be.They never fill in any details about this guy later in the article, either. They never come back to him. They do mention this brief bit about Lynn, MA:\\"Lynn saw a more than 11% increase in support for Trump. Roughly 15% of people in the 101,000-person city have a college degree, significantly less than the 48% of people across the whole state who hold a bachelors degree or higher. \\"Are we supposed to assume this guy is working class purely because of where he lives (ie a suburb outside a city)? Because there are *lots* of ways a suburbanite might not be working class.Are we to assume that \\"working class\\" means simply that a person didn't go to college? Did this guy not go to college? He lives in a place that has low college graduation rates, but they don't say whether he did. Also, whether or not you went to college has *nothing* to do with being working class -- a lot of local business owners don't have college degrees, for instance.The problem with this is that I do agree the Dems have problems attracting the working class...but *I* understand \\"working class\\" to be people who get the majority of their income from selling their labor. It has nothing to do with whether they did or did not go to college, or where they live.And if the Dems and their sympathetic media hear the term \\"working class\\" and interpret it to mean \\"suburbanites without college degrees\\", they are going to learn the exact wrong lessons.Because a lot of \\"suburbanites without college degrees\\" are actually rich boomers in McMansions living off pensions from unions they are actively undermining and/or the sale of houses at fortuitous times during the market/rental income and/or small business owners (landscaping companies, car dealerships, etc).?And there's nothing working class about them -- they make their money by owning things, not selling their labor, and their material incentives are in direct *opposition* to the much more numerous people who *do* sell their labor. They are *owners*, not workers.And focusing more on accommodating them is the *opposite* of \\"embracing the working class\\".This is a disturbing sign that the Dems have so thoroughly forgotten the material working class that they don't even know who they are, and don't even talk to them.","title":"Democrats lost working-class voters to Trump D even in this blue bastion"},{"text":"Dude farts and poop stuff literally NEVER is not funny!!!!

That's my theory anyway, I haven't the slightest clue how right or wrong I am about that.The weirdest thing I ever experienced was this one time I was locked in, but my left arm was free for some reason.

I think that in California there is a big server farm full of chatbots that work 24/7 inflate the left-wing politics. I think Trump has every intention to move into California when he is elected.  I think goal is to do this via legal means. But I think some backup solutions exist as well. For example the early election victory speech where Trump says he's going to send troops to South America to fight cartels. This gives Trump the mandate to mobilize troops within the US.  He may or may not use these troops to raid  California tech companies should court proceeding drag on for too long.  While extreme , the threat alone can expedite the legal proceedings. Focus right now for tech companies would be to  destroy as much electronic evidence as possible , in case things turn sour.Thats what I would do.  No need to let the left-wing propaganda machine run at full tilt if Trump has already been elected . Which might mean less activity.

Republicans have built an entire campaign around their culture wars and \\"woke culture\\" histrionics. This is what they do. Moral panics, fearmongering campaigns, threat after threat to \\"western culture,\\"  propagandistic news cycles featuring political agitators and narratives warning the public about the latest \\"radical leftist\\" plot of the week, and all for the sake of stirring up outrage, arousing hate and validating the prejudices, phobias and paranoid delusions of a seething faction of conservatives.Despite all the histrionics from conservatives on social media this election cycle about the radical left's plot to indoctrinate the masses with transgender and anti-white pedagogy, to perform sex change operations on students and immigrants against their will, to \\"groom\\" children and expose them to pornography in schools, to flood women's sports with men, to force children to attend drag shows, to expose young kids to graphic material in class, to use the education system to recruit children into the LGBTQ and cultural Marxist movement, to use companies to promote the transgender and gay agenda.Despite the hysteria from conservatives around critical race theory, \\"DEI\\" and affirmative action initiatives, \\"anti-racism,\\" imposed white guilt, a radical and secular agenda that's persecuting Christians, a \\"defund the police\\" movement that only a fringe minority of liberals actually took literally, while most were merely asking for accountability, the addressing of racial injustices, profiling, stereotyping, police brutality, and better de-escalation training for police officersdespite all this culture war driven panic and outrage, voters did not turn out en masse to protect their children from a long list of LGBTQ boogeymen, voters did not turn out in solidarity against the \\"woke mind virus.\\"Because it's all a bunch of propaganda and scare tactics, the same old story told again and again about some liberal agenda to transform American culture into something depraved, abnormal, irreligious, and evil.The key drivers this election were the economy, foreign policy and immigration, while most Americans, and low propensity voters in particular, have entirely memory-holed Trump's disastrous economic and foreign policy record, and the fact that Republicans would rather run on immigration as a fearmongering wedge issue, than actually address it with policies that aren't extreme, non-viable, impractical and inhumane...But let's address the hysteria around \\"wokeness.\\" Conservatives claim that it's \\"the left\\" who are obsessed with race, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc... but what I see is often the opposite. Where figures on \\"the right\\" constantly condemn \\"woke culture\\" and criticize a liberal, racial, gender or DEI related agenda whenever the opportunity presents itself. I see conservatives instigating this culture war conflict disproportionately more than I see liberals living up to these criticismsLet's not forget that the modern Republican party was built off of a conservative movement that thrived by inciting racial tensions, scapegoating minorities, and appealing to the grievances of white southerners in particular who were dismayed by civil rights legislation, desegregation, and law and order dog whistling that inculcated white conservatives with fears of racial crime in their neighborhoods.Think about the modern panic around critical race theory and cultural Marxism, and how we are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting for parents, albeit accurate. Think about how some conservatives now claim that racism is over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat. Think about the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives haven't even read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think about all the fearmongering and misinformation surrounding immigrants, and how Republicans have emboldened an ultra nationalistic, nativist, white supremacist movement in this country.Think about how Republicans highlight isolated black crimes in particular in order to raise fears. Think about how every time there's a mass shooting, Republicans direct the conversation to gun violence and murder rates in places like Chicago, when the reality is, rates of gun violence and death rates are highest in Republican-led states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, Alaska etc...Think about the outrage and panic centered around Bud Light after the company sent a single custom can to a transgender personality. Think about the moral outrage directed at target for selling rainbow sandals and t shirts. These are just a couple of examples where conservatives act like a coalition of liberals got together and forced these things to happenThink about all of the increased transphobic and homophobic rhetoric from conservatives every time \\"Pride Month\\" arrives, or how often they promote the idea of a \\"straight pride parade\\" as some kind of joke. Even though pride month was first recognized in 1999, and pride parades have been around for 50+ years.Think about all of the outrage around \\"DEI.\\"Think about all the race related criticisms that Letitia James received, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.Think about how when gay or black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Think about how when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives rally around them and claim *their* appeal to black people.Think about the AI images that circulated over social media of Donald Trump posing with black people.Think about Trump's disingenuous showings at black events, where he sometimes rambles on incoherently about how he's done more for black people than Abraham Lincoln, or remarks that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black.Think about the outrage over litter boxes in schools. Think about how race, gender identity and sexual orientation in particular are the target of countless Republican-led legislative efforts.Think about Republicans wanting to roll back civil rights based on sex or gender discrimination.And all the fearmongering centered around the LGBTQ movementOr how conservatives are so obsessed with pronouns, that they can't help but constantly make the same \\"joke\\" over and over again, \\"mY pRonOunS arE...\\" while crying God have mercy if anyone uses non-heteronormative pronouns, sometimes literally passing bills to prevent it.Oh, and the very disturbing fixation on pedophilia and conspiracy theories centered around child sex abuse rings and their bizarre tendency to accuse their opponents of being pedophiles.The point being, who's really obsessed with these things?","title":"James Carville says Americas woke hangover haunted Harris campaign, damaged Democratic brand"},{"text":"No, not at all.

Basically, when Ireland left the United Kingdom, the UK decided to give Ireland special status so they wouldn't be treated the same as any other foreign country, which included the right to travel and work in the UK without visas or passport checks. They also gave Irish citizens the right to vote in Westminster elections if living in the UK. But many decades later, some British residents in Ireland complained that this was unfair, because Irish citizens living in the UK can vote in Westminster elections but British citizens living in Ireland can't vote in Irish national elections. So Ireland held a referendum to decide if they should have that right, and in 1984, Ireland voted to pass the [Ninth Amendment of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland), with a whopping 75.4% voting Yes, to allow the State to extend the right to vote to non-Irish citizens.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 30, 2024"},{"text":"Problem is most Americans don't know those things passed because Democrats messaging is abysmal.And continues to be abysmal.","title":"Joe Biden's legacy will end-up being the accomplishment of very boring but extremely effective things."},{"text":"Well if that's the case that's a shame.

The dem party cannot win with just their base, and the left/progressive wing had learned it, and they believe their vote must be earned not pragmatically chosen.

So for clarity, the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals and are employed. To answer your question directly, mostly yes. It is very difficult for an immigrant to be a net negative for the economy since they are not eligible for most government services. Unemployed immigrants are generally elderly family members being supported by family members, not the government. Elders also provide value to the economy by providing emotional support and childcare for their families. Unemployed working age immigrants are very rare, and are typically day laborers or under the table workers, both of whom provide benefit to the economy.Criminals are more nuanced, but you wont get argument from me that violent criminals are prime candidates for deportation. Very small portion of the immigrant population though.As for space and blue cities, again, disingenuous. An immigration system should be designed to distribute immigrants equally across the nation. Cities and rural areas are both eligible to play a role, but cities by definition have less space than rural areas. The problem with the current bossing is that red states are missing large numbers of immigrants to cities without notice, putting the blue cities in a tough spot. It is an artificially created problem. Do border communities have to deal with large numbers of unexpected immigrants? Absolutely, and that is why we need to secure the border. But that is also a naturally occurring problem rather than an artificially created one.","title":"Democratic-controlled cities are finalizing plans to oppose mass deportation"},{"text":"This old nutsack is still around?","title":"Carville: Harris campaigns unfathomable spending hurt Democrats"},{"text":"She has more insider trading to do","title":"Nancy Pelosi shows no sign of freeing the Democratic Party from her grip"},{"text":"How about mandating civics classes and funding holding kids back who cant read, let alone understand how gov works","title":"Never mind facts, it will still be the dems fault"},{"text":"Gray came within only 500 votes of winning in 2022.

Because Trump has no successor. Even if he DOES get some kind of miraculous quirk that lets him run again in 2028, the dude is literally 1 and 3/4ths feet in the grave already. He's simply not going to last that long. Everyone keeps saying Vance will take his place, but I don't see it. He doesn't have an ounce of Trump's charisma and I can't see him taking the reigns of MAGA. Same with DeSantis or any of these other pretenders to the throne. His kids are unlikable dipshits who will fold like fucking paper after Trump croaks. They don't have the shit. They're just the Succession brood writ real.But there's no one else. Trump has not bothered grooming or making his supporters prepared for someone new to lead him. He's likely just going to keel over from a grabber and leave his entire administration and movement in total disarray.Honestly, I think in the next four years we're going to see a media figure or someone in the streaming community come in like a dark horse and take over the movement. Someone young enough and non-establishment enough could revitalize the party, especially given it's popularity among young men.Could be someone like Rogan, or someone younger, but I think they're all going to be seeing the potential here. They can court new-money donors like Musk and Thiel and other tech bros. The big challenge for MAGA is going to be getting loyalists in congress. This is where they've really stalled. MAGA congresspeople generally do horrible in local elections, because Republican voters don't like to shit where they eat. They're happy to send a ranting lunatic to DC like lobbing a frag grenade, but with a few notable exceptions, they don't follow suit locally.

(And he actually had the best betting odds among all the democratic candidates for \\"winning the general election IF they are nominated\\").     \\n         \\nHe had a unique gift for successfully selling more liberal leaning policies to independents and even conservatives... which somehow people spun as a bad thing?  People claim that Republicans brainwash working class people into voting against their own interest, but then when somebody like Yang is able to actually get through to them and convince them to support him even though most of his policies would often be considered more liberal, people just say \\"fuck him, too many conservatives are willing to support him!\\"     \\n      \\nI have a lot of family who are conservative.  They were fairly conservative in 2015, and have since gone full MAGA and voted for Trump three times now.  Two of them helped me collect signatures for Yang and even came to a Yang rally and were chanting \\"Yang beats Trump!\\" as enthusiastically as the rest of the crowd.  He got republican voters on board with universal healthcare.  On board with dramatic financial improvements for the working class.  Today those family members can't stop ranting about the woke mind virus, but they were willing to collect signatures and go to rallies for a candidate who enthusiastically supports things like same sex marriage.  He was quite popular among men, while still being strongly pro women's rights and pro choice and stuff.  If people could have stepped outside their bubbles and saw what I saw, they would have realized what a powerful candidate he could have been.    \\n        \\nSadly he was just starting from too low a position.  When he first told people he was going to run for president, many of them literally said \\"president of what?\\" (His friends and family and stuff thought meant like of the co-op board or something).  The fact that he got up to 5% nationally by Iowa was an incredible accomplishment given his starting position, and he was one of the top candidates in fundraising from small donors.  But all the debates were way too crowded, and (for reasons that I believe included racism) he was last in talk time pretty much every time, even often behind people polling way behind him.  He still ran a WAY more successful campaign than Harris though, even though she started from such a stronger position.     \\n       \\nSadly it was often far left people who were slandering and attacking him the most... even though his signature policy was an unprecedented massive reoccurring wealth transfer that would primarily benefit poorer and working class Americans, and also supported things like universal healthcare.  Like what the fuck  And so much lies and slander, I lost track of how many times he was called a \\"billionaire tech bro\\" when he had a lower networth than Sanders (and I think lower than everybody but Mayor Pete).            \\n       \\nAnd almost everybody shit on him for campaigning with Dean Phillips trying to primary Biden, and they all owe him a big fucking apology... given that running for a second term in your 80s was an insane decision, and biden trying to run again quite likely cost democrats the election and put Trump back in office.","title":"A (Way-Too-Early) List of Possible Democratic Presidential Contenders in 2028"},{"text":"Just because it was in the past doesn't mean you can call it hindsight.

USA homogeny is dwindling and now the real power vacuum has begun.Russia literally does everything, every single thing that they point out in the corrupt west. Lets go down the list. Military industrial complex, they literally have their own. Check. Rigging elections? Check. Mass censorship? Check. Killing of opposition? Check. Crushing political people that can challenge the status quo? Super check. Endless wars? Count how many conflicts they have been in since just Putin alone.Check.Mass immigration? Muslim populations imported from the far east into Moscow etc for cheap labor. Which now has come to a point of many clashings between them and local population. Check.Annexation of land? And weapons sales? Destabilizing neighboring nations, toppling regimes putting in puppets? Check.Concentration of wealth into the oligarchs? Super check.They chose specific topics that most of the sane world agrees and uses it as a spotlight to blind the ignorant. Those topics being anti alphabet people, anti gmo. And family based values.

He went a step further and set himself up to pretty much be the Presidents top advisor.  Or more likely the Presidents boss if were being realistic.

In 2010, the average wait time was 1.5 hours in the cities, and around 45 minutes in rural locations, so the next argument is that it was always longer in cities ignoring that used to be twice as long and now it is at least 8 times as long.  If you are a conservative, it is a great system that really cuts down the number of democrats voting while allowing you to cry some really impressive crocodile tears about how the system is actually fair.

Theres so much misimformation and echo chambers out there. It doesnt matter if you appeal to authority, throw some peer reviewed papers against the wall, nothing sticks - see climate change, covid. I think this will either end in 1) countries becoming more authoritarian (the illiberal side has to win only once - see Orban, Putin, and likely Trump or 2) censorship of media (which again, is not democratic. But maybe the only way to save democracy). Right now we are very vulnerablr here in Europe against propaganda and agitprop from ehm certain state actors. people will never agree on anything if they are allowed to pick their informations, now matter how distorted or wrong, to fit their preconcived bias. Either we find a solution or we end like the US. Or worse. Add AI to that and you got the perfect storm. We are decaying, partly, because we are democracies. Try funding pro EU media in Russia or support movememts there, they will be imprisoned, banned or dead faster than you can think.

The facts are that there is some non zero amount of voter fraud and saying that there wasn't any is notOkay, but that's worse. It's just retrospectively applying tone-policing to explain the effect of misinformation being higher than it might have been. It doesn't even dispute the actual problem, just frames it as not absolute, as if anything with people is perfectly black and white. And what you said being true, it's a bad sign, not a good sign.So directly right there, you have people on both sides of that who were misled and that is a very clear pattern in modern politics. It is not as clean as \\"there's the truth and half the population doesn't believe it\\" and that ties into what I said earlier about democrats losing the election because they don't actually understand the opposition.Also worse. Wow, that's so much worse. If one side was magically 100% perfect, that would at least undermine a huge amount of handwaving dismissals of problems with rhetoric in our democracy. Meanwhile, trying to balance the concerted election denial of 2020 against \\"actually, voter fraud does happen\\" is silly. Brandolini's law explains the issue nicely. The fact that one side, so to speak, is held to a vastly higher standard even on this topic is part of a huge, huge problem.","title":"CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only"},{"text":"Yes, I don't understand how people don't see that. The US was in a bad place in the recession era not just domestically but foreign policy-wise due to Iraq. The public was fully against anything that seemed like interventionism. On top of that the EU and US allies were extremely skeptical about US leadership. Voters in Europe didn't want their own politicians to follow the US lead as much. I remember in 2011 Canada and a lot of Western Europe had surpassed America in many respects. The US has since with the implementation of the ACA, and having strong GDP growth compared to Europe now made a full comeback internationally. Russia invading Ukraine also was an eye opener for Europe as well I think. Also the lack of intervention in Syria potentially caused a refugee crisis. Obama was expected to wrap up US conflicts and pare down the need for interventions. A mixture of reality and Trump policies along with Biden being significantly more protectionist than Obama has created a different world structure now. Trump and Biden are much more willing to enact protectionist policies. Trump because of a poor understanding of economics, Biden because he falsely believed that he would undercut Trump support if he was a better version of Trump in some elements. Obama was perfectly fine on foreign policy. He built up US soft power at a time when interventionism was off the table. He kept relations good enough and promoted globalism which contributed to a low inflation rate. He ended up ramping up pressure on China. Made deals to increase European NATO contributions. Even with Iran, he did calm down the conflict there. We don't know what would have happened there if Trump had not blown that up. In fact Trump imposing Tariffs unnecessarily created a much more hostile competitive world rather than one where cooperation was on the table. There was no going back. After Trump was elected countries saw the US as volatile. They saw that they could exploit the partisanship in the US to benefit themselves. If you think about it Russia being more cooperative with the anti-NATO guy makes sense. China as Russia are exploiting the fact that they have consistent leadership and policies due to essentially having no political parties and no elections to worry about. Meanwhile the US leadership spends the majority of their time concerned about politics and positioning themselves to win elections. During Obama's administration there was more foreign policy consensus between the two parties. Romney vs. Obama on foreign policy was mostly agreement, the only disagreement was about how aggressive the US should be. Reality wasn't debated. Now there are much more legitimate rifts.","title":"How Biden Made a Mess of Ukraine"},{"text":"Democrats have become extremely too risk adverse with foreign policy.

I think of it like the maturation process of an individual. There comes a point when kids realize that their parents are not the infallible being they thought. When that happens their map of reality has to re-organize and incorporate the new information. Social media has made apparent how easily people can be manipulated, in many ways it shows us the worst parts of ourselves. We are now in the process of assimilating all that information. You might be right that there is a decay.  On the other hand throughout history there are stories about the cycle of death and rebirth like the Phoenix.

Without immigration, Canada would be facing similar issues as other counties like Japan. But Japan has a ton of exports and reserves, which is helping but is only a temporary patch. Conversely, they dont have a robust immigration population, they simply dont have a to of people looking to immigrate, so their population decreases and then theres less people to care for the elderly and replace jobs that people retire from.
