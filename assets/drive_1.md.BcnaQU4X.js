The town of Sinope was right next to a stretch of land occupied by a super primitive tribe called the Mossynoeci (proto-Georgians) who are described in Xenophon's *Anabasis* as \\"doing in public what we are accustomed to doing in private, and doing in private what we are accustomed to doing in public\\" (approximate quote). In practice, this meant that they had sex in public and walked around nude but also talked to themselves and cracked jokes with themselves. They painted their skin and wore butterfly tattoos and otherwise acted very much like an uncontacted tribe.Again reiterating that there is no way of proving this: it seems plausible to me that Diogenes may have, at some point in his youth, encountered members of this tribe, observed how they were living, and had the quite natural thought (one that almost seems to have occurred to Xenophon): why is *that* \\"uncivilized,\\" while whatever we Greeks do is \\"civilized\\"? Why is it civilized to shit in a jar and live in a house, and not to live in a jar and shit on a house? Diogenes may have had a cultural relativist epiphany and turned theory into practice.An encounter with a tribe like the Mossynoeci would have been a rare and very exotic experience for an Athenian. The fact that Diogenes happened to be one of the very few Athenians who could have had such an experience and *also* happened to be the one Athenian masturbating in public (to our knowledge) seems like just a tad more than a coincidence.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"What?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I think they'd be great, but I'd rather having Vivek at the top of the ticket tbh.?","title":"Dems with data are 'extremely bullish' on Trump winning, Harris may lose six swing states: analyst | Fox News"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/1aigmn12e2ud1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fcef0748dafb279ad24aa3ae5934114006c6dd7Every political pragmatist i follow has actually been dooming over this.Is it valid?

Republican senators going agaisnt Trump proves he is lying / just saying stuff regardless of truth.This assumes that these politicians don't lie or are well-informed enough about the situation to be making such statements. This goes both ways - both for Trump and these senators. You're using a confirmation bias here.II. To lie so brazenly and so totally, it's not just a minor mischaracterization afterall, about natural disaster relief while it is happening is such a shameless act of dishonesty that it fully destroys Trumps creditability to the point where he, and everything he said, can no longer be thought of as being grounded in any sense of what is true. In short he just says whatever he wants either because he is a con man or because he is a delusional idealogue and is lying to himself just as much as he is lying to everyone else.I don't get it - you're saying he lied, but you're taking what senators are supposedly saying at face value and assuming it's true. Your entire point is based off an assumption with no evidence provided by you. That's not right or fair.III Trump supporters have no counter argument with which to avoid the conclusion at the end of point 2 and their only means by which to not arrive at that conclusion is to simply avoid thinking about it. I'm not looking for some rock solid argument that logically disproves this argument or something, All I want is any justification that reconciles Trump being contradicted on hurricane relief by his own party with the idea that he can be trusted on anything. I have looked and cannot find any response to this and from what I have found the only response has been a refusal to think about it.Yes, Trump supporters do have a counter-argument. You're making assumptions based off no evidence. If this evidence exists, you did not provide it. You only said, 'well senators said he's wrong so that must mean it's true'. This is hardly worth discussing until you provide evidence of these claims. All three of your points were made using a confirmation bias, almost text-book confirmation bias.What exactly are you contesting, anyways? What did Trump say that he 'brazenly lied about'? I can't seem to find anything that he lied about. Most of the stuff he's said about the hurricane relief is that the government is doing a terrible job, which I would agree with. Not enough is being done, and it certainly doesn't sit right with the American people since we send billions and billions of dollars overseas while we get the short-end of the stick.Edit for clarity: Essentially, my point is that OP will never hear 'valid counter-arguments' because OP's argument is unfair and somewhat hypocritical. The basis for OP's argument comes from a confirmation bias, combined with unfair arguments and some hypocrisy. It is unfair to enter a conversation with a confirmation bias and accuse someone of doing something with no evidence, and the hypocrisy being that OP said Trump (a politician) is lying, but the senators (more politicians) are being truthful. With no evidence to support these claims, this is just hypocrisy.OP cannot realistically expect to hear a good counter argument if their original argument is, frankly, just silly.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"Stop waiting for election day.

All people lie, and all politicians lie. When caught in a lie, you panic a bit, and stammer. If shown to be lying, you apologize, recognize that it was a lie, maybe explain why you thought it was fair to say what you said, but you ultimately acknowledge the \\"mistake\\" and move on. Bill Clinton lied about his affair, but eventually, when it was proven to be true, he acknowledge he had lied, apologized for lying. He was caught in a lie, and suffered consequences for it. Trump does not, by my and many other's assessments, appear to care whether what he is saying is true. It never seems to occur to him that the things he is saying may or may not be true. He just says what he wants to believe is true. That's not just lying, it's bullshitting, and, as the linked article explains well, it's way more dangerous. It leads you to get in dumb arguments with the NHC about hurricane paths, it leads you to make up stupid bullshit about fema, covid, immigrants, non-existent crime waves, and election fraud.When called on bullshit, he doesn't panic because the idea that he was lying doesn't seem to be present in his mind. He never apologizes because you can't be proven to be wrong if you never cared if you were right. It doesn't matter if several courts of law with independent juries have convicted him of fraud, and defamation and assualt, and rejected his claims he won the election.  He will continue denying all of it with a straight face no matter how absurd. Eventually his base, 25% of the whole country, just accepts that if he keeps insisting what he says is true in defiance of all evidence to the contrary, he must be right.  That's terrifying.

Israel is the 2nd word in the opening call to daily prayer shema yisraelhear o Israel. It is their biblical name. Jews face towards Jerusalem in their prayers. Major holidays commemorate milestones in Jewish history in Israel, such as the destruction of the first and second holy temples in Jerusalem; and Passover, which commemorates the liberation of Jews from Egypt into the Sinai and eventually Israel. The final call in that ceremony is next year in Jerusalem. Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, commemorates victory against the Romans and the cleansing of the holy temple in Jerusalem. The location and the religion/ethnicity are inextricably connected.?Anyway, to briefly address your point, Iran more than anything else presents a risk of massive destabilization based on its control of regional proxies, strategically significant location that affects global shipping and inter-connectivity, and extremist religious leadership that could very well ignite a major war with a nuclear armed state, and/or develop nuclear weapons itself, with few if any guardrails.?So Iran doesnt present so much an existential threat to the US (nor does Russia because of military weakness and adherence to MAD, nor does China for those same reasons but also because their two economies are so interlinked) as it does a risk of destabilization or inciting a war that may drag the US into it.?The US really doesnt have any peer adversaries (since that really could?only be China, which is a frenemy), but Iran is an enemy to the stability of trade and lack of military involvement enjoyed by the US, and therefore the larger threat to the US, to the extent that another country can present a realistic threat.?","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"We all know you can win the presidency without getting more votes.

He said that the government is doing a horrible job, but I've heard this sentiment echoed A LOT, by a lot of people. Mostly from first hand accounts shared on youtube etc., but my impression was that they were doing a bad job.While it's possible that this is just another Right vs Left thing, where more conservative leaning everything is attacking and blaming the Harris administration for letting things devolve into mad max down south, or it's the Democrats essentially accusing Trump of causing the hurricane using his evil Jan 6th magic.Then to go to your first argument:I. Republican senators going against Trump proves he is lying / just saying stuff regardless of truth.Have you ever heard the joke \\"We've investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\\"? I don't know why you would expect the government to sit there and nod along with Trump when he hits out at them just because they wear the same color ties. At the end of the day government incompetence is a bi-partisan stink.II. To lie so brazenly and so totally, it's not just a minor mischaracterization afterall, about natural disaster relief while it is happening is such a shameless act of dishonesty that it fully destroys Trumps creditability to the point where he, and everything he said, can no longer be thought of as being grounded in any sense of what is true. In short he just says whatever he wants either because he is a con man or because he is a delusional idealogue and is lying to himself just as much as he is lying to everyone else.You didn't say what he lied about, just that he said they are doing a terrible job, can you please clarify? There have been a number of claims but mostly I think it's these two: 1. that FEMA funds have been mismanaged and given to migrants. 2. That authorities are actively preventing individuals from helping clean up and help with search and rescue.The first, seems to actually be true. Google practically yells at you for looking up regarding FEMA spending money on migrants, is being reported by everyone as being debunked, however, if you actually look for what is being referred to by Trump and his surrogates, Apparently in 2023, FEMA allocated up to 300+ Million dollars for the [Shelter and Services Program](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023_1018_fema_shelter_and_services_program_fy23.pdf); a glance at what this program does and you'll find that it is indeed a program designed to provide support to non-citizen migrants in the United States, As you can see from the below excerpt:To provide funding to non-federal entities to increase their capacity to temporarily shelter noncitizens recently released from DHS custody, including renovations and modifications to existing facilities.I think there is a point to be made that it is humanitarian to assist migrants, specifically ones that are asylum seeking, and released by the DHS to await court hearings on their status, however, this has been a huge point of tension for the conservative anti-immigration crowd, who no doubt are offended by the idea that we would be spending that much on those trying to get into the country, while there are plenty of people suffering who are already here. I think Trump is not completely wrong to claim that either. It does seem to be at least a valid argument that 300 million dollars that FEMA already had, would be better spent toward relief effort.Regarding the blocking of relief efforts, again, google seems to not be doing many favors, but I found this on youtube which showed a couple of clips complaining about helicopter pilots and other aid workers venting frustrations about what they felt was a lack luster response. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56zG9owMQwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56zG9owMQwI)Even so, again, I think this shit always gets annoyingly partisan and maybe the Trump side is completely wrong but it doesn't sound like an outright lie.Either way it's hard to tell me that this \\"destroyed his credibility.\\" If Trump came out and said the sky is blue then CNN and MSNBC would run headlines all day that read \\"Trump pushes ages old debunked racist theory that sky is blue\\"  and Chris Hays would be smugly leaning out his window taking a selfie of himself under the night sky with the caption \\"does this look blue to you?\\" While the women on the view would chant how his dangerous sky-phobic rhetoric disqualified him from running for office, while a scared guest, I am imagining Jason Momoa, did his best to avoid questions.I'm joking of course but this is how a lot of Trump people feel. Every time Trump says anything, there are a bunch of people ready to jump down his throat and call everything lies, but he's getting these things from somewhere. So for his supporters, he didn't lose any credibility because they feel like the left is just going to point their fingers and call him a liar anyway.(Edit: Ive been on this for too long if you respond with some disrespectful and angry comment, Im going to block you no matter how right you think you are.)","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"Make it so.

Nobody's doing this for BIDEN, Trump is really popular!\\" The idea that people were deliberately avoiding going outside because there was a pandemic that had already killed like... a lot of people just wasn't real to them.Ever wonder why MAGA world was talking about 2020 being a massive landslide in Trump's favor? Like, just casually? That they could even entertain the idea that he'd somehow sweep things even though he only managed to win in 2016 by a margin of negative three million votes? It's cause of the optics. They saw rallies for their guy and empty rooms for the other guy. This made them sure they were very popular.Even though what we saw was a bunch of irresponsible people who hurt themselves and everyone around them with those big crowds and an empty room or remote events just the way the entire world was working in 2020, all they saw was a comical lack of enthusiasm.I keep saying this, but 2020 was special with how the circumstances created a visual narrative that morons could very easily be tricked into believing. Add in the mail in ballots being heavily weighted because many people were casting them because they were taking COVID precautions and one side had just decided that it wasn't real, and you have a story that makes sense.

Both China and Russia, who you'd consider to be greater adversaries than Iran, are already nuclear powers and are already balanced into the global calculus of mutually assured destruction. Both China and Russia are led by governments that can generally be considered rational, secular actors and so their geopolitical goals and strategies are largely predictable.Iran, on the other hand, is within a hair of developing their own nuclear arsenal and once that happens it could throw the entire balance of global nuclear deterrence completely out of whack. Additionally, it can be argued that due to Iran being a theocracy and due to the zealous animosity towards Israel Iran can't be considered a rational actor. This makes their actions largely unpredictable and combining that with the potential for a nuclear arsenal they can easily be considered not only currently  the greatest adversary of the U.S. but the greatest risk to global peace.  So, if you measure who a country's \\"greatest adversary\\" is by geopolitical power or military strength, Iran is obviously not a contender.

Iran aspires to upset this world order and restore what they believe is the natural place Iran should occupy in the ME. This goal requires the expansionism seen now more than ever before, and the nuclear weapon program which Iran pushes against all odds. In their mind, if they are to challenge the US, they need to be backed by nuclear weapons. That will be an equalizer between the uneven military forces.Edit to add: But is Iran US greatest enemy?

She first got in surprisingly on a special election (the first with Ranked Choice), then got re-elected proper. But each times the Republican ticket was split between two unlikeable candidates, one being Sarah Palin, who is just disliked here. This time, the R ticket has pulled their second-placed candidate from the runoff race, and Nick Begich is hammering the state with ads. (So is Peltola.) It'll be tight.I think a few non-Alaskans think that us having a Democratic representative means something about AK flipping. But the reality is it's about 1/3 solid D, 1/3 mainstream moderate-ish R, 1/3 out-there-R. (In the state legislature the first two make a coalition. I *do* wonder if Peltola, who was a state legislator, could teach the US House something...) And you can't get anywhere in statewide office without the support of the Indigenous population. Peltola herself is very much to the right of a lot of Dems specifically about extractive industries. But we're all pro-fish. This is really important.The other tight thing will be to keep RCV.

With Marvel, people are far more willing to accept drastic changes to the characters because we understand that the multiverse has infinite possibilities.

[This chapter of Deeper Insights](http://whale.to/b/sp/springmeier.html#ONE_OF_THE_GREATEST_DECEPTIONS_OF_ALL_TIME:_DISNEY_) also goes much deeper into Disney family history than your post. Also research Walt/Bobby Driscoll. Some relevant quotes:\\"*Disneyland was a huge part of our lives, and we as a family would take an almost yearly trip to the Satanic land of pedophilic paradise. My family has a long history with Walt Disney and his theme park there in Southern California; Walt Disney is the movie producer from my grandfathers story about the limousine ride at two oclock in the morning in Los Angeles, California...the limo ride had ended well for both perverted men, because my grandfather got to know Walt on a personal level up until his death. My grandfather was directly involved with the establishment and execution of Monarch Trauma Based Mind Control Programming within the Disneyland theme park; he worked directly with Walt on establishing a mind control facility that the public would gladly pay to blindly attend and unknowingly support...My grandfather became involved with the CIA early on in its conception, was well-connected, and was a key player in the implementation of the CIA's MK-Ultra mind control program. My grandfather personally oversaw much of the construction of the trauma-based mind control human programming facilities located underneath Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, and he worked directly with Walt on the location of these facilities.*\\"- [Jonathan Sweet](https://mormonmonarch.com/what-is-mk-ultra/)\\"*When I was five years old my mother and father took me to the newly-opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. As we walked down Main Street, we ran into Walt Disney and my father stood aside as Walt Disney, larger than life to me, bent down and shook my hand. He told me that if I would write to him, he would write back to me. I didn't consciously remember anything else after that. What happened next, though, as I later recalled, was that Walt Disney looked at my father with eyes that said important things I couldn't understand. My father then led my mother in the other direction and I was left alone with Walt Disney. My parents never said goodbye, they just left me and walked away. I was terrified and confused at realizing that my parents just disappeared. Walt took me to an office, lifted me up on a big desk that had a glass piece on top and told me that he was my real father. He said the Mickey Mouse Club was my real family  where I really belonged. Everyone was always telling me I belonged to a different family than my parents and I didn't understand, it was all very confusing. He called another man in and that man took me by the hand and led me away. This man was a very bad man and he really scared me. He took me into another room and gave me those viewmaster box glasses to look into. He showed me pictures in them that were so scary that other parts of me had to come to see them. It was too much for a little girl to see. Dead things  cut up bodies, dead cats skinned with big eyeballs and their tails cut off, people cut up, etc. We had that toy at home but mine had cartoon pictures in it. This event involved several of my personalities. Next, the man took me to scary rides and poked me with needles in my waist and legs while he said things during the Alice in Wonderland ride, like, 'This is not really happening. I am not really sticking this needle in your leg. [You are just like Alice](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1frm1wb/comment/lpib25w/). You also ate the large mushroom and feel funny  this is not real.' He kept laughing and acting like all this was fun and games and really amusing, but it was terrifying and confusing to me, and I couldn't understand why he was hurting me. Parts of me split off as they withstood the abuse and I pushed the experiences deep into my subconscious mind as my programming dictated. Then the man took me to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and sexually abused me while we were going through the dark, enclosed ride. During many years that followed, I got hurt on Mr. Toad's ride. I was devastated, exhausted, and out of it during the ride back to Woodland Hills, but looked up at the pretty Mickey Mouse ears balloon, before I finally fell into a long deep sleep.*\\"- [Brice Taylor](http://whale.to/x/ThanksfortheMemoriesbyBriceTaylor.html)\\"*I was trafficked to the USA, to Bohemian Grove where I was drugged &amp; raped by the [Rev BILLY GRAHAM](https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/billy-graham-pedophile-illuminati-luciferian-and-monarch-slave-programmer/) C Richard Nixons pal, in a pink bubble room.

She should have been the kick ass loud mouth prosecutor that we all want and like, and which about half the MAGA universe would actually like too.Instead there was zero counter messaging from Dems.  Sure, Biden would overperform every couple years at a SoTU or speech.  Yeah, Schiff or Porter would occasionally pop up and please dyed in the wool blue voters.  But it was about 1000:1 messaging advantage for the GOP.  It was wall to wall lies, and it was media-assisted.  Trump has literally been campaigning in MI, WI and PA for 3 years.  And his surrogates echo the lies like butter wont melt in their mouths.I could have crafted an infinitely better admin messaging strategy.  I did.  Biden should have come out while he was rescuing us from trumps botched Covid and reminded people 3 times a day what that psychopath did to us.  He should have been selling each daily accomplishment. He should have said now that were re-opening, and now that trump broke the supply chains, and now that Trump tariff taxes have turned our trading partners into adversaries, and now that Trumps record smashing debt and deficit spending has DOUBLED the supply of US dollars in just 4 years, we have another war coming... INFLATION.The message would have been to take it seriously, and to get ready, and to fight it.By being truthful and telling the people what to expect, suddenly its an enemy we can be patriotic about fighting.  Its no longer some boogeyman that came out of nowhere.Remind them every day that this is Trumps inflation, and its our job to fight it and get rid of it.  Make it like a war footing.  Make it so people from CEOs to retirees are watching for it and fighting it.  Reporting if we see a company even trying to sneak profits.  Naming and shaming gougers.  Getting regular people to not panic buy and sabotage themselves and their communities.The actual truth is that Trumps policies and actions could have driven us to catastrophic double digit inflation.  The actual truth is that the Biden keeping it to only a peak of 7 and an average below 5 and down to just 2.4% is actually a fucking miracle, not a fail.Unfortunately that message never got out there.  And worse, a pathologically false one filled that vacuum.Biden or whoever should have prepped people for 10%, then taken a victory lap when we did much better than feared.  Biden should have explained how a little bit of inflation is actually perfectly healthy, because it means a growing and sustainable economy.  He should have explained how the 15 million new and better jobs and better union contracts and better benefits and of that was doing more for the family budget than inflationeas hurting.Instead, union workers who got 30%, 35%, 40% contract raises are hating Biden and loving Trump.  All because trump was messaging them 10 times a day for 4 years while Biden/Dems said nothing, or worse, gave woe-is-me agreement and consent to the lies.People who are making six figures and buying $1600 concert tickets and new trucks and going on cruises are the same ones whining about gasoline costing $3.10 instead of $2.99Imagine someone with Trumps mouth, but Bidens accomplishments.

It's easier to justify making such sacrifices for a dream than it is for a commodity that most people have. Arguably the biggest lifestyle change that homeowners go through after moving in is having high mortgage repayments so having to drastically reduce their everyday spending. Australian household debt is among the highest in the world.I'm generally very anti debt.  But I make two exceptions.Any debt that generate more income then the interest you pay on the debt, is usually a good idea.  For example, if buying a car allows you to accept a higher paying job across town, but you cannot afford to buy a car now, then a car loan makes sense.  The increase in income offsets the interest paid on the debt.the other exception is for home loans, because you have to live somewhere.  You cannot escape that loss.  Either you are loosing money to rent or you are loosing money to interest on a mortgage (as well as maintenance and other things).  So the question here is which loss is smaller.B) It undermines the notion that housing is a right. Housing is not a right.  Not in Australia, not in the US, not in any country that I know of.  People do not have a right to housing.  Its clear that you wish they did, but they don't.  How can i undermine something that doesn't exist in the first place.A) It keeps the market hot.people wanting housing is what keeps the market hot.  If you could stop people from wanting housing, then indeed the market would cool.

We continuously find more and more things in the past that are way beyond what Marx had pointed out as beginning of capitalism. For example, we now know that wage labour was much more common in medieval societies than previously though. Sometimes other people try to fix and create new definitions and stuff updating on Marx (which is a whole discussing by itself)... then we find out even more in the past, etc.But being fair to Marx (I don't hate the dude in any way and I see no reason why someone would), this sub also loves \\"Why Nations Fail\\" and Acemoglu is an even worse historian in that book as far as I could understand and read about.

They're one-third of the electorate. Biden only won them by 3, per CNN's perfect exit poll from 2020 . If she's anywhere near 18, it means she's winning the national popular vote by somewhere near 10 points. Trump may cut into that by doing slightly better with voters of color than he did last time. But they're a minority and the movement isn't that substantial. Like, even if he does 20 points better with Hispanics than last time (which he's not), that'd only make up 3 points. More realistically he's probably doing 10 points better with them, tops.There's some ratfucking with these polls. They don't want to underestimate him a third time in a row. So they're under-weighting white college-educated voters.Remember, all the polls assume a certain composition. [CNN's exit poll](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results) in 2020 predicted a 51-47 Biden win, and that was exactly what happened. That poll weighted white college-educated at 32% and white non-college-educated at 35%. [NYT/Siena](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html)'s latest national poll showed Harris with a 3 point lead.

So while sure some things have become better things have also become worse. Even this excludes that America is not the only country on earth and American action is what often leads to worsening conditions in other countries. The reason why society needs radical change is that the worsening factors are directly a result of our system and not something that can be removed. For example under our system we can never fully incline corporations to pay a fair wage, be completely sustainable, and reduce ecological damage without some sort of radical change. Sure we can be hopeful that in 30 years all these problems are fixed but even if this does happen theres no telling what other problems will exist and wed still have to endure 30 years of these problems. And if it doesnt work were stuck with these problems and likely become extinct due to climate change. Is that a wager youre willing to take?

I don't think America really -needs- an enemy though, at least not from the perspective of the Democratic party.Choosing Iran and backing Israel is generally something that is more of a political peril for Kamala rather than something that is going to have the Democratic base eating out of her hand because there are strong disagreements on foreign policy within the party in a way that there isn't with the Republicans. Like, this could be appealing to the neocons who love the whole Axis of Evil rhetoric, but they don't really have a strong base of voters in America.In the Obama years. the Democratic base largely backed the idea of the Iran Nuclear Deal and thawing relations with Iran. It was Republican hawks who wanted to destroy it (And they succeeded).

A large enough scale disaster is effectively impossible for insurers to handle quickly, they don't (and shouldn't) have enough people working for them to handle the number of claims they just received.Disaster claims are also a giant PIA to manage as each property needs to have causes of loss to be established in order to figure out which reinsurers are going to have to pay out. Usually this occurs after the claim has been paid but every state has a disaster delay exception as they simply won't have reserves to pay out all claims. Then you get the fun that most people don't pay the $45/mo for flood insurance in low risk areas and all of the houses destroyed by water will have limited coverage (basically just their stuff not the house in most cases). because they cant raise prices enoughRequirements to offer insurance in most states are laughingly bad and enough people shop around that the terrible insurers keep rates artificially low. I'm in FL and saw large increases post Ian but not double digits because I got insurance that was right rather than cheap. When all the cheapo insurers got bankrupted by Ian (plus the fun of roof fraud driving some others out) average policy cost rose quickly. This was a correction as most insurance funds have taken losses most years in the last 20 but price competition kept rates low.People are not pricing in decent insurance into affordability. They are also favoring worse insurance over higher deductible insurance to save money, which makes absolutely no sense when dealing with property.","title":"FEMA spent nearly half its disaster budget in just 8 days"},{"text":"Her getting primetime tv exposure without him surely has to sting old Donnie.","title":"Kamala Harris agreed to CNN town hall"},{"text":"Tylenol is only a temporary solution.

The facts are:Trump has outperformed his polling not just nationally but in every major swing state in the last two election.Biden was up by about 10 points at this point four years ago and won by 4.5. Clinton was up by about 6 and won the popular vote by 2.1 while losing the EC. Harris is currently up nationally by 2.5 points according to 538 and 1.8 points on RCP. If you just zero in on PA, Biden was up by 7.1 points at this point four years ago and won by 1.1 points. Clinton was up by 9 points at this point and ended up losing the state by .7 points. Harris is currently up .6 points in 538 and down .3 points in RCP.So forgive me if being scolded for not using the right-thinking averaging site doesnt serve as much of a corrective.

Take a look at the sample ballot ahead of time, so that you can decide who to vote for in down-ballot races.

You will also have the chance to vote for a Congressman and for state representative (sometimes referred to as assembly) and state senator. There might be judges, like for state sumpreme court and for district courts and courts of criminal appeals. There will probably be county commissioners, state or local school boards, city council members.

Each of these elections can have an impact on the lives of people who live in your state and your community.

You dont have to vote in every race, but it can be very gratifying to study up on candidates and ballot initiatives and then feel confident about your choices.

A little trim off the military budget? Perhaps stricter food stamp requirements will save a few bucks?

On their East Side, we would have the forced Arabization of India overwhelmed by a stronger Pakistan supported by a very powerful Iran and its super-wealthy allies like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and Dubai.On the other hand, the UK and the European Union would lose their major ally and most technologically advanced country since the end of WWII, leaving all Mediterranean countries like Spain, Greece, and the Balkans to fend for themselves. The big G countries in that region (Germany, France, and Italy) would have their military resources spread thin, with Germany in particular (Ill come back to it later).Other big G countries, like Canada, would have to thread carefully between maintaining cordial relationships with its neighbor US and taking sides by deploying military resources to back the UK and France - because of its strategic and territorial connections - and probably risking leaving the West side of the Greenland Sea vulnerable or dependent of the US. Japan is pinned in this situation because, since Pearl Harbor, its de facto Military has been the US.Greenland is defrosting. Therefore, the Greenland Sea is up for grabs, and the main takers on that side of the Atlantic Ocean are Russia and, for strategic positioning, China. Russia is attacking Ukraine and keeping that region very unstable, and they want to keep pushing the West out of power. Now, the weakened European West is fighting by itself with the Middle East due to its control over Palestine's disputed land. Back to the German situation I mentioned above, it is now keeping a stronghold against Russia up north in the Greenland Sea along with Finland, Sweeden, Norway (not very big Military), and the UK (that is well positioned everywhere in the Globe, but its Brexit isolationism is fucking them up). Russia already has a strong presence in the Greenland Sea with nuclear submarines and plants. Europe now has two very powerful attackers on the Russian front and the Iranian fronts. Without the US, the entirety of Western Europe is screwed - even if Ukraine has been since 2014 a stronghold preventing the Russian Imperialism advances.Meanwhile, China's Imperialism is taking over their Eastern side towards every Island Nation in the PacifWhy things aren't like this right now because of the United Nations and NATO agreements between all the countries members which most stay put because of the US Military power. Let Turd get into the WH he removes the US from those institutions and game over. We go back to the conditions we were in the past century between 1915 to 1946, encompassing both World Wars. The commitments of the US with its allies aren't fluff. If the US abandons its allies because of the Gazans, it will be more than Gazans going kaputz on that side of the world. If the Democrats lose the election for the Russian Agent running for the Oval Office, then it's Russia/Iran Check Mate, the US meaning triple kaputz.Brazil, Chile, Australia&amp;New Zealand, and the Southern African Region will also have to fend for themselves and figure out how to manage the Western (US) and Eastern (Russian/Iran/China) influences and direct allegiances. Many Pacific islands threatened by China, are already under the watchful eye of the US which is supposed to not fulfill its Diplomatic commitments because a few emotionally driven misogynoir imbeciles in America are ready to throw away their democratic privileges with zero awareness of its implications. ??","title":"Kamala Harris in Danger in Michigan as Arab American Support Crashes"},{"text":"Of course not, why do you think they hand picked Kamala.

What she and her campaign have been able to accomplish in that time is pretty impressive if not downright unbelievable and so I tend to look at polls within that context. Im throwing my two cents in: based off of the polling trends, people I follow on different sm cites who are actually boots to the ground in many of the swing states (and even those non-swing states that seem to be long shots, like FL), the disciplined Democrat GOTV effort, plus pollsters being so scared of getting it wrong, herding and Im suspecting theyve overcorrected for the Trump vote, the likely huge surge of as yet unaccounted Harris voters coming out on Election Day, Trumps increasing derangement (which is usually very telling because the more he goes on his rants the more panicked you know he is so you have to wonder what hes so panicked about if hes supposedly got this in the bag) and, honestly, just general enthusiasm and vibes, Harris will probably end up winning this election and by larger margins than polls suggest.

Similarly, it could be argued that Iran has been a greater adversary over the last year or will be over the next 6 months, than China and Russia, based on the trade disruptions and American hostages that Iran funded terror proxies have caused recently.  Don't forget, there are still Americans being held hostage by Hamas whose fates are unknown.It's also an absurdity to claim that Israel's influence on the US is outsized when they have been obstructed in their existential war for survival by America over the last war, and when the aid we send them has far more realpolitik benefit than any other foreign aid save the recent and short term funds sent to Ukraine.It's also exceptionally likely that Kamala is only saying that as campaign noise, and it is extremely likely that those words will have zero impact on her policy if she wins.","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"Thank you","title":"My CA ballot"},{"text":"Without a doubt.

Russia has never responded positively to any American overtures for diplomacy period. Moreover, Russia has been engaging in increasingly more apocalyptic rhetoric regarding nuclear war.As far as anti-American terrorism goes, most of Iran's sponsoring of terrorist groups is aimed squarely as Israel. Some of the actions construed as \\"terrorism\\", such as cyberattacks against US forces, are also engaged in by Russia to an even greater degree. The Iranian idea of terrorism, when it is aimed at US citizens, is largely focused on particular people (Such as John Bolton) rather than mass killing civilians.

The exception to this was Hamas during October 7th, but that was aimed at Israelis (Though ended up affecting many different nationalities) and designed to capture hostages for a trade.

They are big and strong enough to present *a* credible threat to the US, but judging by their track record they are also probably less likely to respond to any effort at diplomacy from the US than any other sovereign state except maybe North Korea.

The two countries allow people to visit, study abroad, perform international trade, etc. Yes, China is a rival superpower, but they don't do anything (yet) that significantly compromises the United States besides spying and occasional meddling which the US also does with China. China does want to take over Taiwan and is probably looking very closely at the outcome of the war in Ukraine to determine what to do but has not taken any significant action on that front yet. Naming China as your primary adversary is not worth it to be honest - the US has a lot to gain from a decent relationship with China.So it's down to Iran and Russia.IMO it largely how that works out depends on how you weight the different factors. Iran has been funding terrorist groups that have directly fought and killed US military personnel, NATO personnel, and Israeli personnel for the last 30 years. Iran is willing to devote serious money and time into hurting or killing Americans and American allies. One of Iran's stated goals is the destruction of a US ally.Russia on the other hand has invaded Ukraine, which is a serious transgression and not at all acceptable but not necessarily a risk to the US or Americans directly and Russia is actively limiting its engagement with NATO countries and Ukraine has shown that Russia is in several ways a paper tiger. Russia has transgressed in US politics, and I absolutely do not mean to discount its influence there, but its meddling is known and being addressed (albeit not always effectively).So IMO I'd argue it's a toss-up between Russia and Iran with Iran doing more measurable physical damage.

The Houthis in particular, while only somewhat able to threaten Israel, have done much to shut down shipping in the region, increasing the danger to civilian ships and increasing inflation and cost of goods significantly, while shutting down international free trade. At this point the global economic cost from the Houthis is probably greater than anything Russia can manage at this point. Iran has also attacked Israel with the largest drone strike in human history, and the two largest ballistic missile strikes in human history.Iran has also sponsored a bunch of propaganda that has been effective in spreading disinformation, divisiveness, and political radicalism in the West.The US does not base its military threat assessments based on the 'influence' of Israel.","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"Now vs what yesterday or vs 4 years ago or 20 years ago?","title":"Biden and Harris' Record on Spending and Debt Is a Tragedy of Epic Proportion"},{"text":"From my movie research, Grosse Point is where assassins gather to attend their high school reunions, nothing more.","title":"Trump in Detroit: \\"The whole country will be like Detroit if Kamala Harris is your president\\""},{"text":"Yes, she needs to focus 100% on policy education and not even mention Trump or his antics.
