Belgium must reform gender care in children and adolescents following the example of Sweden and Finland, where hormones are regarded as the last resort,6) Netherlands: The Dutch Parliament ordered an investigation into the physical and mental health outcomes of children prescribed puberty blockers. 7: USA: Won't release scientific evidence because of a political agenda. lol. Yeah, misinformation. The favorite word by dems at the moment as they promote censorship. Anybody that disagrees with you is going to be misinformation. Threads will be locked. It's part and parcel on the left right now if you disagree with anything they say, despite that I'm practically on the left. I voted Bernie, Biden, and Harris. I guess that misinformation is really penetrating my body politic. Why won't I admit I hate trans people? Because I don't. And that's the problem with your argument. You think because I care about vulnerable populations like children, or the injustice of women, that all of a sudden, somehow, miraculously, I don't care about another vulnerable population, which is bullshit. Why don't you go over to r/detrans and see how much hate they get from the trans community for deviating from gender ideology. Just because somebody may believe in self-acceptance and doesn't believe in some hocus pocus gender soul, doesn't mean you don't feel empathy for people struggling through something.And again, why this argument is so toxic. Because all you can do to people that disagree with you is call them names. Uneducated. I hate them. I'm transphobic. And you're right, it is a waste of time. And I'll just fall on the other side of the issue because I actually believe in science and know how to read studies. Almost all the studies that are cited from the other side literally have conflicting interests and largely debunked with problematic methodologies, and largely hasn't been studied yet, which is *drum roll* why European countries have completely taken a turn. So I'll continue voting accordingly like the rest of the electorate. Not that I voted for Trump, just completely not surprised by the outcome, and almost relieved. And hopefully the dems can learn from it. Parties get ideologically captured. And this issue has a lot of inherent problems in it. And your argument is somehow, the democratic party doesn't have a position on it? lol. It's just laughable to anybody remotely following politics. Because it's obviously a political issue and there has been a lot of evolution on how it's being pushed. There's no such thing as trans men, trans women, and cis anymore right? Just men and women. What changed? Discounting all the experiences of sex. Biology now is pseudoscience right? See how far that gets you. Ignore comorbidities. Ignore childhood confusion in development. Ignore dynamics of social inclusion. Just throw psychology, sociology, and biology out the window because you have to be right, all the 'science' backs you up. The simplest answer of looking in the mirror and accepting your body, has to be wrong. It's not right for everybody, clearly, but lets just normalize it and society will get on board. And if anybody says, wait, there may be some problems along the way, just call them transphobic. That's how you really pull them over to your side. Winning. And just so you know, there's nothing inherently constitutionally protected about sex changes for illegal immigrants. lol. It can be thrown out just like abortion. Where's the legislation on sex changes for illegal immigrants? It just hasn't hit the Supreme court yet. Just like how a lot of states banned puberty blockers will go there. Nothing of this nature is in the constitution or legislation. So stop pretending it's like some law of the land. Although I am very pro-choice, but even Ruth Bader Ginsburg had problems with it. Which is why your argument is just laughable. It's the job of politicians to challenge things of this nature. Not pretend they have no choice in it. Take a position and own it. But then again, that's why she lost big.Which was clearly my point from the beginning that you conveniently missed and just decided to debate the issue instead of the point that it's not popular and affects electoral outcomes. Because even moderates are starting to scratch their head of the ridiculousness and principles of the illiberalness of the democratic party.Screw universal healthcare. Screw free community college and trade schools. Lets talk about reparations, getting rid of SAT scores, and drag queen story hour. While the same people pushing this weird duality is getting rich. Because that's all the dem party stands for at the moment, social issues that don't affect their billionaire pocket book.Biden tells them nothing will change. Harris tells them nothing will change. Such a winning message. Just push the social issues more to the brink and cause division. I heard there are some Latino men you can blame. lol. And now Harris supporters are threatening to call ICE to deport them. Better jump on it. Hey, maybe that will improve your electoral odds.

Alito and Thomas have consistently been the most egregiously far right justices on this court, by a long shot. If you look at who Trump appointed, Amy Coney Barrett,  Brett Kavanagh, and Gorsuch have actually been more moderate voices. They are definitely giving wins to Republicans, sure, but we've actually seen them (along with Roberts) actually side with the liberals on the court on a number of occasions. We've seen this court actually hand down losses to Trump himself. They are not blindly following the Republican marching orders, though they are obviously sympathetic to them. Through that, Alito and Thomas have been stalwart supporters of Republican policy agenda even when the rest of the court is rebuking it. They are actually the worst.So I actually think that Trump's history of supreme court picks might yield better replacements to those two justices were they to retire. Now I know what everyone will say: Trump will appoint young people that will be there forever, and he has a Republican Congress this time so he can put whoever he wants. That's true. I don't think, though, that we will see anyone as bad as either Alito or Thomas. I really think we're going to see more of the Coney-Barrett brand.

Your priors were blown out the water and your response is to reflect on this, in an exhasperated manner, that you couldn't possibly understand how this went down. Like it's a divine anomaly of public stupidity. If you understand that you couldn't conceive the summation of this outcome, perhaps you should consider you are missing something analytically? All human phenomena has a cause, it doesn't sprout from nowhere.You cannot blame the electorate as bad or stupid. Bad and stupid electorates have always existed and will continue to exist in perpetuity (its inevitable in the diversity of the human condition to be bad and stupid). How does the US have a unique lapse of judgement at this point in time, as opposed to any other period in US history? Consider what makes the cultural climate such that some one as ludicrous as trump could even could even be accepted a SECOND time.First time Trump won it was understood as an unfortunate accident. 2nd time Trump nearly won, with the most votes any Republican candidate had ever received, we brushed the sweat off our brow as a lucky escape and were convinced of a return to normalcy. The second victory should be a wake up call to an indication of distinct broader social, cultural forces that are here to stay, and must be contended with.Rather than asking \\"what am I missing here?\\", you blame what you poorly understand, incidentally, much like the magatards who have a poor understanding of public institutions. Don't write this off as public \\"poor judgement\\", when you are the one systematically blind with little capacity to comprehend this phenoma.","title":"\\"Dems lost because the woke scared away white people\\" son or \\"dems lost because they weren't progressive enough\\" daughter"},{"text":"This is why I got my kid out of public school","title":"Lost a 20+ year friendship over politics"},{"text":"That lesson has been going on for sometime now and they continue to be the nice guys","title":"Biden to push through anti-Trump plans as he vows to make last days in office count"},{"text":"Stop trying to rationalize something irrational.","title":"Why I'm still suspicious about Trump."},{"text":"Here are my thoughts about what could have played the role:1) Could it be possible that this time the MAGAts actually learned from their mistakes back in 2020 and it was them turning out in droves to vote early the same way Democrats did then, while the Dems were the ones who stayed home because they thought that, since Kamala had huge rallies, she would win? What makes you think that MAGAts didn't show to her rallies? What makes you think that your neighbors who were previously known Trump supporters suddenly had a change of heart and didn't just lied to you when they told you that they were going to vote for Harris this time due to his bad rhetoric and racism? They stopped posting Trump signs and instead actually VOTED. Our side had the thousands of people who previously voted for Biden in 2020 only to turn their backs on him, and then her because of the United States' help to Israel. Many of those young people stayed home.2) I keep thinking that timing of the war in Israel and Gaza has been very suspicious from the start. Netanyahu and Putin knew that this would hurt Bidens administration hugely, especially during the election season because America ? has always been supporting Israel no matter what and this war would put Biden and Kamala in impossible situation. Also Bibi is friends with Trump, so why wouldn't he want him to win while also being able to stay in power himself because of his own corruption? Starting this war was definitely a great ticket to accomplish that. He killed two birds with one stone. How could Israeli government not know about Hamas' plans for October 7th when Israel has the best intelligence in the world and they are one of the most militarized countries in the world? They know about a mouse is about to fart before that mouse itself even does it. \\nBottom line to all this is that the Democrats walked into a trap, partly because of their own making due to their complacency and laziness, but also due to a lot of assholery by Putin, Netanyahu and other foreign enemies.","title":"Where did Joe Biden voters go?

He'll speak and people (usually conservatives) are like \\"OMG how is that Catholic?\\" And the answer is \\"It always has been. You're just used to European/white Catholicism.\\" Latino Catholicism has always been more about labor and charity and solidarity rather than gays and abortion. There is solid support among Latinos for abortion and for gay rights. The polls have told us this for a long time. That is not an issue with them any more than it is with black voters. It's all about the economy. We need to message strategically.

If they draw the line super far away from the median voter the net loss caused by catering to them means they won't be catered to unless the candidate has massive leads that allow them to \\"cash in\\" and lose some votes on net. The obvious solutions are:1. move the line closer to the median voter.\\n2. Convince other voters on the issue directly so that the candidate can adopt the position without losing votes on net. \\n3. Get the closest candidate a bigger voting margin by working to build support for them on other issues such that the candidate can sacrifice votes. In the absence of implementing one of these solutions, it is absolutely possible for multiple subsets of the electorate to sabotage the candidate closest to their position by not doing their homework regarding this mechanism design. No amount of campaign research or charisma can always overcome this behavior. This behavior in certain contexts can entail a guaranteed loss for the candidate closest to their position. The irony is that the discipline these individuals seem to hate the most (economics) holds the keys to analyzing and solving this issue. The degree to which this, when combined with other phenomena, contributed to the outcome is up for debate.

It's irrelevant what I think.Your constitution and law says it is. Your courts have affirmed it. And even Trump followed it. What's your argument then? That we stop following the law?But this is literally what I'm talking about. You're literally proving my point. You're way out of touch with voters.Rofl, if voters are transphobic, I'm glad to be out of touch with them.Why did these voters have no issue when Trump did it in his first term? Go answer that. They only have an issue now because Trump has pandered to their bigotry by spreading disinformation. Do you think Trump will actually revoke the law which mandates medical care be provided? Go figure your response when he doesn't.The leader of the long-running study said that the drugs did not improve mental health in children with gender distress and that the finding might be weaponized by opponents of the care.Wait, so you're doing what this researcher warned about, lmao.Please go learn what puberty blockers do. I'll break it down for you:- Transitioning treatments are some of the best tools we have to alleviate gender dysphoria.- Puberty blockers are not a transitioning treatment.- The main goal of puberty blockers to buy enough time for the minor to be mature enough to decide if they want to pursue transitioning.- Gender dysphoria generally gets worse as puberty progresses.- That's the medical benefit of puberty blockers - *to prevent the worsening of gender dysphoria as more time is bought for these minors*.- So if the result of such a study is that mental health doesn't worsen as puberty progresses? That's still a benefit when you contrast it to the alternative of worsening gender dysphoria and its associated psychiatric comorbidities.- This is why we now have data showing things like this happening as a result of trans healthcare bans: https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5127347/more-trans-teens-attempted-suicide-after-states-passed-anti-trans-laws-a-study-shows.- The main caveat in your study is that these kids were already in good shape, and the take away is that puberty blockers kept them in such good shape.- The only reason the author is afraid of publishing the study is because of *posters like yourself* who will then try to misrepresent the results to justify the bans of puberty blockers.Now please, stop wasting my time. You are clearly very uninformed about what trans healthcare entails.https://segm.org/Denmark-sharply-restricts-youth-gender-transitionsDenmark hasn't banned puberty blockers. They have only changed it so that a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is required first before puberty blockers can be prescribed. Or, you know, how it already is prescribed in the US.Like I said, stop lying. Go educate yourself.but there are a lot of problems inherent in the issue. There aren't any objective medical problems with it. The biggest problem now is an increase in suicides because of these healthcare bans. Want to address that?They care about justice, and there is no justice when you have children making decisions they aren't old enoughDon't fucking talk to me about justice. Go ask trans people if there is any justice for them when you're forcing worse outcomes on them. they aren't old enough to make or women working their whole life to compete in a sport just to be one upped by somebody born as a man.But there's justice in attacking cis female athletes because they don't fit your standards of what a woman should look like? Go ask Khelif what justice she got.We can spend all day on this issue.Nope, everything you have said is based on misinformation or outright lies. Go provide **actual studies** showing that puberty blockers cause harm. Do it.My only point is that it's going to affect electoral outcomes.Your initial point is that Harris was pushing this as an issue. But she isn't. Only Trump and Republicans are. Don't shift the goalposts.And republicans are more moderate on this issue compared to how far in the paint dems have gone.Healthcare bans against medical evidence are not moderate.

I replied to another person just now with all the points why I didn't vote for Trump and why I'm a democrat, so I'll reply with the same points. Also, I'm not a person to start a fight or argue, so anyone reading this, please don't fight or argue with me, this is just why I, personally am a democrat. Perhaps that'll change in the future, but for now, this is why:The first issue which was the main one - Trump's tax cuts. He promises tax cuts, and he'll give tax cuts, but they are for the rich, not the normal working American. Meaning it benefits those who are making from $360,000 - $914,000 a year. If you're in that bracket, you'll receive a tax cut of -$7,160. If you're making more than $914,000, you'll receive a tax cut of -$36,320. However, if you're not in that bracket, the average American will have to pay more. The poorest, so those making $0-$28,600, will have to pay +$790. Second class, so those making $28,600-$55,100, will have to pay +$1,430. The middle class, so those making $55,100-$94,000, will have to pay +$1,530. Fourth, so those making $94,100-$157,500, will have to pay +$1,790. Fifth, so those making $157,500-$360,000, will have to pay +$610.Then, Trump's tariffs. That means if he implements this, we'll have to pay it from our pocket's. Corporations won't pay them, even if he has said they will. They won't. That means, everything will become even more expensive. For example, if a shirt in China costs $5 to make, the corporation will sell it for $10 in the USA, so they have $5 profit. But, it Trump's tariffs are implemented, the shirt will now cost $5 to make, but to get it into USA from China, it'll cost 60% more. So now it costs $8 for the corporation. Do you think the corporation will still sell it for $10? No. It'll sell it for $13. These are the tariffs: If it's coming from China, it's 60%. If it's from Mexico, it's 25%. If it's anywhere else around the world, it's 20%.Also, it's good to mention that we're currently under Trump's economy. That's why everything is currently so expensive under Biden's presidency. When Trump was in office in 2017, we were under Obama's economy. The economy the previous president implements works under the next president. I just wanted to mention this, since a lot of people don't realise this. This is going to upset a lot of people by me saying this, but I did vote for Kamala. Not because I'm a far leftist, but because she represented my interests the best. As in, she was planning to implement tax cuts for the middle class. She was going to make sure the rich pay fair taxes, not get tax cuts. From her own words, she said, it's not fair that teachers, nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate, than the rich and big corporations. And I agree with that, that's why I voted for her. These are the tax cuts she wanted to implement for the normal, working class people. The poorest making from $0-$28,600 would've gotten a -7% tax cut of -$1,130. Second, making from $28,600-$55,100, would've gotten a tax cut of -3,8%. Middle class, making from $55,100-$94,100 would've gotten a -2.7% tax cut of -$1,980. Fourth, making $94,100-$157,500 would've gotten a tax cut of -1,8%. Fifth, making $157,500-$360,000, would've gotten a tax cut of -1.4%. The rich, however, making $914,900 or more, would've gotten a +4.1% tax increase, on average of +$121,460.Hopefully this helped you understand me and once again, thank you for asking!","title":"I'm a democrat, but I want to congratulate you all on the victory!

They care about justice, and there is no justice when you have children making decisions they aren't old enough to make or women working their whole life to compete in a sport just to be one upped by somebody born as a man.

But, it Trump's tariffs are implemented, the shirt will now cost $5 to make, but to get it into USA from China, it'll cost 60% more. So now it costs $8 for the corporation. Do you think the corporation will still sell it for $10? No. It'll sell it for $13. These are the tariffs: If it's coming from China, it's 60%. If it's from Mexico, it's 25%. If it's anywhere else around the world, it's 20%.Also, it's good to mention that we're currently under Trump's economy. That's why everything is currently so expensive under Biden's presidency. When Trump was in office in 2017, we were under Obama's economy. The economy the previous president implements works under the next president. I just wanted to mention this, since a lot of people don't realise this. This is going to upset a lot of people by me saying this, but I did vote for Kamala. Not because I'm a far leftist, but because she represented my interests the best. As in, she was planning to implement tax cuts for the middle class. She was going to make sure the rich pay fair taxes, not get tax cuts. From her own words, she said, it's not fair that teachers, nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate, than the rich and big corporations. And I agree with that, that's why I voted for her. These are the tax cuts she wanted to implement for the normal, working class people. The poorest making from $0-$28,600 would've gotten a -7% tax cut of -$1,130. Second, making from $28,600-$55,100, would've gotten a tax cut of -3,8%. Middle class, making from $55,100-$94,100 would've gotten a -2.7% tax cut of -$1,980. Fourth, making $94,100-$157,500 would've gotten a tax cut of -1,8%. Fifth, making $157,500-$360,000, would've gotten a tax cut of -1.4%. The rich, however, making $914,900 or more, would've gotten a +4.1% tax increase, on average of +$121,460.","title":"I'm a democrat, but I want to congratulate you all on the victory!

There was decreased turnout across the board and clearly those on the left got sick of the same neoliberal Rockefeller Republican the DNC keeps churning out. There were also threats against polling places all over. A lot of areas with depressed turnout for president were POC-heavy places, and many who didn't vote Harris or at all for president still voted to keep statewide and Congressional Dems in office. Ticket-splitting also helped, but the reality is Blue Dogs and New Democrats are not doing it for most voters.Merrick Garland and Dems as a whole also showed no sense of urgency in fighting back against the rampant voter suppression that's been going on since the midterms so between suppressed votes and people feeling helpless or scared to even try then that's just the end result.","title":"How the 'Latinx' label shifted Latinos from Democrats into arms of Trump"},{"text":"They didnt have time for a primary.

The deadline for applications is Jan. 27, 2025. Turkeys Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has kicked off a tender for 800 MW of solar. The total capacity covers six proposed projects, consisting of 385 MW in the region of Karapinar, 200 MW in Karaman, 75 MW in Malatya, 60 MW in Van and 40 MW each in Antalya and Kutahya. An initial ceiling price of $0.055/kWh has been set, with a base price of $0.0325/kWh applicable to each project. Bids can be submitted until Jan. 27, 2025. Details on the ministrys website state the electricity generated from each project will be sold in the free market for a 60-month period from the contract signature date, which will be followed by a 20-year period where the electricity generated will be supplied to the transmission system. The solar tender follows a wind tender launched by the ministry last week for 1,200 MW of wind across five proposed projects. Alparslan Bayraktar, Turkeys Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, said the ministry plans to procure at least 2,000 MW of renewable energy tenders each year, as it works toward a longer-term target of reaching 120 GW of installed solar and wind capacity by 2035.

Forgetting that allowing Trump to take over likely means the end of Gaza and the West Bank as we know it Second, that elitist attitude isn't helping anyone. We're just as average American as anyone else, we just have different interests and hobbies. Some people can name all 53 players on an NFL team, some people can grow amazing plants, some people know the minute differences between a '65 Mustang and '74 Mustang, and others like us as plugged into politics.

Go watch The Wire S1, S2 and S4, do you think the folks at street level, imporvished dockworkers and kids at underfunded schools care about that? No they dont and I dont blame them, the system is broken and the working masses are slipping through the cracks in bulk, the Democrat party has to put a net to stop them from crashing into the ground because even as a foreigner I know the GOP wont, they need to listen to people like Sanders/AOC a bit more and listen less to establishment and hollywood democrats.Now I dont expect Trump to fix any problem at all, hell I expect him to make everything so much worse for everyone except the 1% but Trump does give a way to vent their anger, like the good fascist he is he pointed at an enemy with his little fingers to redirect the frustration of the popular classes and his followers, being the uneducated cattle they are, swallowed his bullshit and asked for seconds.","title":" How can we create our own \\"Project 2028\\" so we have a fully fleshed out set of Democratic policies to rebuild democracy and the fed?

The midterms need to promote progressive policies with the right message. Progressive policies passed by ballot measure even in the most Republican states. People resoundingly approved repro rights, minimum wage increases, paid leave, and rejected the voucher scam. On top of that 3/4 of Maine voters just neutered SuperPacs. Massachusetts is allowing ride-share drivers to unionize. Nevada ended slavery in prison. These things are popular across the board. If more states neuter PACs like Maine did we can see better candidates and ballot initiatives without so much misinformation and meddling coming from the ultra-rich. Bernie could have won in 2016 and as I and many have said these past three presidential election cycles, you cannot keep capitulating to Republicans and bowing down to their narrative. If you want to beat Republicans, you don't run as one, and you sure as shit don't alienate entire swaths of your base. Turnout was lower this time around because people have had it. It was the whitest election since 1992 IIRC and this is largely due to Dems surrendering to the Republican narrative on immigration, refusing to listen to the majority of the electorate on Gaza, and bowing down to their corporate donors thereby reinforcing neoliberalism which is why someone always has to profit either directly or indirectly from healthcare, housing (even public and \\"affordable\\"), education, and public infrastructure. Either a new Democratic party must rebuild from a solid foundation of ending neoliberalism, or people will either stay home during elections, or find a new way to make their voices heard through organizing or finding new candidates.","title":"Straight-up BS: Democratic chair attacks Bernie Sanders election critique"},{"text":"Who decides to suport Trump because someone bad endorsed Kamala Harris?

A rising tide lifts all ships. It's easy to point out the manifest contradictions of Trump, but what he does so successfully is build a narrative that people can get behind. The contradictions of his policy matters less than the fact that they (to the average voter) fit into his narrative. It's the same with Obama. In 2004 Democrats had the same angst about losing white working class voters, so nominating a black guy with the middle name Hussein would have sounded crazy on ID-pol terms. However he won, because he told a story that encompassed all Americans, which meant that he gained with WWC and minority voters alike. I think as a good rule of thumb, going forward Democrats should just avoid mentioning any race/gender/sexuality etc. Just say Americans. Put forward a vision for America that encompasses everyone, design simple to understand policy that fits that vision, and promote it. If they start thinking 'well if we offer a tax credit policy on ABC we could appeal to Latino males aged 19-34 who love XYZ' they're fucked.","title":"\\"Dems lost because the woke scared away white people\\" son or \\"dems lost because they weren't progressive enough\\" daughter"},{"text":"I have said it 100 times before; stupid people will be the death of us all","title":"Liberals Just Lost the Supreme Court for Decades to Come"},{"text":"I genuinely worry for the democrat voters' mental / emotional state.","title":"I don't trust this temporarily demoralized, sullen lull.

For example, there isn't, and for the majority of most people's lives there hasn't been an alternative.  Hamas campaigned on ending democracy and still gained power.The last elections were held in 2006, meaning that anyone under 36 (about 2/3 of the population) hasn't voted Hamas in. I'm not aware of any statements where Hamas proposed to end democracy if elected before the elections were held.  Netanyahu's approval rating hovers around 35-40% depending on the month,But how much of this disapproval comes from people who think he's not being harsh enough on Palestinians or lenient enough for settlers?..[Here](https://www.jns.org/poll-netanyahu-maintains-majority-after-gallant-firing/)'s a poll from yesterday:\\"Asked by Direct Polls who was best suited to serve as the Jewish states prime minister, 47% said they felt Netanyahu was the right man for the job, while 27% cited Gantz and 26% said neither man was suitable.When choosing between Netanyahu and Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, 48% said Netanyahu was best suited to lead, 27% said Lapid and 25% said both were unsuitable.\\"People may hate their governments, but Netanyahu is unfortunately the democratically elected leader of Israel from its most recent fair elections, and it's not unlikely he'd be elected again if elections were held today.The mainstream alternatives to Netanyahu in Israel are also not very different from his position on continuing the oppression of Palestinians and the Gaza genocide, which makes sense because that's that the majority of Israelis really want - look at [this](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/56081) opinion poll from a month ago: * Israelis are roughly evenly divided on whether the war should end. * Of those who think the war should end, of those who think it should most cite the condition of the hostages as a reason, and only a tiny minority acknowledges \\"great cost in human life and the desire for quiet, peace, and security\\" * A large majority of Jewish Israelis think the IDF has been conducting the genocide in a manner that's ethically \\"good or excellent\\". * A majority of Jewish Israelis think jailers who abuse Palestinian detainees should be exempt from investigation and punished lightly if convicted.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Enough with the gaslighting.Joe has done a fine job of fixing Trump's previous mess.

You're going to get a lot more votes during a major crisis, a once in a lifetime Pandemic, where a lot of States mailed a ballot to your house no matter what. 4) Clearly Harris and dems ran a terrible campaign. They either didn't show up or voted Trump. All I'm saying is you shouldn't spread conspiracies about vote totals until it's certified. You're comparing a final count to an unfinal count. And clearly Trump has non-stopped campaigned and built his coalition, while dems were sleeping. I'm not disagreeing with you about how terrible her campaign was, just be careful with figures at the moment. The 15 million and 20 million vote figure is extremely misleading because there are a lot of outstanding ballots. And it's getting old that it's being passed around like they are 'missing'. That's simply not true. Those graphics and intentional misrepresentation of the vote tally is irresponsible beyond belief.There will be time to analyze, just don't like how many people are throwing around vote totals when they are still counting in a lot of areas and people are coming up with wild theories.Clearly there's been a huge shift though and a realignment. Clearly that was going to happen because they both ran unordinary campaigns and branded themselves unlike previous candidates in history. Harris was super left in 2020 and ran a Mitt Romney campaign with a dash of woke without even a Primary. And Trump ran his working class anti-establishment campaign. So where the pieces fell is quite interesting.Just no point in talking about national vote totals because they are still counting. We already know who won.

Republican president, good economy.But we can't rely on the economy going south, which it will if Trump does what he says he's going to do. We need to get out there with messaging. And combat this goddamn \\"Democrats are socialists\\" narrative which has always been absolute horse manure. If Dems are socialists, they're pretty bad ones. We can't even get universal health care when we have a filibuster-proof majority.And yes, I know. The economy is actually good.

She defended your fucking constitution and the law. It's something **Trump did too even as he runs anti-trans ads attacking Harris for it**.- I will follow the law, she said. And its a law that Donald Trump actually followed. Youre probably familiar with now. Its a public report that under Donald Trumps administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. - Federal law requires inmates to receive access to necessary medical care, and courts have found that this can include medically necessary gender-affirming surgery. Legal obligations to provide this care were also acknowledged by the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Trump administration. Any efforts to categorically eliminate access to gender-affirming surgical care would likely face legal challenges. So please, stop wasting my time with such lies. Because these anti-trans ads were based on disinformation to spread hate towards trans people and immigrants.Sorry to break it to you, but the trans issue is something dems have to grapple with.Sorry to break it to you, but there is no trans issue beyond the culture war Republicans are pushing.

There's a reason all over Europe, even in the most leftist Country's they are rolling it back. The point is people want to know what you're doing about the issue. It's not going to go away. Gen Z literally has campuses where professors are having class in Hamas sympathizers, just because they view Israel as the oppressor. Literally being harassed while doing law exams, after being locked down during the Pandemic. Asian kids being discriminated against in admissions. Free speech restricted and DEI garbage in their school system. SAT scores being thrown out for activist points and DEI nonsense. Look up who Walz brought into the Minnesota school system, Brian Lozenski. Look at his views. Look at the 250 million Michigan spent in bullshit DEI initiatives.

And there is no justice when you punish people for what their parents or beyond did. You promote equal access. And like usual the left goes to hard in the paint. They should be talking about free community College and trade schools. Harris could have turned it around, but had too much baggage and a terribly inept candidate, because she surrounded herself with the college elite and only knows San Francisco, Howard University/DC, and Montreal. And then she tried to run a Mitt Romney campaign talking about her glock, hanging with Liz Cheney, and wouldn't answer any questions. Trans. Education System. Immigration. Economy. It's really not that hard. And she had to repudiate the bad parts of the left and embrace the good parts. But that's the problem with her style of politics and who she surrounds herself with. Meanwhile you had Trump going against free trade, talking about not taxing tips, calling Liz a war hawk, and the unfairness with immigrants going through the process the right way while illegals coming through, and  calling the news fake while they were caught lying over and over. Trump is a grifter. Her character is disgusting. But let's not pretend the dem party is on the wrong side of the culture war by going to far. Meanwhile she surrounded herself with super rich Hollywood elites, while the pleb working class are suffering paycheck to paycheck. It's almost comical. But don't worry, those rich elites had the correct skin tone? Her branding was abysmal. It's everything people hate about wokism. No substance.

There are Muslim Arab Israelis and many Jews aren't Israeli. If someone persists in blaming Jews as a whole for the war then that is certainly incorrect, antisemitic and hypocritical if they don't make the same distinction between Arab Muslims and Palestinians. However I think if someone does this as a one off and then will correct themself when challenged, it can be an understandable slip of the tongue and not indicative of hypocrisy and antisemitism seeing as Israel itself and it's leaders like Netanyahu do seek to push that idea of conflating Israel and Jewishness.\\nIsraeli - Israel is a nominally democratic state. It has elected multiple Prime Ministers who have campaigned on a basis of continuing war crimes and human rights abuses. A minority of Israelis do oppose this and even for those who do supports Israel's actions that by no means makes them valid targets in warfare as they are still civilians. It does however seem fair to say that collectively Israelis are responsible for the actions of Israel in a more general sense, seeing as they specifically chose their leaders, in a way that Palestinians aren't for the actions of Hamas who they didn't elect. Kind of like if someone says \\"Americans will get what they deserve with Trump\\" or something like that. Obviously many Americans despise Trump and oppose him, but as true generalisation the US population as a whole is responsible for him coming to power (he did get voted in and this time with what looks like a majority of votes). The same applies to Israel.\\nZionism - Zionism is a rather hard term to define. I can dig up academic Jewish articles from decades ago with people arguing that the term had lost its original meaning and required redefinition. I think at least part of the issue here is what other people mean by Zionism and what you mean could be different.For me for instance, a key component of Zionism is not just that Israel should exist but that supporting Israel takes primary importance over respecting the human rights of others peoples or international law. In this basis it is specifically the policy of continuing to occupy Palestine and committing war crimes and human rights abuses there which has allowed the conflict to continue for decades, it seems accurate to label Zionism as to blame seeing as it is the guiding philosophy which has caused Israel to continue the conflict.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Yup, redditors with this smug attitude will never resonate with the common American voter with a mentality like that?","title":"How the 'Latinx' label shifted Latinos from Democrats into arms of Trump"},{"text":"Clearly I need to move to an even redder state to find better women.","title":"As a woman I would like to say - Thank God the men voted!

A mix of democracy and technocracy with a lot of transparency seems like the best approach. Decisions should be driven by logic rather than emotions, but without losing empathetic considerations. However, everything ultimately depends on humans themselves.For instance, if you gave people in a community the power to easily decide how to allocate funds within their local area, it would only work if people cared enough and were willing to educate themselves on the available options. This is where the idea could fail, even though such an approach could enable communities to shape their spaces in more human-centered and effective ways.The key lies in education. A strong start would be to reform our schools to emphasize critical thinking, how to gather and evaluate information, and how to form ones own informed opinion. Currently, education often focuses too much on rote memorization, neglecting these crucial life skills. By teaching students how to analyze, question, and interpret the world around them, we could prepare future generations to engage meaningfully with governance systems and their communities.","title":"Weve gotten the pandemic, the inflation, and now the fascists, when do we get the Depression and WW3?"},{"text":"You are aware inflation always exists right??

You're comparing a certified election to an uncertified one. This time last election we didn't even know who won yet. There are 6 million votes in Cali alone that are still being counted. Oregon is still counting. Washington is still counting. So many States still are counting, especially since they have to cure and wait for postmarked ballots. How are people still this confused about the election process? CA has like a month to certify. So many votes are not in the tally yet. You're confusing races being called versus election with their final certified votes. Turnout will be down, clearly because of election rules different than under a Pandemic and clearly Dems lost big and need to reform. Just don't understand how this lie that there are 15 million less votes has spread so far and wide.Bernie is right. Just tired of hearing that cited figure. Just say Gen Z is tired of the woke shit, faced a difficult experience in the election, and Trump non-stopped campaign and built a strong coalition.No need to spread nonsense about 15 million votes missing until it's certified. Because it's going to be way less than that. I wouldn't be surprised if the vote increased. Because there's something like 16 million votes outstanding right now.","title":"Straight-up BS: Democratic chair attacks Bernie Sanders election critique"},{"text":"Im racking my brain but neither can I.

The money you, and everyone like you, donates goes into the Democratic National Committees coffers.

Same for Republicans. Admittedly SOME of the funds pay for campaign ads, wrapped busses with huge smiles on the side and all that gas money. The people that count votes are paid by the states theyre counting for. Thats all coming from tax dollars. The people counting votes are paid by those states to count impartially. If one party paid better than the other, impartiality would go out the window. Youd see winners based on who paid the counter better. Youre 100% correct. The whole election is a circus run by clowns that comes around every four years to convince you that you matter. That YOUR vote could be the deciding factor! Just like Publishers Clearing House sending out mailers that You could be the next winner of $1,000,000 dollars!. Never mind the electoral college and all thatWhat most people dont realize is this circus is put in place to keep you from seeing that both parties are indebted to the same dark money and have been lying to you for your whole life. Both parties represent the wealthiest of all the people and rarely live up to their promises to make things better for the masses. This is why, on the grand scheme of things, this country has been on the same trajectory for a very long time with ebbs and flows here and there. Always maintaining the same trajectory. Theres a reason most better developed counties have more than two major political parties. A dichotomy is a recipe for mutually beneficial corruption. Until this choice of ONLY RED OR BLUE goes away, this will only continue. This is why ALL of the politics in the USA has shifted to the right with only Bernie Sanders holding out to represent the proper left.

People just like you volunteered to use their time to push people to vote for Harris. In the end, the people were just plugged for more and more money. An endless demand for more. People werent paid for all their work. All volunteers. That money went up the chain. Billions of dollars donated only to watch the Democratic Party woo republican politicians and abandon the poorest people of this nation. Even Bernie Sanders has expressed his sadness in seeing this. Every democrat that donated was competing with opposing donations for the Republican Party from the likes of Elon Musk. Every day people didnt stand a chance. Still, the demand for more donations grew louder!What happened was a contest between greedy and greedier at the cost of the American people. The privileged holding a fundraising popularity contest under the guise of choice between the same thing in two colors. Who gets richer, Red or Blue? No, you cant vote for the people because thats socialism and thats bad. You have to choose which millionaire gets to win! Is one worse than the other? Sure! But both are nowhere near what they should be and neither actually represents the people of the country. Take it or leave it! Just give more! Many Democrats felt this was 100% the right thing to do and I know many Democrats saw the choice as between the lesser of two evils.At this point, its become libertarians in the center, Democrats on the right and Republicans on the far right. We have no leftist party who focuses on the wellbeing of the people above all else. We have a Democrat *light right* wing party who claims to care, only to use that as a way to drain money from the people they claim to care about. If theres ever another election, instead of volunteering, maybe press the candidates to see if they actually represent you and dont simply have their hand out for more money? I have to always remember when Bernie Sanders was running for president against Trump and leading to become the Democratic presidential nominee. Even Trump feared Bernie was unstoppable! That was until the DNC stopped him and chose Hilary Clinton in his stead stating the DNC sees no enforceable obligation in having to run a fair and impartial primary election The DNC attorneys argued the words impartial and evenhandedused in the DNC Charter cant be interpreted by a court of law and there in used to keep things honest. All the people who donated to Bernies campaign were robbed of their money and their hope only to watch Trump become president the first time. Here we are again. Always stand up for what you believe in. Sometimes it IS about the lesser of two evils. At times like right now though, where youve done everything youre being allowed to do, I ask, is supporting this party as it is still worth the effort and never ending demand for funding? OR is it time to demand restructure? What do you do if they refuse?

Ghettos are still common today, and the ghetto mentality of us vs. them is everywhere, criminal institutions reinforce it by segregating people by race, everyone is just racist as fuck and there are lots of incentives to continue being racist.How we fix this is by fixing those incentives. Ironically, Trump is doing a lot right now for racial conciliation by capturing the Latino and Black votes, as dumb as that is, that coalition building will without a doubt make MAGA less racist within the next few years.Stop agitating people by trying to convince them that racism is in our blood and it can't be changed.

If you could prove \\"hardship\\" of splitting the family, USCIS would grant a waiver and let the applicant stay in the country to get their green card. Language barrier, security/crime at their home country, etc, but could not only be a financial hardship.Essentially the only way to get it denied was if the citizen spouse lived in a border town, spoke Spanish, and went down to Mexico every weekend to see friends and family (or party), or flat out already lived in Mexico but commuted to work in the states. In such cases it would be hard to show that they wouldn't be able to live in Mexico with their \\"banned\\" spouse for the 3/5/10 year ban.The program in question just made it so there was no need to apply/prove the waiver.Of course, this is also means that there will very very likely be updated mandates within the agencies that would start making those waivers much more difficult to obtain. As well as probably just firing half the staff to extend those 3-8 month proceedings to 2+ years.Tl-dr: this would normally be a nothing-burger, if it didn't come on the heels of the election results.","title":"Judge declares Biden immigration program for spouses of U.S. citizens illegal"},{"text":"Making judges popularly elected is stupid because it will incentivise judges to hand down decisions that are popular instead of legally correct.","title":"Liberals Just Lost the Supreme Court for Decades to Come"},{"text":"Were gonna stay home or vote 3rd party so Trump will win and well be able to stoke even more moral outrage on the backs of the dead and dispossessedInstead of 100k bodies to build our movement on, well have a millionYeah, you and people like you are either deluded, stupid, or cynically evil.","title":"Where did Joe Biden voters go?

And covid ravaged many coutries and cause a lot of economic crisis and then instead of admitting covid was mainly at fault they thought it made more sense politically to say he handled it too poorly and that he was the cause for all of americas problems and sort lf sat back and didnt do anything. They could have made law allowing abortion in every state again or stopped roe v wade from being overturned since they controlled 2/3 sectors of government but just said oh well we tried and failed. And beyond all of that the exit from the war in afganistan is a total embarassment and the fact that it didnt become a bigger issue with most americans yet is beyond me because joe and kamala pulled troops out of afganistan and didnt follow trumps set in place plan to get everything out because god forbid parties work together on something ever. Now you have terrorist extremists parading with their new top of the line military equipment which is absolutely horrific and that whole was was a massive black hole for money that didnt even produce any results besides cutting the head off the snake once just to have it grow a new head. BUT then without adressing any of their own shortcomings they run kamala on a campaign that really seems to be a grab for voters to want to elect a woman, a black woman which i would say is a fantastic milestone to try to acheive, but it has to be organic and that person who will untimately be the first needs to earn it not just be undemocratically inserted as the presidential candidate (that could be concerning to the state of a democracy) along with actually advocationg for no voter id when there is a know illegal migrant crisis ( thats insane and no other country does that) and then run a campaign on giving back abortion rights and trans rights and inclusion and aid to israel and ukraine and not very much else past that which A) does not cover the border crisis B) doesnt even compete with rfk and trump teaming up to make america healthy again which i see as the greatest win of the election and to not try to run on that same idea was a major missed oportunity but theres a lot of big pharma influence that might not allow that with the democrats and maybe even the republicans but atleast they are making an issue of it now and rightfully so as americans have the worst chronic desease epeidemic of most if not all countries of the world.  you have a guy thats not really cool with people getting abortions as far as im aware besides life of the mother etc etc and has talked very poorly to and about women which isnt right but typical of his generation and hes a felon which there are many politicians on both sides that are equally or more deserving of felon status for insider trading etc etc.I think the main issue with the republican party is that religion is in some of their politics and religion and government should stay separate and it has caused some really bad issues for americans and has given the republican party a bad lookBut to answer your question i think that kost of america is pro trump because he is campaigning on actually fixing the countries issues and not just abortion and trans rights which are lesser issues when you have venezuelan criminals being releases from prison and dropped at the american border as they can just walk in and stay, major human traffickking and just an explosion of undocumented population. I think dems are the minority but some dem values are not minorally shared as i think most women want abortion access to exist and i think theres an argument to be made that you you cant just have one late term because you want to you need a cutoff date which is longer than six weeks because you might not even even know you pregnant then and not everyone is ready but 24 weeks might be too long i think theres some scientific research to be done to find a realistic cutoff (with exemptions ofc) but it seems trump as crude as he is really might be the best option.

Trump and the Republicans used the fascist playbook to weaponize rhetoric. They created a fictional narrative about who Trump is, and who he will be as president. As well as a fiction about Harris. Voters either bought into it wholesale. Or in the confusion of all the discrepancies of it, they picked and choose the part they like the best. Or, because the propaganda lies was also designed to create mistrust and sow confusion, they didn't think that the election mattered and sat it out.So it doesn't matter who the candidate was. They would simply have reshaped the narrative. Face it. Tens of millions of people got conned. The fascist playbook works in countries where voters are not vigilant and resistant to it. But if you want to blame someone, blame the media. They have been sane washing Trump for years. Had they called him out more on his lies, and label them fascist whenever he used fascist rhetoric, perhaps enough people would have been more resistant to it.","title":"So here is the thing that I am still trying to wrap my head around the most.."},{"text":"So you understand why legal immigrants would find an issue with people who came here illegally. Having gone through the process (that's easier than immigrating to a lot of other countries, but not the easiest in the world), been patient, waited for the system to move you along only to have someone skip the line and circumvent that process.And also I disagree with your comment about how everyone is literally illegal immigrants here. There wasn't a country when Europeans came over here (they obviously didn't discover it, there were people here already) and there weren't laws in place that had a process for people who wanted to move here that were being broken by the people arriving.I think most people are empathetic and understanding, but just because someone is in a not great situation in their home country doesn't mean they are entitled to come live in the USA without going through the process in place and following the rules. And if they're escaping a \\"dire situation\\" that qualifies for them declaring asylum here, then there's a path for those people too that doesn't involve sneaking in.There are many, many countries in the world where moving there and obtaining a citizenship is way harder than it is in the USA.","title":"How the 'Latinx' label shifted Latinos from Democrats into arms of Trump"},{"text":"Step one.

I think the issue is that most people just block out how awful Trump is on multiple levels... the negative stories don't break through into their echo chambers, aren't discussed on Fox, not what their friends share on Facebook or whatever. They just don't see it.So with that established, you have to figure that The Republican in a swing state is almost always going to get 45% of the vote regardless of who the candidate is and who they are running against. So that's sort of Trump's floor here. Those aren't voters for Trump, they are voters for generic-Republican. So all Trump has to do is find that other 6% that wouldn't otherwise vote and he wins.. and that's what happened. He managed to find conservative-adjacent people who usually don't vote but were willing to show up for him. Perhaps Liz Cheney actually pulled away a few of those traditional Republicans and the floor is more like 42% and he needs to make up 9% but if that's the case, he still found the votes.Also keep in mind that roughly 1/3 of illegible voters can't even be bothered. That doesn't mean they'd vote against Trump, it could be a 50/50 split, but they don't care enough to even participate in the system. So basically the movement we are seeing is driven by only 1/3 of the country, and only 20% of that group are the difference makers in this recent election. That's not a major shift in political winds.The problem, imho, is about combating disinformation and not having a good way to push back on it. Combine that with infighting over wedge issues being promoted by foreigners (Gaza, in the case of this recent election) and it's an uphill battle.I'm really not sure how or where we need to shift on specific issues, the failure is more one of communication. We need a better more consistent ground game, we need better offline social networks. We need to find a way to be visible without being a parody of ourselves that they see when presented through online bros and Fox. We need to be reaching people year round, not just when it's time for the next election.. Democrats are too reliant on smoke and mirrors rather than feet on the ground. To drive home that last point, Trump had at least SIX public rallies within an hour's drive from me, Harris was here once and it was a private event and I don't think she left the airport. I realize that this isn't a place worth her investing time and energy but if you are just going to touch and go then why show up at all? It was more a publicity stunt than an actual visit.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

He was a middle aged, average bald guy but ended up meeting the reasonably attractive sister of one of the kids in his cult and, over a period of time of communication over the phone, persuading her to quit medical school to come live with him (in conditions she wasn't fully aware of).Getting to my actual point: he managed to persuade both the brother and sister that their parents had conspired, in their past, to poison them. By doing so he effectively alienated them from their family (although he made them occasionally beg for large amounts of money from the family that they would hand over to him). When he finally got arrested it took the brother and sister years to get over the false memories that he'd implanted in them of their parents poisoning them. They essentially ended up remembering what he wanted them to remember which is scary to think about.So some of these folks may indeed have been rewired by propaganda enough that their \\"I'm scared for my life\\" is genuine.Human minds, especially of the young, are malleable and vulnerable.

Dude, there is blatant massive corruption everywhere in politics. The Democratic Party runs on a torrent of billionaire and corporate cash. A striking fact if you ever watch cable news is that they NEVER talk about money in politics or barely ever. When a revolving bad guy like Joe Manchin or a Kirsten Sinema torpedos any legislation that could be good from inside the party, for example, they wont ever even bring up the massive amounts of corrupt cash theyre getting. Instead they will invite them on to talk about how theyre fiscally responsible and just couldnt get there this time because of spending. They will happily brush it off as being a moderate, a word that basically means corporatist extremist at this point. Its absolute blatant insanity in plain sight of that has devastating consequences for tens of millions of people. Massive fundamental change has to happen or things are going to degenerate fast from here. As Bernie pointed out yesterday, 60% of Americans are living pay check to pay check while corporate landlords openly engage in price fixing. Imagine what its like to be working to barely pay extortionate and rigged rent while Kamala talks vaguely about increasing housing supply so in a decade maybe prices might ease off a little if some Manchin/Sinema character doesnt torpedo any potential measures again like they do every time any meaningful change is on the table. The corruption has to be recognised and talked about in a clear-eyed way. People are angry and they are right to be angry. They are pissed at people who have stood by, watching them suffer, and smuggly dismissed them as racists. Trying to triangulate between the corrupt donors and ordinary people is not going to work.

The only undecideds they could get were Haley voters, which is why they made that push with Cheney towards the end. When I heard interviews with Trump campaign people, they were clear on their strategy of courting young black and latino men, and didn't seem worried about the reaching out to Haley voters. So then they thought that there could potentially be a giant gender gap this time around, so they started trumpeting up abortion access and women-centric messaging. People criticize Harris for doing that, but it doesn't seem like Harris had any other avenue to try.","title":"\\"Dems lost because the woke scared away white people\\" son or \\"dems lost because they weren't progressive enough\\" daughter"},{"text":"I always find it funny when they equate the loss of Roe v Wade on Trump directly.

These Sodium levels are off the chart! Link some election Schadenfreude you found."},{"text":"No.So for example I have four immediate coworkers, three I know voted Trump and a fourth who I believe voted but I'm not entirely sure. Let's use them as a small case study... blue collar and in the trades, rural, Trump's target audience.Co-worker 1: the genuine MAGA among them, absolutely pro-Trump. He's the one with the red hat. Also a big Elon Musk fan, a big FuckTony fan. He spends the entire day watching YouTube videos, that's his source of news and information. He's surprisingly somewhat of a critical thinker, at least when something opposite of his opinion is stated but you spend an entire day watching the same stuff it sticks. He's a bit misogynistic, a bit xenobphobic, less racist but there's hints of it. At times it's muted and at time it's a major focus... it's easy to see why Trump appeals to him, specifically. But he also cares a lot about civil liberties so there's a chance of getting through to him on that topic if I can just get him to see what happens under Trump (for example, random ICE road blocks and citizenship checks on GreyHound buses last time). The hard part is getting through to him, I'd actually have more luck via a YouTube video than talking to him. He's strongly non-religious but not anti-religious. He doesn't do any of the weird Trump cult worship stuff (portraits of Trump, signs in the yard year round, etc.), but he thinks Trump successful and smart.Co-worker 2: I wouldn't call him MAGA, but he's a conspiracy theorist. He's a bit of a flat earther, also spends entirely too much time on YouTube and can't tell an obvious parody from real. Big Joe Rogan fan. Otherwise a smart guy, at least when it comes to job related skill but a bit gullible. He has past drug addiction problems so that may play a role. He definitely voted Trump. I wouldn't call him a Trump fan though, in fact when the debate with Biden happened his take away was that it was a trainwreck on both sides.With the first two, the commonality is too much YouTube, getting their information from unreliable sources and propaganda while thinking everything else is the actual propaganda. I believe both of them vote when Trump is on the ballot and probably can't be bothered when Trump isn't on the ballot. I wouldn't really call either of them conservatives in the traditional sense (i.e. Reagan) but they both fit the mold of what the GOP is turning into.Co-worker 3: Kind of a good old boy, but not political and doesn't want to discuss politics. He votes Republican because he hunts, likes guns, not particularly religious but goes to church on major holy days. He's very reasonable but the problem is he doesn't want to discuss the issues so there's no inroad there. He's a reliable voter that sees voting as a duty but he's just a given R vote every time.. he voted for Trump but that's not an endorsement of Trump. If the GOP continues to get worse, maybe he'll wake up to what's happening.Co-worker 4: Just a sort of typical rural guy with decades in the trades but more cynical than political. He's the type to hear something on social media, even if complete BS, and just accept it as accurate. He often says things to me that I have to correct. But he's not passionate about it or anything. I'm not sure if he voted, I know co-worker 1 was really pushing him to vote. But in fairness, co-worker 1 was not necessarily pushing for him to vote for Trump even if that was strongly implied. So, this one is unlikely to vote at all and is just completely disinterested... if he voted for Trump, it's simply because that's what most of his peers did.So out of the five of us.. you have one reliable R voter, myself (a more or less reliable D voter although there are exceptions), and three voters unlikely to show up if Trump is not on the ballot. Looking at just the five of us it's easy to see why Trump won and why it's also not a reflection of the country's overall mood. What they have in common is low information in terms of the quality of \\"news\\" and understanding of government. They trust no 1 because he's passionate on the topic, passion is mistaken for knowlegable, but they don't really follow politics or have only done so recently.

Hes simply repugnant.With that said, in the last four years (between 2021-24), the Consumer Price Index which tracks inflation amongst consumer goods and services was 20 percent. In addition in 2021 &amp; 2022 while inflation was peaking, wage growth lagged behind.Although wage growth has surpassed the inflation rate in 2023 &amp; 24 and the Fed has appeared to maneuver the soft landing, Americans across the country cant help but feel that theyre strapped for cash and the data backs it. We went from seeing record high savings rates to record high consumer debt during the Biden-Harris Administration. Inflation may have cooled, but American families are still feeling some major heat.In closing, Trump won because working/middle class Americans realize that they dont feel better off today than they did four years ago, and that feeling is hurting their ability to provide for their families.

A fundamental problem here is that any one individual voter's caricature of their ideal presidential candidate is not necessarily the same caricature of the next voter, and sometimes those caricatures are at odds. However, every single vote is needed, and it is notably and consistently harder to get voters to vote for Democrats nationally. Democrats' voters resent compromise. On some degree, I can understand that -- compromising with adversarial groups is pointless and fruitless and has led to a lot of strife. But sometimes, compromises need to be made with uncomfortable positions or potential allies, and this is simply unpalatable to some subset of voters.To echo AoC, we need to be willing to build coalitions. Sometimes that means voters (people) have to make and commit to decisions they may not be happy with because it is needed to make positive change. But I worry that our electorate is simply incapable of this. Anything that can be digested quickly and easily is simply not given any further thought, and where the most immediate and basal of reaction takes center-stage at the exclusion of everything else drives voting decision.","title":" How can we create our own \\"Project 2028\\" so we have a fully fleshed out set of Democratic policies to rebuild democracy and the fed?

Should the powers declare themselves willing to admit our sovereignty over a neutral piece of land, then the society will enter into negotiations for the possession of this land. Here two territories come under consideration, Palestine and Argentine. In both countries, important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment the native population feels threatened and forces the government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless we have a sovereign right to continue such immigration - Herzl, The Jewish State.So here Herzl:\\n- Refers to the Palestinians as the native population, NOT the Jews.\\n- Explicitly describes the immigration of Jews to these regions as colonialism.\\n- Starts the passage by wanting to appeal to colonial powers and not the people who actually live there.All of this is fairly good evidence that Zionism is a settler colonial ideology but theres more. If his majesty the Sultan were to give us Palestine, we could in return undertake to regulate the whole finances of Turkey. We should there form a portion of a rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to Barbarism. We should as a neutral state remain in contact with all Europe, which would have to guarantee our existence - Herzl, the Jewish StateSo here Herzl is trying to get an imperial power(Turkey) to give the Zionists land(obviously disregarding the people who already live there) and wants to essentially create an extension of Europe to fight Barbarians in the name of civilization which is just colonial rhetoric at its finest. I briefly told him the purpose of my visit, but in order to prepare him for the shock, I took the precaution of speaking at first only of colonization.it was not a matter of colonization on a small but on a large scale. We wanted the territory as an autonomous one - the Diaries of Theodore HerzlSo once again, Herzl is making it extremely clear that Zionism is a settler colonial ideology. Hes not vague about it at all in fact if anything its apart of his advertising strategy.There are other examples of course. Herzl uses the word settlement a lot throughout his writings. Overall, Herzl is very clear throughout his writings that Zionism is a settler colonial ideology that relies and racist mentalities and tropes. He explicitly states throughout his writings that Zionism is a colonial ideology and that Jews are colonizers. He uses the methods and reasoning of settler colonialism.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"I think guys of all races like Trumps machismo.

You wanted this, didn't you? You did this. This is the \\"economy\\" you voted for, are you proud of yourself now?What are you going to do to fix your mistake? Because \\"vote differently next time\\" isn't gonna cut it anymore. There's real harm and weight about to be dropped on this nation because too many of our countrymen were wilfully ignorant or intentionally cruel. It's best for the ones you know to find out real quick which is which. If they want to change and want to fight, help them out, sign them up, and make an ally. (But don't trust them where anyone's safety could be involved). If they're happy with their choice as they see the damage done - let them know you know what they did, and they can't hide who they are any more. Broadcast that shit, for the people who need protection and whose lives are at risk, that they can better protect themselves going forward.\\nAnd if you're not in a position to voice your opinion safely - keep your head down. Stay safe, stay quiet, keep your eyes peeled. If you have a friend who is trans, no you don't. You know an immigrant family from down the street - they were born here as far as you've heard. Someone new invites you to a protest downtown - that sounds like a waste of time, you'd never be interested in something like that. Trust nobody who doesn't have skin in the game. Clean your socials, put the mask back on, and protect yourself and your loved ones as best you can.\\nWe all have hope that this won't go as bad as we think it's going to go.

To say they dont know how government works is only to affirm the basic principle of representative democracy. They really arent supposed to know everything about everything in government. And its not that people do or dont know how tariffs work, or economics, or fiscal policy, or anything else on that long list. Thats WHY we elect representatives to do that work and the problem is not that the issues are too complicated. Its because the electorate dont feel listened to, they feel patronized, they feel taken advantage of, and they feel abandoned. The way an automobile engine works is complicated. I know vaguely the principles involved but I certainly dont know everything and not nearly enough to fix my own car. I could buy the tools and read the books and manuals and give it a try because Im not stupid and COULD learn it, but Im a history professor and the chair of the department at a small university and that keeps me pretty busy. So I may not even understand the true nature of the problem, much less how to fix it but that doesnt mean that I dont know that my car doesnt run. COMMON SENSE tells me that. Thats why I have a mechanic I trust. He knows intricately everything there is to know about cars and I have come to trust his expertise, skill, experience, and judgment. I tell him what is going on with my Volvo, HE LISTENS, and then works to fix it. I dont need to know the ins and outs of every little part of it, although I also know that if I DO ask him, hell explain it all to me and why he did the work he did and why thats costing me what it costs. But really, I just want my car to run well. Ive had the same mechanic for going on ten years now and BECAUSE I trust him, and BECAUSE he listens, and BECAUSE he doesnt take my money and tell me everythings fine when it ISNT, I keep coming back to him. But if he began to start talking down to me like Im stupid, telling me the car is fixed when it isnt, or simply not listening to me when I tell him whats going on with my car, then thats the day I ELECT to go someplace else. In the end, auto mechanics are a dime a dozen, and so are elected officials.Im devastated by the outcome of the election and for the first time in my life, I am beginning to think that the problems we have in this country are now beyond fixing and not because theyre too hard for people to understand but because nobody has faith in the people who have claimed to make that work their lifes calling. \\nThe belief that people are too stupid to make good choices based on COMMON SENSE is EXACTLY why were not winning, governing, or providing solutions for what is clearly a country that is in its twilight without a rapid return to basic principles of good government.","title":"Democratic strategist says her party has lost common sense and the ability to speak to normal people"},{"text":"Are telling me that people were literally paying REAL MONEY to get false propaganda and wrong information?Why not just listen to the free bots on reddit telling them how Harris is going to win and why orange man is bad.Why would anybody pay for lies?

I also wish he'd talked a bit about the Virginia democrats who seem to have done very well this cycle, and  tried to highlight some examples of why they appear to have broken the trend.One of the difficulties in explaining the positive impact the Democrats did have on the economy is being able to \\"Disaggregate\\" your commentary. Some parts of America are objectively worse off under the Democrat administration! And some parts are better off, including what I would call the aggregates as a whole.Ideally, Kamala's campaign would have had the time + space to be able to make this point in a nuanced way. Some were better off, and some were not. That isn't good enough, but Kamala had built the *foundation* for ensuring everyone would benefit under her administration - and here were some clear, specific policies on how she would do that.That would have let her more clearly differentiate herself from Biden. Ideally of course a longer democratic campaign and primary (Biden not stepping down earlier + having a concrete succession plan was the biggest 'Democratic' Mistake of this overall for me) would have given the Democrats even more room to move on this by running a primary and letting them run against Biden's record.However, all of the above is about nuance, it's about having an adult conversation where the Democrats sit down with the median voter - they have a give and take. They admit wrongdoings, and in doing so (law of repocriation) they also *push back* on some of the messaging about how America's become a lot worse. I think that conversation is doable - I think the Democrats could and should have had it. It's the equivalent of the fireside chat - authenticity still counts for something. And in some ways, Kamala was handicapped in terms of being authentic because she wasn't able to differentiate herself from Biden.However, think one has to acknowledge the utter domination of the alternative media space makes this so much harder of a tightrope to walk. When the other side's media firehose is a 24/7 screaming ocean of piss that allows no compromise or nuance, you're swimming uphill. Again, I think the Democrats still win this election if they play their cards right, and I think all of Josh's points in this article are valid. A lot of them echo frustrations I've made in my post history, especially the idea of the Democrat [everything bagel]( https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/democrats-liberalism.html) and tariffs. However, the media environment makes a big-tent Democratic wipeout *incredibly* difficult.We do need to keep the role of the media war in mind. The Trumpian alternative media did an exceptionally effective job of narrowing the language / scope of what the Democrats could talk about, and the nuance with which they could do it. This is an area the Democrats badly need to improve in.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"Thanks for everything except for saying we should throw immigrants under the bus.

Obama came from nowhere on a populist message and defeated Dem establishment choice Clinton in 2008, and just crushed both of his elections by wider electoral margins than Trump.In 2016, the Dem establishment swept Sanders under the rug, and Trump was elected by appealing to middle class blue collar workers.  The same is true and even more amplified in 2024 where he will also carry the popular vote.Clinton and Harris ran on \\"I'm not Trump\\" or fear of failing democracy, which doesn't actually speak to the issues and needs of most working class people.  Trump still has a negative favorability rating, but his messaging is simple and it appeals to working class individuals that were all but taken for granted by the democratic party.  So many voters consistently would say they don't like Trump, but voted for him because they felt he handles the economy better, and whether right or wrong, that perception gets you votes. At the end of the day, the electorate appreciates charisma, populism, and simple messaging.","title":"I give Biden some credit"},{"text":"That's Hillary and her 2016 campaign, along with the corporate media.","title":"The hatred and contempt unleashed by liberals on Latinos was predictable as soon as it became apparent how many of them voted for Trump, but the intensity of the anti-Latino bile in just 24 hours has been a bit surprising.

Keep in mind that the Supreme Court basically invented its own power. Judicial review isnt in the constitution. The Supreme Court just kind of decided they get to do that, everyone else mostly just went along with it, and since its been centuries, nobody really questions it. At the end of the day, the Supreme Court relies on everyone else respecting it and collectively agreeing to continue the game of make believe. One of the big things that makes that possible is the perception that the Justices arent politicians and strive to be serious and judgmanlike. If you start loading the bench with youngsters naked power grab style, it pulls the curtain back and people start questioning why were listening to philosopher kings. Politicians dont want that because they know that when the ideological balance of the court is in their favor that it benefits them. Secondly, it makes them more of an unknown quantity. Peoples political beliefs can change significantly between young adulthood and death. Nominating a 20 or 30 year old can mean you end up getting ratfucked by your own nominee for decades. Picking a more ripe candidate with a long track record of decisions in line with your ideological preferences raises confidence that nominating them benefits you and your team longer term.","title":"Liberals Just Lost the Supreme Court for Decades to Come"},{"text":"Let's assume a bunch of faithless electors casts their votes for someone other than Trump, or even goes for Kamala (if that's how faithless electors even work) and it gives the win to Kamala, are there no safeguards or other laws/policies to \\"fix\\" this so that the candidate that actually won the election is president?","title":"Liberals Just Lost the Supreme Court for Decades to Come"},{"text":"I mean, there's other swing states where it mattered too, but yeah.

I said it was bigger than Rogan for women, which is true [according to last year's Spotify recap](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-11-29/top-songs-artists-podcasts-albums-trends-2023/). Rogan audience is [81% male](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/donald-trump-joe-rogan-podcast-1236041671/).And JRE is absolutely a right-wing podcast. Let's examine his 10 most recent guests - * JRE #2225 - Dave Smith, a Libertarian political podcaster\\n* JRE #2224 - Tim Dillon, a conservative comedian and pocaster\\n* JRE #2223 - Elon Musk, self-explanatory\\n* JRE #2222 - John Fetterman - Someone who ran as a progressive, but has since admittedly [abandoned progressives since his stroke](https://newrepublic.com/post/182504/john-fetterman-abandon-progressives-bill-maher)\\n* JRE #2221 - JD Vance - self-explanatory\\n* JRE #2220 - Triggernometry podcasts hosts, also right-wing\\n* JRE #2219 - Trump, self-explanatory\\n* JRE #2218 - Sam Tripoli, [self-admitted conservative](https://www.instagram.com/samtripoli/p/CCP2MCzFFGW/)\\n* JRE #2217 - Brian Cox - not American but is anti-Brexit and would probably classify as left-wing in\\n* JRE #2216 - Luke Bryan - conservative country singer. Of his last 10 podcasts, there is only one person who holds views that aren't right-wing. Even if you want to be charitable and claim that Fetterman is still a progressive, that is still 80% conservative guests. Claiming that JRE isn't right-wing is dishonest. That ratio is not an accident.

To add, while there are multiple reasons, this is perhaps the biggest one. When it's easier to vote - more people vote. There's a reason why there has been a concerted effort to make voting more difficult in certain areas. In 2020 we got a glimpse of where voters actually stand. You have to consider many factors when it comes to voter turnout. For instance, if you are working a job paycheck to paycheck, you're more likely not going to be able to vote. Add to that the long lines to cast your ballot in certain communities, and you have the recipe for low voter turnout. After all, if you're working a couple low wage jobs just to get by and have a family to take of, voting isn't your first priority, your family is the immediate concern. Yes, one could argue about the importance of casting your vote and how it will affect your families future, but when you have only so many hours in the day, those immediate responsibilities are your priority. Millions of people are forced to make tough decisions on election day between making sure their kids get dinner, did their homework, have food for breakfast and (in some cases) lunch the next day, and then knowing they have to do it all again the next day. So while they would really like to participate, they simply are unable to in many cases. There are people who struggle with this problem every election, and it's a damn shame. Yeah, some companies allow their employees an opportunity to go vote, but there aren't many. The vast majority who aren't given this opportunity are low-wage employees who provide \\"essential services\\", yet are the same people who are considered unessential when it comes to them having a voice.

The three justices appointed by Trump in his first term were young by judicial standards: Justice Neil Gorsuch was 49 years old at the time of his confirmation, Brett Kavanaugh was 53, and Amy Coney Barrett was 48. All three of them could easily serve on the Supreme Court until the 2060s, and their replacement of older justices meant Democrats already faced a difficult path to flipping the court to the liberals within the next 10 to 15 years. That time horizon is now closer to 30 or 40 years.Given that Supreme Court judges are always political appointees and always serve for life, I've wondered why the two major parties don't simply drop all pretenses and nominate judges that are no older than 30 so that they can comfortably serve their agenda for half a century or more.","title":"Liberals Just Lost the Supreme Court for Decades to Come"},{"text":"Pasting a reply to another comment, because your comment just now triggered me.

Meanwhile on the journalism end they have one person staffed to cover the topic and it's cherrypicked to max sensationalism. The letter was written right after particularly egregious cherrypicked data were covered.I also think this piece misses the mark on why Harris lost the election, which was 1) a poor economic environment by the lower class, consistent with what was happening abroad that led to incumbent parties losing, 2) an inability to formulate a strong economic and domestic structural positions because the administration she was attached to was unpopular, and 3) a lot of wealthy business people got angry at some of the details in Biden's handling of businesses, including a vastly unpopular FTC chair, which led to considerable effort by the wealthy people in the country to see that administration discontinued. Maybe, there's an argument to be made that the complete alienation of men in the campaigning of Harris also led to the loss.So, while I agree that liberals in general go on about so many problems, I'm not sure anything mentioned in this piece has any impact on changing an election.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"Depends on the gender and race of the other candidate.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 7, 2024"},{"text":"The fallout im referring to is the absolute shellacking we just endured on Tuesday.

Then, in July 2024, they demanded he step down, after he had trouble speaking during the debate. July is too late to start a primary. Its funny, because the mainstream media DEMANDED he step down, but then the mainstream media didnt even endorse Harris.

They are the ones who handle all the money. Now they are about to put Russell Vought in charge of OMB, who essentially controls the accounting side of the government. He is yes-man and loyal to Trump and wants to create a Christian Nationalist government. The worst part about this is that a Christian Nationalist country is more of a means to an end. The end goal is that corporations have record-breaking profits. The next step would be to fire a large part of the OMB, so that they CANNOT report the financial impacts of Trumps policies. We will get delay after delay for these reports, if Trumps Agenda 47 comes to fruition. Just remember, this was the exact agency cited in the Supreme Court, and theres a reason for that.

But to answer your question, I think there are arguments either way. Rogan definitely is the biggest, and you are correct in that he typically doesn't push back on guests unless it's about fighting/MMA. However, there is also the plenty of evidence that he heavily facilitates the young men to redpill pipeline, and there is an argument against Kamala attaching her name to that and further amplifying some of the more problematic guests Rogan has on.Personally, I think the Rogan thing is overblown, but the argument that she could have done more podcasts that weren't her audience has merit. Instead of doubling down on Club Shay and The Breakfast Club, which I imagine has a similar audience, I think she could have gone to someone like Friedman or Theo Von, who I think has more overlap with Rogan's audience but don't host as many right-wing conspiracy theoriests.Even still, my point about Trump being held to a lower bar stands.
