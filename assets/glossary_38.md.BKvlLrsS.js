In the case of billionaires, number one is out of an increasingly smaller number of people and competitorsyou become competing against the gov, can you win vs them? etc etc Most people in a situation they developed on their own work, craft, strategy would do most anything to protect it.

Many Americans would say 300k is comfortable, but you could imagine what 600k could do, especially if they are fulfilling their own destiny.I think we are all capable of doing bad things and feeling rewarded for it, I think you dont go straight to doing bad things, its a gradual progression based on confirmation biasI must be right bc I did x y and x.Once you get to a certain point you are not only above everyone, but desensitized.

This would have been a political certainty, as predictable as what happens when you touch a match to a puddle of gasoline. When business screwed the farmers and the workers C when it implemented monopoly strategies invasive beyond the Populists' furthest imaginings C when it ripped off shareholders and casually tossed thousands out of work C you could be damned sure about what would follow. Not these days. Out here the gravity of discontent pulls in only one direction: to the right, to the right, further to the right. Strip today's Kansans of their job security, and they head out to become registered Republicans. Push them off their land, and next thing you know they're protesting in front of abortion clinics. Squander their life savings on manicures for the CEO, and there's a good chance they'll join the John Birch Society.

The only answer is these people are into Schadenfreude, sadism, self-hating, self-destruction. In order to explain to the \\"Cons\\" why no progress gets made on these issues, politicians and pundits point their fingers to a \\"liberal elite,\\" a straw man representing everything that conservatism is not. When reasons are given, they eschew economic reasons in favor of accusing this elite of simply hating America, or having a desire to harm \\"average\\" Americans. This theme of victimization by these \\"elites\\" is pervasive in conservative literature, despite the fact that at the time conservatives controlled all three branches of government, were being served by an extensive media devoted only to conservative ideology, and had won 6 of the previous 9 presidential elections.

Not feasible.Fallout is only significant when the fireball touches the ground and has an opportunity to neutron-activate heavier particles; heavier fallout falls out faster than lighter fallout and therefore has had less time to decay before it begins reaching things humans don't want it to.If a shot tower high enough to prevent this is impractical, a balloon-borne test is another option (albeit with its own problems). I have no idea whether Poland has geology suitable for underground testing, or whether its part of the Baltic is deep enough that a barge test's fireball wouldn't touch the seafloor and cause a Baker.Gun designs and anything not boosted is vulnerable to predetonation from Russian nuclear ABMs. Gun designs and anything not boosted is vulnerable to predetonation from Russian nuclear ABMs. The only survivable weapons are the 2 and 3 stage designs on MIRVs with salvage fusing.While I'm aware of the value the Russian government assigns to Moscow (imperial core and all), they only have so many interceptors. Who cares if any individual nuke is survivable, provided you have enough?Let's say that Russian forces cross into Poland, and, consequently, two hundred MRBMs get shot at Moscow in sequence (as opposed to in one wave), twenty of which are nuclear-tipped. But Russian BMD doesn't know *which* twenty, do they? They'll have to spend so many interceptors fighting potentially-nuclear spam that eventually a real nuke will get through when A-135/235 runs out of missiles.Maybe Russian forces can launch a retaliatory strike once they see the first Polish MRBMs launching, but if the MRBMs are dispersed on TELs I bet the counterforce strike won't get many. I'm sure you're aware of the cockroach-like tendencies of TELs.There is a public misconception that just having any nukes at all is an adequate deterrent; it's not. The quality of the warheads, delivery systems, quantity, and launcher proximity to the target are all very important for deterrence.I'm well aware of that; North Korea is probably the best example of this, where their actual deterrent has mostly been the artillery aimed at Seoul. You need China-style/number of nukes to deter one of the nuclear superpowers, of which Russia is one; small \\"regional\\" arsenals like the Pakistani and North Korean ones won't do.This in mind: if you assume Russia attempting to invade Poland is a given, any nukes are better than no nukes. The question isn't whether to start development  it's when to. Without nukes they're probably screwed, so they might as well at least try for small stuff like nuclear artillery/landmines before today's Russian economy figures out it needs to conquer and loot more than Ukraine to survive.","title":"Trump says Putin wants to meet, arrangements already underway"},{"text":"I think its also that a part of toxic masculinity is being able to brag about how many little sex trophies youve forced women to make for you.

Apparently not. You seem to think that they do it by hiring people, paying them nothing, and then selling the stuff they make/handle and taking all the profits. That's not how you get a billionaire at all. Billionaires become billionaires by exploiting other billionaires (and in the process creating a lot of millionaires, typically). Bezos didn't make anything on the backs of laborers before he retired as CEO... Amazon had never made *any* profits on the sale of stuff and shipping it up to that time. The only real money they made was on cloud services, and I can tell you from experience with many people I know that worked in those areas... they were paid extremely well and a big chunk of them retired by 40. Bezos is worth a lot because rich people (include those investing the earnings of workers and making *them* much richer too) have purchased Amazon stock and bid its price up to rather stupid levels. Billionaires are created by asset bubbles, not \\"profits stolen from workers\\". Now... it will almost inevitably all come crashing down *eventually*, but in the mean time, you're going to have to contend with the fact that Amazon pays unskilled workers actually somewhat above the going rate for their area... that's why they... hire on.Trump is a different but related case: he made a shit ton of money grifting bankers, and a small amount grifting suppliers... and then another large amount grifting people that couldn't afford it into investing in a terribly company... note what's missing in any of that?

Options to the consumer have increased, plus the accessibility and convenience of these items has helped to keep prices on these goods as low as possible. Also creating 1.5 million jobs which didn't exist before that, and that doesn't even include the jobs created from services which cater to Amazon. Jeff Bezos deserves every penny he has.one of the worst workplaces in the entire country for worker who make pennies to Bezos' millions.Go figure people with no job skills don't make as much money as people with job skills. And they make less than Bezos because they produce maybe $200 worth of wealth per day while Bezos produces millions.

Unfortunately, I greatly doubt that Biden's statements were even intentional, given that they were immediately walked back each time by unknown people in the State Department or Press Office.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61548531](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61548531)I'd argue that this is directly contradictory to US interests: not only does this undercut our longstanding policy of strategic ambiguity, it also makes the President look like he's not even in control of his own Executive Branch.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"\\"A business only succeeds and makes a buttload of money if and only if the product they provide are worth the value as its a voluntary transaction between the consumer and the business.\\"That's true in terms of non-necessities.

In a free market, people vote with their dollars (and attention, for ad-supported products) for the products that best serve them. This incentivizes other people to make the best products that truly serve fellow humans. Sometimes, when capitalists make truly great products, they accrue a ton of capital  think Google founders, Facebook founders, Tesla, etc I find your cutoff of $1 billion to be arbitrary and seemingly shaped by the opposite side trying to use class politics to sow division, eg leftists. Is $1 million or $100 million not exploitive, but $1 billion is? Maybe $1 billion isnt, but $100 billion is? I find this logic arbitrary and based on little more than jealousy.If someone creates a product that creates a billion times more value in the world for other humans, its perfectly reasonable for them to accrue a billion times more capital.Take Google. The Google founders are obscenely wealthy, but I think its fairly obvious that they have created exponentially more value in the world than theyve captured. The incremental productivity, product sales, etc created by Google is clearly in the trillions of dollars, so by comparison the $200 billion of wealth they have is actually proportional and relatively small. This also incentivizes other people to make an even better product and, as history shows us, eventually someone will, and capital will accrue away from Google and towards them, but society will benefit even more. Arguably this is happening right now with AI improving upon and replacing search.Capitalism is the best system. It works. Is it imperfect? Sure. But humans are imperfect, and the other issues you mention either have other root causes and/or are necessary trade-offs to support capitalism which is a system that, on the whole, has  lifted most of the world out of poverty.A thought experiment is: if everyone in the world could be lifted out of poverty, and no one would be exploited, but it required 1 person to accrue a trillion dollars, would that be fair and worthwhile trade? Morally the answer has to be yes. But will people be jealous of the person with 1 trillion? Sure. Thats effectively what I see as the modern lefts position on capitalism.I also want to inverse the above logic to show why communism doesnt work. Capitalism is effective because people vote with their dollars by purchasing the best products and rewarding and incentivizing the creation of ever-better products. You cant cheat this process. Amazon and Google are successful because theyre the best products, not because they cheated. (As an aside, while some companies succeed by essentially cheating, eg bribing governments, lets say, this is directly anti-capitalist, and much closer to communism).In non-capitalist systems  communism, heck, even normal, modern governments, the allocation of capital is decidedly arbitrarily, rather than through merit, and this just never works. Wealth and power are rewarded to winners of arbitrary political games, not the Darwinian process that awards these in capitalism. This produces bad products. In communism, a tech company, the Russian version of Google, lets say, is run by Putins friend, not the person who invented the best search technology. This product will be way worse than Google, because the capital wasnt allocated by the honest voting of people using the best product  it was allocated by Putin to his friend. In short, capitalism works. Alternatives dont. $1 billion is an arbitrary cut off. There should be no billionaires is a poor argument fueled by jealously and class warfare from the left.","title":"CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire"},{"text":"This is how a lot of the conversations go with a few friends of mine.

I am the true Florida man after all, he said on the show. Lots of Florida Republicans would be pretty excited. Gaetz was a representative in Congress from 2017 to 2024 and was reelected in the past election before he was nominated as attorney general by President-elect Donald Trump. He later withdrew ahead of the release of a House Ethics panel report accusing him of regularly paying for sex with women, including a minor.  The report by the bipartisan panel included explicit details of sex-filled parties and vacations that Gaetz took part in from 2017-2020. The politician has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.  Pam Bondi, former Florida attorney general, replaced him as the nominee for attorney general.  After he withdrew, Gaetz was hired as the host of a weekly primetime show on the far-right One America News Network. In the video posted on X, Gaetz said he said he couldnt believe there were already questions about the next election when Trump hasnt been sworn in yet. \\n My family will think and pray about this.

People in the lower classes don't have the time or the energy to work 4-6 days a week with an 8 hour shift AND go home and cook food from scratch every night just to avoid some salt and sugar. They are going to do whats easier so that they can do other things. Cooking isn't a desirable hobby for everyone. Not everyone gets joy out of it.Medication and Metabolism: Some people are on medication that makes them overweight. Certain anti depressants and adhd meds do this.Social Engineering: Comparison to European countries such as The Netherlands and Denmark. Why are the people there so fit and skinny? Their cities are designed to encourage bike riding and walking. American cities are designed around cars and will be for the foreseeable future.  These are also cultures that normalize smaller portion sizes which is tough to get used to if you are used to big American portion sizes.Lackluster Regulation: This in my opinion, is a big one. And I'm going to use Latin America as an example instead. Latin America has car centric cities and a cultural norm of large meals just like the United States. They aren't thin like Europeans and asians are. But they are thinner than us. And thats because sugar content is highly regulated. Countries like Colombia have a near 100% sugar taxes on their products, they force companies to slap a sticker on products with high sugar content that says HIGH IN SUGAR, they penalize companies if they put too much sugar in their products, and they encourage artificial sweeteners. Turns out if you want Coke and your options are a normal Coke that is 4 dollars and has a giant warning label on it vs a Diet Coke which is 2 dollars with no warning label, You'll pick the Diet Coke. If you did this in the US people would start complaining about their rights being taken away which is horse shit.Misinformation: There's this weird truism Americans have that Artificial Sweeteners such as Aspartame are more unhealthy than natural Sugar. It isn't. It's one of the most highly tested chemicals out there and is proven to be safe for consumption. It has been that was for almost 50 years. It is far safer than the Diabetes and Heart Disease that a sugar diet can eventually give you.Please think about this stuff before you repeat that obesity is simply a moral failing. It is far more complex than that.","title":"GOP Senator Blames Americans for Most of Their Health Problems"},{"text":"Wow, it's almost as though Trump doesn't know much about tariffs or something.","title":"How Trump could declare a national emergency to hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs"},{"text":"All right.  I've looked at the first four links you gave pretty closely, and the problem (to me) is that you don't distinguish between what the left calls bullying and what I think of as bullying.  To me, threatening real violence against peaceful, democratic allies is real bullying.  Bringing up Hilary's bathroom habits or mocking a disabled reporter, you know, it's not right, but it's not what I think of when I think of bullying.  It's not a reason to believe Trump is going to destroy the international peaceful order we spent so many decades to build.  Which in my view is the real problem.Second.  You mention that using a different reason for impeachment than a ground of impeachment implicates our justice system and makes it easier to slide into corruption.  I would have to agree.  So thank you for that!  !deltaI don't think it's enough MORE corruption than what we already have to make it necessary to avoid, however.  Our constitution doesn't actually protect us very much.  We nod in its general direction, as we pass it every day on our way to work in our so called justice system, but we don't actually implement it meaningfully, as far as I can tell.  Right to trial?  No.  Speedy trial?  Nuh-uh.  Applying the laws as written?  Sorry:  no.  And so we're already on the far side of that particular divide, and I don't think a slippery slope is going to move us any significant direction toward or away from corruption.I actually have no evidence the people did NOT vote for a bully.  I would like to believe they didn't, and if we impeach Trump we will give them an opportunity to be heard, on that.And finally:  the Republican establishment has the BIGGEST axe to grind, where Trump is concerned, because he's destroyed everything they spent years of not decades building.  I don't know, but I suspect there are very few, in Congress, who don't harbor some secret animosity toward Trump and who don't secretly yearn for an excuse to implement it.

That campaign was almost successful when the Istanbul accords were initialed.

Russia has not fully mobilized, which keeps the average Russian happy as its economy has grown to the 4th largest (PPP according to the IMF and World Bank so anyone who wants to argue about it, find a more reliable source -- you can't.)  The people in the Donbas are still tasked with doing most of the fighting and they are looking for a more rapid solution. Then there's the question of defining \\"finish off\\".  Many argue that Ukraine already is \\"finished\\", that doesn't mean the fighting has stopped.  There has to be a political solution.  The Zionist Nazis in the Biden administration do NOT want to be blamed for the loss so they're doing all they can to keep the war going.  Russia is in no hurry to end the war because the US has not been willing to accept the terms laid out months ago.  Ritter (et. al. mostly the folks on Judge Naps show) carefully explains that Russia isn't really all that interested in occupying Kiev and then having to fight a guerrilla war.  Unfortunately this all devolves to \\"kill all the Ukrainians\\".  I've hardly begun to touch the nuance of what is going on in this war.  The collapse of Syria and the tensions over Taiwan directly affect how it will be prosecuted.  Ritter presents a compelling case.

Today, states receive what's called Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) that provides Medicaid funding based on a state's per capita income. MD gets a lot less money from the feds than MS, for example. This money, in combination with dollars from the state, are used to pay for services, run assistance programs, etc. In most states they are also used to pay insurance companies to administer Medicaid on behalf of the state. Insurers get a monthly per person premium based on the projected health and cost of services of the Medicaid population. But if the funding pool is limited, states will have no choice but to cut these premiums and put a cap on how much they pay the plans. Costs are always rising whether due to inflation or new pharmaceuticals like GLP-1s.Why should we care about the insurance companies? Well, less revenue but higher profit targets means cutting costs. They will do this through more Prior Authorizations to deny or delay services, not covering expensive drugs, and downscaling internal operations. This will very negatively impact people covered by Medicaid and the doctors who are paid by these plans. It will be worse in poorer states who can't replace the federal funding they historically would've received.If you're not on Medicaid, this also affects you. Insurers will need to reduce costs in other products, like employer coverage or Medicare Advantage, to hedge the inevitable reduction in revenue from Medicaid. This doesn't even account for all the problems with dismantling the ACA will cause.Our healthcare system is about to get even more fucked and unfair than it has been ever before.","title":"Big Cuts To Medicaid Reportedly On The Menu For House Republicans\\n"},{"text":"But they will make it about moral failing.

There is the subway, 3 commuter railways that converge on Lower-Midtown Manhattan, and the Port Authority with trains and the best commuter bus network in the country. So not only is there great transit in, there are natural chokepoints. Literally the tunnels in on the Hudson, &amp; the bridges on the East River.So that means implementation meant cameras on these highways and then on about a dozen north-south avenues. Most other cities would have to do a lot to implement. (1) Because the downtowns/CBDs might not be easily delineated as easily as Manhattan and (2) because geography doesn't suit itself to setting up these boundaries.I'm familiar with DC for example. Using the border of the district would be too broad, but even if you zero it in on everything inside FL Ave and the rivers, you'd be missing Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Arlington. And what about Tysons? Even the simplest zones would mean hundreds of blocks with cameras otherwise people will divert to side streets.Boston might be the one other place it could work, due to the river + harbor geometry and how their transit all leads to downtown.I'm all for the congestion charge in NYC. But NYC is also the one city in the US, arguably, where having a car is not only unnecessary but actively worse than using transit. But given that other cities have (1) more spread of job centers and (2) worst transit than NYC, I think transit should be a little more carrot and less stick in other areas to build out more transit and dense housing via zoning reform.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"she wanted to make it look like only democrats showed up. by their own definition, she posted misinformation","title":"Kamala Harris Shares a Trump-less Photo of Presidents at Jimmy Carters Funeral"},{"text":"In a sane system, someone like Trump would be ineligible to run for dog catcher, let alone president.","title":"Donald Trump has gone silent on working class cost of living issues"},{"text":"Trump Covid-19 response killed how many?","title":"Trump Calls Officials Handling Los Angeles Wildfires Incompetent"},{"text":"They allow our water air and food to be poisoned for their profit and they blame us....","title":"GOP Senator Blames Americans for Most of Their Health Problems"},{"text":"Isn't his name Tim Apple?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"Amen to that","title":"Do you guys got liberal freinds"},{"text":"Of course, Canada would have no means of retaliating. /s","title":"How Trump could declare a national emergency to hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs"},{"text":"the russians defeated the nazis in WW2 and they'll finish off the banderites soon enough.","title":"They are determined to escalate this into WW3 as Trump takes office.

Think McMansion developments in what most people would view as run-down small cities.He did work with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, ran youth programs in the town of Braddock, PA after joining Americorps, and later moved to Braddock and became its part-time mayor, full-time youth services person focused on getting out of school youth GEDs.Protesting the highway bypassing the town? He was there. Protesting the medical center taking away the town's hospital? He was there. Buying up distressed properties, and converting them for public use? That's him. Defying the law to marry LGBT couples at his house? That's him too.Basically, if you look at Fetterman in Braddock, it makes sense why he had progressive credentials at the time. He was a strong example of a downhome decaying city focused mayor bringing real change to his constituents as much as possible.He ran in the 2016 primary for PA-Gov, which he did surprisingly well for comparatively low recognition, and the guy who beat him lost to the Republican. He next ran for Lt. Gov and won in 2018, and is most famous for his first task being MJ legalization research, and famously loudly supporting it and LGBTQ equality with flags hanging  from his office balcony, which the legislature made a point of having him remove.This is where most peoples knowledge comes in, and they focus on his work on the Board of Pardons at Lt.Gov.The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the Board of Pardons \\"with the heart of an activist and, at times, the force of a bully\\".[63] The Inquirer also reported that he threatened to run against Attorney General Josh Shapiro (who, at the time, was planning a run for governor) unless Shapiro supported more pardons.[63]While chaired by Fetterman, the Board of Pardons recommended 50 commutations for life sentences, and Governor Wolf granted 47 commutations.[64] As lieutenant governor, Fetterman announced \\"a coordinated effort for a one-time, large-scale pardoning project for people with select minor, nonviolent marijuana criminal convictions\\".TLDR: He was more along the lines of a upper middle class kid who saw he was privileged as fuck, and started operating in noticeably positive and productive ways in forgotten cities, something progressives have wanted to see for a long time to rebuild the working-class base.","title":"Enabling Trump is a bad look for Fetterman | Pennsylvania's senior senator was elected as a progressive Democrat.

In a statement on X, Smith said she had the opportunity to meet Trump at the resort and then at his golf club on Sunday morning. We had a friendly and constructive conversation during which I emphasized the mutual importance of the U.S. C Canadian energy relationship, and specifically, how hundreds of thousands of American jobs are supported by energy exports from Alberta, Smith wrote in the statement. I was also able to have similar discussions with several key allies of the incoming administration and was encouraged to hear their support for a strong energy and security relationship with Canada.","title":"Friendly and constructive: Premier Danielle Smith meets with Donald Trump"},{"text":"I have a central liberal leaning wife.

People actually felt and still feel betrayed by Trump when he finally came out and said he likes H1B visas.  Just look at how the media covered both stories.  Look at the reaction from conservative social media and its entirely evident.Meanwhile Trump comes out and says uh actually I doubt well lower your prices and there its crickets.  No one sharpening their pitchforks.  No one feeling betrayed.  No one even cares.  And when the tariffs hit and the price of their eggs goes up as a result, there will once again be crickets.  They wont bother trying to hold him to that promise because they never actually cared about that promise.  It was always an excuse, at best, a way to pretend you arent just voting for bigotry and racism.And you can bet the media wont be wasting time talking about how high grocery prices are, either.  Theyll still be focused on how old Biden looks, Hunter Bidens cock, etc.Imagine if Elon started talking about how we need to protect trans rights or how diversity, equity, and inclusion are actually good things, forcing Trump to once again side with him.  I guarantee the pitchforks would come out for both of them at that point.Trumps voters turned out in hopes of mass deportation, in hopes of silencing and punishing trans people, out of disgust at the thought of being led by another black person, let alone a black woman.  They turned out for him in order to spit in the face of brown and black people, trans women, and the broader world - the same people on which they blame all of their problems.","title":"Donald Trump has gone silent on working class cost of living issues"},{"text":"My aunt is full care and we cannot find a suitable place to take her. \\nPeople dont take these jobs because the pay is basically slave wages. \\nThis is cruelty.","title":"Big Cuts To Medicaid Reportedly On The Menu For House Republicans\\n"},{"text":"If you don't have friends with different political views, you are doing life wrong.","title":"Do you guys got liberal freinds"},{"text":"With how slim the majority is there are at least 4 Republican members from Southern California and another 5 from the rest of the state who could keep this from happening.

Not many economists meet that criterion. Stephen Miran has made just that case. Miran, the president-elects choice to chair his Council of Economic Advisers, has written that the U.S. could be better off with average tariffs of around 20% and as high as 50%, compared with the current 2%. Mirans views are worth studying, and not just because hes going to advise Trump. He has described tariffs as a tool, and international intervention to weaken the dollar as another, that could address a longstanding global tension: the U.S.s economic and military support for other countries have contributed to an overvalued dollar, wide trade deficit and hollowed-out industrial base. Sweeping tariffs and a shift away from strong dollar policy can have some of the broadest ramifications of any policies in decades, fundamentally reshaping the global trade and financial systems, Miran wrote in a November report for Hudson Bay Capital, where he is senior strategist.","title":"Trumps New Economist Makes the Case for 20% Tariffs"},{"text":"but think about new jersey diner patrons!!!!!!11","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 12, 2025"},{"text":"They're much too obsessed with normalcy and the status quo.

These systems, fueled by Big Food and Big Ag, have prioritized profits over public health since the 1960s and 1970s, w/Big Food replacing whole, minimally processed foods with an excess of highly processed food products.Big Ags industrial farming practices prioritize yield over nutrient density, relying heavily on dangerous pesticidesmany linked to cancers and chronic diseasesand depleting soil nutrients to produce calorie-dense, nutrient-poor crops. Compounding the issue is excessive government subsidization of industrial agriculture at taxpayer expense, while regenerative and organic farming are left unsupported, making healthier options unaffordable for most Americans.The result? A staggering $3.8 trillion spent annually on healthcare in the U.S., with three-quarters of that tied to preventable chronic diseases driven by these very food systems. Its a crisis manufactured for profit at the expense of public health.\\"*Chronic metabolic diseases account for 75% of all healthcare expenditures in the U.S., and theyre driven not by bad genes or bad behavior but by bad food.

Its Trumpland and elite Republicans wish that this propaganda and highly nativist public-relations campaign boxes Dems in, in the sense that Democratic politicians who vowed to resist Trumps coming onslaught risk appearing weak if they dont stand up to this. But if the liberal mayors  in Chicago, for instance  and governors were to pick a fight over this, they could be seen as objecting to the kinds of more selective arrests with which they dont actually have a problem, hence feeding into Trumps lies and smears that Democrats dont support punishing, say, actual violent gang members who came from foreign countries.  \\nThese are objectives that pro-immigration groups and attorneys are preparing to vigorously combat with education campaigns and their own messaging  though they know itll be, putting it mildly, an uphill battle against the weight of the state, Trump, Musk, and conservative and other mainstream media.During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump, Vice President-elect J.D.

In my conversations with the dozens of people we see at the clinics every week, and Haitian community leaders, and people who come up to ask me questions, it seems like a lot of immigrants feel that the country doesnt want them here.

Any properly maintained vehicle going at the intended speed (usually 5-10 mph) won't suffer damage from standard speed bumps. If your car is getting damaged, you're either:\\n1. Going too fast\\n2. Your suspension is already shot\\n3. The bump is poorly maintained (which is a maintenance issue, not a speed bump issue) I've seen these in gated communities, so it's clear that the people with money and nicer cars want this as well.Gated communities use humps because they prioritize resident comfort over actual safety. Public streets need real deterrents, not gentle suggestions to slow down.

Even a convicted felon, rapist, and friendly agent of Americas enemies**made possible by five corrupt Republicans on the Supreme Court, and it worked. Democrats were massively outspent, not to mention the power of the billionaire Murdoch familys Fox News and 1500 hate talk radio stations.They are responsible for our crises of gun violence, the drug epidemic, homelessness, political gridlock, our slow response to the climate emergency, a looming crisis for Social Security and Medicare, the situation on our southern border, even the lack of affordable drugs, insurance, and healthcare.Clarence Thomas and his wife have been accepting millions Sam Alito is also on the gravy train, and there are questions about how Brett Kavanaugh managed to pay off his credit cards and gambling debts. John Roberts wife has made over $10 million from law firms with business before the court; Neil Gorsuch got a sweetheart real estate deal; Amy Coney Barrett refuses to recuse herself from cases involving her fathers oil company.None of this is illegal because when five corrupt Republicans on the Court legalized members of Congress taking bribes they legalized that same behavior for themselves.Our modern era of big money controlling government began in the decade after Richard Nixon put Lewis Powell  the tobacco lawyer who wrote the infamous 1971 Powell Memo outlining how billionaires and corporations could take over America  on the Supreme Court in 1972.In the 200 preceding years  all the way back to the American Revolution of 1776  no politician or credible political scientist had ever proposed that spending billions to buy votes with dishonest advertising was anything other than simple corruption.The originalists on the Supreme Court, however, claimed to be channeling the Founders of this nation, particularly those who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, when they said that money is the same thing as free speech. In that claim, Republicans on the Court were lying through their teeth.In a letter to Samuel Kercheval in 1816, President and author of the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson explicitly laid it out:Those seeking profits, were they given total freedom, would not be the ones to trust to keep government pure and our rights secure. Indeed, it has always been those seeking wealth who were the source of corruption in government.Thus, today America has a severe problem of big money controlling our political system.

I assume that you may have damaged your car on a speed bump. But ask yourself how that would have happened. You admit they are effective at slowing traffic but never acknowledge how they cause this effect. It works in two ways. One is the psychological effect of making a driver intentionally slow down to avoid damage to their car and a violent impact. But the second way they achieve this is by being a physical barrier that will forcibly slow vehicles regardless of the drivers intentions. In fact, it is this second way that reminds drivers to be aware and slow down intentionally so the next time they come across a speed bump they wont have to subject themselves and their car to the physical impact. But also, to address your concern about damage over time, consider that driving in and of itself will cause damage to your vehicle over time. Sudden impacts at high speed would cause worse damage than the wear and tear of driving over speed bumps at reasonable speeds. And the threat of damage is what stops bad behavior on the road. Red lights work this way, too. The light does not actually stop you at the intersection but it warns you of the danger that crossing through the intersection at the time, so most decide to wait. We also use other damaging means to warn and persuade drivers to follow the posted rules, such as rumble strips on highways, pylons at high foot traffic areas, and tire damage spikes at one way exits.","title":"CMV: We should get rid of amspeed bumps."},{"text":"Controlled burns certainly can be one way to manage future wildfire risks but one issue that cannot be overlooked is that controlled burns require certain conditions in order to be carried out safely.

If you voted for Trump because of economics, what in his agenda of tariffs and more tax cuts for corporations and the rich, do you think will bring down the cost of eggs?Or was it just about mass deportations? Where do you think the money is coming from to pay for that? Republicans rail against the ballooning federal deficit but money for Trumps mass deportation plans and more corporate tax cuts need to come from somewhere? The rich will not willingly give up their wealth so Republicans will cut entitlements and programs for low- and middle-income Americans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the ACA, and federal agencies like FEMA that are urgently needed especially by low- and middle-income Americans during disasters.

The problem is, he hasnt actually been able to do *anything* for those folks, which just feeds into the narrative that while Democrats support the working class in their speeches, they end up being no different then the Republicans when it comes to enacting meaningful change. As such, Fettermans just gotten more and more talkative about foreign policy and social issues, neither of which were ever selling points for him as a Progressive. All that said, Ill be interested to see if he ends up being more of a Sinema or a Manchin. Manchin voted with his party so long as he, his family, his business partners, or his district got a treat. Its gross that he help up national bills til he got paid, but *so long as he got paid*, he voted accordingly. And, perhaps most importantly, he never actually voted against the party in exchange for Relublican treats. He wasnt for sale, he just wasnt going to do anything without being directly rewarded.

As of this morning, the Kenneth Fire has been 100% contained, Hurst Fire 89% contained, and Creek Fire 90% contained. As for the big ones, no change in containments but an increase in acres; Palisades at 23707 acres and Eaton 14117 acres.Great news though for Eaton, as the flareups that happened were no issue over the night and were dealt with accordingly. Also, among the downgrades evac orders included the JPL, which is a huge relief to see.Over night, Palisades were looking great with water drops and the work done during the daylight. Flareups were dealt with quickly earlier and might have stopped some eastward movement. However, it seems that the north part of the fire is kissing Dirt Mulholland, a fire road at the top of the mountains that separates Encino and Pacific Palisades. The old Project Nike site is probably gone, but thats totally fine if the fire stops there.As for me yesterday, I tried to just disconnect and relax for the day. I had a meal with a friend who just got back from Japan. I also reached out for a few possible other roommate situations (fingers crossed). The skies looked much better, even with the smoke. The best part for me? I cant see the Palisades flames from my place anymore, and theres barely a glow. Some places were still closed (good for them and their workers) and the amount it of community support has been amazing to see.

Thanks to Metas conveniently timed announcement that theyre ditching fact-checking, these lies are spreading unchecked across Facebook and Instagram. And naturally, Elon Musks X is a hotbed of falsehoods.Lets start with Trump, who couldnt even wait for the flames to die down before launching into his greatest hits about California water management. Hes claiming Governor Gavin Newsom refused to sign the water restoration declaration that would have prevented this disaster. One small problem: This declaration doesnt exist. Its completely made up. State officials from both parties confirmed to local NBC affiliate WXII that there was never any such document.But reality hasnt stopped Trumps allies from running with this narrative. Musk, James Woods, and the usual suspects are busy building an alternate universe where Californias water reservoirs are empty (theyre actually brimming, according to state officials), and the only reason anyones house burned down is because of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at the fire department.Yes, you read that right. The same people who spent years telling us climate change isnt real are now trying to blame the fires on the fact that the L.A. Fire Departments chief is a woman. Never mind that Kristin Crowley worked her way up through the ranks for 22 years. Never mind that the departments leadership is still predominantly male. The right has found a way to combine their favorite bogeymen: diversity initiatives, California governance, and climate science.Heres whats actually happening: Hurricane-force Santa Ana winds combined with unusually dry conditions (hello, climate change) to spread small fires at unprecedented speed. Yes, some fire hydrants failednot because of some conspiracy about water managementbut because the system was overwhelmed by simultaneous massive demands for water. The departments firefighting aircraft couldnt fly for several hours because of those same dangerous winds, not because theyd been sent to Ukraine (another false claim making the rounds).This is the playbook were going to see for every climate disaster going forward. Rather than acknowledge the role of climate change, rather than have honest discussions about infrastructure and emergency preparedness, the right will search for ways to blame their cultural grievances. Everything becomes evidence of their preferred narrative: Hydrant failures become proof of Democratic mismanagement, female leadership becomes proof of woke politics gone wrong, and the actual causes get buried under an avalanche of manufactured outrage.The timing with Metas announcement about ending fact-checking is fitting. Just as these fires demonstrate why we desperately need reliable information during disasters, Silicon Valley is busy dismantling the systems designed to provide it. Mark Zuckerberg calls this getting back to our roots around free expression. In reality, its about appeasing the incoming Trump administration, even if that means letting lies spread as fast as wildfire.Meanwhile, actual Angelenos are losing their homes, their communities, and in some cases, their lives. The rights exploitation of this tragedy isnt just cynicalits dangerous. When people cant get accurate information during disasters, when every crisis becomes fodder for culture war narratives, we all lose. Except, of course, for the people spreading the lies. Theyre doing just fine.The question isnt whether these conspiracy theories will continuethey will. The question is whether well let them distract us from the real issues: climate change, infrastructure funding, and emergency preparedness. While the right obsesses over imaginary water declarations and DEI initiatives, actual solutions get pushed aside. Thats not an accident: Its the point.\\nParker MolloyParker Molloy writes The Present Age on Substack.","title":"The Rights Wildfire Lies Spread Faster Than the Flames"},{"text":"Stop dragging your feet, just do it","title":"Biden is still considering pardons for people who have been criticized or threatened by Trump"},{"text":"I could see how some aggressively uninformed people made that mistake in 2016, but its willful ignorance at this point.","title":"Big Cuts To Medicaid Reportedly On The Menu For House Republicans\\n"},{"text":"\\"And, this room holds the Donald Trump Archives.\\"\\"Isn't this a toilet with a photocopier in it?\\"","title":"Newsom Urges Trump To Accept Invite To Tour Damage From Wildfires: 'Respect' Our 'Pleas'"},{"text":"Yup.

Heres an analysis of how Canadas exports to the U.S. could be absorbed by other countries:1. Uranium\\n\\t?\\tDemand: Countries like France, China, Japan, South Korea, and India already import uranium for their nuclear power plants. With global emphasis on clean energy, demand for uranium is growing.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canadian uranium is among the highest-grade in the world, with consistent and reliable supply chains.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: These countries could absorb more if Canada redirected uranium from the U.S., though the logistics of reallocating contracts would need to be addressed.2. Potash\\n\\t?\\tDemand: Countries like China, India, and Brazil have high demand for potash due to their large agricultural sectors. These countries already rely on Canada for significant portions of their fertilizer needs.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canada is the worlds largest and most reliable supplier, offering high-quality potash at competitive prices.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: Other countries would likely increase their imports if more became available, as global potash demand is strong and expected to grow.3. Rare Earth Minerals\\n\\t?\\tDemand: The European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Australia are actively seeking to diversify their rare earth supply chains away from China.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canadas rare earth minerals are highly desirable due to their ethical sourcing and the global push for reducing dependence on China.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: While Canadas rare earth production is still growing, any increase in supply would be quickly absorbed by global markets, especially for use in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and electronics.4. Softwood Lumber\\n\\t?\\tDemand: China, Japan, and Europe are all major markets for softwood lumber, particularly for construction and furniture.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canadian lumber is prized for its quality and availability. It is often preferred over other sources due to consistent supply and competitive pricing.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: While transportation costs to these markets may be higher, demand for Canadian lumber remains strong, and countries would absorb additional supply.5. Energy Products (Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Electricity)\\n\\t?\\tDemand: Europe and Asia, particularly China, India, Japan, and South Korea, have growing energy needs.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canada is known for producing high-quality crude oil and natural gas, and global energy markets are always looking for reliable suppliers.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: Exporting crude oil and natural gas to other countries would require infrastructure adjustments (e.g., increased pipeline and port capacity for overseas shipping), but the demand is there.6. Aluminum\\n\\t?\\tDemand: Europe, Japan, South Korea, and India are significant aluminum importers for industries like automotive, construction, and packaging.\\n\\t?\\tWhy Theyd Take It: Canadas aluminum, produced using hydroelectric power, is more sustainable and ethical than aluminum from many other countries.\\n\\t?\\tFeasibility: These markets would eagerly absorb additional Canadian aluminum, especially with the global push for greener materials.Challenges\\n\\t?\\tLogistics: Redirecting exports from the U.S. to other countries would involve increased shipping costs and logistical adjustments.\\n\\t?\\tExisting Trade Agreements: Long-term contracts and trade agreements with the U.S. might limit how much Canada could redirect without legal or financial consequences.\\n\\t?\\tMarket Competition: Some products (e.g., softwood lumber, energy) face competition from other exporters like Russia, Brazil, or Australia, though Canadas reputation for quality would give it an advantage.ConclusionYes, many countries would willingly take what Canada currently supplies to the U.S., particularly for uranium, potash, rare earth minerals, softwood lumber, and aluminum. Global demand for these resources is high, and Canadas reputation as a reliable and ethical supplier positions it well to redirect exports if needed. However, practical challenges like logistics, contracts, and infrastructure would need to be addressed to fully capitalize on this opportunity.","title":"How Trump could declare a national emergency to hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs"},{"text":"The world leaders need to stand up against Bully boy Trump","title":"How Trump could declare a national emergency to hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs"},{"text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav","title":"White Christian nationalists are poised to remake America in their image during Trumps second term, author says"},{"text":"They thought they were voting for Ron Swanson.

And I know the USA gives subsidies to many industries, including the oil and gas industry. So I'm ok with some subsidies to support EVs. But, how much are we giving? Who's benefiting from it now? As the industry expands we'll see less need for government assistance to maintain it and establish it. A lot of regular gas stations and businesses have already added EV charging infrastructure, and that's only going to increase as we go. But, it's not an infrastructure issue that's really the problem it's an efficiency issue. My friend bought a brand new EV two weeks ago. On a quick charge it's 45 minutes to get fully charged and they can't make it from their house to the beach on a single charge. So their trip is extended at least 45 minutes just to charge. The drive from their house to the beach is about 3 1/2 hours. For context, I can make the same drive without refueling. The energy capacity and charge times are a bigger issue than availability of charging at this point. And that's not something the government really subsidizes that's something manufacturers will do. We don't subsidize Chevy or Ford building bigger engines.","title":"CBS Worries Trump Will 'Stall Progress' On Electric Vehicles"},{"text":"He should tie his bootstraps or whatever.0","title":"Newsom Urges Trump To Accept Invite To Tour Damage From Wildfires: 'Respect' Our 'Pleas'"},{"text":"Why should I have any sympathy?

Would they shut down Starbucks because they believe we shouldnt be drinking coffee (never mind alcohol)? christians may have some unifying belief in the divinity of jesus and his execution, but theyre not a monolith in their tangential beliefs, like any other religion. just look at the divisions in the muslim world, the conflict between sunni and shia, isis and the taliban and al queda. christians are no more unified in their beliefs than anyone else, and depending on which sect gets to make the rules, it might be more than just us unapologetic heathens that find boots on our necks.innocent until proven guilty is fundamentally at odds with the notion of original sin. you cannot have religious freedom where religious freedom means suppressing the same. perhaps theyre not actually all that interested in religious freedom ??","title":"White Christian nationalists are poised to remake America in their image during Trumps second term, author says"},{"text":"How much has Fox News or the GOP talked about the \\"senility\\" of Donald Trump?","title":"The Rights Wildfire Lies Spread Faster Than the Flames"},{"text":"If you aint better than a nr, who ARE you better than? -Gene Hackman in Mississippi Burning.?","title":"Donald Trump has gone silent on working class cost of living issues"},{"text":"Russia is in asia, it's an accurate statement.","title":"CMV:  We need to impeach Trump, like, right now."},{"text":"The appeals court denied the block but left the stay in place.

The list of barrier policies goes on and on, and forms the essential core of conservative politics.  Im willing to sacrifice my upward mobility if it protects me from the upward mobility of those below me.And so a class-locked person even begins to take a strange sort of pride in their station.  We cant all move up, someone has to be the foundation of the pyramid, someone has stay down here to hold the bottom of the ladder steady for the others.

He declined to rule out military or economic coercion against either Greenland or the canal, and he said he was open to using economic force on Americas neighbor to the north. Leaders in the targeted regions and elsewhere have pushed back against the suggestions, even as experts are still largely undecided about how much stock to put in Trumps threats. That kind of guessing game, experts say, isnt good for global security as Trump heads into his second term.Uncertainty is bad in international affairs. You want to know that your allies are with you, and your enemies need to know that youre resolute against them.  You want to know, more or less, what the world is going to look like in the morning, said Peter Loge, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior FDA adviser during the Obama administration. Some have guessed that Trump is just trolling as he gets ready to retake the White House later this month. Others have said they think the president-elects comments at his Florida presser last week suggest a potential shift away from jokes and toward a more serious aim of American territorial expansion, though he hasnt yet shared any specifics on his proposals.In diplomacy, language matters and signaling matters. And when youre dealing with someone as erratic as Trump is, thats a problem, if you cant distinguish between the insult comic dog and an actual U.S. foreign policy, said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, with a focus on Canadian foreign policy.Whether or not Trumps serious, its obligating global leaders to respond as if he is.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  whom Trump has labeled governor  hit back that there isnt a snowballs chance in hell that Canada would become part of the U.S. On Thursday, he quipped to CNN that one of Canadians defining traits is that theyre not American and dismissed the threats as a distraction from Trumps proposed 25 percent tariffs. Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc also said Thursday the 51st state remarks were a way for Trump to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos, knowing this will never happen. From a Canadian perspective, the tariff threat is real. Its not trolling. The governor of Canada, the 51st state, the annexation  that is trolling, Bratt said. But when you have this hyperbolic language at the same time with other countries, its a bit more complicated. And after Trump expressed openness to possible military force on Greenland or the Panama Canal, leaders may have more to wring their hands about, Bratt said. Whether it is trolling [or not], theyve got to treat that seriously.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has stressed that Greenland, where Donald Trump Jr. stopped for a visit last week, is not for sale and will not be in the future either. Greenland Prime Minister Mte B. Egede declared Friday that the Arctic territory is for Greenlandic people. The foreign minister of Panama, Javier Martnez-Acha, said earlier this week that the only hands operating the canal are Panamanian and that is how its going to stay, as reported by the BBC.And its not just the Trump-mentioned countries that have stepped up to respond, though some are skeptical about the incoming presidents potential follow-through. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday guessed that Trumps statements were more of a message to other global players than a real plan to acquire territory.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday that, in a discussion with several European leaders and the head of the European Council, there was a certain incomprehension about comments out of the U.S. Though he didnt mention Trump by name, Scholz emphasized that force should not be used to move borders.This is the fundamental problem with being the president of the United States of America; its that people have to take your word. They may not believe that you have the guts to go through with something. They may not think youre credible, for example, ultimately. But they have to take these things seriously, said Daniel Nexon, a professor with Georgetown Universitys government department and its School of Foreign Service. Regardless of what happens next, Trumps comments have upped focus on the strategic importance of Greenland, a self-governing Arctic island territory thats under Denmarks control, amid tensions with Russia and China.You are asking me if I think the U.S. will invade Greenland? The answer is no. Have we entered an era that sees the return of the survival of the fittest? The answer is yes, French Foreign Minister Jean-No?l Barrot said this week, per Reuters translations.Melting ice is opening up new routes through the Arctic, and Trump said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes, questioning Denmarks right to it. Russia, which is approaching the three-year mark of its invasion of Ukraine, is watching the rather dramatic development of the situation very closely, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said of Trumps comments on Friday, as reported by Reuters. Moscow has also expressed a strategic interest in the area. With regard to the Panama Canal, Trump has claimed the major shipping passage is being controlled by China, though the canals authority disputed the assertion. Trump has criticized former President Carter for a 1977 deal to transfer control of the canal, which was constructed by the U.S.And after Trump declared he hopes to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum joked that North America should be relabeled Mexican America. Trump appears to believe that if he is unpredictable and might do a crazy thing it gives him strategic advantages, stoking fear that could lead to concessions and cultivating the element of surprise, Nexon said, but too much unpredictability is probably pretty dangerous.Weve constructed a very powerful system of influence and control globally that is centered around these partnerships and alliances that depend on the idea that theres some predictability in US behavior. That making an alliance with the United States is not making you vulnerable to exploitation, or that you can expect that the United States will come to your offense or wont seize your territory on a whim, Nexon said.","title":"Trumps Talk Of Expansion Puts World Leaders On Alert: You cant distinguish between the insult comic dog and an actual U.S. foreign policy"},{"text":"If only he could go silent on everything","title":"Donald Trump has gone silent on working class cost of living issues"},{"text":"That will be entertaining to Utah residents like me.

When I was in college I assumed progressive policies work at face value. Good intentions made good policy. Ie strengthening unions, higher taxes on rich people more social welfare is always going to benefit the working class. Duh thats what they are meant to do. As I started gaining experience and seeing how things actually work in practice it turns out the policies and political views are often self serving. Taxing the rich to give to the poor on the long run makes everyone poorer. Whether that be through corruption or just decreased economic activity broadly. You could disagree with this but its an easily arguable position with tons of solid data. Its a more believable argument that instead of thinking Obama is a class traitor and a simplistic take that he just cares about his investments. Its way more likely as he gets older and sees how things actually works he becomes more free market oriented. When he doesnt need votes he can more freely try to advocate nuance policy that would actually help the poor like a more vibrant capitalist economy. The more cynical take and one I believe in is people like Warren and AOC are lying to you. They know most of the policies they support are BS they just want votes and power.","title":"CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about"},{"text":"This asshole wont have a library.
