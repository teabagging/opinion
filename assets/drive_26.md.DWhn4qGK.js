He is also demonstrating semantic aphasias: steak mountain or steak hill, instead of Snake mountain. Trump is continuing to slur words. What is even more troubling is how Trump sometimes cant form words at all but just makes sounds. For example, Saudi Arabia and Russia will. bluh-ub-bll.That's more what's meant by phonemic paraphasia. It's more like what a toddler would say pronouncing a more complex/unfamiliar word. I'm by no means an expert, but I think it would be more concerning if she pronounced it 'Ne-fix'.The reason I ask is that mispronouncing words is just a thing that everyone does, and in some cases it's just an [accent/dialect feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj7a-p4psRA). Also, it's a thing some parents do deliberately to entertain themselves by exasperating their older children or as a kind of family in-joke (my partner and I are both fully capable of pronouncing the word \\"thunderstorm\\", but when one's happening it's a \\"tundatorm\\" if we're talking to each other).

It all really depends on how old you are, where this person appears in your life (e.g., school, work, random cashier at the grocery store, online dating site, social media, etc.), your gender/their gender, and how well you know this person and how well they know you. Im assuming youre young and still in school, but, in general, if they dont know you very well, dont touch them, dont follow them, dont bring them gifts/flowers, dont just randomly tell them theyre pretty/beautiful, and dont try to get their personal information (phone number, address, social media, etc.) by asking them or by stalking their social media. Your first step should be becoming closer to the person by becoming friends with them. You wont have to be best friends, but this person should be comfortable and willing to talk to you without you always being the one initiating the conversation. If they never seem to initiate the conversation, or they try to avoid you, then theyre probably not comfortable with you, so you shouldnt be doing romantic things.Just start by getting to know them. Try to treat them like anyone else, as if you arent really attracted to them. You dont go around buying flowers for people you arent attracted to, and you dont go around touching them or telling them how pretty they are. Try to be natural. Joke around, chit chat about random, everyday topics. For example, omg did you see what happened in the news?, have you seen this tv show/movie?, and things like that. If this person is willing to engage with you and continue the conversation through their own free will, then theyre probably somewhat comfortable with you. You can usually tell when someone is just being polite and when theyre actually engaged in the conversation. This is very important, and you need to be able to pick up on non-verbal cues if this person is uncomfortable with you or wants nothing to do with you. But, if theyre comfortable or somewhat receptive, just keep it up until you start to find things you have in common, and then you two should start to develop a closer, platonic relationship. After youre 100% certain that this person is comfortable with you and not just chatting with you to be polite, you can start playfully commenting on their appearance. Things you like, but dont just be completely obvious that youre attracted to them. Try to keep it casual. For example, if youre just naturally talking about eye color or talking about a person who has blue eyes, for example, and this person has blue eyes, casually mention how you think blue eyes are so pretty. Dont stay on the topic, just mention it and let the conversation move on. If they continue talking about it, you can continue and talk about how pretty you think blue eyes are, if they say something like, I have blue eyes, then this person probably likes you and is okay with flirting, that type of comment is basically asking you to talk about their eyes. But, you should keep it subtle, part of the fun in flirting is not knowing if *either* person is sexually attracted to the other. But, the best response to that type of response would probably be a simple, you do with a little smirk. Continue on casually flirting about non-sexual body parts, like hair, eye color, freckles, height, etc. as the topics naturally come up. If they start to compliment you subtly, or if they seem to always be fishing for compliments with the I have blue eyes type comments, then they probably like the flirting and it indicates that theyre probably interested in you.If they seem receptive to the subtle flirting, then you can start moving into more obvious flirting. Things like playfully touching non-sexual areas (hair, arms). But, even with more obvious flirting, youre still not home free. As you continue on flirting, and theyre obviously receptive to it, a fun, sexual tension should naturally start to develop between you two.At this point, you can probably ask them on a date, but stay casual. A simple, hey, would you want to go see this movie with me? should suffice. If they agree, its still not acceptable to confess your love to them. They *still* dont really know you. You should be going on several dates before saying I love you. And even if they say I love you back, it still isnt time to confess how youve been secretly attracted to them for years or whatever, keep those types of comments in. Nobody wants to hear about how someone was secretly obsessing about them without even knowing them. Thats kinda creepy.But, just remember, this persons is just that, a real life, living person, and they should be treated as such. Theyre not the person of your dreams, theyre not destined to be with you, and theyre not just a sex object. Treat them like a normal person, get to know them, flirt with them subtly, flirt with them more obviously, and then ask them out if they seem interested.A lot of people confuse the feelings of love and infatuation. Infatuation is that feeling of deep attraction and obsessiveness about someone that you dont *truly* know, a deep desire to get to know them and explore their body sexually. Even if you are close friends with someone, if you havent seen them in intimate and vulnerable moments and dont know who they are in the privacy and comfortability of their own home when no ones around, then you dont really *know* them. Love is when you truly know someone, youve seen them in all of these vulnerable, private moments and have experienced some of their worst qualities, yet you know you would go through great hardships with them because you cant imagine them not being in your life. They are similar, they *feel* similar, but theyre different, and its usually people who confuse infatuation with love when they barely know someone that comes across as creepy. Infatuation is more of a horny feeling, love has nothing to do with sex. Love is more of a deep bond and connection with someone. Acting like you love someone when youre just infatuated with them is creepy, and its a quick way to get the person to stop talking to you. Dont fall into those pit traps.","title":"cmv: dating a girl feels like submitting a resume to your boss and hoping that you have enough qualifications and credentials for her to want you"},{"text":"I'm not worried about the DNC trying to stop election interference.

Abu Mazen Charges that the Arab States Are the Cause of the Palestinian Refugee Problem (Wall Street Journal; June 5, 2003):\\n?\\tMahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) penned an article in March 1976 in Falastin al-Thawra (cf. supra), the official journal of the PLO in Beirut: \\"The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny, but instead they abandoned them, forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland, imposed upon them a political and ideological blockade and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe\\" (emphasis added).\\n?\\tAs Abu Mazen alluded, it was in large part due to threats and fear-mongering from Arab leaders that some 700,000 Arabs fled Israel in 1948 when the new state was invaded by Arab armies. Ever since, the growing refugee population, now around 4 million by UN estimates, has been corralled into squalid camps scattered across the Middle East - in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank.\\n?\\tIn 1950, the UN set up the United Nations Relief and Works Agency as a \\"temporary\\" relief effort for Palestinian refugees. Former UNRWA director Ralph Galloway stated eight years later that, \\"the Arab states do not want to solve the refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders do not give a damn whether Arab refugees live or die.\\" The only thing that has changed since then is the number of Palestinians cooped up in these prison camps.","title":"CMV: Countries that demand that Israel withdraws from the West Bank should send soliders to guarantee Israel's security"},{"text":"Hey!

Around half its residents are black. But in the special election on September 18th to fill the districts vacant House seat the Democratic candidate, LaMonica McIver, won in a landslide. She defeated her opponent by 81% to 16%a larger margin than President Joe Biden managed there in 2020.\\nIt is no shock that a Democrat won the deep-blue district. But the result is the latest in a string of strong scores for Democrats in special elections. This yardstick could endorse recent polls showing Vice-President Kamala Harriss party taking the leador merely confirm the popularity of Democrats among the few motivated, hard-core voters who reliably show up for off-cycle elections.\\nIn past presidential campaigns special elections have not carried much of a message about the contest at the top of the ticket (at least, none that could not anyway be gleaned from opinion polling). But in congressional elections, which have relatively few polls, the results can be revealing. In 17 elections to the House of Representatives since 1990, the party performing best in interim elections went on to win the popular vote 13 times (see chart). Moreover, special elections provide a valuable complement to polls, since they are unaffected by survey methods. Combining them with polls yields much more accurate predictions than either indicator does on its own.\\nThis prognostic power is one reason why, for the 2022 elections to the House, The Economist predicted fewer Republican seats than some other forecasts did. Democrats faced an uphill battle to defend control of Congress. Though Mr Bidens poor approval rating pointed to a red wave and polling suggested a narrow Republican victory, Democrats strong performances in special elections nudged our forecast towards a closer result. The Republicans won 222 seats, just four more than the minimum for a majority and far below expectations.\\nThis year Democrats are doing even better in special elections. To estimate their performance, we compare both parties with a benchmark for each ballot, based on the most recent regularly scheduled election result for the same seat. In New Jerseys tenth district Ms McIver outperformed her benchmark vote share by three percentage points. A moving average of these scores, with greater weight for federal than local elections, gives the Democrats a 3.3-point edge. Such an advantage will give the party a boost in our forthcoming forecast of the congressional elections.\\nThere are reasons to be sceptical, however. In recent years the Democrats have found greater support among college-educated voters, who are more likely to turn out in off-cycle elections. In the general election the party will have no such advantage. This might explain why Democrats did worse in the general elections of 2020 and 2022 than you would expect from special elections alone. The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has shown he can mobilise less engaged, non-college voters. These voters might not choose to turn out for an interim contest, but they are likely to support his congressional colleagues if he can coax them to the ballot box.\\nAlthough this dynamic complicates the picture, special-election results should still cheer Democrats. With less than six weeks left in the race, you would rather be the party winning landslides.","title":"Recent special elections bode well for Democrats.

The 6 republican appointees are wearing party colors on their robes pretty openly now, and most of them were involved in the 2000 decision that handed Florida to W. Some were Justices ruling in the GOP's favor and some were on Bush's legal team. No argument against the fact that Harris has shown she is competent and prepared - she certainly has.

The former, advocated for mathematical empirical truths, that theories based on subjective discovery, which imply limited government and free markets were incorrect. Instead, they suggested that society could be modified if only the correct system, or model was put into place. These ideas persisted, eventually leading directly to the rise of Fascism in Europe, the modern scientific approach wasnt really so different so much as it was simply a justification for the same old despotism weve known for centuries And while the German Historical School is long since dead, that form of economics prevails in the mainstream, the left actively embraces the tools that lead to fascism, despite what they try to pin on us. The Austrian School, the subjectivist approach derived directly from the economic discoveries from the Classical Liberals is still alive today in the Libertarian movement and to a degree, in the Conservative movement as well (not to hide the fact libertarians and conservatives have always been ideologically opposed on some issues). This form of economics is not only unified, it implies free markets, limited government, private property and individual liberty. This is where End the Fed, taxation is theft, etc. originate from.  The empirical approach championed largely by the left, does not conform with the Subjective Theory of Value, despite what they claim (this is self testable/ self-evident) and therefore is directly at odds with a free society. All of that to say, the Left can complain about Nazis and the System all they want.

However, the other thing it does is introduce uncertainty due to human error. Once they say that the results in GA might not be accurate itll pave the way for other states to follow suit.

The death cert says nothing about Finegan on it. Also, they lived in St Ann and the person on the death cert, Beryl Christie, lived in St Andrews, and says she's a spinster which usually means never married. If you compare that Beryl picture with an older picture of Iris, it looks like it could be the same person but older but the timeline doesn't work. The picture with a child on her lap (Kamala - Iris lived until 1981). Kamala looks like a toddler so if she's 2 or 3 Iris would be 78, so the person in the Beryl picture can't be Iris if that picture was taken around 1980ish which people are saying.The confusion is that the birth cert for Beril Madeline Finegan (parents Iris and Patrick) says she was born in 1917. The death cert people are linking is to Beryl Christie Finegan (middle name changed completely) who was born in 1921. I believe the birth cert for Beryl is correct which lists her middle name as Madeline. There were people with the last name Christie in St Ann parish. However, I'm working on proving that (I love doing genealogy research).Also, the death cert they use for Oscar, Donald's father, says it was witnessed by his son Christopher Harris. Who is Christopher Harris? I don't find him anywhere in their tree. It says he's married but the Beryl one says spinster which usually means never married and the person who reports it was Muriel Murray, I have no idea who that is, but we all know Beryl had lots of family there at the time, so just strange.

It looks like a lot of people agree with that sentiment on Reddit, but when you actually talk to people out in the real world, its a totally different story. Liberals and liberal media survive on hyperbole and irrational over emotional outrage. They can spread misinformation easily online where people are too lazy to fact check. There will be a lot of bots, dont forget that Tik-Tok is the most Anti-Trump social media platform out there, and its also been proven by the US Department of Homeland Security that Tik-Tok is a [military experiment](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/1/chinese-communist-military-writings-reveal-plans-f/) by the Chinese government to cause election interference and also a spyware that collects data on people. Reddit is not far off. This website has millions of users from all around the world, and the main subreddits are congested with the worst kind of dregs of society. Overall its a small number in reality though, and most people dont even really agree with whats trending or controversial, they just want to jump on the bandwagon for upvotes and brownie points. The majority of people in the world dont know what Reddit is, never been on this website, and will not be influenced by its far left leaning media. Then you have the majority of Moderators on this website. The ones on the main subs are the most mentally disturbed and fragmented chronically online basement dwellers on welfare that you can imagine. Some of them might have income, I can bet those are the ones who rarely if ever even login, the majority of Moderators here are volunteers doing it for free, and a certain type of person is drawn to that authority position over a large number of people. Usually some control freak dweeb that has no control or authority over anyone in actual reality/real life. So they abuse people in the subreddits simply because they can and wont be held accountable for it. Reddit used to be an interesting place 10-15 years ago. Its just a cesspit on the web now. I try to stay off the main subs for that reason.

The -only- successful corporations basically follow this model until people burn out. This is why so many people job-hop now, because you are never paid based on how well you do, but instead on how little they can get away with.Being an office worker is stressful and demanding just like being a lawyer. The only difference is the language and the scenery. Whilst a lawyer may need to eloquently negotiate their point of view around a judge's preconceptions, or use their skills to persuade a jury, you'll also be going through similar negotiations with your boss in an office or trying to navigate your office politics. The truth is -everyone- hates these parts of jobs. They're tedious and demanding and they sap your social and physical energy.My best advice for the future is play to your strengths and develop skills. You don't need to be the best lawyer in the world, just like you don't need to be the best paralegal or office worker. You just need to be good enough, and be able to stand up for yourself enough that you don't get completely trodden. Don't worry about not having a work-life balance because that is something you will find through trial and error. If you can't handle something after a year or so you'll be able to change. You're not locked into anything as an adult, even if it feels like you are. Career switching these days is far easier than it has been in the past.Also, if what I've been told about lawyers is true, you'll definitely have -plenty- of office work to do, reviewing documents and statements and constructing cases. You may as well do it being paid well.A friend of mine once told me the \\"three-day rule\\" which basically comes down to this: If you hate doing something, do it for three days - whether that be exercise, writing, drawing, reading, socialising or even just brushing your teeth - whatever it is in your life you hate. The main reason you hate it is because it doesn't fit your existing skillset, and you don't want to commit yourself to it so you're just waiting for it to be over - but three days is a long time. It's a long enough time that you start forming a routine, and for your brain to get used to the idea and start optimising and adapting to it.This is especially true when it comes to physical work. Barring a complete disability if you do physical work for three days you'll find your body starting to adapt to the patterns of motion. You'll probably hurt like hell because likelihood is you've overdone it the first two days, so you'll have to work slower, but you're building parts of your body and muscle memory to perform tasks. Because of this it gets easier over time. In general though, stop thinking about \\"for the rest of my life\\" and start thinking about the next three days. \\"The rest of my life\\" is an impossibly vast and difficult thing to comprehend, but working at an internship for \\"the next three days\\" is easy.","title":"CMV: I should become an office worker instead of pursuing law"},{"text":"I've been broken into while I was home.\\nI didn't shoot the guy.

May they comfort you in dark times. Me? I'm looking at the bigger picture. Because that child, that woman, that gay couple, those people in Ukraine, in Sudan - their lives matter too.

The Republicans fan the flames by saying Dems just want to take everybodys guns. The Dems fan the flames by saying Republicans want them to put them in happy meals. Neither is correct. Most of us on either side of the aisle just want some common sense gun regulation that wont step on anyones constitutional right to bear arms, but that also keeps them out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. We could, right now, using existing infrastructure and with very minimal added expense, create a way for citizens to call and report anyone they have concerns about getting access to weapons. If deemed credible by law enforcement, that individual could be flagged in a national database that would be seen by every law enforcement agency in the country and would show up on a background check, and it would take literally less than ten minutes to do. And we could practically implement that tomorrow, because every 911 center in the country already has the ability to do this. That person could then be interviewed by law enforcement and/or subjected to further evaluation before having that flag on them removed. I realize that could be seen as an overstep by some but that doesnt seem unreasonable to me if you give people a good reason to fear youre going to commit mass murder. I think also the owner of the gun should be accountable for whats done with it, and that you should have to have gun insurance to cover liability for anything done with it by you or someone who gets a hold of it. You should also need a license to purchase any firearm, including long guns, and getting said license should require passing an accredited gun safety course. It should also have to be renewed every 5-7 years by taking a refresher course. Every gun sold in the US should come with a trigger lock. It should be illegal to leave a firearm unattended and unsecured in a vehicle, or inside a home or business with juveniles present, and should be a more severe charge if its also loaded. All that said, even being about as far left as it gets, even I dont want to ban guns. Matter of fact Id do away with almost all the bans. I think if you want to own an M1 Abrams and stuff it full of live grenades, thats nobodys business but your own so long as you dont hurt anyone or do anything stupid with it.

Domestic terroristsa phrase typically used to denote terrorists who are not directed or inspired by FTOshave caused more deaths in the United States in recent years than have terrorists connected to FTOs. Domestic terrorist attacks and hate crimes sometimes overlap, as perpetrators of prominent domestic terrorist attacks have selected their targets based on factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity.White supremacist violent extremism, one type of racially- and ethnically-motivated violent extremism, is one of the most potent forces driving domestic terrorism. Lone attackers, as opposed to cells or organizations, generally perpetrate these kinds of attacks. But they are also part of a broader movement. White supremacist violent extremists outlook can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views.White supremacist violent extremists have adopted an increasingly transnational outlook in recent years, largely driven by the technological forces described earlier in this Strategic Framework. Similar to how ISIS inspired and connected with potential radical Islamist terrorists, white supremacist violent extremists connect with like-minded individuals online. In addition to mainstream social media platforms, white supremacist violent extremists use lesser-known sites like Gab, 8chan, and EndChan, as well as encrypted channels. Celebration of violence and conspiracy theories about the ethnic replacement of whites as the majority ethnicity in various Western countries are prominent in their online circles.\\"[DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR COUNTERING TERRORISM AND TARGETED VIOLENCE](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf)","title":"Republican deletes post after Dem confronts him for dubbing Haitians pet-eating 'thugs'"},{"text":"lmao gottem","title":"Trump-Zelenskyy feud escalates as Republicans demand envoys removal"},{"text":"Trump in his own way said the same thing to her at the debate.","title":"Kamala Harris Stumped When Asked How Shell Pay For Her Agenda If GOP Controls Senate"},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/PatNMahiney ([8?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/PatNMahiney)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: the good ole republicans are no better than Trump in practice"},{"text":"But a \\"decent\\" phone is not equivalent to a flagship phone.

When you buy any product or service, its usually produced by some combination of these factors (smartphones, for example, involve human factory workers (labour), minerals (land), and factories/machines (capital)).Marxists tend to conflate capital and land. However, the distinction is important because while land is generally a fixed resource (not entirely since you can discover new oil reserves for instance, but in the short to medium term the total amount of natural resources available is fairly constant), capital is something that can be actively built and produced (some dudes can build a factory). Letting a land owner profit off of owning land is rent seeking since theyre not doing anything of value, and profits from land dont serve as a market signal that can lead to people building more land. However, its a good thing for people to profit off of capital because that rewards people who invest in the construction of capital, and profits from a factory can incentivize someone else to build another factory, which increases humanitys productive capacity.","title":"People who dont want Labor to control Reserve Bank of Australia have neoliberal brain worms: Greens senator"},{"text":"It is kind of fun watching Jasmine Crockett grill people","title":"Democrats take legal action against Georgia election board"},{"text":"\\nthis has been another someguy rant, thanks for listening to my insanity.

The situation there is very different from what most people seem to believe, especially on Reddit. So please ask me if you have any questions about life there, the occupation, the checkpoints, Palestinian violence, Settler violence, the IDF, etc.The bottom line is that this won't work.International troops have never helped in this conflict. It's so media driven that no foreign country wants to get their hands dirty.Even when they do, in the form of UN Peacekeeper troops both on the border of Lebanon and also on the border of Egypt in the past: these have proven to be utterly useless.The UNIFL are in place in Lebanon right now to prevent Hezbollah to be south of the Litani river in line with UN Resolution 1701. The truth is that Hezbollah has never, even for a day, withdrawn behind that river, and the UN has been utterly incapable of stopping Hezbollah from building an immense rocket firing infrastructure, weapon depots, infiltration tunnels, and so on. Hezbollah roam around very freely in the south of Lebanon, and UNFIL pretends to look the other way.So I don't see any realistic way that foreign troops will help in this situation. I also don't see any way that Palestinian armed groups will stop attacking Israel, at least in the short run. They are more active than ever in the West Bank.","title":"CMV: Countries that demand that Israel withdraws from the West Bank should send soliders to guarantee Israel's security"},{"text":"The scandalousness is what makes the brain worms hot ??","title":"People who dont want Labor to control Reserve Bank of Australia have neoliberal brain worms: Greens senator"},{"text":" sacredover/under on them building a casino on top of it within the next two generations?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Pinged MILK-TEA ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20MILK-TEA&amp;message=subscribe%20MILK-TEA) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20MILK-TEA&amp;message=unsubscribe%20MILK-TEA) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=MILK-TEA&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So it turns out, some of my family has trouble understanding the concept of \\"nepotism\\" as a negative and \\"conflict of interest\\" while here in the west.It's either \\"helping out the family\\" or \\"family duty\\" or \\"with trusted friends\\" and it's what friends of the family do with each other. !ping MILK-TEA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The reasoning is, apple is using its dominant market position in USA to price the products higher in rest of the world.Of course legally Apple can do that.

Everybody has standards, preferences and requirements in dating. Where I'll challenge you however is the idea that all (or many) women have these standards you mentioned, that this is somehow the average. You write that you watch Youtube street interviews where women demand guys make 100k or up, and be 6ft or up. So, let's put that to the test. I'm going to use American statistics for this, as I'm assuming you're American based on you not using the metric system. [About one third of American households make 100k or up a year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/203183/percentage-distribution-of-household-income-in-the-us/) - but remember, these are households, meaning many are most certainly dual-income. For the sake of argument though, let's use this to argue 1 in 3 American men alone make over 100k a year. [14.5% of American men are 6ft tall or up](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585718168419c246cf6f204e/t/5ab7e2de70a6adbbb6bcf676/1522000606378/STATISTICS%2B-Dimensions%2B-%2B3-19-18%2B%281%29.pdf). Using these two stats, that would mean that, if \\\\~33% of men in America make 100k+ and 14.5% are 6ft or taller, \\\\~4.7% of American men make both 100k+ and are 6ft+. And that was when I exaggerated the percentage for income. If it was true, that most women demanded men have these two things, it would be impossible that [at least 50% of American men are partnered](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/), most of them with women. Unless, of course, women at large actually don't demand these two things. Which, luckily, they don't! Women are individual people, just like men. There will always be people with standards you might find unreasonable, but a vocal minority with these standards shouldn't put you off from dating.My suggestion to you would be to watch less of those Youtube compilations, and instead build up your confidence and talk to real life women. You write that you've \\"*talked to many women and they all seem the same way as talking to men*\\". Continue talking to women, socialize, build your confidence and I swear dating will feel a lot less daunting.

It's like the game of thrones but for sex. These are real interactions, beliefs, and subcultures that engage in this idea. Does this sound familiar?There is a \\"value\\" assigned to people and therefore a *hierarchy* of high and low value people. Everyone is out for themselves, everyone wants to fuck, fight, and feed on the highest quality things until they die. Everyone is an object or an NPC. The selfish self is the only thing that matters. Basically Ayn Rand's perception of reality.If all of that sound familiar then you get what I am saying right? You have seen this view before and it seems like you are seeing this same view. This is The Game^(TM) and you have put your head inside the game and this is the reality you see (or maybe just the reality you hear about).Logically, let's assume you current view is that the The Game^(TM) is not only real, but the *only* reality. There is no other \\"truth\\" only the The Game^(TM) exists and that is the underlying, objective reality to everything. Is this what you are kind of thinking these days?Now if I've described at least 10% of your view accurately, let's take a look at two alternate views and see which one you think is more realistic than what your current view is.# Alternate View #1The Game^(TM)  is objective reality but its not biased towards any particular sex. I.e., men have it bad but so do women. Everyone is suffering in the The Game^(TM)  except some small elite group of super sexy, intelligent, kind, generous, wealthy, and spiritually enlightened Ubermenchen.In this alternate view, we acknowledge that your insecurities about dating and being in a fulfilling relationship are real. Yes you are in competition with other men (and other women) and it's stressful. But also we acknowledge that women don't have it easy either, women are constantly competing for men *and* women. Women have to be all sorts of things in order to have \\"value\\" and get \\"high value partners\\" (e.g., young, beautiful, submissive, but also not submissive, nice but not too nice, a virgin but also a master of the sexual arts somehow, etc.).In alternate view #1 your view  is not wrong but it's not complete. Yes there's a daunting sexual competition constantly happening forever from your first day of puberty to the day you die. Welcome to the jungle, it sucks for everyone (not just men).And I gotta say, as a man, I can see women have it hard too. They are constantly being asked to lower their standards and I am certain you wouldn't like to be told to lower your standards, that would piss you off right?# Alternate View #2The Game^(TM) is not objective reality, it's just a cultural illusion manifested by the collective subconscious behavior of millions of assholes with no self-awareness, no empathy, no experience with real love and nurturing, and basically no concept of people having inherent value just for being a sentient being.Edit: To clarify, in alternate view #2 we take the view that people don't have to play The Game^(TM) and people are capable of thinking beyond their self. True love is real and it is a selfless but powerful way to live and connect with people, one that isn't chained by jealousy and hunger for power and control over other people.

There's no way of verifying that they are legit. They could be coaching the interviewees on what to say before they turn on the cameras, or getting 100 interviews and narrowing it down to 5 that they show in the video. Their goal is to get views and they want the interviews to be interesting, or sensational, dramatic, whatever it take. If the video leaves the viewer feeling outraged or upset, they are likely to watch the whole thing and comment, which is exactly what the poster wants since it makes them money. It's just rage bate.Also keep in mind, the interviwers on those type of videos questions like \\"what's your ideal most amazing guy\\" and they are answering in a very hypothetical manner. Ofc if you ask someone how much money they wish their partner could make, they will say 1 million. Does this mean they actually expect their partner to be making 1 million or like anyone making 1 million would be interested in their broke ass? No, not unless they are rich themselves.That aside, I would encourage you to look at dating more in the way that you think women look at it. Not in the sense of having superficial standards and expectations, but you should have some standards and expectations. If dating is like a job interview, it goes both ways. You also should be considering what you want in a partner, thinking about what your ideal partner looks like (in a realistic manner), and when you date specific people you should be considering if they fall into your standards. This will take some of the pressure of yourself and get you out of your head.When looking at yourself as the person being interviewed and evaluated, I would suggest comparing yourself to your idealized partner in your mind. If your idealized partner is very honest and trustworthy, well are you very honest and trustworthy? Think about the traits and values that are important to you, and strive to live up to them and find a partner who does as well. There will always be people who are super focused on superficial shit. You can choose to join the idiot masses or be better than them and have more important things to worry about. Not that it means you are shallow if you want to be attracted to your partner, but things like money and looks shouldn't be all you care about when looking for a relationship. Same goes if you are dating someone, it shouldn't be all they care about. If it is, move along.","title":"cmv: dating a girl feels like submitting a resume to your boss and hoping that you have enough qualifications and credentials for her to want you"},{"text":"at this point i feel some of these people blame kamala for israels actions more than netanyahu","title":"And THIS is part of the reason I'm no longer on Twitter...the proof you can be \\"liberal\\" and still have brainrot the level of a MAGA worshipper."},{"text":"The good news is that our next president is a career prosecutor.

According to prosecutors, the attack would have resulted in $75 million in damages and caused power outages for much of the state. Prosecutors recommended a sentence of less than 18 years for Clendaniel, but a federal judge disagreed.

If you're only putting yourself on dating apps, this is the reality - you're casting a wide net in hopes of finding a catch, but obviously the chances are low because of how those things are set up. It takes a lot to get your foot in the door and it's important not to tie your self worth to these things as they don't map into the real world very well. Also, think about the women on there who are searching for the typical six figures, six feet, six inches kind of thing - are they really the type of women you would want to be in a relationship with or is it just a superficial attraction based on looks that you're basing your thoughts on?Alongside this, there's a lot of people out there who are abusing the fact that there might be problems with some parts of the world to get money - dating and the male-female dynamic is one of them. Those videos you're watching on youtube? They're being very selective with the people they choose to put into the video. They're designed to get views by being polarising or shocking or whatever else and more often than not, they're misconstruing the subject matter. There's a lot of women out there - a lot which are beautiful in all sorts of ways - who don't even touch dating apps or don't put much stock in them and who are a lot more down to earth than the stereotyping you've been presented with (and who aren't dull enough to assume that most men out there make six figures).Your best bet is to meet people through shared areas in person, such as work, school or social functions and hobbies. That way, you actually get to show who you are to the other person and they get to show who they are to you and not only does it feels a lot more natural, but there's a lot more opportunity to get your foot in the door simply by showing up. Believe it or not, most people out there are willing to bend their 'criteria' for a person because we all know that no one is perfect. An extra little tidbit is that most personal growth is done in and around relationships, so even certain red-flags aren't deal-breakers and that's completely fine.My third/fourth bit of advice is that if you genuinely work on yourself - as in, you have things in your life that you enjoy and they are fulfilling for you - the dating part of life is going to have way less meaning and be tied way less to your sense of self worth. I'm an introvert and homebody at heart, so naturally, I'm a bit of a gamer nerd. That's not all I am, however, I also play a musical instrument, enjoy working out and work out consistently, I read and write, I love nature and go for hikes - and I try to practice all of it with intention to the point that even when it comes to the 'nerd' parts, others can still admire me for it. I also know myself pretty well; I'm not looking for some omega extrovert who goes out partying as a lifestyle - that sounds like a bad time and a recipe for disaster to me. I accept the fact that it can take time to meet the right people for me or that I might even meet them online and have to accept and deal with the realities of that situation. And you know what? I am generally happy and I am generally secure. I've made both my home and work environment healthy for myself.In short, cast your net, but don't let it consume you even a little and if it does consume you, accept and be okay with the fact that you'll just let things happen in person because it's the healthier thing for you to do. (That healthier part will help you feel self-assured and self-assurance translates into attraction, also!) And ignore all the bullshit out there and keep doing you - you're a person and I'm a person, by default we have the same intrinsic value.","title":"cmv: dating a girl feels like submitting a resume to your boss and hoping that you have enough qualifications and credentials for her to want you"},{"text":"Eric Adams just needs to change his party affiliation and he will have millions of defenders","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Which is a good thing if you want them to actually vote lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"As a millennial I don't know if I can support Harris if her platform doesn't include universal healthcare for furbabies and a tax write off for adulting","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Dating is about finding a good enough fit.

Indigenousness? The Canaanites were the first people recorded in the region followed by Hebrew writings predating the arrival of Arabs and Phoenicians of which Palestinians share ancestry with. The Israelites conquered the Canaanites and intermarried resulting in Canaanite DNA being passed down and Arabs colonized the Israelites intermarried and passed down Canaanite DNA inherited from the Israelites.Land bought?Jews not only bought the land, they often paid highly inflated prices for that land:In 1944, Jews paid between $1,000 and $1,100 per acre in Israel, mostly for arid or semi-arid land; in the same year, rich black soil in Iowa was selling for about $110 per acre.\\nWhen John Hope Simpson arrived in Israel in May 1930, he observed: They \\\\[the Jews\\\\] paid high prices for the land, and in addition they paid to certain of the occupants of those lands a considerable amount of money which they were not legally bound to pay. \\\\[The meaning here is that the Jews who bought the land from the absentee owners and paid the tenants to vacate the land, as well.\\\\]\\nMost Palestinians immigrated from Jordan and Egypt in the 1800s, It doesn't matter how long Jordanian and Egyptian immigrants were squatting on the land the ottoman Turks stole from the native Jewish population it's still their land. The largest owner of land pre-48 wasnt Arab or Jews. It was PUBLIC land. This was land that had previously been owned by the Ottoman Empire which passed to the British as part of the mandate. Those public lands, post 1948, passed to their defacto sovereigns (Israel, Egypt, and Jordan).\\nWars won? In 1948 five Arab countries armed with the best weapons money could buy formed the Arab league and attacked a day old Israel which was under a arms embargo at the time and still lost. They have attacked multiple times over nearly all after calling for ceasefire.\\nThere were over a thousand Pogroms and attempts of genocide by the Arabs in Palestine in the course of several centuries including the Hebron massacre where Arabs went door to door killing and maiming over a hundred innocent people in the city of Hebron who's Jewish population existed long before Jews started immigration back to their homeland. It started with the killing of a four year old Jewish boy and his father in their own house by muslim mobs.There were no \\"forced gunpoint\\" takeovers only a failed attempt of genocide against the Jewish population by Arab forces who blocked the only source of water, destroyed pipelines and marched into battle with swastikas painted on tanks, they were so sure of victory they described with glee what they thought the outcome of their attacks would be comparing it to the \\"mongol massacres\\" and \\"second kybar\\" after the first kybar which was the genocide of the Jewish population in the region much like the attempts of genocide against the Maronite Christians in Lebanon by syria and \\"Palestinians\\" or the attempted takeover of Jordan again by the Palestinians, or the attempted takeover of Egypt by the Palestinians or the attempted takeover of Iraq by the Palestinians.If you'd like to know more about the history of nakba from the son of one of the two Hamas founder's this is a good start he talks about how his grandmother was told to leave by the Palestinian forces not Israeli. She refused and still lives on the land the same as other Palestinians who are now the majority of the 2.5 million Muslim Arab population in Israel.https://youtu.be/necPCKnfMd4?si=46LhFodizvjNNPQOLesson learned if you take a group of people's land who have been there over a thousand years before you, kill, torture, colonize, attempt to force convert them for centuries, build mosques over their temples and churches you destroyed, take their money when they buy their own land back from you but then refuse to let them live on their purchased land, refuse agreement set out by the British that would take the majority of the land from the people you just stole from, killed and colonized for centuries.Gang up with multiple other countries on one country under a arms embargo and still lose, attack over and over in new wars you start losing more and more land every time and refusing six offer's to share the land including one for 95% of it, send thousands of rockets into their country on a regular basis and act like the fact that those rockets are shot down and fall predictably in the neighborhood they're launched from killing your own people means your the victim. Stating in interviews that civilian deaths are the plan and your refusal to build bomb shelters or let civilians use the multi million dollar tunnel system you built then you kill and torture over a thousand innocent people and kidnap over two hundred.

The SBIR Phase I awards will fund research projects to explore the technical merit or feasibility of an innovative idea or technology for developing a viable product or service for introduction in the commercial microelectronics marketplace. This is the first award for the CHIPS Research and Development Office. The Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to getting small businesses the resources they need to thrive and promoting competition to level the playing field.  \\n...  \\nNIST measurement science, or metrology, is at the heart of all the advances we anticipate from American chipmakers in coming years, like smaller, faster, chips that take less energy to make, operate and cool, with more functions at less expense.The award-winning projects were competitively selected from proposals submitted in response to a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) on multiple topics on research projects for critically needed measurement services, tools, and instrumentation; innovative manufacturing metrologies; novel assurance and provenance technologies and advanced metrology research and development (R&amp;D) testbeds to help secure U.S. leadership in the global semiconductor industry.These are all Phase I SBIR awards, which are meant to establish the merit, feasibility and commercial potential of the proposed research and development projects. All 17 small businesses will be under consideration for a SBIR Phase II award in Spring 2025. Each Phase II award can be funded up to $1,910,000.  \\n...*About CHIPS for America*CHIPS for America has allocated over $32 billion in proposed funding across 16 states and proposed to invest billions more in research and innovation, which will create over 115,000 jobs. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, semiconductor and electronics companies have announced over $400 billion in private investments, catalyzed in large part by public investment. CHIPS for America is part of President Biden and Vice President Harriss economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind.

They came to see that not all of them were Nazis, and the German people felt deep shame and guilt over their crimes. Palestinians have to come to see Israeli as not all Zionists, and the Israelis are still carrying out a genocide and ethnic cleansing, so it would be like the Jews being expected to forgive the Nazis while the Nazis still retain power and refuse to acknowledge their crimes. Even still, it's still better to try peace for a change of pace.

Given the nature and frequency of violent conflict in there, this could lead to a major war if soldiers get harmed by Hamas attacks. And if this happens, the opposite will also be true, and soldiers are sent into Gaza to protect againts Isreali incursions. From what I've seen, especially with the Oct 7 attacks, Hamas soldiers and radicalized Palestinians do not give a shit about who they kill when they attack Isreal. There have been reports of non Isreali citizens being killed, abducted and violated. [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231018-foreigners-killed-abducted-or-missing-after-hamas-attack](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231018-foreigners-killed-abducted-or-missing-after-hamas-attack)  \\nAnd if you really want to think about it, the main reason why soldiers are sent to help defend territories isnt to actually defend said territories. One American soldier is just one American soldier. An Isreali soldier could do the same job as an American soldier, so if your concern is just that, then sending military hardware aid could do the job just as well. Typically when soldiers arent sent to help defend territories, they're there to function as a way for the nation to get directly involved should their soldiers be harmed. Again, your idea would either drag many countries into a war they didint want, or they'd lose their justifications for using those tactics in future situations (i.e. USA in Afganistan, Syria, Japan, etc etc). Plus I suspect both Isreal and Hamas will roundly reject this, mostly because the nations that demand Isreal's withdrawal are opposed to Isreal and vice versa, which means... Isreal is gonna have enemy troops in Isreal territory, and Gaza will have enemy troops in there as well. Do you really think Isreal will accept Iranian troops in their territory? And who's advocating for Hamas to stop attacking Isreal? Mostly just Isreal actually, at least consistently. So I dont know how you want to work with that.And yes, Iran does want Isreal to withdraw from West Bank. Because that land provides a launch location for Iranian supported and armed Hezbollah to move in and attack Isreal.","title":"CMV: Countries that demand that Israel withdraws from the West Bank should send soliders to guarantee Israel's security"},{"text":"what if, the Israelis just stopped being such assholes and then maybe their neighbors wouldn't want to kill them?one of the key demands of Hamas is a \\"right of return\\".  The 1990's Oslo accords peace plan didn't include it, and Hamas derailed those peace talks through terrorist bombings.The vast majority of the people living in Gaza, and many people living in the west bank, are descendants of people who fled for their lives during the 1948 war.  Israel refused to allow refugees to return after the war ended.  Instead, Israel confiscated their property and redistributed it to jewish refugees.I think its important to point out that many jewish refugees to Israel who received confiscated land were people who similarly had their property stolen (in places like Egypt and Iraq) and were exiled.So, Hamas wants the Palestinians who had their land stolen to be able to return to where their families used to live and NOT have to live under the rule of the country that took it from them.Ending the current provocations in west bank and gaza isn't enough to settle this dispute.  Many people in that area want, not just for Palestinians to have their own country, but also for that country to include land that they were displaced from.  And, achieving that would involve abolishing Israel and could result in the ethnic cleansing of millions of jews from the area.I want peace.  I want a ceasefire.  I condemn a lot of the actions of the government of Israel.  But, I think oversimplifying this conflict as merely current provocations (and then concluding that the conflict could easily stop with the ceasing of those provocations) is a grave error.  the situation is a lot more complicated than that.","title":"CMV: Countries that demand that Israel withdraws from the West Bank should send soliders to guarantee Israel's security"},{"text":"I think the main point against this suggestion is simply that it has historically been a REALLY bad idea for nations to go to foreign lands and play world police.

The Democrats portray the Republican as *so much more worse than the last Republican* that we *must* hold our nose and vote for the Democrat. And election after election we choose the \\"lesser evil\\" rather than the \\"greater evil\\" without realizing that *they're both* **evil**!Think about the many social advancements we've gotten throughout US history. I maintain that *we only achieve major social advancements* when we *vote for a \\"so-called\\" third party.* That's the *only time* the 2 ruling capitalist parties give \\"we the people\\" any of what we want.In the WWI era we gained the right of women to vote -- 50% of the population! We also got the right to directly-elect US senators, the most significant change to the rich-white-men-created constitution that we've ever got. But what was happening at that time?At that time the Progressive Party was making huge gains and the Socialist Party was growing so fast that after WWI the ruling class conspired to launch the \\"Red Scare\\" and do things like have the American Legion burn down Socialist Party HQs in several cities.So the ruling class decided they had to move to the left to co-opt the \\"threat\\" and give us what we wanted. This is the pattern again and again in history.In the 1930s FDR was not elected as a liberal icon advocating dramatic reforms. But then the Communist Party was growing fast, the Socialist Party remnants were still around, and the labor movement -- buoyed by communists -- was increasingly militant and active. These factors combined to push FDR to the left.And \\"we the people\\" got things like social security, the 40 hour workweek, unemployment insurance, and welfare -- the *right* (later abandoned by the conservative southern Democrat Bill Clinton!) that the US gov't had a responsibility to give cash to poor people. And the leftward movement provoked a backlash from the ruling class. After WWII the ruling class launched the McCarthy era and blacklisted communists from the labor movement, from the media and any other positions of power or influence.In the 1960s the US was suffering from our failed wars in southeast Asia, with the ruling class bankrupting the country in pursuit of empire. Then the anti-war movement combined with civil rights and black empowerment and other radical movements to start voting for a huge range of small, so-called \\"third parties\\" -- everything from the Youth Int'l Party (the Yippies) to the Black Panther Party.To \\"co-opt the threat\\" the 2 ruling parties and the ruling class responded by conceding LBJ's Great Society programs -- things like MediCare/MedicAid (the first steps in the 4-step program to give \\"we the people\\" full nat'l health care) and the voting rights act.That's what happen -- when we vote for so-called \\"third parties\\" it forces the ruling class to move their 2 ruling parties to address \\"the threat.\\"This even works for the political right!In the 1990s when the billionaire oligarch Ross Perot (the guy who offered to buy the ABC TV network and run it to give Nixon sympathetic media coverage, think of it as the idea behind Fox News) decided to run for president, he ran essentially on 1 issue: Fiscal austerity. When he shocked the country getting 19% of the vote the ruling class spurred their 2 ruling parties into action!The liberal-minded Democrat Clinton became a budget hawk and smiled as he repealed FDR's welfare law. Both Republicans and Democrats agreed on raising taxes and cutting spending, addressing Perot's concerns. This was so effective Clinton ran a couple of balanced budges late in his 2nd term, the only balanced budgets in my lifetime!Once the Perot \\"threat\\" was over, Bush launched his unneeded wars and cut taxes *at the same time* driving the budget deficit to new heights.But the fact remains: To get the 2 ruling parties to address the \\"we the people\\" the solution is we just need to vote for 3rd parties. \\"The people can have anything they want. The trouble is, they do not want anything. At least they vote that way on election day.\\" -- Eugene Debs, the socialist presidential candidate who received more than 3% of the vote for president while sitting in a jail cell for opposing WWI.

Unlike just ten years earlier, when there also was a pandemic (swine flu), but without much drama.Furthermore, no I don't think US politics had much bearing on the policies across Europe, Australia.

Many say that it isn't conspiratorial, and the conversations don't belong on this sub.  I respectfully disagree.  In retrospect, since it's inception and it's installation of a Bill of Rights, the whole premise of the creation of the United States was to establish a governance of, for and by it's citizenry.Because before it was a U.S.A., it was a colony of the British Empire and their oppressive King.  The Founding Fathers installed methods to give the citizens the ability to always side-eye their government, to keep them in service to it's people.  And methods to ensure if that governance became too detached from its' mission, it may be re-directed, by various Constitutional rights of the governed to do so.  Legally, as well as ethically and morally.If there would have been an internet of things after WWII, maybe, just maybe this guy would have gained some traction in his speculations:[https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/joseph-mccarthy](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/joseph-mccarthy)But, there wasn't.  And THIS guy continued not only his rhetoric, but, his plan as well:[https://www.azquotes.com/author/7985-Nikita\\\\_Khrushchev](https://www.azquotes.com/author/7985-Nikita_Khrushchev)Because the governed citizenry has really only had limited sources of mass media for their consumption from before the inception of the US until about 1995 or so (demilitarization and subsequent commercialization of the world wide webbie), the proverbial flag was actually captured very shortly after those Founding Fathers implemented their grand new plan, circa about 1788.  Because the plan needed money and the bankers were quick to provide it, with terms favorable to the bankers.The first public sign of trouble in paradise was the War of 1812.   The Banker's War.  You and I lost that war then, and continue to lose it today.The second guy I mentioned here was right in his rhetoric, tragically.The first guy was pretty right as well, IMHO.So, by the time the powers that be figured out how dangerous to the controlled narrative the interwebs might be (oh, I miss the old AOL chatrooms!  Wild West!), the throttling of that medium began, in earnest.  I'd say we had real possibility of learning truths from about 1995 to 1999.  Dead internet theory since then.These United States and their imminent capture by forces and powers early on it it's infancy, and all that's happened since then is a bigger conspiracy than we'll ever fully know.  And, with the continued censorship of our online potential, we'll still never fully know.We can see it. We can kind of source it.  We can even feel it.  We can either accept it, or reject it, now, in this moment.  The future's so bright we're gonna wear shades may be a metaphor for our own good, or our chosen permissible victimhood.  I urge everyone to choose wisely in November, by getting themselves informed and by comparing the big chair candidates plans for both us and U.S., and how they align with old Nikkie's quotes, or don't.  His prophetic time may be tomorrow.Stay safe!","title":"Am I crazy?"},{"text":"Lol if you think that's bad, wait until you read this [idiot's ](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/child-care-trump-what-matters/index.html)response to childcare!","title":"Kamala Harris Struggles to Answer Economic Questions on MSNBC"},{"text":"I dont think the state should be being deliberately cruel.

LET ME SCROLL! - probably you And tbh thats completely fine if so. We all have to start somewhere, and we all have disadvantages and suffering; after all- as the Buddhists say, thats what life is, suffering.So if youre going to suffer regardless, I challenge you to sit down and think about what you can do with your life, to make that suffering worthwhile.What can you do, to justify that suffering? And think big, because why not? In life, were ALL IN. Were playing for keeps. The beauty of the game though, is that you can choose your hand. So choose wisely. And make a bloody good game out of it!I can guarantee you that working on yourself and your life, irrespective of your short comings or downfalls, will vastly improve your quality life; ten fold to that of simply saying oh well.We did not come this far as the human race by settling for mediocrity and pain; we gripped life by the throat and we make it ours.Being productive, for the past several hundred thousand years, has proven to be quite effective; and you can look at the results by just looking around at all the marvellous things weve done today.Doing the opposite, or rather; following the teachings of neoliberalism and their engineered woke mind virus, is not proven, and so far; only seems to increase suicide rates and mental health diagnoses.It really is that simple. Dont believe the depopulation propaganda by the globalist deep state elites who are trying to pit against eachother, the classes, the sexs, everyone whos not them. Divorce is up, mostly initiated by women or the neoliberal girl bosses, whos hypergamy is being manipulated into also not settling; relationships are down, hook up culture is rife, birth rate is subsequently down also. All part of the plan.They managed to steer the feminism movements in the late 20th century with cia assets and more (proven) to essentially tax DOUBLE the population as well as destroy the traditional family.That aside, the neoliberalism movement we see at the moment, is only being used to usher in alt right authoritarian rule. Wed never ask it for, unless we were absolutely sick of the pendulums current position on the far far left. We see this happening in the UK, France, Europe; and now the west. Again, all according to plan.Also, be wary of statistics you read on MSM / propaganda outlets, the world has never been safer; also heres some pleasant reminders of that-If the world was 100 people, 100 years ago today:94 were living in extreme poverty, now just 10.17 had basic education or more, now 86.12 were able to read, now 85.1 living in a democracy, now 36.0 vaccinated, now 86.43 die before 5 years old, now just 6.Things are far far better and greater than theyve ever been, even most violent crime statistics are cherry picked on the news from covid times; and are historically- especially past 10-20 years; on a major decline.Do with this what you will, but whatever you do- give yourself a hug once in a while. Its hard to be moving forward in a world filled with propaganda telling you youre moving backwards. Youre doing good! But you could also be doing better. Dont settle for less, push yourself.Justify the suffering. And soon? It wont feel like suffering any more, at least not in the way it does now- and better yet; youll have something/s you actually wanted; paid for and earned - by the suffering.So again, choose wisely. \\nPeace love and prosperity to you, my friend.\\n**WHO ARE THEY?**\\n-Blackrock board members and subsidiaries, sit on and own all of Vanguards companys; and vice versa.

In some states, you cannot use deadly force (within your home) unless you have a \\"reasonable fear\\" of imminent death or bodily harm upon themselves. Some require some level of \\"duty to retreat\\", depending on the circumstances (like who is the initial aggressor). Some allow for \\"force\\", including lethal, only to stop illegal entry, activity, or attack (on the structure). And sometimes multiple of those, or more, factors are all applied depending on the exact circumstances.Generally, it's not quite as simple as just \\"someone is in my house so I can shoot them!\\".Washington D.C. is one that has the mix and sort of falls between castle doctrine and duty-to-retreat (or rather, both kind of co-exist). A person doesn't *have* to retreat, but they do need to take reasonable actions to attempt to do so before using lethal force. A jury can weigh whether they feel that a person made an attempt to avoid using force in determining whether use of lethal force was justified. And then on top of that, using lethal force is always limited to situations where the person \\"believes that they are in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury\\".","title":"Kamala Harris comments on shooting a home intruder are absolutely responsible, Fetterman says"},{"text":"They cost *a lot* to keep alive.

From my understanding of this it's basically just going to be equivalent to raising the sales tax by 3% and then redistributing that out? If that's the case and assuming the 1600 estimate is right, then some quick math suggests about anyone paying under ~53k a year will have more and anyone paying above will have less, scaling off how far away you are from it.

Hermes is both surprised and impressed by the phone booth, and proceeds to throw his cell phone away.The same happens in?Bender's Big Score, when Bender decides to kill himself after losing Fry in the year 2000, after being tasked by the scammers to go back in time and kill Fry. After realizing that it was a phone booth, Bender remarks: \\"What kind of horrible suicide-free time is this?\\"Suicide Booths appear in?Futurama: The Game?during the New New York Levels.

I joined a couple years after the riots.When I first hit the street, there was a common sentiment that most pro-active arrests (guns and drugs) werent worth getting into. The reasoning was that these are more likely to lead to a use of force and our States Attorney Office had already proven that she was willing to charge officers criminally for a UOF, even when there is no evidence to support the charges. Furthermore, the SAO was routinely downgrading and dropping charges - it was common to see people you arrested with a gun out on the street a few days later. So the idea was is it worth potentially getting injured and/or charges in a UOF when the gun or drug charges you file are probably going to get dropped anyways?When COVID hit, the SAO released a statement that many quality of life crimes would not be charged and that possession of certain amounts of heroin and crack deemed by her office to be personal use would no longer be charged by her office. She implemented a policy that would basically require officers to cite people for simple possession and no method of enforcement for some of the common calls for service we would get.One of the issues that I saw was that possession over a certain amount and/or packaged in a certain way was generally considered possession with intent to distribute. However, the SAO would downgrade PWID to simple possession and then decline to charge based on their policy. Some guys on my shift arrested a man with two packs (100 pieces of heroin in gelcaps, package for street level sales) and $800 on his person. A clear PWID charge. The SAO said no, it was personal use and declined to charge.Once, I attempted to explain this policy to a frustrated citizen. She got into an argument with some squeegee boys and they got disrespected to her. She wanted me to arrest them or at least stop them, but I had no legal basis to do so based upon her statement. I explained 4th amendment laws, state laws, and the SAO policy and how it all interplayed. I then told her Id go talk to them to try to convince them to apologize, but if they ran, I was certainly not getting into a foot chase with some juveniles across a busy street. If any of them got hurt, I would be liable since I couldnt detain them in the first place. She then filed a complaint on me, saying that if I had more officers, I could have stopped them - but failing to take into account the fact that the amount of officers would not have somehow given me a constitutional basis for a stop. Our IA interviewed me and got hung up on me saying the SAO was declining certain quality of life charges (including the squeegee charges). They didnt believe me and insinuated I was neglecting my duty. I had to remind them that the SAO made a public statement in which she listed the statues she would no longer enforce. My IA case got dropped, but the lesson that our IA is trigger happy, uninformed, and full of house cats who have almost no street time is a common theme across departments.Even simpler things like vehicle infractions are subject to this. Vehicle policies have become a lot more restrictive in dense population centers - and not without good reason. The conditions under which a vehicle pursuit may be justified are extremely rare; the occupants have to be committing a felony AND their actions must present an active and imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to officers or the public. The criminals know this and it is very rare for them to yield to police, knowing that cops cant chase them for blowing red lights and stop signs. Our policy is written in such a way that even activating lights and sirens may be construed in and of itself as a pursuit. Combined with a trigger happy internal affairs and SAO, few cops are willing to try to pull over cars they see driving like jackasses.In reference to defunding, I had a call in which a lady experiencing a mental health crisis jumped into the harbor. I was first on scene and saw her naked and running towards the water. It was cold that day and I later learned the water was 47F. When she jumped in, I requested the marine unit. As I waited for a response, she swam out about 50 yards, then started going under. When she bobbed up, I could hear her quietly gasping Help. Dispatch got back and apparently the marine unit had been defunded. I requested Fire Departments Rescue Team. Not working that day. I requested any jurisdiction with a boat. No one was available immediately and it would take 30 minutes at the fastest to get the dive team there. Me and two other officers ended up stripping our gear and swimming out to her.The crux of your discontent is about a lack of enforcement. And while you focus on the Defund movement, that movement was a social reaction to a deeper issue of faith in law enforcement. That deeper social issue manifested itself in more ways that simply cutting budgets - and in most cases, budgets probably did not get cut.However, many other aspects came to light. A vocal withdrawal of support, state prosecutors actively working to undermine enforcement, shuttering of specialized enforcement units. I am not arguing that some of the distrust wasnt deserved. But I am saying that this had a profound effect on the morale of officers that is still pervasive today.I believe that this general belief that the public hates police to the point that you cant find witnesses willing to come forward at a homicide scene, that prosecutors hate police to the point that they will seek criminal charges against officers who got into a justified use of force, that attorneys general will downgrade and dismiss the charges that officers worked hard to investigate, that IA and civilian review panels are full of house cats who are trigger happy and petty - that all of this means you have fewer people willing to become cops, fewer cops willing to be proactive, and a public willing to blame the cops for things outside of their control which then perpetuates this social feedback loop.","title":"CMV: Police haven't been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that's why crime has got so our of control in California."},{"text":"Trying to avoid polarity here but his stated goal of trying to stop a regional war in the Middle East has clearly failed.","title":"Biden says he'll continue policy work after leaving office: \\"I'm not going away\\""},{"text":"Amen!

They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they dont resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they dont ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they dont need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they dont bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn.You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe.Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?

The problem is that the states certified the election and there wasn't a basis to reject a certified election result. The thing about the US Constitution is it reserves the power on how to administer elections to the states. There's little federal oversight besides maybe the VRA. So, their strategy is smarter this time. They're going to attack things at the state election board level.   \\nMike Howell, from the Heritage Foundation has identified and recruited Trump loyalists to serve on state election boards across the US. Since 2020, there have been 8 instances where election officials have refused to certify results. That puts stress on the state systems. Georgia, for example, permits election board officials to have unlimited discretion to request inquiries prior to certifying. The only thing is the US Constitution does have a time limit for states. Georgia also permits any citizen to have an unlimited number of ballots to protest against. So, if it looks like Harris is winning in say, AZ, or GA, there's enough Trump loyalists at every level in order to gum up the state's ability to certify elections. Doing so could block Harris from having enough electoral college results.   \\nThis isn't even mentioning that Stephanie Bobb is now the RNC's chief legal counsel for election stuff and so she's had 4 years and way more money/resources to create legal cases that can jam up state's election results.","title":"CMV: If Kamala wins in November but Trump still manages to steal the election through the courts it would be better to scrap the entire constitution and start over than allow him to be sworn in again."},{"text":"Jesus God.

You can't just write up an excellent legal document and read it out on national TV and have a strong constitution. A strong constitution means a constitution that is reliably respected. After Trump's first attempt I would say the state of the US constitution is not strong, though I also wouldn't call it weak. It can always be weakened further, though.Fundamentally, there is no set of rules you can design that can stop people from breaking the rules, if the people with the power of enforcement don't care to enforce them. The only true protection is public willingness to protect democracy.Not the main point, but additionally, I think you overestimate how well written the US constitution is. Any document that admits unitary executive theory as a remotely credible interpretation is not reliable at providing checks and balances.I don't think having a diverse voter base is relevant.","title":"CMV: If Kamala wins in November but Trump still manages to steal the election through the courts it would be better to scrap the entire constitution and start over than allow him to be sworn in again."},{"text":"What's with this \\"four MORE years\\" garbage?
