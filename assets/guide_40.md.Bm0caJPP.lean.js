The only difference was that the Nazis called it cultural Bolshevism. The Nazis portrayed themselves as traditionalists seeking to bring Germany back to its former glory. They argued that contemporary society was overindulgent, corrupt, and disgustingly hedonistic. Bringing back traditional values was supposed to be the remedy for the proverbial rot infesting German culture. The Left was and is the natural enemy of fascism, so communists, socialists, etc. were portrayed as a destabilizing force intending to upend society with their revolutionary ideology.Homosexuality in all its forms was supposedly a symptom of Marxist ideology. Being gay, bi, trans, etc. was seen as one of the perversions that Marxism encouraged. Being gay was a fetish one could opt into, in their opinion, and the result of Marxist ideas about undermining traditional values, hierarchies, and gender roles. The fact Bolshevism was perceived as a Jewish ideology certainly didnt help matters, either. In the end, communists, LGBTQ+ people, and Jews were all persecuted and killed for broadly the same reasons.Cultural Marxism is just the modern revival of this old idea.

If you start someone at a very young age and teach them this habit they will have a huge leg up in adulthood.Maybe the next generation can break the cycle.","title":"When it comes to grocery prices, Trump suddenly changes his tune"},{"text":"Maybe that was his plan.

This time around he has made much bolder promises and his supporters will feel the pain if he follows through.  He said prices would drop and it will be hard to ignore the direct effect of tariffs and mass deportation if he keeps those promises.

With other issues, like say with gay marriage, it doesn't really affect anyone else, so you can just ignore it even if you don't support gay marriage.But with trans rights, acceptance has to be a bit more active, such as acknowledging new names or pronouns and adapting to them. That might seem like a small thing, but it draws attention to their identity and does involve other people being proactive, instead of passively accepting them. Also issues like trans people in sports seem like they might affect other athletes, based on how we currently understand men and women sports.Many Americans are still uneasy or uncomfortable about even being able to change your gender, so there has to be a shift in mindset in how we see gender and identity broadly for trans people to be fully accepted. Ideas of gender fluidity are just not mainstream yet.

There is no \\"true\\" label for anything that did go to appeal.We could take a massive collection of human reviews and compare them to AI reviews. We could look at the denial rates of both. We could look at the appeal rate of both. We could look at the overturning of appeals of both. We could have that same collection of reviewers receive the denied claims of the AI and see if they would have denied them. There are multiple ways we can measure the AI compared to what existed before. The claim here is that the CEO was evil for using this AI. And the 90% number used here is a misrepresentation of the actual statistics. Assuming that appeal cases are a representative sample of non appeal cases, when denying insurance claims early is industry standard, is not unreasonable.I disagree. Claims are denied for many reasons with The primary one being incorrect or incomplete information in the claim. Correcting this information and resubmitting is not an appeal. This on its own accounts for over half of denied claims. Appeals occur after any of the main reason for rejection have been eliminated. The remaining pool of cases that could then be appealed are significantly different from the pool of rejections.","title":"CMV: putting Luigi Mangione on a pedestal for murdering Brian Thompson is wrong and takes hatred and anger too far."},{"text":"Different states have different laws pertaining to felon voting rights.

This is mostly because the Ukraine / Russia war has really shown how much the West is willing to let them bleed and how ill-equipped their militaries actually are to handle the situation. Trump's actions would more signify if shit hits the fan, the US might be willing to force a white peace which gives them an out, emboldening them. For Russia specifically, I think this actually decreases the likelihood they enter into another conflict like this. I made this comment in response to someone else who talked about British concessions to Germany before WW2 and I don't think the comparison is there (at least for Russia). Germany's concessions came at very little cost to Germany, which emboldened them. The concessions (if any) to Russia have come at an extreme price, including a reliance on former client states like North Korea, Iran, and Belarus. It's also been extremely costly to the Russian population, both in terms of manpower, confidence in government, and quality of life. Putin's lesson will not come from the peace deal but the cost it came at. This doesn't rule out increased odds in the next 20+ years looking far out, but in the immediate (5 to 10 year period), I don't see Russia starting another war like this one.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

But they hide that free version making it difficult to find online, and heavily advertise the paid version, even sometimes providing an interest-free loan if they file with their product.  Still and if you start filing, and exceed software threshold for income; the program will quit and require you to buy the next edition up..Anyhow, the idea of allowing people to file taxes directly to the IRS, and without complicated software sounds like Intuit and TurboTax are at it again.","title":"Republicans push Trump to scrap IRS free direct tax filing tool"},{"text":"Looks like every Trump promise is shaping up to be a lose-lose scenario for him, which will make his getting overthrown all the more inevitable.","title":"Trump pardoning January 6 rioters would be unpopular: Poll"},{"text":"He's going to go down in history as the grave digger of American democracy.","title":"Mitch McConnell Issues Trump Warning: 'Reminiscent of Before World War II'"},{"text":"He shook her hand, and once he mentioned a trans person, there was an awkward pause, then she recoiled and screamed about a violent attack.

I think that insurance companies probably aren't really the problem, it's the costs at the hospitals. Whether that's because they have huge, bloated admin staff counts or greedy executives or something, costs are inexplicably high. Insurance companies just pay those inflated costs and pass the charges along. I absolutely have a problem with the cost of healthcare in this country.?\\nBut I'm also opposed to more government involvement. Are there any programs the government does that are efficient and cost effective? Look at the VA.

But the poll finds positive sentiment toward Trump often trails the level that greeted other recent incoming presidents, even when he outperforms his own previous transition numbers.**The countrys mood appears to have lifted somewhat following Trumps win, at least in part due to the type of shifting partisan sentiments often seen in the wake of elections where the presidency changes partisan hands. Most overall still say that things in the country are going badly (61%), but the share who say things are going very badly stands at just 15%, the lowest in CNN polling since May 2018.

And everyone's very upset that their houses are heavily damaged. So they elect a new HOA president who says that he will put out the fires by having other neighborhoods pour oil on all the houses. The houses aren't on fire any more but that would never have helped.And frankly, as silly as the above metaphor is, it's still less ridiculous than what the reality is. Because, even in the absurd scenario I've described, I'd still imagine that the neighborhood wouldn't choose a felon who tried to overturn the last HOA election.

The steel tariffs made US products more expensive for US consumers, and virtually all of the money from the  tariffs were all sent to farmers who needed the income since the Chinese put retaliatory  tariffs on US farm goodsMany companies passed the costs of the Trump tariffs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.[212]:?180? Following impositions of the tariffs on Chinese goods, the prices of U.S. intermediate goods rose by 10% to 30%, an amount generally equivalent to the size of the tariffs.[213]:?233C234?A study published in fall 2019 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that by December 2018, Trump's tariffs resulted in a reduction in aggregate U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month in deadweight losses, and cost U.S. consumers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax.[24] The study's authors noted that these were conservative measures of the losses from the tariffs, because they did not take account of the tariffs' effects in reducing the variety of products available to consumers, or the tariff-related costs attributable to policy uncertainty or the fixed costs incurred by companies to reorganize their global supply chains.[24] A study by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the tariffs reduced employment in the American manufacturing sector.[214][215]An April 2019 working paper by economists found that the tariffs on washing machines caused the prices of washers to increase by approximately twelve percent in the United States.[23] A 2019 paper by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the steel tariffs led to 0.6% fewer jobs in the manufacturing sector than would have happened in the absence of the tariffs; this amounted to approximately 75,000 jobs.[216][217]In May 2019, analyses from varying organizations were released. A May 2019 Goldman Sachs analysis found that the consumer price index (CPI) for tariffed goods had increased dramatically, compared to a declining CPI for all other core goods.[218] A CNBC analysis that month found that Trump had \\"enacted tariffs equivalent to one of the largest tax increases in decades,\\" while Tax Foundation and Tax Policy Center analyses found the tariffs could offset the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for many households.[20][21][22] The Tax Foundation found that if all existing and proposed tariffs were fully implemented, the benefits of the Trump tax cut would be eliminated for all taxpayers through the 90th percentile in earnings.[219]","title":"Democratic President Rebuilds Economy, Just In Time To Hand It Off To Trump  Again"},{"text":"Yes because the CEO of Intuit (TurboTax) doesnt like free filing.

He let the Saudis leader MBS murder a journalist and his son in law magically got put in charge of a $2 billion dollar hedge fund for MBS with zero experience and against MBSs advisors advice Trump literally spouts Russian propaganda verbatim, he publicly praises Putin, he holds private off record meetings and phone calls with Putin, and has done countless things that solely benefit Russia.

A couple of Carter's decisions have really aged well. Most notable is appointing Volcker as Fed chair, which more than any single action anyone else did broke 1970s stagflation, at the cost of temporarily wrecking the economy and thus his political hopes. We'd be in much better shape if we'd listened to him on energy conservation, his Israel-Egypt work is looking timely as hell, and him legalizing homebrewing ultimately birthed the craft beer boom.He still wasn't well-suited to the presidency in some key ways, famous for being morally rigid yet indecisive when he needed to be decisive. He clashed with Congress even when his own party was in charge and thus struggled to get his agenda across. His malaise speech was actually fairly well-received but he shot himself in the foot by firing his cabinet and giving off an impression of chaos. Too much of a wonk to be a great head of state, too morally upright to be a great Beltway insider.But I don't want any of this to detract from the fact that, prior to his presidency, Carter once greeted Gregg Allman at the governor's mansion while wearing only a pair of jeans, and the two killed a bottle of whiskey.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"If only there was a law to prevent Presidents from doing business that would make situations like this never occur...","title":"Trump crypto venture partners with platform linked to Middle East militants"},{"text":"Heck ya!

If you are in STEM or have any skills whatsoever (tech, doctor, science, engineering, etc), you'll qualify for visa programs in better countries. Healthcare, engineering, science, and technology are global needs.So yeah, if you want out, you can get out (in this specific example). The low functioning folks will live out their climate experience where ever they're stuck (\\"economic light cone\\").With regards to fighting climate change, the US has 40GW of solar PV manufacturing capacity online (due to the Inflation Reduction Act). This is enough to serve domestic annual deployment needs (at this time), even if tariffs are instituted. Coal plants will continue to retire, they are entirely uneconomical to run compared to new renewables + storage (except for the generator in Dry Forks, WY).

Taxes are a literal, physical manifestation of the social contract. People tithe 10% to their church, who has never done *anything* for *anyone*. However, asking for them to pitch in for the schools that taught them and their children, the infrastructure that allows their lifestyle, as well as all the various subsidies and programs that enhance it is somehow a bridge too far. This article belies a much darker and seedier truth, which is that incestuous boardrooms made up of a super-small number of revolving door oligarchs are intentionally making your life *much much much* worse so theirs can be barely even marginally or nominally better.

That threatens billions of dollars in investments and thousands of current and promised jobs at EV facilities, many of which are located in states aligned with the GOP.Republicans represent congressional districts with 19 of 25 major automaker battery and EV assembly plants in operation or under construction, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. Most of the remaining facilities in Democratic Party-represented districts are in states which supported Trump in Novembers election.Trump has made rescinding President?Joe Bidens pro-EV initiatives a key plank of his economic platform. In his address at the Republican National Convention in July,?he promised?to end the electric vehicle mandate from day one of his second administration. To do that, he needs congressional approval to eliminate incentives such as a $7,500 per electric vehicle buyer subsidy in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was approved by a party-line vote in August 2022.[You can read the full story here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-12/trump-s-push-to-eliminate-ev-tax-credits-hits-gop-lawmakers-home-states)","title":"Trumps Push to Eliminate EV Tax Credits Hits GOP Lawmakers Home States"},{"text":"Everything Trump does is unpopular.","title":"Trump pardoning January 6 rioters would be unpopular: Poll"},{"text":"Disgusting excuse for a human being.

But that's because it's Game Theory, which:1. Assumes players *always* make the best, most rationally self-interested choices. Always. Always.2. Game Theory is often a thinly-veiled excuse to be justify being a selfish peice of shit. Because of point 1: it assumes self-interest is ubiquitous and that everything is a fucking game.Anyway, rant aside: the computer programs showed a much different reality - the strategies with the most total wins on average were almost all cooperation-oriented. The asshole programs that defected frequently performed horribly over several games.The best strategy? It produced two simple rules of engagement:* Be forgiving.\\n* Don't be a doormat.The tactic was to always cooperate in the first round and then do whatever your opponent did last round. If your opponent defects in one round, you retaliate. Otherwise you cooperate.It's forgiving, so long as the opponent goes back to cooperating.If they don't, it's scorched Earth.It feels like an oppropriate response from someone with any self respect, and respect for others.

Ultimately, Trump is a consequence the dems have time and again proven they are willing to accept, rather than allow democracy to take place in the form of running a candidate chosen by the people. So you are right in terms of the science of behavior, Trump as a consequence of the dems actions in both 2016 and 2024 cannot be a Punishment if it doesnt reduce the probability of repeating their illiberal, undemocratic behavior in the future. In fact, 2024 proves Trump is a (in terms of applied behavior science) Reward because they behaved the same as 2016 and 2020. So Id predict that they continue to behave the same way i.e. choose their candidates in a smokey back room, use media influence and superdelegates to censor opposition, run a campaign on vapid policy and empty identity politics.Note* In applied behavior science, the terms Reward and Punishment have a very specific meaning that is slightly different from the colloquial sense. They are used to define the process by which the resulting effect of consequences to an action either increases or decreases the probability that an organism will repeat that action again under the same circumstances.","title":"Help me rationalize this election."},{"text":"This sounds so backward for me looking in from the outside.We have a mostly pre-filled online tax form system that you glance over and add anything that was missed or correct errors.

A Republican state representative in Missouri has proposed legislation that would allow a person who pleaded guilty to or was convicted of a felony to serve in public office C and has named it after the president-elect, who has a felony record.The Donald J. Trump Election Qualification Act, introduced by state Representative Michael Davis, would repeal a 2015 Missouri law that prevents a person with a felony from becoming a candidate in a local or statewide election.It would allow a person with a felony record to run for office if otherwise qualified.The legislation takes an obvious page from Trumps book. He was convicted of multiple felonies, yet is now Americas president-elect.A lot of people dont dont think about the fact that Donald Trump, if he met all the other requirements, if he was a Missouri resident, could not run for state representative or state Senate, Davis told the Missouri Independent.He would be precluded from running for these offices but was able to be re-elected president of the United States. So I think that at least causes people to start thinking about the issue a little more than they might otherwise, Davis added.Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in New York in May for falsifying business records for misrepresenting hush-money payments that were made to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election.I believe that we should punish those who do wrong, but once theyve completed the terms of their sentence, we should allow individuals to reintegrate into society, Davis told Fox2Now.They are citizens.

The nazis used it to radicalize a whole society in attempting to exterminate anyone that didn't fit into their Aryan nightmare vision of society.  Experts of all fields and historians have studied it well. (Tldr at bottom if you're seriously too lazy to bother helping stop another holocaust)Far righters and nazis use the term to deem their enemies cultural Marxists to dehumanize them in the eyes of society as jews and socialists.  They equate the two together. It with the great replacement theory is the two driving forces of white supremacist/nazi ideology.You might recall the deliberate murder of 6 million jews in death camps by the nazis. Yeah, they were able to get society to do that by slowly radicalizing the populace against jews by \\"othering\\" them. Just like now the far right is endlessly demonizing any vulnerable group they can, to anyone who stands in their way of total power. When they call democrats Marxists and leftists, what they're really saying is they're not Christian. They're Jewish communists, therefore they should have no rights. It's absolutely mind-blowing how many young people don't know this and have been sucked into the far right. Hostile foreign states are deliberately agitating, and spreading propaganda to incite violence and division here too among many young people. \\nhttps://theconversation.com/cultural-marxism-and-our-current-culture-wars-part-2-45562Use by recent conservatives:Although the term cultural Marxism is used by mainstream academic figures, it has obtained greater prominence since the 1990s from its weaponized use by right-wing political commentators such as William S. Lind and Pat Buchanan.For these culture warriors, cultural Marxism (or, often, Cultural Marxism) is associated with a program of moral degeneracy and subversion of traditional Western values - particularly Christian family values and moral teachings. On this understanding, cultural Marxism is linked, or equated, to political correctness, itself viewed as morally subversive and degenerate. Anders Breiviks disjointed manifesto offers an extreme example of this kind of thinking.\\"https://www.thejc.com/lets-talk/is-the-term-cultural-marxism-really-antisemitic-rn6x61tm\\"In short, Cultural Marxism can be and has been used as an antisemitic phrase, to confer antisemitic meaning or as an antisemitic dog whistle. Because of that, it should be avoided. That said, it isnt only used in antisemitic contexts, and of course, those using it are not automatically, or always, antisemites.\\"https://www.salon.com/2019/05/05/a-users-guide-to-cultural-marxism-anti-semitic-conspiracy-theory-reloaded/\\n\\"It wasnt generic anti-Semitism that motivated the shooter, as a wave of right-wing blame-shifting would have it. Even at the vigil for the victim, the Daily Beast reported that one participant seemed to believe that anti-Semitism does not come from the right wing, but from the left, claiming, Fascism and socialism are the same sides of a different coin.Generic statements like that ignore hard historical facts. As Neiwert writes, a specific anti-Semitic narrative about cultural Marxism  meaning Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms by a cabal of Jewish intellectual migrs from Nazi Germany known as the Frankfurt School  is motivating these massacres, whose victims have included Muslims in New Zealand as well as Jews in America. This is a narrative Donald Trump has long echoed, especially with his attacks on political correctness. For potential terrorists, its also embedded in a very specific, dynamically evolving matrix of right-wing political activity and institutions that marks out a wide range of other targets for retribution, up to and including mass murder.\\"\\nTldr:  the far right blames German  scholars(Frankfurt school) from the 1930s who many were Jewish for kicking off what would become the progressive movement(really any movement that argues for equality and decency). The nazis persecuted them as part of the holocaust/final solution and they fled to america. Now Americans are using nazi rhetoric to attack any vulnerable group or perceived political correctness, or social equality as \\"cultural Marxism\\". It's quite literally nazi rhetoric folks and the fact any Americans are helping these people cause another mass persecution event is absolutely bonkers. We aren't using the word nazi for far righters as a random insult/pejorative. We are using that term because they are copying the rhetoric, policies, and strategies the nazis used. Ww2 was the most well documented war in history. We have it all. There's no denying what I'm saying unless you're a dishonest person who doesn't care about lying to oneself. ?","title":"Pete Hegseth, Trumps Defense pick, says allowing gay troops to serve openly reflects a Marxist agenda"},{"text":"In Republicans Project 2025, they say The long march of [cultural Marxism] through our institutions has come to pass.

Its interesting, and should be horrifying, that Project 2025 starts off its 920 page report of crazy, with the phrase, cultural Marxism, because it has a dark heritage.  Prior to 1933, there was a feeling in Germany that there had been a cultural and moral collapse. This fed the populism of the Nazis. The Nazis pushed out messaging that there was a plot to spread sexual, political (communist) and other revolution throughout the Weimar Republic and the West. This idea, building on Mein Kampf, has been pushed forward throughout history and has now ended up in Project 2025, blaming liberals for all of conservatives problems.

All of this COMBINED with the trial he was on and got convicted for felony as well as rape would have in in Reagan's time completely disqualified him from the presidency.Yet the fact that despite all of this he still won the 2024 presidency isn't an indication of failure on Joe Biden's part but just how seriously flawed the political system has become with an increasingly partisan Republican party that has become just barely far-right and which was the result of an ever growing rise of right-wing media outlets that have more or less brainwashed many Americans that gave Trump enough tools to stand on a platform of racism, misogyny and right-wing nationalist rhetoric and become powerful through it.Had Trump tried that in 1980 he would have been booted out before he even got a lick of nomination. Meanwhile had Reagan tried running for the oval office in 2016 or 2024 with the same platform and policy rhetoric he had during his presidency he would have never been accepted by the party nor the Republican voters and instead be seen as a \\"Republican In Name Only\\" for having some positions that would deem him as \\"Communist Democrat\\".

We have invested more money in the last 4 years into American infrastructure than any presidency has since the 50s. We have created a genuine revival of American production and industry. We will soon be one of the most advanced chip manufacturers in the world as well as other industries becoming much more competitive. We have seen a real resurgence in the trades in recent years. Going to university to earn a decent living is no longer a requirement. There is excellent money to be made and lots of jobs in skilled trades now. That wasn't the case when I left high school in '07. Union strength and union interest is higher than it's been since at least the 80s.We have brought down student debt by no insignificant margin. We weren't able to accomplish blanket forgiveness like many hoped, but for millions of Americans, they are now able to financially afford buying property and starting families. Europe has begun to rearm itself in a significant way, and American weapons have been crucial to preventing Russia from becoming an imperial power that can grab land wherever and whenever it wants. The Ukraine war can and should have been handled with a firmer response, but we have the hindsight of knowing that all the nuclear bluster from the Kremlin was worth less than the dirt on your shoes. In 2022 we didn't have that knowledge. NATO is now larger and stronger, and European nations are taking action to be able to defend themselves. Probably most important: The pandemic was resolved. People with expertise were put back in the driver's seat for navigating the country out of the biggest health crisis in a century. People got back to work, case loads went down, the pandemic ended.

There is not one single person in my family tree who entered the US illegally on a boat or by walking into Texas.  And the 14th amendment is odd on this subject.  It was specifically written for the freed slaves and their children.  Those people were all here legally, but had been brought here against their will.  That's why the 14th amendment speaks to peoples being under the control of the government. They people you are speaking of entered voluntarily, but illegally and are NOT under the control of the government because they are not legal immigrants. Look, I don't mind legal immigration.

Attacking anyone willing to serve or making our military sound weak or even making it sound like we arent all one is just about as disqualifying as it gets. The military has about 6% of our forces are LGBQT, thank them. Thats likely closer to 10% but many prefer to dont tell because they joined when it wasnt okay or during dont ask dont tell. Shame on this guy. We are having a recruiting problem and the Republicans have proposed or done the following recently: Proposed cutting benefits for disabled veteransElected a draft dodger who called POWs and wounded veterans pathetic. Stalled promoting Generals and High Ranking Officers thus stalling careers of others below them causing lower morale and possibly retention issues. Threatening to jail or fire Generals. Told transgender soldiers they were less than and questioned if they belonged in the service and if the Military should pay for the care. Also causing troop morale issues. Considering lowering the age to enter the military. The Army has missed its recruiting goals for the last 3 years and is down 20%. Three of the major branches have missed their recruitment goals over the past year or two. America isnt ready for another war. Yet America has unknown drones at its coast in VA, NJ, and San Diego, specifically its military bases. We have no idea how much we may need the LGBQT soldiers, the immigrant soldiers they are supposed to be taking care of and who would want to volunteer for them if they wont even take care of you afterwards. Meanwhile President Joe Biden who as a Senator voted to send his son to war over some bullshit lies made up for it and help millions of Veterans and their loved ones by enacting the PACT Act. Now people who did not avoid the Vietnam draft, or Korea, or those that went to Iraq or Afghanistan can get the care they need for their families and themselves without a lot of the typical red tape at the VA. We Veterans just like his son inhaled some crazy toxins and those older vets who saw agent orange were denied and many are gone. Biden fixed it, made it right. It was too late for his son but he still fought the good fight because soldiers deserve it.

So, he's found guilty based on the theory he hid another felony that was never charged or proven, and no one knows what that underlying felony was cuz the jury didn't even have to agree on what it was. He's guilty based on alleged uncharged crimes. This is a horrible precedent, and flies in the face of our constitution and freedoms.

Where it differs is the US has become a global destination due to its economic opportunities, location, and influence on the world stage, making its immigration challenges more pronounced and unique compared to immigration issues in Brazil Compared to peer countries like the uk germany, or japan, the US still has birthright citizenship. There are no European countries with birthright. In the uk it was abolished in 1983.
