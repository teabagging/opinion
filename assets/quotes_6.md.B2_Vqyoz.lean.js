If a \\"rally\\" was just a bunch of looters and one guy was saying something about George Floyd while it's happening, that's another thing.  This is clearly like the latter case.Clearly at some point if a rally has enough bad people then you would in fact criticize anyone who was part of it.  I can't give you an exact number.  But in this case not only was it organized by white nationalists (I already posted the link to the Wiki article of the guy who got a permit), not only were they chanting white nationalist slogans - you haven't even pointed to a *single person* who was there doing anything *other* than the racist stuff.Wikipedia explicitly prohibits the use of primary sources as references for its articles. It's not an authoritative source and can not be used to prove any claim. As such, you have yet to prove that the Charlottesville rally was organized by white nationalists.Further, your argument that if a rally or protest had enough bad people in attendance, one must criticize everyone who attended it, doesn't seem to justify assuming that everyone at said event is a part of the bad group of people. Why should I assume that just because one group of people attend a public event, everyone at the said event is a part of that group?It's also a completely subjective way to measure whether the attendees were all good people or bad people. What number you might feel is enough bad people attending an event to criticize all attendees is not the same as what number someone else might feel is enough. This would mean that one can't argue that one event can be criticized, but another can't; because there is no way to objectively determine which event had enough bad people in attendance to make it condemnable.","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"Why was he downvoted?","title":"Hey dumbass liberals, hes your president again. ??"},{"text":"He also pardoned dr fauci, because, just in case ??","title":"Biden pardoned his family and other people for future crimes."},{"text":"The Gulf of Mexico being renamed is WAY more important than lowering the price of groceries or ending the war in Ukraine, or the housing crisis, or the minimum wage not changing in 16 years.","title":"Hillary Clinton laughs as Donald Trump says he'll rename Gulf of Mexico"},{"text":"Ha, youre not wrong.

It's never learn to be happy and content in yourself and have a full life without a woman. It's never build a positive support system and have loving friends who you can talk to about your problems when you're down. It's never go to therapy make yourself a mentally stable person who is capable of being an equal partner in a relationship. It's all external and goal oriented. Go to the gym and get a job and a Bugatti and then get bitches. The advice women actually try to tell these guys is stop treating women like a trophy and just make friends without ulterior motives, but the guys will always get pissed off about that and start ranting about friend zone and shit.

Never do that.\\nYeah by red pill influencers. But they do anyway. From women's perspective it's basically a meme that a dude will get a girlfriend or even a female friend and then immediately dump 30 years of baggage on her a turn her into a therapist because he's not able to speak about his feelings with his male friends without getting bullied and roasted. Women then just feel overwhelmed and forced to do ridiculous amounts of emotional labor. Guys like Tate will then say \\"never tell women your feelings\\" but that's not a solution, the solution is to be able to talk about that shit with your bros and then hug it out and cry like women do with their friends, so that you don't have a fucking nuclear bomb of trauma to dump on your gf and are relatively stable when you do open up.

Like many experts, he has adjusted his views based on evolving science, and this doesnt equate to deliberate dishonesty. In fact, science is inherently a process of refining our understanding as more data becomes available. Early in the pandemic, guidance on masks and social distancing evolved as new evidence emerged. Fauci and other experts worked to give the best possible advice based on what was known at the time.Changes in recommendations are a natural part of scientific inquiry and not evidence of dishonesty. People in leadership positions, especially in crises, often face complex, uncertain situations, and public health guidance is refined as the situation develops.The use of masks to protect against airborne particles and pathogens can be traced back to the Roman Empire, where masks made of animal bladders were worn by surgeons to protect against the spread of disease.His statements about vaccine efficacy that seemed overly optimistic at times was often due to the data available at the moment and the goal of encouraging widespread vaccination to control the pandemic. Over time, it became clearer that the vaccines were highly effective at preventing severe illness and death, but less so at preventing infection altogetherespecially with new variants.Fauci, like other public health experts, has always been transparent about the possibility of side effects while emphasizing that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. Early in the vaccine rollout, experts were upfront about known side effects like soreness at the injection site, fever, and fatigue, which are common with many vaccines. For more serious side effects, like myocarditis or blood clotting, these were acknowledged as rare but important to monitor.As with any medical intervention, vaccines were subject to ongoing monitoring, and as new information came in, recommendations and guidance were adjusted accordingly. This is a key part of the scientific processits about continually updating our understanding based on real-world data.Publix health guidance is always subject to change based on new, real-world evidencethis is a hallmark of science, not dishonesty.","title":"Biden issues preemptive pardons for Fauci, Milley, Jan. 6 Committee and others"},{"text":"When dealing with a huge baby, it's best to take steps before he throws a tantrum.Which is... at least 2 to 3 times a day.So, yet another smart move by Biden.

What you want me to do is provide evidence that some of them were not. Correct? Anticipating the futility of this, Id like to establish exactly what you would need to see. I can certainly show you images or clips of people at that event who are not wearing, carrying, or chanting anything related to white supremacy. But I somehow suspect thats not going to cut it, because you believe by default that anyone there was indeed a white supremacist, regardless of what they might look like or what theyre doing at the exact moment they were on film. Do you need to see footage of someone in the rally explicitly stating that they condemn white supremacy? Even if I could find such a clip, it doesnt seem like that would do the trick either, because Trump doing precisely that has had no effect on you. You will just retort that their very presence at the rally means they must be a white supremacist, and that their statement is not genuine. So, youve basically setup a syllogism which makes disconfirming your claim impossible. Its circular and self-reinforcing. Id argue that its you who is making the affirmative claim without sufficient evidence. Its implausible that every person at that event was a white supremacist. How do you know that to be the case. Finally, even if every single person there actually was a white supremacist, its clear that Trump thought there were others there who were not. A far simpler explanation would be that he was simply mistaken. Your alternative is that within the span of a few moments he strongly condemned white supremacists, and then defended those very same white supremacists, despite the fact that he explicitly said those were not the people he was defending. Thats a hell of a lot of mental gymnastics to jump through just to be able to call Trump a white supremacist, when we already have thousands of legitimate and verifiable reasons to condemn him.Your analogy is not applicable. Your claim is that Trump praised white supremacists. He simply did not do that. In fact, he explicitly did the opposite. This isnt a claim about what did or didnt happen at the event. Its not a claim about who was or wasnt there. Its a claim about something Trump is alleged to have stated, which he did not state.","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"\\nDenmark residents are aliens now?!?!?

You are way overstating their results, it is NOT over decades. If i recall their circumcision type was far more aggressive than infant circs as well, removing most of the inner foreskin, while infant cuts leave a fair chunk of it (side note:  generally the more thats left the easier foreskin restoration to repair some of the damage is)Muslims and Jews give that up as a form of SACRIFICE, as in they are giving something up, not that it is a meaningless act (more specifically they force their children to sacrifice worldly pleasure for religious beliefs)So what if that the birth rate increases in religious countries, wealth and religious views heavily influence birth rates. no one is arguing it does not work either way.

The \\"stripping away of identities\\" you mention was mostly because everyone there already shared the same identity. When's the last time you saw a 1950s church with meaningful racial or economic diversity?Social media actually exposes us to WAY more diverse viewpoints than traditional communities ever did. I follow people from dozens of countries, different political beliefs, and various backgrounds. Sure, some people create echo chambers, but that's a user problem, not a platform problem. Even those echo chambers are typically more diverse than historical church congregations were.Look at movements like BLM or #MeToo - they gained traction precisely because social media allowed different groups to share experiences and perspectives that would never have happened in traditional third places.The real issue is that we're in a transition period. We're still learning how to use these tools effectively. Previous generations had centuries to figure out how to make physical third places work. We've had social media for what, 15 years? Give it time.Instead of trying to recreate old models, we should focus on improving how we use these new spaces.

First off, women face plenty of issues. Nobody said women don't. But you know what isn't helpful ever in any discussion? Trying to say \\"why should I care when this?\\" Women have suffered generally more than men throughout all of recorded history, but it would be just dishonest or ignorant to suggest that currently there is not a particularly harmful male loneliness epidemic and we have evidence that suggests women broadly speaking have much more emotional support than men.Toxic masculinity is perpetuated by men AND women. I don't know how to make this more clear. It is a cultural issue. Men are raised, often by single women, to be misogynistic, selfish, and emotionally repressed because society, men and women, created those conditions over the past few generations.Do I think the problem is routed by initiatives taken by men? Sure, of course I do. But right here, right now it is problem that is being fed by men and women. In addition, it's become increasingly clear that as a result to the rise in toxic masculinity, there has been an inverse reaction causing a rise in toxic femininity to combat it. And this is just shit for everyone.Masculinity does not mean exclusively male. Women can have masculine traits or perpetuate masculine ideals. And men can have feminine traits and perpetuate feminine ideals. It is time people stopped boxing these up as a man or woman issue. They are a people issue and this segmenting of the population and us vs them attitude has to stop.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"I still dont see how this actually protects anyone.

Well\\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00809-6Conclusions: In this national cohort study spanning more than three decades of observation, non-therapeutic circumcision in infancy or childhood did not appear to provide protection against HIV or other STIs in males up to the age of 36 years. Rather, non-therapeutic circumcision was associated with higher STI rates overall, particularly for anogenital warts and syphilis.","title":"Biden Administration Warns Against Forced Surgeries on Intersex Children in Historic Report"},{"text":"Man.

When the person on the monument was an advocate of reconciliation and almost certainly wouldnt have agreed with becoming a messianic figure of the lost cause myth, the monument was built during the rise of the 2nd Klan, and theres a literal neo nazi rally going on in close proximity at the same time there isnt a good way to view people talking about heritage and culture. If someone talks about the culture and heritage of their ancestors broadly that isnt inherently wrong but doing so and hyper focusing on the 4 years when those ancestors  (and often not even their ancestors) were fighting to keep people enslaved and uphold white supremacy indicates thats the part of the culture and heritage they care about.","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"they should fight any legal troubles the proper way, with lawyers.

Tally ho.**Citation point 6** points to this world bank reporthttps://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-prosperity-and-planetwhich has this figure https://i.imgur.com/BaIi762.png that states that the number of people living on less than $6.85 right now is about the same as it was in 1990. Which Oxfam restated as \\"the number of people living in poverty has barely changed since 1990\\". I think that's a pretty dishonest (if factually correct) statement, since we can see from the world bank figures that the poverty rate of people living on $6.85 has dropped significantly, the absolute number not dropping as much is due to population growth. $6.85 represents GDP per capita of 2500, which is low but not that that low. India is at 2500 right now.**Citation point 7** points to their own classification method, which I copy here.https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-01/English%20-%20Davos%20Methodology%20Note%202025.pdf We first took the wealth of all individuals on the 2024 Forbes Billionaire list who are categorised as having inherited their wealth, which was 36% of total billionaire wealth.\\n \\n To calculate the monopoly and crony sources of wealth, we first take the total wealth of the billionaires classified as self-made billionaires and divide it by that industrys value-added (i.e., the industrys contribution to the worlds GDP) across the world. This gives us the self-made billionaire wealth intensity of each industry.\\n \\n For the purpose of this calculation, the wealth of each billionaire is entirely attributed to the main industry in which the billionaire made his fortune, or divided in equal proportion across up to four industries in cases where several industries played a key role in generating the wealth. However, some billionaires have amassed their wealth across more than four industries, or the information about them is not clear enough to assign them to only a handful of industries, in which case their wealth is marked as diversified.\\n \\n The second step is to identify the industries that are subject to particularly strong monopoly power\\n (or market failures) and cronyism (i.e., private sector influence over government policy that affects\\n their industry). We use the exact list of crony industries proposed by The Economist (2014) for their Crony Capitalism index, except for ports and airports because of a lack of disaggregated value-added data.\\n \\n Additionally, we define IT and asset management as monopoly industries, the former because of the\\n market failures of network effects, intellectual property, and vendor lock-in, and the latter because of\\n asymmetries of information. More detail about this classification can be found in Jacobs (2015).\\n \\n Table 7 shows that billionaire wealth is concentrated in a few additional industries that could be considered Monopolistic - including some that are subject to network effects like fashion and luxury goods retail, sports, and motion pictures C and the headline result would be higher if they were included.An uncharitable reading of this methodology could be summed up as \\"it's impossible for billionaires to not be cronies/monopolistic because the very act of being a billionaire makes you one\\".**Citation point 10** is the infamous \\"64 trillion from India\\" paper that nobody should take seriously. However, I do think it's funny how Oxfam framed their usage of this junk data. The estimate of the drain of wealth from India to the UK is $64.82 trillion from 1765-1800. The details for this calculation can be found at https://monthlyreview.org/2021/02/01/the-drain-of-wealth/. **This estimate, whilst debated, has nevertheless been widely cited and used.**Which is essentially the academic equivalent of \\"lots of people are saying thus it's true\\".This just reinforces my priors that modern Oxfam is a joke more focused on academic masturbation rather than doing their stated purpose.","title":"Oxfam reports on poverty when the richest applauds their leader."},{"text":"This headline is trash.

I think a, if not the defining bottleneck is men's severly underfunctioning emotional intelligence (to not say outright lack of emotional intelligence). I've been discussing this with someone in another thread for like two days now.Emotional intelligence begets awareness, which begets accountability. It's hard to continue a behavioral pattern that harms you once you're aware of the pattern itself *and* the motive behind it. Most people aren't conscious of either.The sense of belonging men share now centers external validation; men train each other to rely on external validation to keep one another in check. Their fathers, brothers, and male friends subtly shame them when they act too emotional, which is \\"bad\\" because it's feminine, and in that way they learn to (1) derive their sense of worth from things external to them, and (2) suppress their emotions. This is also why men rely, even subconsciously, on the acquisition of money and women to feel worthy, and rely on women as an outlet for their emotionality. Most don't know how to generate that sense of self worth or self love internally.But now they resent the austerity of those expectations, and project their resentment onto women, who seem relatively free to be emotional and thus free of shame and burden. Paradoxically, men still want to keep them around because without women, they feel worthless and unloved, like there's something fundamentally wrong with them.I believe change hasn't happened because tragedy and community are the only catalyzing events for it. Men will either have to experience a truly devastating sense of loss (which I think is beginning now), OR collectively find a new sense of belonging. In either case, tragedy or community have the power to move men to become emotionally sovereign and accountable. Women have been begging men to change their community, or rather the keystone values and methods that generate their sense of belongingand when they didn't, women began to distance themselves from men. We're more vocal about navigating the dissonances, the projections, the double standards. We became self-sufficient to not rely on men's provision (which they also resent). But the core work is external to women, and internal to men. They will only feel better once they learn to approach their internal worlds with brutal honesty, curiosity, humility, and compassionand that applies especially to the parts they repress and reject in themselves.Edit: readability","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"What would pardoning DACA kids do?

The EU setting the defence policy does not mean EU joint operations, it doesn't even necessarily mean an EU army as those armies could still be national ones. What it means, is that the EU should pilot what and how countries even conceive their armed forces. This is a recipe for disaster.  \\nIf the EU had been setting the military policy it would have been \\"Spend as little as possible without being completely butt-naked\\".Do you really think that the EU's defence policy would have included provisions for expeditionary capacity, the likes of which French employed to fight terror groups in Africa and the Middle East?  \\nOr that the Bureaucracy of a EU army would have allowed the rapid military build up that we've seen in Poland by buying tanks from South-Korea?  \\nOr that such an EU army would spend the funds necessary to maintain an independent Nuclear deterrence force instead of falling for the nuclear disarmament activists?Your argument is \\"Sure, an EU army would suck, be underfunded and basically worthless, because it would suffer from the same issues that Europe's national armies are suffering from BUT independent countries could still pay twice as much and build a separate national military to offset some of those issues\\" ... then why even have the EU army in the first place?Most of the benefits from an EU army can be had from procuring the same equipment, which we can't even do without it turning into a 20 year long political struggle. What makes you think a EU army would work any better?  \\nSome other benefits are gained from operating side-by-side which we already do in NATO and with multilateral missions in the EU.  \\nAnd peak efficiency could be obtained by mutualizing specialized units so that we can procure specialized equipment instead of every country having to build a jack-of-all-trades army. But that can only be done if every country fully trusts that they can rely on those mutualized assets to fulfil their own defence policy goals, which we're nowhere near.  \\nThe issues is not the EU army, the issue is that EU countries can't even agree what that EU army would do, what equipment with, under whose command, against what target, and with what funding. Unless those issues are solved, there is nothing that an EU army can do that cannot be done through multilateral cooperation, and with those at least we maintain multiple capable small-to-medium militaries that can do their thing, instead of one big dysfunctional one that never gets the green-light to do anything.There are a few areas where EU cooperation and even integration is warranted, but I do not believe they can expand to the whole military as you do because of the above mentioned issues.  \\nThis is a strength of Europe's defence, because there are always a few countries that have prepared for any threat. Force all those countries to decide together and they'll only agree to spend on the lowest common denominator.   \\nUS-aligned states will refuse to splurge on EU defence industry, Northern states will refuse to spend on Mediterranean patrols, South-Western states will refuse to spend on Russia deterrence, Central states will refuse to spend on African expeditions, ... In the end, only a sliver of those missions would be covered by this EU army, and only a handful of European countries would be able to meaningfully participate in those. It makes way more sense to just do it on a multilateral basis directly with the countries involved, even if that annoys EU federalist that'd like Brussels to have more power.Outside of joint patrols in the Mediterranean and Baltic (which we already do) and a unified command for European air defence, which we could and should do, most of European defence policies are too dissimilar to be reconciled.","title":"Dutch liberal leader Jetten seeks to increase military spending to 3% GDP and establish the European Army.

If you live even slightly out of the metro area you're basically taking your car because you have no alternative.France's rail network has been built around HSR for decades at the detriment of everything else, including the financial health of the SNCF which has taken 20-25 Billion euros of debt building that infrastructure.   \\nOver 50% of HSR users are managers or executives and their families. It is a great network to allow engineers to live in Lyon and work in Paris, or to move tourists around, but it does very little for the vast majority of French people despite raking in an overwhelming majority of the funding.   \\nAs a result it makes French rail expensive, reduces the number of services cities, and makes it poorly suited to moving masses of people cheaply on a daily basis, so 70% of people still use their cars for daily commutes.  \\nI judge a rail network's success by it's ability to replace cars and busses for 90% of the people, not on it's ability to replace plane flights for 10% of them. On that front the SNCF has done very little in the last 40 years because its resources have been monopolized towards HSR for political reasons.And this problem is only getting worse with new projects. More stations are being closed, or forced to move out of the cities so that trains can maintain high-speeds, damaging the usefulness of those lines even further as the time gained, is made up for by the necessary commute from the station to the city centre.  \\nIn these schemes only the terminal cities are winning, the SNCF is taking on debt, the government is funding it, the serviced cities either see the end of service, or have their stations relocated so far out that the commute cancels any time gained from the High-Speed train, the price of the ticket goes up, the rest of the infrastructure is not maintained, ... It's not worth it.The Bordeaux-Toulouse line that you're mentioning has already had reports done on it that all opposed it. It is a very expensive project (10 Billion euros) with no guarantee of success, that is built on extremely optimistic projections and broke every rule in the book to get approval because local politicians applied pressured to get their HSR.  \\nThis is not what people need or want, they want cheap, punctual, reliable trains that can take them from where they are to where they're going.   \\nHSR is the most expensive way to barely meet half of those criteria, when more price-competitive solutions would deliver 80% of the benefits for 20% of the price are systematically being ruled out because they're not as prestigious.","title":"Dutch liberal leader Jetten seeks to increase military spending to 3% GDP and establish the European Army.

It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.In the press conference you cited, Trump does say that he saw two violent sides. What he's trying to do is say leftists groups create violence. I think this passage from the press conference you linked is very telling:Those people C all of those people, excuse me C Ive condemned neo-Nazis. Ive condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.It's the same strategy that the GOP have done since Barry Goldwater. You saw it when Hillary Clinton said Trump attracts \\"some deplorables\\" and the message is spun as, \\"The Dems called us ALL deplorable.\\" What they're doing is making it so it's hard to see any lines between where white nationalism ends and normal GOP begins. They do it so the moderate GOP can have deniability but they keep the far right support. What both groups want is the messaging that liberals - leftists - are the ones causing divide, discord, disharmony, and are the ones prone to violence. Later he says:?I am not putting anybody on a moral plane, what Im saying is this: you had a group on one side and a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. Youve just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but thats the way it is.Throughout the whole exchange, Trump is trying to pivot away from the Charlottesville incident to talk about jobs/infrastructure. But they keep pressing him because they really want him to say the Unite the Right were filled with white supremacists'. I don't follow the back and forth to mean that Trump ever concedes that framing. I think he's pushing back against the framing. In this other passage he says:and Im not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally C but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.What Trump is trying to say: \\"Leftists, and the media, treat conservatives like we're all Nazis, but non-white-supremacist conservatives just want to feel pride in their history.\\"","title":"CMV: Trump Praised White Nationalists At Charlottesville"},{"text":"u really should log off. it might help u.","title":"President Biden pardons family members in final minutes of presidency"},{"text":"Lincoln, Clinton, and Trump have done it too.

Beyond Iranian lethal plotting against its own domestic dissidents and current and US former officials, the outgoing officials also stressed the need to counter global and domestic counterterrorism, including racially and ethnically motivated threats; and biological threats like the avian flu outbreak and those arising from coinciding advancements in artificial intelligence and biotechnology.Other threats on the Biden teams list were natural disasters; cyber and physical threats to critical infrastructure; the fentanyl crisis; and the challenge posed by drones.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/20/2025/biden-team-stressed-iran-threats-in-departing-briefing-for-trump-team?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Biden team stressed Iran threats in departing briefing for Trump team"},{"text":"The view, CNN, and MSNBC pundits will defend it as noble and necessary because Trump will weaponize the justice department.

A group that harps on about it a lot? Absolutely yes. But I have had plenty of conversations with like-minded men and women about this topic, often blaming toxic masculinity and conservatism. I think its become a bit of a buzzword for the right, but I dont think that means you can say that nobody ever talks about how it is those peoples faults. But I will also say that women play just as much of a role in perpetuating societal norms as men. Toxic masculinity is not just men telling men how to act, it is women doing it too. There is a famous quote that author Brene Brown quotes from a man she met: But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters? I said, Yeah. Theyd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable, we get the shit beat out of us. And dont tell me its from the guys and the coaches and the dads. Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else.This is a real sentiment. Men often feel ashamed of not following societys expectations of them because theyre scared of how women will perceive them. I genuinely think if it were just men perpetuating this, toxic masculinity would not be anywhere near as prevalent. Thats not to say it is womens fault. Because it is isnt. It is society as a whole. But some women even doing little things like expecting men to always pay for dates, or never making the first move certainly doesnt help us to get rid of these gender norms and expectations. You cannot say men should not be expected to be the breadwinners and not be expected to provide for the women while simultaneously agreeing that men should still pay for dates and put all the effort into initiating romantic things. This isnt all women, but its definitely a sizeable percentage of them in my experience.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Hey Im a Democrat, look over here I say! ??","title":"Biden Pardons 5 Members of His Family in Final Minutes in Office"},{"text":"Bless this man and all the hard work he did during the COVID pandemic.

Trump and his supporters will rail against Biden and say this confirms what Trump was saying all along, that it was a witch-hunt. But Biden did the right thing. Trump made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish perceived enemies, the enemy from within.After the Supreme Courts immunity ruling, Trump became more emboldened and his threats escalated.

NIH provided funding to ecohealth, not for GoF, but for RGE classification. The experiments didn't amount to the EPPP standard for GoF established in 2014. The rest is you assuming that they created sarscov2, which is also wrong.Peter Daszak from EcoHealth, convened 27 scientific experts to promote the natural spillover theory in the respected medical publishing - The Lancet.They published of their own volition, he didn't force them to Co-author, and there have been dozens of virologists more that have since confirmed it.Anthony Fauci utilized seven intelligence officers to refute the lab leak theory in the CIAs COVID-19 origins review to influence the public. According to whistleblower testimony, six of the seven initially concluded that the virus likely originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. However, these six individuals were allegedly offered substantial monetary incentives to alter their conclusions to favor uncertainty or a zoonotic origin.This is speculation and is not sourced, I assume you have evidence of the payments since at least 3 of the scientists have explained why they reversed their positions.Those who suggested that COVID-19 originated from a laboratory faced deplatforming or censorship. Facebook &amp; Twitter removed posts promoting the lab leak theory, labeling it misinformation. Media outlets &amp; public figures also dismissed the theory as a conspiracy, leading to the suppression of related discussions.Private companies can regulate their social media networks as they see fit. The Murthy case/congressional hearings showed that it was voluntary, Zuckerberg even admitted to such. The other issue is that it was misinformation, that didn't stop it from being promoted by members of congress and celebrities.Given these circumstances, how is this not the most egregious crime in modern history?\\nBc you've misunderstood the science and decided that something is a crime when it is not, and are still whining about being told you're wrong.The scientists conducted experiments to study how different versions of a coronavirus related to SARS affect mice that have been genetically modified to have the human ACE2 receptor (which the virus uses to enter cells).Among other features like DPP4, and several other ligand gate systems that were bred specifically for that experiment. The thing that made it RGEC and not GoF is that they used a chimera with swappable spikes, and did not alter the WT coronaviruses.","title":"Full list of Joe Biden's last minute pardonsDr. Fauci, Liz Cheney, more"},{"text":"Honestly how the hell do you pardon people just randomly.","title":"Inauguration Live Thread"},{"text":" Trump and his inner circle now have full clearance to do horrendous things and then do blanket pardons at the endThey would've done it anyway","title":"President Biden just pardoned five members of his family in his last minutes in office: his brothers Jimmy and Frank Biden; his sister Valerie Biden Owens; Valeries husband, John Owens; and Jimmy's wife, Sara Jones Biden."},{"text":"Should've pardoned Kamala's family too","title":"Biden pardons his family in final minutes in office"},{"text":"Biden Crime Family","title":"Biden pardons his brother James Biden"},{"text":"Does he really have to when he can just commit state crimes and nothing ever happens to him?","title":"Biden pardons his family in final minutes in office"},{"text":"Please do.","title":"President Biden pardons family members in final minutes of presidency"},{"text":"Good for him!","title":"Biden Pardons 5 Members of His Family in Final Minutes in Office"},{"text":"I wish he had done one for himself.

Guys gotta realize that we tend to do this to ourselves. I mean, not entirely. A lot of it is upbringing and extremely early social contracts, and a lot of that comes from a need to impress women, honestly. That shits hard to break from and will likely, on a societal scale, take generations if it can even happen at all. People need to see their dads personality and opinions and put that in the context of his life in the context of his society, and then apply that as an adult because like hell theyre gonna learn the weight of that as a child. That or social groups and organizations need to form with some real recognition of the issue so that men can be taught about this on a large scale so that actual social change can take hold. But right now those groups are Andrew Tate sponsored things so that needs to be overthrown and replaced with something that wont just aim to feminize the male social contract because thats just not going to see enough progress.And OP is right that the fire is fueled by people writing this situation off or blaming individual guys for it. Every lonely guy will occasionally (especially online) get their feelings and experiences dismissed completely, and that helps to create that vicious cycle that you mentioned, and right now all they have is misery or some hope like Andrew Tate or hardline religious thinkers like Ben Shapiro.Its complicated, and its not an issue that women should have to deal with.

Plenty of women are single and lonely, but you dont hear about it because they arent blaming men for their loneliness epidemic. We invest that energy into finding communities and friends. Hell recent studies say women are happiest single. I think a lot of that has to do with women having to do more emotional labor and duties around the home while also working a full time job. A lot of men and women also having very different politics now and for many women thats something they arent willing to compromise on. Find close connections in other relationships, like with your friends and loved ones. Learn how to love yourself and be happy on your own. If women can do it, men can too. Make peace with the fact you might not ever meet someone and learn how to build a full life without one. Then if you meet someone, great! But if not, you still have a great life. A partner cannot be a cure for loneliness, it only leads to dependency and control and resentment. Its better to be single than end up in an unhappy relationship that makes you feel even lonelier. Loneliness sucks and social media only makes it worse. Loneliness is not a gendered problem, but I think men would do better if they got out of these toxic echo chambers and form positive and supportive communities where they can feel comfortable being vulnerable and uplift each other. I think men should be allowed to vent and talk about the struggles of meeting someone, but it needs to not spiral into women only want 6 ft tall dudes making 6 figures nonsense.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Yes.","title":"Full list of Joe Biden's last minute pardonsDr. Fauci, Liz Cheney, more"},{"text":"Yes.","title":"Full list of Joe Biden's last minute pardonsDr. Fauci, Liz Cheney, more"},{"text":" Trump is a divisive figure but it doesn't help when people purposely twist what he's saying to construct false narratives when there's plenty of real content to use.I don't think \\"this has been debunked\\" needs replying to, but as for this part - the truth is the opposite.

These people should be condemned in the strongest terms. Trumps statements praised the former and rejected the latter.

According to whistleblower testimony, six of the seven initially concluded that the virus likely originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. However, these six individuals were allegedly offered substantial monetary incentives to alter their conclusions to favor uncertainty or a zoonotic origin.Those who suggested that COVID-19 originated from a laboratory faced deplatforming or censorship. Facebook &amp; Twitter removed posts promoting the lab leak theory, labeling it misinformation. Media outlets &amp; public figures also dismissed the theory as a conspiracy, leading to the suppression of related discussions.Given these circumstances, how is this not the most egregious crime in modern history?The scientists conducted experiments to study how different versions of a coronavirus related to SARS affect mice that have been genetically modified to have the human ACE2 receptor (which the virus uses to enter cells).What They Did:1.\\t??Created Viruses C They used genetic engineering to make different versions of the virus.

You and many other may not like it, and for good reasons, but he was chosen by the people. You can argue that people are misinformed, misled, confused, whatever it may be, but THEY put him there, not the \\"government system\\".\\nRight now, neither party had a candidate that people resonated with. You need someone that a MAJORITY of voters can get behind. Harris was never going to be that, ever, and Biden unfortunately had his age show at the debates and this was also not generating any energy other than \\"please not Trump.\\" Democrats had no single person to rally behind. Trump, however, had already captured the energy of conservatives and was literally beloved by his core base, with others preferring him while not liking him. He had the energy and was making lots of promises (that likely won't be fulfilled) and told people what they wanted to hear.\\nAgain, the system worked as intended. People ran for president and the people chose. The options were just bad.\\nWhat we want are better candidates. Younger, more intelligent, more grounded in reality. But people have to chose them, and for the last 12 years people chose older, out of touch, candidates.

It took me over 50 years to really understand the link between age and wisdom.  For me it was learning that the world is so complex no good solution exists for major issues and anyone that thinks they know the right answer doesnt understand the issue.  Egomaniacs aside, as you age you care less about fighting for something to prove yourself right and are more accepting that you could be wrong.  You learn that mistakes arent the end of the world but the best opportunity to learn.  While some become locked in their beliefs with age more learn to accept their view of the world is not that of everyone else. Strong leadership and political skill take decades to learn.  I can now walk into a room of diametrically opposed factions, get them to find common ground and get them to work together.  I couldnt do this in my forties and it gets easier every year. There are counter examples of all of the above but were not talking absolutes here, were talking on average.  While I think we would be better off not having octogenarians as president, would a bunch of 35-45 year olds be inherently better?\\nThis part is less a direct argument for old leaders but it does have impact:The US government system is designed to move slowly.  I struggled for years railing against how little large organizations change and the bureaucracy of big government but consider the alternative.  Imagine the chaos if once one party took over congress or presidency they could rewrite hundreds of laws in 2-4 years.  Those politically opposed to the changes would likely win at the next election cycle and make their own hundreds of changes, many of which would be rolling back the previous changes.  It would be chaos!  You need government to move slowly so society can adjust to change.  Older politicians slow change.  While I think having a president that could die from old age while in office is a terrible risk the US is taking, the idea of people with only 3-4 decades of wisdom in that position has its own set of problems.","title":"CMV: America's government system is flawed and putting old men in office is just stupid"},{"text":"I wonder what prompted him to do that","title":"Biden pardons Fauci, Milley and Jan. 6 committee staffers in final hours of presidency"},{"text":"Yes.

Especially because it's unintentional, or frankly, people don't want the downsides of changing the policy. For example, in terms of the wage gap, how maternity leave interacts with our pay and raise structure plays a major role. But if you talk about changing that pay and raise structure (replacing negotiation/performance based rewards with structured equal ones, I.E union wage scales) people, even Progressives want no part of it.

He was not candid about the NIHs financial conflict of interest with vaccine manufacturers. He effectively appointed himself as the unquestionable source of Science and Truth regarding covid and the pandemic response. However, poor judgment, arrogance, grandiosity, dogmatism, and even dishonesty with the public are not crimes.Reasonable people can disagree, but in my view disgrace and ridicule are the best punishments for a pompous, self-important figure who craves honor and glory.Important to remember: a pardon for federal crimes (of which the clearest was perjury in sworn testimony to Congress, which apparently would go before a jury drawn from residents of Washington D.C.) would:* Not prevent prosecution under any US state's (or foreign country's) criminal law;\\n* Terminate the pardonee's 5th Amendment right to refuse to provide (federally) self-incriminating testimony;\\n* Enable a more complete truth-seeking procedure (including enabling prosecutions of organizations and people who made more money from Fauci's misconduct than Fauci himself);As Dr. Marine details in his 6th point out of 7: 6: Fauci had many accomplices. Fauci as a phenomenon during the pandemic would not have been possible without a sycophantic corporate media which gave him an unlimited megaphone and never asked him a single challenging question. His widespread support among the US academic medical establishment allowed him to almost single-handedly define the narrow Overton window of acceptable discussion of the pandemic response. Anything outside of this confine lay anti-science, misinformation, and granny-killing. US academic medical leaders effectively followed him into a dystopian world of lockdowns, abridgment of basic rights and freedoms, censorship, and public health dogmatism. They failed to promote open discussion and debate of covid policies and in many cases quietly worked to suppress dissent.","title":"President Biden pardons Fauci"},{"text":"We don't trust most elderly people to drive, why the fuck do we trust them to run a country?","title":"CMV: America's government system is flawed and putting old men in office is just stupid"},{"text":"100%","title":"Biden pardons Fauci, Milley and Jan. 6 committee staffers in final hours of presidency"},{"text":"How's the narrative false?

Other people they could call on to grab a beer, play tennis, watch the game, and TALK. The older men in my lives have actual meaningful relationships with other men. They bounce ideas off each other, give advice, vent, laugh. I have dated many men who dont have that. They depend on a partner for all of that PLUS romantic partnership. That is asking a whole hell of a lot for one person. It also means if they arent dating someone they have no community or support.There is a trope these days that goes something like this:Husband plays golf for 5 hours with buddyWife asks how is John- is he liking the new job?

(Case in point, [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyShow/comments/1hxylmj/richard_reeves_of_boys_and_men_reframing_debates/) re: his recent appearance on the Daily Show.)I think this is due in large part to [identity protective cognition](https://informalscience.org/identity/dan-kahan/)/motivated reasoning. Pointing out that there are some systemic forces that *sometimes* punish men more than women runs counter to the narrative that men are the privileged class in *all* circumstances, which is believed by many. Highlighting how things have changed over the past 2 - 4 decades, and that some of those changes have disadvantaged men, threatens those internalized beliefs. It doesn't help that, in many circumstances, people making superficially similar arguments are toxic redpillers who want to roll back gender equality.","title":"CMV: The vitriolic response against the \\"Male Loneliness Epidemic\\" only makes things worse."},{"text":"Bingo","title":"Fauci Pardoned"},{"text":"Because Trump doesn't care whether or not he committed a crime.

I grew up with more girl friends than male friends, and thus indirectly experienced their dating history through them. The amount of dudes who are absolute creeps and weirdos... normal guys simply dont understand how dangerous and often vile and hostile the internet is towards women. No that is BS, you can't really be saying that all the depressed lonely men is because they're all incels. They're a very small percent of people and the biased selection of guys your friends dated (key word) doesn't represent a vast majority of men who are just trying to get by.My main issue is confusing the idea that men need female partners with the idea that women \\"owe something\\" to men or that it's their fault. It is no individual's fault (except for assholes which exist on all sides) but the result, in my opinion, of a growing virtual presence in social interactions (among numerous other factors). There has always been a similar dynamic (generalizing here) of women tending to be more selective than men in choosing partners. But things like dating apps have exagerated the difference 100 , leading to an increase in mostly male loneliness. Telling men to just be comfortable single doesn't make sense either. Not because it isn't good advice, but because that isn't the problem. Sure it's important to be happy by yourself, but we are also social and yes sexual animals. Social interactions and emotional/physical intimacy is one of many natural human needs; there are plenty of guys I know who are doing ok, pursuing their passions etc, but also feel lonely not having a close partner to share their lives with.If you are a woman saying things like that, how would you like to be single (no dating whatsoever) for the next 5 years? How about 10? 15? You might be fine with but I often hear takes like that from people who happen to be in relationships... just pointing that out so people have some more understanding in this discussion.I think a start, aside from long term tackling of harmful societal structures like patriarchy, would be deleting dating apps and touching grass more.

Theyre BLAMING that loneliness on women, expressing disrespect for women, and expressing entitlement regarding women, as if we were possessions.?I think that you are wrong about the percentage of just lonely men vs incels that talk about the male loneliness epidemic. Almost everyone I have seen bring up this topic on Reddit, eventually devolves into incel rhetoric.?Meanwhile, I think the problem here is something that you lined out in the beginning of your post wherein dating is supposedly some win lose game and you are seeing only to win if you get the girl. This is a toxic mindset anyway. People are not possessions, no matter what their gender and winning at life does not mean that you have to be partnered with somebody.Meanwhile, I definitely think its stupid to deny that the male loneliness epidemic exists. However, I do think that it is not that much of a difference in percentage between men and women who are lonely because what the men who bring this topic up dont understand is that women dont just wanna have sex. Women are equally lonely because what we want are different things and we dont have those things either.

A romantic or sexual crisis.Frame it as \\"women need to date men even if they don't want to\\" and it's an instant loser.But it's in large part a homo*social* crisis--a lack of deep friendship and emotional bonds between same-sex individuals. A hanging out and holding up your bros crisis, not a girlfriend crisis. The suffering of lonely young men is an emotional/psychological problem first and foremost. The key human need not being met is support, community and companionship, not orgasms.This could most easily be rectified by young men becoming emotionally bonded to each other as friends, helping each other emotionally and through life, and none of that needs involve women. The fear of being seen as gay is a big blocker here.That's also part of why it affects men more: Because women are allowed to vent/cry/be vulnerable with other women without being automatically mocked for homosexuality, a large number of women have tight communities who will support them in difficult times. This is why actually queer women have to specify the difference between \\"girlfriend\\" in the ride-or-die straight besties sense and their girlfriend.Women will generally have multiple close friends they can count on in a crisis. Imagine a breakup. If all of her friends can't support her, *some of them* can. Someone's going to show up and be sympathetic, as soon as she calls for help (which she's allowed to do, because she wasn't raised not to).Men, if they allow anyone to be close to them, only allow their partners.
