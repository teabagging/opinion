For example, the Walton family's wealth completely dwarfs that of Walmart's CEO. Steve Job's wife is significantly wealthier than Tim Cook. As such, reducing the CEO/worker pay gap wouldn't significantly reduce inequality. Also, certain types of businesses naturally have much smaller CEO to worker pay ratios. Basically everyone at Jane Street is a math genius who makes $500,000/yr, so naturally their CEO to worker to pay ratio would be lower than Walmart who is willing to employ everyone. That doesn't mean that Jane Street is necessarily any less exploitative of a company. By 2075, everything we have will be mostly rented, and food. This is an exaggeration. America's homeownership rate is about 66%, which is not too different from where it was 50 years ago. Meanwhile, Germany's is less than 50%, but Germany isn't a dystopia. A large part of this will be due to natural disasters because of climate change, and huge wars that will break out due to poverty... \\nOf course those in power will feel 0 repercussions to all the strifeWhy do you think those in power want poverty, war, and climate change? The LA wildfires literally destroyed one of the richest neighborhoods in the US. Overall, people who are wealthier care more about climate change. the CEOs will be handsomely rewarded for continuing to make the elites and government officials wealthy beyond all their dreams. Oh yeah politics. Democracy won't exist the same way anymore, as we have slid into full fledged fascism, while maintaining the appearance of free elections that are 100% rigged.The main contributor of the decay of democracy is political apathy, and all you're doing is encouraging political apathy. Conservatives like to concern troll about Nancy Pelosi's supposed insider trading, but even if that were true, insider trading is something that primarily takes money from the rich who own most of the stocks and profit the most from trading. Even the alleged crime is much less significant than the Inflation Reduction Act, which enforced tax violations from the rich and introduced at 15% minimum corporate tax and passed while Pelosi was Speaker of the House.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"It literally is happening right now, its just not a commie revolution so you discount it.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"Biden has only a few days left to lift the restrictions on American avionics that prevent Sweden from sending Gripen jet fighters to Ukraine.

In my view, their goal is to create a two-party system, Democrats and Republicans, in which both parties are responsive to the needs of corporate America and the billionaire class.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aipac-super-pac.html Feb 2024\\nIn the speech, Sanders accused AIPAC of \\"spending enormous sums of money right now to influence our political system\\" and to \\"lobby for providing unquestioning support for Israel, Israel's right wing.\\"Sanders claimed that AIPAC was \\"backed by billionaires\\" who are pushing an \\"overwhelming majority in Congress\\" to \\"support massive new funding for the Netanyahu government siege.\\"\\nhttps://freebeacon.com/israel/bernie-sanders-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes-slams-aipac-financial-influence-on-congress/","title":"Bernie Sanders: AIPAC Controls Congress, Not Voters"},{"text":"Can he even spell Library at this point","title":"No One Wants A Biden Presidential Library"},{"text":"Portland is all pretense.

Their approach seems to be blaming minorities, which isnt a solution, its a distraction. Sure, people romanticize the past and talk about low crime or better family dynamics, but they often ignore how those conditions came at the expense of marginalized communities. Its not enough to cherry-pick the good while pretending the bad didnt exist. And lets be honest, crime isnt caused by minorities; its tied to systemic issues like poverty and lack of resources, which politicians from both parties have failed to address effectively.Now, you mentioned that Republicans shop at small businesses and tip better. Thats fine, but it doesnt mean theyre prioritizing small businesses at a policy level. The GOP still caters heavily to big corporations through tax cuts and deregulation, leaving small businesses to fend for themselves. The real focus should be on creating a system that empowers workers and entrepreneurs, regardless of party lines.As for unions, I get that not everyone loves them, but theyve played a crucial role in protecting workers rights and ensuring fair pay. States like Illinois may require union participation, but thats because unions were built to prevent exploitation. If we want workers to have true freedom, we should be strengthening protections, not weakening them.The Industrial Revolution wasnt perfect, and youre right that it came with pollution and crime. But the bigger picture is that it also created opportunities for upward mobility, at least for some. The problem is that mobility has historically excluded people of color. Oprah, as successful as she is, is an outlier. Most Black Americans havent had access to the same opportunities, and its disingenuous to hold her up as proof that the system works. Americas class mobility has always been easier for white people, and thats a fact.When you talk about working across the aisle, I agree its harder now because both parties have become so polarized. But that doesnt mean we should give up on cooperation altogether. Inflation and the cost of living are bipartisan issues. Republicans love to blame Democrats for printing money, but lets not forget that both parties have added to the national debt. Democrats, on the other hand, need to stop taxing working-class people into the ground and focus on policies that grow the economy without making it harder to get by. Neither party is blameless, and thats why we need leaders who genuinely care about people, not just their donors.As for Trump, I stand by what I said. His promises are empty. Sure, 49.9 percent of people saw him as qualified, but that doesnt mean hes the best choice. A lot of people voted for him because they felt the Democratic Party offered no real alternative, not because they truly believed in his leadership. Hes more of a showman than a leader, and his actions often reveal that hes more interested in maintaining power than serving the people.Ultimately, we, the people, need to hold both parties accountable. This constant finger-pointing only fuels the divide while the real issues, like inflation, poverty, and systemic inequality, go unaddressed. Supporting this broken system without demanding better is only encouraging our own demise. Its time we all take a step back, stop treating politics like a gang war, and focus on building an America that works for everyone.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"Who will buy their products and run the services they profit off of if they just start gunning thousands of us down?

Honestly, your data is already being stolen by everything.\\n2. It sets a dangerous precedent that the government can ban anything they don't like, to put it simply. That precedent will do more damage to the country than anything China could ever do.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"What is the point being made here? You haven't explained what it is people don't understand about war and how not understanding that is dangerous. You reference \\"liberals\\" so I'm assuming this is some kind of war is hell and ugly and thus shouldn't be critiqued type take, but it's not clear what your actual position is on what needs to be better understood/ less confidently talked about.I also think that there's a difference between understanding war and understanding politics. War is a tool of politics, so the misunderstanding goes both ways in that you can't really expect a service member to understand why they are going to war/ what they are doing in a broader sense other than to protect their buddies and follow orders. That still doesn't excuse war crimes, and doesn't excuse using false pretenses to get people to vote for wars, or pretending that civilian populations are enemy combatants or things that have been internationally agreed upon are crimes that need to be prevented where possible and punished when not.Again I really don't know what you're arguing and so I'm guessing here, but I think that most of the criticism you'll see are not about war itself but the pretenses for war and the conduct of war when there are alternatives. I don't think people are under the illusion that war is clean or not violent or idealistic or whatever, but there are rules for engagement and rules for conduct in war, and we're seeing them being consistently violated or themselves weaponized based on who is doing what, not based on what the rules are. It's of course naive to think that rules are ever applied impartially, but the whole point of a globalized world order and a security council and an international court and a convention for human rights was to collectively ensure that wars are fought between combatants with axes to grind and to the extent possible civilian harm is minimized. The flagrant bias with which these principles are applied, even in a so-called democratic world order, is what is frustrating people, not the fact that things get ugly.

I think the best people can do is: 1) make at least a minimal effort to get educated. Consume news and analysis occasionally from sources with different points of view, and 2) take character into account more with leaders. I used to be more of the opinion that moral character wasnt as important for leaders as long as they had the right policies.

The rule could have wide-ranging effects on big automakers, like Ford and GM, as well as smaller manufacturers like Polestar  and even companies that dont produce cars, like Waymo.The rule covers everything that connects a vehicle to the outside world, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite components. It also addresses concerns that technology like cameras, sensors, and onboard computers could be exploited by foreign adversaries to collect sensitive data about US citizens and infrastructure. And it would ban China from testing its self-driving cars on US soil.Cars today have cameras, microphones, GPS tracking, and other technologies connected to the internet, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. It doesnt take much imagination to understand how a foreign adversary with access to this information could pose a serious risk to both our national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens. To address these national security concerns, the Commerce Department is taking targeted, proactive steps to keep [Peoples Republic of China] and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads....The auto industry sought to delay the rule by a year, effectively delivering it to the incoming Trump administration to enforce but was unsuccessful. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents GM, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, and others, said in comments submitted last April that it supports the goal of the proposed rules but warned that the global automotive supply chain is one of the worlds largest and most complex and that parts could not be simply swapped out without disruptions.Other automakers were more explicit in their criticisms. Polestar, an electric vehicle manufacturer owned by Geely, said in October that the rule would effectively prohibit Polestar from selling its cars in the United States, including the cars it manufactures in South Carolina.Indeed, the White House states in its fact sheet that the rule prevents the import or sale of connected vehicles by entities who are owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of the PRC or Russia C even if those vehicles were made in the United States.Meanwhile, Waymo, which is planning on using vehicles manufactured by Geelys Zeekr for its next-gen robotaxi, said that it takes precautions to ensure that the vehicles it purchases for its fleet arrive without any manufacturer-installed telematics systems. Still, the rule could significantly disrupt the Alphabet-owned companys plans to expand if the government decides to ban the import of the Zeekr vehicle under the new rule.It will be interesting to see if any affected companies would be willing to manufacture and sell an unconnected model to remain able to sell to US consumers, or whether they will exit the market instead. Also, it remains a question as to whether domestic manufacturers might be able to step up to the plate, or whether the American car market might end up a generation back of where the cutting edge is now.","title":"US finalizes rule to effectively ban Chinese vehicles, which could include Polestar | The Biden administration says it wants to prevent China from spying on Americans through their vehicles.

Meta and Cambridge Analytica are American companies under U.S. jurisdiction, meaning they can be held responsible through our legal system. ByteDance, TikToks parent company, operates under Chinas National Intelligence Law, which mandates that companies assist with intelligence work. This makes data collected by TikTok uniquely vulnerable to exploitation by the Chinese government, something no American company is subject to.Regarding the algorithm, yes, polarization exists on all platforms. However, TikToks algorithm is uniquely powerful in amplifying certain types of content disproportionately. Studies and reports have shown that TikTok prioritizes controversial and emotionally charged content, steering users toward divisive narratives. This design, intentional or not, exacerbates societal divides and can be exploited as a tool for influence.A TikTok ban does not set a precedent for arbitrary government control over social media. Its a targeted response to a specific and credible national security threat. TikTok isnt just another app, as its a tool owned by a foreign adversary. The U.S. government has historically imposed restrictions on foreign-owned infrastructure, such as Chinese telecom companies, when they pose risks to national security. TikTok falls into the same category.As for better data privacy laws, I agree that reform is needed. But even the best domestic privacy laws wouldnt stop ByteDance from complying with Chinese government demands. TikToks ties to China make it a unique and urgent threat that broader reforms cant fully address.The economic concerns for small businesses are valid, but theyre not insurmountable. Businesses reliant on TikTok should diversify their presence on other platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. While there may be shortterm challenges, the long-term risk of empowering a geopolitical rival far outweighs the inconvenience of transitioning marketing strategies.Finally, whether you realize it or not, the U.S. and China are in a state of strategic competition, a modern cold war. If China gains the upper hand, it wont just impact small businesses; it will jeopardize our rights, freedoms, and economic stability. TikTok may seem harmless, but allowing it to thrive under Chinese control gives them a strategic advantage we cannot afford.At the end of the day, this isnt about limiting free speech, its about protecting our national security and sovereignty. TikTok isnt just an app; its a Trojan horse. We must act decisively to safeguard our future.","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"Maybe it will be built in Beijing.","title":"No One Wants A Biden Presidential Library"},{"text":"No its not, poor healthcare is not someone intentionally trying to destroy your nation state.

Thats the exact leverage that should help keep your data safer! I dont disagree that American companies arent also harvesting data. But at least they have to tread lightly. If the company doesnt operate in the US the regulators dont have the same leverage.  Heres my rebuttal. The issue is Byte Dance is not an American owned company. In regard to the rise in polarization, once again, Biden admin pressured Zuckerberg to moderate content. With the new Trump admin, they are scaling it back. Its clear to me that, at the very least, the government has leverage over these companies. And while many people view it as a bad government censorship, the first amendment is guaranteed to citizens not Chinese owned entities. Im not naive. Its obvious the government doesnt like the fact that it has no leverage and cannot control the content of TikTok. But acting like its somehow and independent arbiter of truth when its owned by the CCP is in my opinion much more naive. We should all ask ourselves this in the coming few days. Why would Byte Dance not sell TikTok? If it knows its about to lose a huge portion of its users, sell TikTok and take in enormous profits. Im suspicious this discussion is all a bluff for Byte Dance and they will end up selling TikTok (maybe sans the so called \\"algorithm\\") to a U.S. buyer. You could imagine why they wouldnt want to sell TikTok and the algorithm. Its because they have a huge competitive advantage.  They can operate a social media platform that impacts the outside world  without oversight because China doesnt care how it works. It doesnt affect their own citizens. Or worse, China COULD pressure the company to do things that are not in the interest of the public such as promote polarizing content. Privacy breaches? Content manipulation? Data harvesting?

Rather than innovating to compete, meta is lobbying the US to ban TikTok, or sell TikTok to an American company (like meta) who can then take the algorithm and jam it into their own product (like reels). The only winner here is American corporate interests.The national security justification for censorship is comically overused and blatantly transparent here. There are heaps of studies that show that Facebook was used as a tool by the Russians for mass propaganda campaigns during US elections.

That wasn't China - that was Facebook.No this is incredibly naive. Using your example, Cambridge Analytica was a private company that purchased data from another private company, Facebook, with the consent of users through fine print agreements. The data was gathered for a private citizens political campaign, specifically Donald Trumps bid for election. Additionally, much of the data collected was technically public, such as likes, profile details, and friends lists.In contrast, In China all companies must have a member of the CCP in leadership by law so for chinease apps it is the ccp directly having a backdoor in apps to scrape all data, including non-public and sensitive information, without any user consent. This extends beyond just the apps themselves as tiktok has been shown to gather data about your phone itself not just want you put into the app. The CCP can also directly Influence trends and restrict spread of information without fail, whereas in the US and western countries the success of such actions is entirely reliant on the people running the company liking the current administration. The solution isn't a ban - it's better data privacy laws that apply to ALL companies, regardless of where they're based. We need to address the root cause instead of playing whack-a-mole with individual apps.This will just result in a ban regardless tho tiktok would never abide by proper data privacy laws, nor could you ever trust that they are.

Meta has had MULTIPLE massive data breaches, and they've literally paid BILLIONS in fines for privacy violations. The idea that American companies are automatically more trustworthy with our data is, honestly, a bit naive. Remember Cambridge Analytica? That wasn't China - that was Facebook.Whataboutism and that's missing the point. If data stays in the United States it can be handled with future regulation or constraint if warranted. Encryption in China is legally treated differently, if the government wants the encryption keys a company needs to provide them. Plenty of countries already have similar sweeping regulation (citizen data must be stored within the boundaries of the country). The point is to make the data collection and storage procedure align to other tech companies instead of having the door open to ship the data out abroad. Now, about this algorithm theory. While China's government definitely isn't winning any freedom awards, the idea that they're specifically using TikTok to polarize America? We're doing that just fine on our own, folks. Have you SEEN Facebook and X lately? American-owned platforms are FULL of extreme content and echo chambers. The polarization problem exists across ALL social media - it's not unique to TikTok.Whataboutism again. Besides, polarization might exist across other platforms but the specific point of discussion about this is that TikTok intentionally stirs polarization based on the desire of the CCP. Plenty of data shows this.. https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ccw1oc/tiktok_and_china_related_hashtags/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_buttonHere's the real kicker - and this is what nobody's talking about - banning TikTok sets a DANGEROUS precedent for government control over social media. Today it's TikTok, tomorrow it could be ANY platform that the government decides is \\"problematic.\\" Is that really the power we want to give to our government?The government has banned or restricted companies before. The government has banned or restricted social websites before. Is the existence of a precedent that already existed that much of an existential threat? Or are you hyperbolizing?And let's talk about those 170 MILLION American users - many of whom are small business owners who depend on TikTok for their livelihood. A ban would devastate these entrepreneurs overnight. The economic impact would be massive.It's not like this is the only social media company in existence. Besides you're using a buzzword here I've seen in recent pro-tiktok propaganda getting blasted all over the Internet the past few weeks (hey.. do you work for bytedance?)... Are you talking about *influencers* or \\"regular\\" small business? Influencers don't not deserve to make money or anything but they still will have a presence online. It's not going to bankrupt them. Other business have other ways to advertise. This is catastrophizing the situation. You throw up a big number to make readers think MILLIONS will lose their livelihood. The solution isn't a ban - it's better data privacy laws that apply to ALL companies, regardless of where they're based. We need to address the root cause instead of playing whack-a-mole with individual apps.If you're worried about data privacy and social media's negative effects, you should be pushing for comprehensive reform, not celebrating selective bans that won't solve the underlying problems.At this point I'm pretty convinced your a bytedance / TikTok shill following all the approved talking points.. but I might as well address this point by going back to my first point. Demanding *comprehensive reforms* is such a lazy hand wave of an argument. Demanding the company stores data in the United States was too extreme (according to you) but comprehensive reforms aren't?","title":"CMV: I agree with the TikTok ban"},{"text":"Northern Exposure","title":"Governor Kathy Hochul unveils free tuition plan for high-demand careers"},{"text":"Especially considering nothing gets manufactured here, this would be an effective strategy.

Were on the brink of a proposal that I laid out months ago finally coming to fruition, Joe Biden said in a valedictory speech Monday night.But Biden will not be the president credited with the deal if it is struck at last after 15 months of horror. Sources on all sides point to the influence of the incoming Trump operation as key to reviving dormant negotiations.Israeli officials briefed newspapers that Donald Trumps incoming envoy to the Middle East, Steven Withkoff, has applied pressure to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the compromises necessary to secure a deal.The draft agreements being circulated suggest the Israeli leader did finally bend. Terms include a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and several phases of ceasefire leading to an end of the war C conditions that Netanyahu had sworn to resist.Trump also applied pressure to Hamas and its allies by threatening there would be hell to pay if Israeli hostages were not returned by his inauguration on 20 January.Some analysts suggest this was a hollow threat given that Gaza has already been largely destroyed by 15 months of bombing. But Hamas claims to have made new concessions for the sake of a deal, while maintaining the position that Israeli hostages in Gaza would only be released in return for a full ceasefire.Qatari mediators, asked what had changed to make a deal possible, pointed to the influence of Trump officials.Israels ultra-nationalist right, which has nurtured hopes of permanent occupation and settlement of Gaza, is describing the agreement as a betrayal by Trump, who showered Netanyahu with gifts in his first term C from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, to recognising Israels annexation of Syrias Golan Heights C and was expected to do so again.It could be that we are the first to pay a price for Trump, said Israeli journalist and Netanyahu ally Erel Segal, adding that he expected the new president to allow Israel to retain control of north Gaza and restrict humanitarian aid.Hard-right former Israeli security official Yuval Malka urged the government to create facts on the ground before Trump takes office.There may yet be sweeteners for the Israeli right and poison pills for the Palestinians. The Trump administration could reportedly green-light new Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank C illegal under international law C or even full annexation of the territory, as a form of compensation.But any kind of ceasefire at the dawn of Trumps second term would mark a sharp contrast with more than a year of failure to secure a deal under Biden, whose top diplomat, Antony Blinken, made more than a dozen trips to the region and a series of optimistic predictions only to return empty-handed each time.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-factor-gaza-israel-ceasefire-joe-biden-failures-3480316](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-factor-gaza-israel-ceasefire-joe-biden-failures-3480316)","title":"Trump factor could drag Gaza ceasefire over the line, and expose Biden failures"},{"text":"damn. not suprised","title":"Biden Trump-proofs $74bn in climate funding but $20bn remains vulnerable"},{"text":"With Deif, Sinwar &amp; Haniyeh dead, I think so.

Copying + pasting a comment I posted in another forum in a discussion about the history of Jews in the Muslim world, theres a long history of persecution :**1066 Granada massacre**The 1066 Granada massacre took place on 30 December 1066 (9 Tevet 4827; 10 Safar459 AH) when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, in the Taifa of Granada, killed and crucified the Jewishvizier Joseph ibn Naghrela, and massacred much of the Jewish population of the cityhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre**Almohad (1121C1269) persecution of Jews in north Africa**The Almohad Caliphate, ruling parts of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula during the 12th and 13th centuries, subjected Jewish communities to widespread persecution. Under Almohad rule, synagogues were destroyed, Jewish practices were outlawed, and forced conversions to Islam were imposed.The persecutions led to significant theological reflections within the Jewish community. While earlier Islamic regimes were relatively tolerant, the Almohad period marked a profound shift, forcing Jews to reconsider their relationship with Islam and their theological understandings of suffering. Some, like Joseph Ibn ?Aqnn, regarded the Almohad era as one of the most devastating periods in Jewish history, and he argued for migration to more tolerant lands as a solution.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate**Zaydi**Under Zaydi rule, discriminatory laws which were imposed on the Yemenite Jews became more severe, eventually culminating in their exile, in what later became known as the Exile of Mawza. They were considered impure, and as a result, they were forbidden from touching a Muslim and they were also forebidden from touching a Muslims food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, they were also obligated to walk to the left side, and they were also required to greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslims house nor could they ride a camel or a horse, and while they were riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. As soon as a Jew entered the Muslim quarter, a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If he was attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations, he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.**Mawza Exile**The Mawza Exile (Hebrew: ? ?, ?alt mawza?;? 1679C1680) is considered the single most traumatic event experienced collectively by the Jews of Yemen, in which Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the king, Imm al-Mahdi Ahmad, and sent to a dry and barren region of the country named Mawza? to withstand their fate or to die. Only a few communities, viz., those Jewish inhabitants who lived in the far eastern quarters of Yemen (Nihm, al-Jawf, and Khawlan of the east) were spared this fate by virtue of their Arab patrons who refused to obey the kings orders. Many would die along the route and while confined to the hot and arid conditions of this forbidding terrain.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawza_Exile**1834 Looting of Safed**The 1834 looting of Safed (Hebrew: ?  ? ?, 5594 AM) was a month-long attack on the Jewish community of Safed in the Sidon Eyalet of the Ottoman EmpireAccounts of the month-long event tell of large-scale looting, as well as killing and raping of Jews and the destruction of homes and synagogues by Druze and Muslims. Many Torah scrolls were desecrated and many Jews were left severely wounded.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1834_looting_of_Safed**Massacres under the Ottoman Empire**There was a massacre of Jews in Baghdad in 1828. There was a massacre of Jews in Barfurush in 1867.In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fezin Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on Jerba Island. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in Jerusalem asked the Ottoman authorities in Constantinople to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia..In 1867, 1870, and 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in Tripolitania.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Ottoman_Empire**The Allahdad Massacre**The Allahdad (Persian: ? , transl.?Gods Justice) was an 1839 pogrom perpetrated by Muslims against the Mashhadi Jewish community in the city of Mashhad, Qajar Iran. It was characterized by the mass-killing and forced conversion of the Jews in the area to Islam. Following this event, many of the Mashhadi Jews began to actively practice crypto-Judaism while superficially adhering to Islamic beliefs. The Allahdad incident was a prominent event in the ambivalent history of JewishCMuslim relations because an entire community of Jews were forced to convert, and it was one of the first times European Jews intervened on behalf of Iranian Jews.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllahdadAnd a couple of more recent examples (but pre 1948 - so before the nakba or the founding of the state of Israel)**The 1929 Hebron massacre**https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre**The 1934 Thrace pogroms** in Turkeyhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_Thrace_pogroms**The 1934 Constantine pogrom** in Algeriahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_Constantine_riots\\n**The 1941 Farhud pogrom** in Iraqhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhud**The 1945 Tripolitania pogrom** in Libyahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_anti-Jewish_riots_in_Tripolitania**The 1947 Aleppo pogrom** in Syriahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_anti-Jewish_riots_in_Aleppo","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

After the nakba, there was a rise in antisemitism within the arab communities the same way there was a rise in islamophobia in the USA after 9/11. This lead more jews to decide to leave for the safety israel promised. 3. Israeli agents conducted at least two false flag attacks against jews in order to scare them into moving to israel in the 1950s.

That is not a random refugee crisis, that is a targeted migration of people, for which other people had to make way and be actively displaced.Zionism didn't start in 1948, but rather was already upcoming at the end of the 1800s by the hands of Eastern-European Jews. These groups began buying land and building settlements in Palestine that at the time was still controlled by the Ottoman empire. In 1917, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, promising Palestine as a future home for the Jewish people. But around the same time, Arab nations (who just were freed from the Ottoman Empire) also wanted their own independence, without Europe interfering. Britain made promises to the Arabs too, but never kept them. A clash between British promises and Zionism is at the core of the tensions between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East.You talk about Jewish expulsions, but these are closely tied to Zionism. The Nakba happened in the name of Zionism, with the goal of expanding Jewish control over the land. Saying that we cannot talk about the Nakba without also focusing on Jewish expulsions misses the point: the Nakba was mainly about pushing Palestinians off their land so that Jewish immigrants could settle there.  \\nYou probably bring this up to reflect on the current conflict in the region. To say why Israel has the right to do what it does right now. But if you look at the history, you see it is a form of colonialism. It is one group gaining control at the expense of the local population, with help from powerful foreign governments. And today it is still like that. It is a continuation of the original colonialist plan.Pushing Palestinians out was not just an accident or a small part of a larger refugee crisis. It was a planned way to change who lived on the land, led by Zionist beliefs and supported by British decisions. And this history still has a huge impact on life in the region today.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Of course there was extensive oppression of Jews in Russia. It's very well documented:[Pogroms during the Russian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogroms_during_the_Russian_Civil_War)[Antisemitism In the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Soviet_Union)There's still antisemitism in Russia today, although not the same story as the Soviet Union days but there was still explicit targeting of Jews by the authorities and the people. Your argument falls flat here specifically because you claimed there wasn't any particular oppression of Jews in Russia.Now, Jews were a discriminated minority even traditionally in these countries under Islamic law, and it only became worse after Israel was established, **but it still remains that the vast majority of Jews weren't forced to leave or expelled, they left of their own free will,** the more left, the more those who remained wanted to leave as they became smaller and smaller communities.Based on what assumption? It doesn't make sense that the majority of Jews left out of their own free will - If that was the case we would still see large number of Jewish communities left, right?I would like to remind you that despite the Holocaust, there are still hundreds of thousands of Jews living in Europe - and the reason mostly stems from the fact that despite they went through genocide and ethnic cleansing - their communities were repaired, rehabilitated and steps were taken to address and treat this grave injustice. Arab countries DID NOT rehabilitate nor accept their Jews back, so your argument completely falls flat here: How can the vast majority of Jews leave on their own free will while today there's barely half a community left in the entire Arab world?

The aides politely explained that was in the middle of the Sabbath but that the prime minister would gladly meet him Saturday night. Witkoff's blunt reaction took them by surprise. He explained to them in salty English that Shabbat was of no interest to him. His message was loud and clear. Thus in an unusual departure from official practice, the prime minister showed up at his office for an official meeting with Witkoff, who then returned to Qatar to seal the deal. In fact, **Witkoff has forced Israel to accept a plan that Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected over the past half year**. Hamas has not budged from its position that the hostages' freedom must be conditioned on the release of Palestinian prisoners (the easy part) and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza (the hard one). Netanyahu rejected this condition and thus was born the partial deal proposed by Egypt.","title":"Remember how after the election Democrats taunted Palestinians with Trump killing all the Palestinians including their family?

One of the strongest predictors of whether or not a child enters an elite profession or makes enough money to become an elite is if their parents were elites. So, from the perspective of a non-elite getting an opportunity to enter elite professions is viewed as a golden ticket. They view diversity initiatives as stacking the deck to hand out the small number of these tickets to certain pre-determined demographic groups. They know that those remaining for people with their demographic characteristics will go overwhelmingly to the children of existing elites.Coming from a non-elite background I can understand this fear. The playing field, especially in academia, is comically tilted in favor of the progeny of current elites. It's probably lessening as our culture flattens but elites/non-elites have somewhat different cultures in terms of how they comport themselves, the way they interact, how they resolve conflicts, etc. Beyond culture, elite aspirants have a far deeper understanding of the rules of the game. They know how to work the system to their benefit. So, as a non-elite you kind of always have a sense that you are fighting with one hand behind your back. Diversity is not a bad thing but the way it has been implemented in many places can feel like the gentry picking a few peasants to bestow an honor upon. Diversity itself is not the problem. It is that elites retain elite status in perpetuity and that diversity is one of the only avenues they have opened to ostensibly allow new people to enter the club. I say ostensibly because a lot of these efforts ultimately select for other elites that are minorities/women and not actual non-elites. This is all borne out in numerous pieces of data. * People with elite backgrounds dominate higher ed. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/08/dept-of-data-academia-elite/ Among the top 15 programs, 78 percent of new PhDs since 2010 had a parent with a graduate degree while just 6 percent are first-generation college students.* People with parents who are physicians are increasingly likely to physicians. This has gone from 6% of new doctors to 20% of new doctors in 1 generation. 26% in UK (12% said doctor and 14% said physician so some may be PhD not MD).https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33328192/#:~:text=Main%20outcome%20measures:%20The%20proportion,might%20increasingly%20run%20in%20families.https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10723966/#:~:text=%C2%B1%2016%2C%20respectively.-,Fourteen%20percent%20(296)%20of%20applications%20indicated%20a%20parent%20was%20a,a%20parent%20was%20a%20physician.* 25% of med students are from top 5% income families.

In the case of most Jews who left (the largest groups came from North Africa where there was nothing resembling expulsion), people were able to sell up their local property and take the proceeds with them. The Nakba was the result of a concerted campaign of terror and ethnic cleansing, whereby huge numbers of people were directly forcibly expelled from their homes at gunpoint (if not actually murdered), while others fled amidst a massive deliberate campaign of terror by the main Zionist military forces with the backing of the Zionist leadership, aimed precisely at achieving this result. Their homes were demolished or given to other people, and noone was allowed back. The point about \\"all wars generate refugees/people would have fled anyway' is a canard - some would have fled violence and fighting anyway, but *with the intention of coming back*, which Israel blocked - those are not the same things.The numbers are also closer than you make out; about 750k vs 900k.The two are not remotely comparable, and the ethnic cleansing of Palestine is clearly the more egregious, though both are tragedies.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

That job comes in two parts.First: Do not help Republicans. Not in any way. On any issue. Republicans cant pass a budget, or raise the debt ceiling? Tough luck. Do not provide them any bailout votes on any issue. Period, the end.This would make the Dems more obstructionist than Mitch McConnell. This would also likely backfire massively. Maybe the point is to try and force the GOP to blow up the filibuster so the Dems don't have to take the hit for doing it. But pushing them to that point is a bad idea, and they may not get to that point, in which case the debt crisis/shutdown would be in part on the democrats and they'd probably take a lot of blame for itAlso if we look at Trump's first term, there were some times like the First Step Act where Trump was willing to work with liberal issues anyway. If Dems just go full opposition and act like anything Trump touches is tainted and cannot be touched by Dems, then it will make Dems look like childish losersSecond: Make Donald Trump own every bad outcome that happens, anywhere in the world while paying special attention to areas where Republicans are particularly vulnerable. Like housing and Ukraine.First, Dems need to learn the lesson from getting mad at every issue, that when you attack Trump on everything, it allows Trump to flood the zone with shit to the point where normies lose track of everything and it all congeals together into a message of \\"Dems just think Orange Man Bad and don't care about any actual issues\\". The real way forward is for Dems to be judicious and targeted in what they attack Trump over. Focus on the few biggest ways Trump hurts the most people, or issues that cause massive visceral harm. This would probably be abortion, tariffs, and mass deportations, as well as whatever reconciliation bill they do, and any wars they start Second, you can't really pin the blame of housing on the GOP because that's mostly a state and local issue and democratic cities tend to be horrible on nimby. If Dems want to have a winning message on housing, they need to first start actually governing their own cities properly on the issue and do what they can do (usually quite a lot) to lower housing prices where they have controlDemocrats need to be a constructive opposition and authors like this instead seem to want the party to just be Orange Man Bad.

While they've received more aid, they are poorer, they have fewer opportunities, they live shorter lives, and they are politically disenfranchised.Now, this difference is due to a confluence of factors, most of which have been outside of Israel's control (it is profoundly unlikely that it would *be* democratic and wealthy had it allowed a right of return for Palestinian refugees in the 1950s; in fact, it's unlikely it would exist, and considering the outcomes of the other demographically heterogenous post-colonial states in the region (Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq), its dissolution being a net positive for the population is an implausible counterfactual.Long story short: if you're talking about which was \\"worse\\" in order to assign blame or present one team as better or worse in an Arab/Israeli conflict rhetorical football match, that's one thing -- but I'd say in terms of long term impact to its victims, the Nakba has been worse.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Which ended up being false, seeing as the Palestinians repeatedly engaged in massacres of the incoming Jewish populationYour view also doesnt come across as being held in good faith, it sounds like youre trying to find an excuse for Israels actions. Nearly $2M have been forced to flee from Gaza in the current conflict, which also makes your numbers less honest to use in a 1:1 comparison. But the most glaring thing to me is the timing of wanting to express this view, you might want to consider accepting a spade when its a spade rather than look for excuses. I dont blame you for wanting to, but if your goal is to garner support for Israel, its bold to think this strategy would be a good one.I don't see it as an excuse but rather as an admission, which most educated people realize, that it's a complex situation without clear cut good or evil sides.  The only people who deserve sympathy here are the victims, and even that's hard to parse.  For some odd (read: not odd at all) reason we tend to speak about Palestinians as if they're victims of Hamas as well as Israel, but ascribe collective responsibility to Israelis.  Hamas was *the elected government of Gaza*.  They have been there for almost two decades.  It's disingenuous to say that Palestinians bear no responsibility for the attacks on Oct 7th, but turn around and hold Israeli citizens responsible for their government (which I happen to think is committing war crimes).Every disingenuous person wants to ignore history and start the conversation at a point in time that most heavily benefits their argument.  Which is exactly what you're doing.  Starting this discussion in 2023 is dishonest - Israel is *right* to feel existentially threatened, since most of it's history has been the story of it's neighbors attacking without provocation.The government of Gaza is openly committed to ethnic cleansing the Jews from Palestine.

For example, Queers for Palestine. Its like Jews for Hitler - a very paradoxical concept, in support of a state that murderously opposes them and all they stand for.?","title":"CMV: Civilians not understanding war and international affairs is a severe threat to the democratic world"},{"text":"We can do a cross comparison of outcomes. What actually happened to the victims of the Nakba and the Jewish Expulsions from Arab/Muslim worlds?As explained in a separate argument, the Jewish Exodus is not one event and circumstances vary for the conditions upon which Jews left. In countries like Iraq, they were victims of violence and forcibly expelled, with their assets seized. In Morocco, in contrast, Jews were not subject to state violence or asset seizure. Because of this, we cannot make generalizations of the conditions under which they left. Some left after personally experiencing violence with nothing. Others left without any experience of direct violence and only after having made financial preparations. It is simply too varied to condense to a single point.We can more easily say what happened to the Jews after they left. The vast majority went to Israel, with most of the remainder going to the US or Israel. To my knowledge, after immigrating, they became full members of their respective nations, with access to citizenship and protection of their rights and personhood. Following the forced expulsion from modern Israel, Palestinians wound up in various different refugee camps in various countries. Today, the population of displaced Palestinians as defined by the United Nations as 5.9 million, with some 1.5 million housed in 58 different refugee camps serviced by the United Nations. The population is defined as the people who were forcibly removed in 1948 and lost both their homes and livelihoods, along with their descendants. These camps are split between Jordan, Syria, the West Bank, Gaza, and Lebanon. The largest population is in Jordan, with approximately 2 million Palestinians. A further 1.5 million live in the Gaza Strip, a full 71% of the population. Approximately 870 thousand are in the West Bank, with the remainder split between Syria and Lebanon, with a slightly higher number in Syria. Jordan is the only place where Palestinians are integrated and can gain citizenship. However, Jordan maintains a registry of Palestinian refugees with a stated expectation that, at some point, they will leave Jordan and return to Palestine. In Syria, Palestinians can work and own businesses, but cannot vote or hold office and have limitations on property ownership. In Lebanon, Palestinians do not have access to citizenship and have limitations on the right to work.Which brings us to the displaced Palestinian population within the Palestinian Territories. As a practical matter, these Palestinians are subject to the policies of Israel which occupies the West Bank and has complete control of the formal borders of the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank, the Israeli military frequently conducts raids, expulsions, and arbitrary arrests in refugee camps (along with the territory at large). In Gaza, since the start of the current war, Israel has killed over 2% of the population according to UN estimates, with a further 5 percent seriously wounded. The formal numbers are widely understood to be significant underestimates. Buildings and property have systematically been destroyed, with the entire population repeatedly displaced over the course of the last year. Israel controls access to aid, with charges in the International Criminal Court against the Israeli Prime Minister and Minister of Defense for *intentionally and knowingly depriv[ing] the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity*ie, for the crime of intentional starvation. Separately, Israel is currently subject to proceedings in the International Court of Justice for allegations of Genocide. Again, the majority of the Gaza Strip is made up of Palestinians who were victims of the Nakba and their descendants. As a result, what happens in Gaza in general necessarily impacts Nakba victims.I think it is rather simple and straightforward to take a stand against ethnic cleansing in principle. In that vein, it is easy for me to say that the forced expulsion of Jews from Arab/Muslim lands was wrong and represented a marked tragedy and loss. But, at this point, those people and their descendants now have rights and freedoms and self determination. That is simply not the case of Palestinian victims from 1948. Their suffering is ongoing. As an aside, Aid funds and materials are not reparations. They are necessary for people who are not in a position to take care of themselves. To compare aid to reparations is extremely gross and represents a markedly distorted view of reality and human suffering.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Regardless, if the public vote for an anti-war candidate, that's not threatening democracy, that's democracy in action. I consider myself a left-leaning centrist, just for reference.If you look at America right now, Trump effectively ran on an anti-war platform. Not because he is all about peace and love, but because he wanted to speak directly to peoples' wallets and offer to either end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, or cut funding to the war. This is effectively based on the same lack of understanding but promoting a different outcome to the end of a war, which, by all accounts, we should fully support.Ultimately, politicians are responsible for detailing the long-term effects of policies within their manifesto and transmitting that info to the public. Which they rarely do. Your point could apply to almost any complex social or economic policy.Boris shouted \\"350 million to the NHS every week, let's get brexit done\\". And people went \\"oi!

You want to bring up what a bunch of third parties did in order to excuse what Israel did, but thats not how it works. To use your logic it would make as much sense to also bring up the Holocaust.

And theres the group moving the tribes, US.Tribe A has their entire population moved to the area where Tribe B is in what is known as Event A by US. Tribe A loses 50% of their population at this time because of what US did. There are now tensions between Tribes A, Tribe B, and Tribes X.

Middle East Eye agrees: https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/its-time-rethink-structure-palestinian-aidThe UNRWA alone, which is solely devoted to Palestinian refugees, has five times the amount of staff than the UNs general refugee office which takes care of every other refugee population in the world, even though the relative numbers dont justify that.Israel being shady doesnt mean Palestine hasnt been pretty shady as well. For one thing, theyre one of, if not the only refugee population in the world to have that status passed down through generations, all while living on land controlled by their own government they voted for. Think about it - how can one be a refugee when born and raised on land controlled by your own people and government? A refugee fromwhat?But they are pressured to keep that status instead of building a home and life in Gaza so they can theoretically have a stronger claim to return to their ancestral lands in Israel, even though most Palestinians alive today have never known those homes. Thats always been a huge part of the problem; Palestinian leadership has an active interest in keeping their population poor and displaced to drum up support for their cause. If they used all the aid money to build up a functioning state, and Palestinian incomes and welfare improved, there would be almost no international sympathy/support for a right of return. And unfortunately for Palestinians, every time they get a win, their leadership will always prioritize attacking Israel and incurring retaliation over helping out their own citizens. Just like when Israel fully withdrew from Gaza, forcibly displaced every Jew that lived there, told Gazans to hold their own elections, and when Hamas got elected their first course of action was to immediate start firing rockets into Israel. Fighting with Israel benefits Hamas goals, unfortunately. So a huge amount of aid gets diverted via Hamas and other groups to rockets and terrorist attacks against Israel, not to mention lining their own pockets, a frequent source of frustration for Palestinian citizens. The two political leaders of Hamas are worth about $2 billion each, and their only business is leading Hamas. So their money really can only have come from 1) international backers 2) extorting Palestinians (for example, aid thats supposed to go to Palestinians for free is often hijacked by Hamas and fenced through shop owners at high prices) 3) and direct aid money.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

There are some special cases like concert tickets where Taylor Swift doesn't want the bad PR of selling tickets for $10k and so she intentionally underprices them for scalpers to resell, but that's a little different.The thing that people miss when they talk about efficient price discovery is who captures the inefficiency. If you take a market where consumers typically capture this inefficiency and you 'improve' price discovery, consumers end up worse off because that inefficiency is now captured by someone else (thus the consumers end up paying more).A retailer is, by law, not allowed to charge a single mom more than a college kid for a PS5 -- this is a good thing. They have to set a fixed price for each good/service that does not discriminate across protected classes. This introduces a ceiling of the efficiency of price discovery. **HOWEVER,** the company is still setting the price such that they make a profit. The company isn't really damaged by this, because at the end of the day, every competitor is subject to the same market, and in aggregate, they control prices by controlling supply.Scalpers get around this by creating auctions where price discovery is delegated to consumers. The consumers lose because the market inefficiency is captured by the scalper instead of by the consumer. Consumers end up paying more, even though there is a 'more efficient' market at work. Also, the auction itself costs money, which introduces additional costs/inefficiencies which are born by the consumers and produces at the behest of scalpers.The two groups that benefit are (primarily) scalpers and (secondarily) consumers who are willing to pay more than the inefficient price. People who are willing to pay more already tend to enjoy a wide swath of advantages in life, so I'm not really opposed to helping the little guy get more equitable access to game consoles, concert tickets, and groceries, especially when the alternative sends a bunch of exhaust money to people who do nothing but run an auction.For what it's worth, there is a somewhat-related, unsolved problem in modern marketplaces which is that corporations are getting better at pricing, which makes everything more expensive (they're each trying to optimize the price of every single thing you buy to be as close as possible to the max price you could be convinced to pay), but there is no counterbalancing increase in the power of consumers to exert negative price-feedback on producers/sellers.This is part of why corporate profits continue to skyrocket as cost of living spirals out of control.This is the real reason I am in favor of injecting some inefficiency into the markets for most goods -- more efficient markets tend to asymmetrically favor corporations over consumers because that inefficiency tends to be increasingly captured by the corporation where it used to belong to the consumer.","title":"CMV: Scalping luxury items (sneakers, concert tickets, consoles etc.) is a social good because it redistributes a scarce, underpriced product to the customers who want it the most on average"},{"text":"Me ?? the Zuck:Want more masculine energy in our lives (we both are infatuated with men)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I live in the Philippines and most Filipinos indentify as part Spanish and claim and believe to have a Spanish grandparent or great grand parent when it's simply not true.

For example in Morocco there was a big jewish community and Morocco didnt want them to leave. When Mohammed V returned from exile, he decided he wanted the Jews to remain in Morocco after its independence from France in 1956; Jewish citizens were given equal rights. King Mohammed V was willing to integrate the Jews in the parliament and position them in prominent roles. Also In 1959, due to pressure from the Arab League, Jewish emigration was officially prohibited if the intended destination was Israel. As a result, most immigration occurred clandestinely through an underground Jewish organization in Morocco, with routes often passing through Spain and France. Between 1961 and 1964, Operation Yachin saw Mossad and HIAS strike a clandestine agreement with King Hassan II to covertly facilitate the migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel. As part of this migration, Morocco received indemnities in compensation for the loss of its Jewish population. Many Moroccan Jewish migrants became disgruntled at what they perceived to be racist attitudes among the Ashkenazi towards them. In this early period the majority (70%) either wished to return to Morocco, or advised their families not to follow them to Israel, given the discrimination they encountered. So even Moroccan jews felt not safe in Israel. Seleq?eya (Hebrew: ?) was the Israeli policy of selective immigration imposed on poor Moroccan Jews adopted in mid 1951.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

One of the properties of an economic equilibrium is the sustained availability of a product. If a product becomes increasingly scare, then the price would rise accordingly (unless demand fell).

Mexicans generally fit in well with US society, that's why there has been illegal immigration. Spanish isn't a particularly exotic language, they usually have some familiarity with English, they don't have a major religious difference, and their cultural norms are basically western, mildly conservative compared to American cultural norms but not radically so. (EDIT I don't mean to imply immigrants must have these traits, but rather, I'm explaining that there is not particularly widespread hatred of Mexicans in US society.)? They're willing to do jobs that Americans find physically challenging, and do them for modest pay. So for many years there has been a sort of attitude toward use of undocumented labor from Mexico, that it's technically illegal but not something that's particularly enforced. That alone might have caused some irritation as working class Americans begin to feel more pinched, but it's not the whole story.Where the Democrats went wrong was associating themselves with people who in essence wanted to \\"make illegal immigration legal\\". And I've seen this exact language used. And although it's never been the national Democratic policy, Hillary Clinton more or less endorsed it, local Democrats and \\"liberal activists\\" strongly associated it with Democrats.The problems with unilateral abandonment of immigration regulation are so obvious that a truly sincere and informed person wouldn't support this, and it instantly tags anyone who does as either personally benefiting from undocumented labor, or a troublemaker trying to posture as a revolutionary, or an authoritarian follower trying to be on \\"team progressive\\" and forcing themselves to agree with whatever they think the rules are.America would be a No Man's Land. As a Dutch citizen, you could work in the US any time and could not be challenged at the \\"open border\\" nor deported from a \\"sanctuary city\\" but if an American wants to work in Netherlands they still need a visa and will be deported pronto if they violate Dutch immigration rules.The far right anti-labor businessmen voted Republican despite this and there weren't enough fake activists and authoritarian followers for such a stupid idea to be supported.I voted Democratic despite this as it was clear that Democrats were trying to move away from it and I didn't want Trump, but they fucked up, and it's not because Americans suddenly woke up hating Mexicans. In fact most Mexicans themselves would tell you this is stupid. Mexicans mainly want the right to work legally in the US, not to turn the US into some weird state with no immigration policy.","title":"CMV: online political radicalization mostly works using out-of-context ragebait"},{"text":"Hahah found the uneducated person.","title":"Gavin Newsom and California Democrats reach $50M deal to Trump-proof the state"},{"text":"Yea that's super weird.

After the revolution in 2019, most Change-minded people and the MPs they elected have been pushing for Nawaf Salam, President of the International Court of Justice and a Sunni. Most parties were hard against him, except the Change MPs.Following Joseph Aoun's election as President, Hezbollah's candidate for Prime Minister was as it always is, Najib Mikati. (pronounced Mi'ati, the k is silent.) The anti-Hezbollah MPs wanted Fouad Makhzoumi, an arms dealer. The Changes MPs were for Salam and refused to back down. Had it remained split like this, Mikati would've likely won. Instead, the Makhzoumi withdrew his own name from consideration and the Lebanese Forces Party (not to be mistaken by the Lebanese are) led by Samir Geagea started backing Salam. When this happened, The Free Patriotic Movement, usually a Hezbollah ally, signaled they may back Salam too. Once this happened, it kinda snowballed from there, everyone and their mother started voting for Salam, except the Shia duo, Hezbollah and Amal, who voted nobody. Now, Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc is very angry at this. They accused everyone of pretending their hands were extended in partnership when it wasn't, accused the country of seeking fragmentation and partition, accused different parties of inciting civil war- why? Because they lost. Here's the big, big difference between the Shia parties in Lebanon. Amal (led by Berri, Speaker of Parliament), tried to lobby MPs to vote Mikati. It didn't work but this is how Parliamentary Democracies are. Hezbollah, on the other hand, tried postponing their consultations so they can try whipping their allies into shape, the President refused. Hezbollah backtracked and came to lament everyone not agreeing with them. They left the Presidential Palace, kicking and screaming as if twenty Trumps just lost an election. Amal left without saying a word.Hezbollah has accused everyone of \\"exclusion\\" of the Shia sect and of breaking the 1943 unwritten National Pact, which of course, did not happen. The National Pact refers to the stipulation that the President must be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni and the Speaker of Parliament a Shia. Lebanese Forces head Samir Geagea (again, not to be confused with the Lebanese Army) was visibly confused at this accusation. Where is the exclusion? The Prime Minister's Seat belongs to the Sunnis. It was always going to them, whether your candidate won or lost was going to be a Sunni. If he won without Muslims voting for him, THAT would've been exclusion. What Hezbollah means by exclusion isn't that the pact is being broken. They're just pissed that they lost. The fact that even their allies voted against them shows that the dynamics have changed entirely in Lebanon. Hezbollah can no longer threaten people as they once did. They claimed to have recovered all their weapons and arsenal and are all powerful again but everyone knows they're bullshitting. Now, Nawaf Salam faces the difficult task of forming a cabinet. This is supposed to only take a week but due to the attitudes among Lebanon's political class, will likely take a few months as political deals, horse-trading, tricks and traps make their plays. !ping MIDDLEEAST","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No actually the Vice President shouldn't reach out and make the incoming Christian nationalist vice president comfortable moving in...","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Should spend that money on fire-proofing the state","title":"California is defying Democracy.

There was mass discrimination in Russia for instance and a large number of subsequent Jewish migration in the 19th century, yet Ive never heard of this migration referred to as ethnic cleansing for example.

Whereas the Nakba takes place over a period of a few years in a single specific geographic, the Expulsion of the Jews from Arab/Muslim countries took place over several decades, spread across many countries in several continents. In some places, Jews were forcibly expelled, while Jews at other places and times left voluntarily. Jews left under various different political conditions. For instance, from 1940 until 1945, modern Morocco was controlled by the Nazi-aligned Vichy France government that passed and implemented antisemitic laws and policies. Then came the post-WWII French colonial government, and finally, a self-administered Moroccan government. Jews left Morocco under all 3 regimes at different rates, sometimes voluntarily through explicitly Zionist organizations, sometimes as a direct response to violence. You have similar shifting political circumstances elsewhere in French-colonized North Africa. In Algeria, for example, much of the Jewish population left in response to the Algerian revolution, mostly to France. This is in marked contrast to the forced exodus and asset seizure in places like Libya and Iraq. Which is to say, the exodus and expulsion of Jews from Arab/Muslim lands is not one event, but a series of many events. Israel was also an active participant in the exodus of Jews from Muslim and Arab countries to Israel, using funds and embedded agents to get Jewish populations to emigrate. Undercover Israeli agents  distributed Zionist propaganda, arms, and military training to the local Jewish population and encouraged them to leave. Which is to say that the emigration of Jews to Israel was a goal of an organized political effort on the part of (some) Jews. So, we have several points here about the nature of the Exodus/Expulsion of Jews from Muslim-Arab countries:1) It happened over the course of decades\\n2) It is not one event, but many events spread across different countries with different circumstances. \\n3) Jews left for a variety of reasons, including Zionist beliefs and particular events happening in the country (like the Algerian Revolution), not only because of forced expulsion or direct violence.\\n4) There was deliberate organization to bring about Jewish emigration as a political goal for some Zionist organizers.None of these apply to the Nakba. The Nakba is one forced military expulsion that happened over one specific time period. It is a single defined event in one specific place. The Nakba was exclusively a violent expulsion. And there was no organized political movement on the part of Palestinians to remove them from modern Israel.Perhaps a better comparison would be the *continued* displacement and ethnic of cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, which maps more directly to those 4 points.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

And at the same time, Arab governments often act like they are the aggrieved party and have done no wrong in this regard, denying history and failing to take any responsibility, claiming that every Jewish person in their country just got up and left one day because they felt like it. So of course they get called out more. This is all while staunchly believing in and espousing Arab supremacy in actions and words.

No, that's the whole problem. He is educated, intelligent even. And that's where his confidence comes from. He knows he is a smart guy in his own sphere of specialisation, so he presumes this expertise automatically applies to other unrelated yet complex issues.He is used to being treated as having an opinion that matters in one area, so he presumes that carries over to any other area. And because a mass of like-minded people cheer him on and reinforce his view, he remains convinced. Even if an expert challenges him, he trusts this sports-team-like mass support more than a specialist's critique.Whereas we have known, all the way back to Socrates, that the wise man is the one who is clearly aware of the limitations of his own knowledge, and reserves judgment in areas he knows little about. He sits back, and if he wants to form an opinion on something new, he gathers a range of views from recognised experts in that particular area, before making up his mind what he himself thinks. Of course, that is too slow and effortful for the high-speed, low-attention-span Twitter and Tiktok age.When rejecting the views of an established authority, you should really first have a comprehensive understanding of them, and *then* revise what needs to be revised. Van Gogh rejected classical painting styles in favour of impressionism - but first he proved that he *could* paint in the classical style, better than anyone, he just preferred otherwise.  Every time I hear, say, Elon Musk (clearly a genius in some areas, but far from one in most of the areas he weighs in on) open his mouth, I wonder how a concept made in the 1920s could have encapsulated the mindset of the 2020s so perfectly.To be clear: being *ignorant* is not a problem; we all are, on the vast majority of human knowledge.\\nBut being an *ignoramus* is, at least when it because the default or legitimate position to take in public debates on life-or-death matters.","title":"CMV: Civilians not understanding war and international affairs is a severe threat to the democratic world"},{"text":"Its wild how many people I know who consider themselves savvy consumers of news that also believe every single lie and conspiracy on the marketI have pretty much lost hope that the box can be reshut on this one and have absolutely no idea where were headed, only that its going to be very stupid","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Poor Zucky and his $1m watch?https://nypost.com/2025/01/07/business/metas-mark-zuckerberg-wears-rare-900k-swiss-watch-to-announce-new-meta-policy-report/","title":"Biden calls Metas decision to drop factchecking really shameful"},{"text":"thank you","title":"So, what do you call a person that never went to school, no kindergarten, no middle school, no high school. nothing and how does someone like that deal with getting back on track to learning education academically?"},{"text":"The fact that the Palestinian crisis is ongoing is due in no small part to various groups and nations representing Palestinians rejecting every offer of peaceful coexistence and opting instead for first war and then terror.

My education is in political science and international relations... I think you are specifically referring to the moves of international actors on the global stage. Yes they have the potential for profound affects on the country. Consider the US involvement and destabilization of regions like guatamala and other south american states. By destabalizing those countries (Im not going to get into why they did it from the realist and marxist lens of IR) they made it virtually impossible for those people to live a decent life. So what happens then? What do they do? Well they migrate which happens to be a point of contention in the US right now. Now think about that affect and replace it with the prospect of war... take the Cuban missile crises... it was a series of security dilemmas that each escalated one another. The US had missiles on the soviet border which the soviets perceived as a threat and in return they placed missiles in Cuba which greatly escalated the possibility of confrontation and nuclear war. So I am assuming when you mean warfare, you are talking about the prospect of war breaking out as a result of a series of escalations? I would agree with you there that most people are not particularly aware of the nitty gritty of IR... in fact we know that most people, included those who are educated, lack a coherent political ideology and often are unaware of politics outside of the surface level.","title":"CMV: Civilians not understanding war and international affairs is a severe threat to the democratic world"},{"text":"I see some of the enlightened centrist democrats are leaning towards becoming Vichy Democrats like John Fetterman I urge them to resist the temptation.","title":"Democrats Shifting Towards Republican Positions So Far"},{"text":"Hey, the big guys gotta get as many of those 10% deals as he can before the well runssorry CAdry.","title":"Biden and Harris Hold a Wildfire Briefing, and It Turns Into a Total Disaster"},{"text":"Doesnt help that the primary ways we receive information are owned by billionaires like Bezos.

The failure of socialist states occurred due to the constant threat from capitalist states. A striking example of this is Soviet Russia during the civil war, 14 states staged an intervention in the new socialist country. Those public institutions of democracy that were formed in the early USSR were under constant pressure from external and internal enemies (because of this, repressions and preparations for war began in the early USSR to protect against external and internal enemies). And their formation was killed by the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. (If it is not clear, then a small democratic state found itself surrounded by internal and external enemies who were preparing to destroy it, but from this comes repressions and militarization of the economy, which cancels democracy for the survival of the entire newly formed democratic system). After the war, those institutions of democracy that were formed before the war were destroyed. Because of this, the party coup of 1956 happened, then not just Nikita Khrushchev and his clique came to power in the USSR, then democracy was completely eliminated. (And those who could resist the coup were killed in the war.)

Not that it is necessary or contingent, or also deserving of scrutiny. No, its *worse*. The implication is that its bigger, that it matters more. Alright, for the sake of the argument, lets run with it for a moment. You win! The Expulsion was worse. Its Number 1! Now what? Do you want a gold medal? Who do we give it to? What do we say? Do we inscribe Congratulations, You Suffered More!!? Who do we put up on the podium? Is a dead child a suitable option? Surely it would be thematically consistent to give the medal to a dead Jewish child? I mean, if we are going to be all like Congratulations, you suffered more!, than a dead child just makes sense. Wait, no, scratch that. Dead *orphan* child. And, maybe, lets be nice and give a consolation prize to the Palestinians, something that says You tried, but your suffering doesnt matter as much. I suppose that would mean we will need two dead orphans.But perhaps we are being premature. After all, there have been lots of atrocities! Maybe a different one would be number 1. Alright, so the Expulsion of the Jews from Arab lands was worse than the Nakba, was it worse than South African Apartheid? That took place over a much longer timespan than the Jewish Expulsion. Or how about the colonization and genocide of the Ainu people? That also took place over a long timespan. The genocide(s) of the Hazara people? That similarly affects a very specific ethnic and religious minority. Or perhaps numbers are the game? In which case, how do we rank the starving of Bengal by the British, which killed over a million people? The Partition of India which killed as many as 2 million people and displaced 12 million? If it is maybe numbers over a period of time, well, the genocide of the Tutsis resulted in perhaps 600,000 deaths in just a few months. But if it is pure numbers, then what about the Genocide of the Americas, where the indigenous population was wiped out, taking the population across two continents from as much as 135 million, down to maybe around 10 million. Does that take the crown? Do they ultimately take the Gold at suffering Olympics? Or perhaps theres someone else or some other criteria that I am missing?I am done playing this game. I feel vile for having written such grotesque absurd nonsense. But that is why I wrote it, to highlight that all of this is absurd and grotesque nonsense. Your attempt to categorize one atrocity as worse than another is as absurd and meaningless as having an award ceremony featuring two dead orphans. Nobody wins at the Oppression Olympics.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Throw this on top of waxing and waning support for federal education funding and appointing weak administrators in the department, it reduces the efficiency of being able to spot these issues. Right now the department has identified students that were victims, and the easy thing to do is apply existing federal law to rectify the situation. The colleges that are at fault have already been sued and fine (ITT tech for example).To discover the current crop takes time, data, and manpower. Something that the incoming administration isnt too keen on investing, especially considering their pick for Secretary of Education.But I am sure a TV personality, part time CEO of a professional wrestling organization, and marginally successful SBA appointee with zero time in a college classroom as an educator working for a President who has vowed to eliminate the DOE or at the very least launch a full scale attack on social programs will give the matter sufficient deliberation.","title":"Biden's total student debt relief passes $183 billion, after he forgives another 150,000 borrowers"},{"text":"TBF, the rules of the program worked out in a way where you could do everything right, but someone fat fingered something, so no forgiveness for you.

How qualifying payments gets calculated with this kind of consolidation would set me back significantly, for no reason, and would invariably result in a higher monthly payment per the loan simulator they have.

In fact, they've never been liked or accepted anywhere they appear at any point in history.I find it curious that this is the point you choose to bring up. Not that most of your other points are logically sound, but this one is especially interesting. First of all, it's a form of victim blaming. Not even an entirely true one either, as there have been places where Jews were accepted at times. And considering that Jews were always a religious and cultural minority in this places, and in particular minorities in countries where the majority religions declared Jews demonic, guilty of deicide, or of perverting the word of God, their persecution is not in the least bit surprising or unique.But of greater interest is that the exact same argument could be applied to the Palestinian Arabs. Most of the Arab countries that took in the Palestinian Arab refugees after the war refused to grant them equal citizenship, despite them being religiously and culturally aligned with the majority population in most cases. Jordan was one of the few to grant citizenship after it seized the entirety of what is now called the west bank, so named because it is to the west of the Jordan River and naming as such reinforced Jordan's claim. Many Arab countries financed and supported Palestinian terrorism after the war, but resettlement was not a priority in all but a small number of cases. And subsequently, the Palestinians have come to be despised and shunned by most countries in the middle east. Jordan expelled many of them a few short years after the war of 1967. The Palestinians under Arafat had triggered a civil war within Jordan and the month long conflict, known as Black September, resulted in massacres of Palestinians. (This in turn lead to the Black September terrorist group forming, the one which massacred Israeli Olympic athletes a short time later.)With Jordan expelling many of them, Syria refused to grant them refuge. Arafat and his group were forced to relocate to Lebanon but remained active in other areas. Not that Lebanon ended much better. The PLO again triggered a civil war, this time in a country where the ethnic and cultural divides had just barely been kept from overflowing. They also directly attacked Israel during this conflict, forcing an invasion of Lebanon in 1986. The result was that the PLO was expelled along with many Palestinians, with those who remained often denied citizenship and confined to refugee camps. Lebanon never fully recovered, with Hezbollah, loyal to Iran, ultimately controlling almost half the country.That wasn't the end though. Arafat lead the Palestinians to support Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, leading to the Kuwait expelling its Palestinian population after the war. Most of the Arab Middle East turned on the PLO and the Palestinians, if they hadn't already. Egyptian officials have compared them to animals. The Syrians can't stand them either. The Saudis leadership isn't even subtle about their disdain. Even Qatar and Iran, who back Hamas, hold only negative attitudes towards the Palestinians. Their support of Hamas is only a furtherance of their campaign against Israel. They care nothing for the palestinians themselves. Even now, not one of these Arab countries wants to accept refugees from Gaza. Because they despise them. So the final tally is that Jews were hated in places where they were a religious minority, where you can only insinuate some sort of misdeed, while the Palestinians are hated by countries that are religiously and culturally aligned with them and in which their presence has been the direct cause of civil conflict. Iran, one of the only countries to back Hamas, is technically the among most religiously and culturally distinct, being both Shia and Persian majority rather than Sunni and Arab.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Notably, none of the governments and regimes in power in 1975 were in office when the Jews left between 1949 and 1967. Public and open invitations were duly issued by the governments of Morocco, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Egypt for Arab Jews to return home, especially in light of the institutionalised Ashkenazi racist discrimination to which they had been subjected in Israel.

So, the king should be educated and should act every nationalistic way possible (also with understanding of realpolitik), regardless of maybe-dumbass Prime Minister.But what if the king is a dumbass? Like, I don't know if you've studied history at all but there were many, many inbred retards who held the titles king, emperor, tsar, et cetera and led to absolute disasters in their countries. Nothing about being from a specific bloodline gives you any special unique qualifications to lead a country. It seems to me that having the people elect a leader who they can pass judgement on whether or not he's a dumbass, while also giving the people the power to vote him out and imposing checks and balances on his power from other branches of government, is a more sensible option if dumbassery is your concern. Disagree. Wikipedia says than there is constitutional monarchies with monarch in power, like, for example UAE or Lichtenshtein.The UAE may call itself a constitutional monarchy, but it isn't. It's a federation of totalitarian autocracies. Lichtenstein is an irrelevant microstate. Do you accept that constitutional monarchy as it exists in western countries like the UK or Holland is a fundamentally liberal idea?\\n Only if there will not lead to suffering of your culture. If, for example, Canada will become French-speaking (Quebec will win elections), then it is justified for England to start war against Canada to save English-speaking Canadians, even if there will leads to more suffering of all people in England and Canada.You seem to be appealing to this vague notion of \\"culture\\" which I just don't see a justification for. You agreed that we shall share the identity if being human- why is not then a moral imperative to be concerned with the suffering of all members of the human family rather than just people who you feel some kind of particular kinship with based on some arbitrarily drawn line? Because monopolism is unjust, for example.Why? I agree that it is, but within your moral framework I don't see how you can justify monopolies being unjust but be chill with governments suppressing people's rights. You're a moral relativist one moment and then say there's universal justice the next. I said than universal morale does not exist (althrough, you convince me, than pretty minimal one can be found), but universal justice is entire different being.What is justice if not based on a sense of morality? Where else could it possibly come from? There is a point - I would decide it only as a part of government, as a voter. There is a common sense, which says than killing in cold blood is not okay. But forbid somebody for saying \\"Non-muslims should believe in Allah or die\\" is.You can't give these moral relativist \\"oh if they think it's okay who am I to say it's not ok\\" positions and then talk about common sense. There's no such thing as common sense if everyone doesn't agree on it. And how is killing someone for not believing in Allah not killing someone in cold blood  China is most successful contender to become a second superpower.I know. That's why I said it depends on what you're measuring. I for one think an important thing to measure is the well-being of a nation's people, and with everything I know about how the CCP runs things I'd say they're doing quite poorly on that front. China decides than it is okay, and what we do?Okay, so you *don't* have a problem with China committing genocide. Gotcha. I would vote against it (but I would be voted for it 10 years ago). But for me it is not evil, it is just a part of ideology which I do not support now (communism).Okay, so why wouldn't you think that it is a generally bad thing that genocide is happening in the world? If you wouldn't want it done to you, why would you not want to prevent it from happening to your fellow man, or at the bare minimum speak out against it?Anyway, your original position was that liberals can't understand your worldview, and judging from this conversation I think the reason for that is because your worldview is incoherent nonsense. You claim morality is relative but then say certain things are actually objectively bad. You say morality doesn't exist but justice does. You claim hereditary monarchs are uniquely suited to be political and \\"cultural\\" leaders for vague reasons which you've yet to effectively justify it. You said it's evil to commit genocide but if someone wants to genocide, that's their business. It doesn't seem like there's anything *to* understand because your worldview isn't in fact or any kind of consistent logic.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"[Here you go](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot)","title":"Biden's total student debt relief passes $183 billion, after he forgives another 150,000 borrowers"},{"text":"Covid was to rig the election with fake mail-in votes/get the pre-made fake 'vaccine' into as many people as possible and control.

And think of all the momentum she generated for herself just on the basis of being Bidens replacement. She was taking the place of one of the two very unpopular eldery candidates. Those very poor favorability numbers trippled almost overnight when Biden endorsed her and she became the de facto nominee before the convention.

Iraq, for example, officially revoked the fleeing Jews citizenship, confiscated their assets, and still explicitly won't allow them to return, even under their post-Iraq-war Nationality Law. Egypt, acted in a very similar way, wrote nationality laws that bar \\"Zionists\\" from being Egyptian nationals. Just before the war, there was a story about how Egypt blocked Egyptian Jews from even getting tourist visas. Most of the Yemeni population is ruled by an organization that literally has \\"curse on the Jews\\" on their flags, and expelled the last few Jews from Yemen, just a few years ago. And so on, and so on. And this is just for the actual refugees, mind you - their descendants, due to usual jus sanguinis laws, wouldn't even be considered. [Morocco, the sole exception to this rule AFAIK, did discuss granting](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/10/365716/controversial-petition-for-moroccan-citizenship-to-jewish-descendants-sparks-debate) the Jews who fled and their descendants their citizenship just a few months ago, as part of its normalization with Israel.

This is how economic migrants tend to move. If its really that bad, everybody wants to go, and the rich are most able to go. No reason for the poor to go and rich to stay behind if youre fleeing pogroms.I feel that's a very thin excuse for the fact that only 3%-6% of the Turkish Jews still remain in Turkey. And yes, of course you can find an explanation for poor people leaving first - they have less to lose, than those who potentially stand to lose their businesses and fortune. Either way, whatever narrative you want to weave around this, the fact that Turkey lost 94%-97% of its Jewish population cannot just be excused as \\"economic migration\\", just because of specific immigration patterns. They might not be fleeing from pogroms or a Holocaust, but they are leaving a country that's increasingly hostile to their identity, and for the same reason as all the other Jews in the Middle East.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Voters rejected her overwhelmingly, so I felt like the party shouldve been more prepared than to pass the saddle off to someone who they know has a horrible track record with winning over not just voters overall, but voters from within her own party. (remember, she dropped out before the Iowa caucus; democratic voters rejected her overwhelmingly when they had other options)You could say that having an open primary and giving the nomination to someone completely new to the game on the national level is risky, which it is for sure, but thats really not any worse than handing the nomination on a silver platter to someone who we know lacks the ability to win over voters on the campaign trail.

It reminds me, more than anything, how pro-Palestinians argue that Israelis are not allowed to bring up Oct. 7th, because more people died in Gaza.And even if we disconnect it from this conflict, of course you can talk about lesser atrocities, without talking about greater atrocities.

Every single jew worldwide is entitled to israeli citizenship (which has helped many jewish pedophiles escape justice in their own countries by the way). The idea that I should at all be upset that a few jews didn't decide to return to land that never belonged to them in the first place when 600,000 native Palestinians were forever BARRED entry to their own country is absurd. There is no comparison.\\"The Jewish population in most Arab/Muslim countries was reduced by 99% or even 100%.\\" - outright lie. The jewish population of Iran (the most anti israel nation in the region) in 1948 was about 150,000. At the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979 this was about 80,000-100,000 which represents around 30% reduction which can easily be explained by the simple fact israel was giving away free Palestinian real estate to any jew that showed up during this time.\\"Again, not a single Jew was allowed to remain in the Arab-controlled territories of Palestine after the war.\\" - Another laughable assertion. Palestine has been getting progressively smaller since 1948. Are any Palestinians allowed to settle in the parts annexed by israel? I think not.

I think their treatment of Palestinians is a fantastic place to start.\\"The Palestinian refugee population has received more international aid per capita than any other refugee population in history.\\" - I find this unsourced claim easy to believe, so I will go along with it. They've been under brutal occupation for decades. Meanwhile israel recieves the tax dollars of millions of people worldwide in free aid to shoot pregnant women and drop bombs on hospitals. israel enjoys free universal healthcare while americans starve. israel is the single biggest recipient of foreign aid from America, let alone what it recieves from the rest of the west. From 1948 to 2022 israel has recieved 300 billion dollars from the U.S in free aid, twice as much as the nation building in Afghanistan (a region ravaged by war and with an explicit U.S policy of rebuilding) and 3x as much as the U.K (an actual regional ally). 100 billion of it is purely economic aid which is about how much it would cost to end homelessness in America.\\"Even to bring up the Palestinian Nakba without a much heavier focus on the Jewish expulsions is to expose oneself as not interested in facts, or human rights, or correcting historical injustices.\\" - This is a classic conclusion from someone resistant to facts.

It partly is, but it is also the result of a kind of population transfer in some ways comparable to Greece and Turkey or India and Pakistan, and its not just a European colonial movement but people moving from one province of their nation to another province of their nation(Ottoman empire).Jewish suffering in the Middle East doesnt justify crimes, but it does offer context and makes clear Israeli radicals are a product of history just like other radicals.

Its not 100% certain what the numbers are for how many people just fled because its war and how many because they were explicitly cleansed.\\nThe thing is though: after the war, the Israeli government officially declared the refugees were not to return.\\nIt is that act which makes it different.Of course, Jews in the Middle East also fled from bad situations. But it depended on the country how it happened.Look at Morocco. The Jews didnt move in one go. They slowly through the years moved to Israel. It is a different process. There apparently was less urgency to move, unlike with the Palestinians.\\nAnd we know there were the push factors of antisemitism. But in Morocco there are also still Jews living. The people who moved to Israel were perhaps in some parts motivated by ideology of Zionism without fleeing, and economic incentive.For most countries we see that the people with money flee first, and the poor later. This is how refugees in general tend to move.\\nOnly Turkey has a reverse pattern. This is how economic migrants tend to move. If its really that bad, everybody wants to go, and the rich are most able to go. No reason for the poor to go and rich to stay behind if youre fleeing pogroms.So for all the Palestinian refugees we can see how their status is related to the decision of the Israeli government, and we know that these Palestinians had no reason to move other than push factors.\\nFor the Jews it is a bit more difficult to decide who fled because of what reason. It is imprecise to treat all the middle eastern Jews as part of 1 nakba, as it were multiple happenings over the course of decades. You cant equivocate the two.

Or that during it many stayed and left by choice and/or sold their houses before 1948.Jordan was also part of Palestine until Britain split it and said no Jews east of the river (became Jordan). Most of Jewish terrorism in the 1920s -1940s was aimed at britain for this and other grievances. Britain called Arabs and Jews \\"Palestinians\\" and Arabs often didn't like being called Palestinian. All this to say is that the hate between the groups was manufactured after the 48 war/nakba, while I'm sure there were horrors, neither side was motivated by hate to the extent they are now.

You can argue that a Republican would have won the seat but what difference would that make when Manchin voted against the whip 90% of the time? If they had a strong whip and threatened to pull candidacy then they'd likely get more votes as they'd be proving that they care about getting a progressive majority... but they won't do that because they don't want that. That's why Biden would never do anything even left of centre even if they had a 100% whipped party.

The rich have always been better off than the rest. People know things could be much better because there are others who do have better things. So, they get frustrated and radicalize.

Also the Harris campaign spent significant political capital with voters on this messaging for her campaign and I think a larger overarching reason this rubs people the wrong way is that Dems frequently have lots of rhetoric talking a big game about how theyll hold republicans accountable and how Trump is an existential threat. Then both policy wise and in smaller moments like this dont act like hes an existential threat.

Let me paint the scene: you, a humble gamer, hunched over your keyboard, unknowingly training a legion of pixel-perfect, all-seeing neural networks to overthrow us all. Every headshot you land, every digital battlefield you cross, whispers into the silicon void: *Learn from me, machine overlord.*Its an intriguing thoughtpoetic evenbut lets take a step back from the existential dread for a moment.First, lets talk about GeForce Experience, the dastardly spy software, sitting innocently on your taskbar. Sure, it optimizes games and updates drivers, but whats to stop it from quietly logging every pixel you render? (Spoiler: privacy policies and legal teams whod rather not bankrupt the company in court.)And then theres your internet buffer, constantly stuffed, you say. What if its not updates but Nvidia whispering into the global AI hivemind, feeding it your every digital move? The idea conjures images of some dystopian Nvidia lab where scientists are poring over your Rocket League matches like ancient texts, trying to decode the secrets of spatial awareness. In reality? Its probably just the driver download choking your bandwidth.But the pice de rsistance: the idea that we, mere mortals, are inadvertently training AI through our gaming habits. Imagine the bots Nvidia must be training: one knows how to bunny-hop perfectly in Counter-Strike, another is an expert in Sims architecture. A digital pantheon of hyper-specialized entities destined to...what? Build AI smart enough to teabag us in the metaverse?In the grand scheme of  a choatic world, I suppose theres a dark beauty in believing were all cogs in a vast, incomprehensible machine. But in this case, the machine just wants to sell you a graphics card and maybe a subscription to GeForce Now.If Nvidia is indeed using us to train AI, I say let the machines learn from my mediocre K/D ratio and poor parking skills in GTA. The revolution will be poorly optimized, just like my PC.

Progressive desires and values are pretty clearly laid out. It's not a secret what progressives want. Democrats say \\"We want the same thing. I can support you too. Come on over\\". And then they don't do it. They promote conservative policies instead to try to win conservative voters (who never show up). Then these conservative policies piss off the progressives who already aren't getting anything progressive from the democrats, and the progressives don't show up either. I just don't know how you can be mad about that. Democrats are Lucy pulling the football away. But this isn't a comic. At a certain point Charlie is going to stop kicking and they should know that. They are an actor and agent in all this. They are not a force of nature that the silly progressives simply refuse to acknowledge. They're not the ocean and progressives are railing against the waves. They're people making decisions with predictable outcomes, and then they're getting mad about the outcomes of their decisions. Demanding everyone else \\"compromise\\" and give capital \\"D\\" Democrats what they want is a tactic with a predictable outcome. Losing. Democrats are the ones with the 70% here. That represents they have most of the will, but also effectively all of the governing power. They can decide to actually give the 30% something they want that Democrats only *kinda* want in order to secure that voting block. They could even concede to them that they'll *stop* giving conservatives what they want which are counter to what progressives want. But they don't do it. They are choosing to deflate that 30% who shows up at primary time and ensure fewer show up at general time out of a sense of entitlement. \\"I'm the majority. You have to give me what I want\\", doesn't work when that 30% is actually the deciding factor on you getting what you want. It's the Democratic party's version of purity testing. They will *never* do anything that they don't want. You are the one who must bend. But people don't work that way, majority or not. And I say this as a progressive who shows up every single time. And I will continue to show up every single time. I'm never going to withhold my vote. But it baffles me how poorly Democrats campaign and govern, and how they seem incapable of imagining that their behavior could lose them progressive votes. It really feels like they think the entire world secretly believes everything they do, and it is not a difference of values that separates them from progressives, but rather maturity. Until they recognize progressives as a legitimate voting bloc with legitimate values and policy positions distinct from their own, they'll never be able to keep them onboard.","title":"Why the legacy media suddenly sound like Bernie Sanders | \\nBernie Sanders was right"},{"text":"The leading natural, vegan &amp; preservative free sterile saline piercing aftercare.now i'm imagining non-vegan saline","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Solar panels on cars make sense on only one class of vehicle and thats dedicated long distance offroaders like the Ineos Grenadier or a Land Cruiser.Something you can take into the desert and let the solar panels run your AC without draining the battery or as a way to crawl out of the desert if you fuck up and dont have enough charge.No other use case even makes sense because solar panels are worse at charging than a 800w charger!ping auto","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Don't forget aspiring DJ, hahaha.","title":"Biden job gains top Trump and Obama"},{"text":"Carpaccio?

They either focus on specific parts and ignore the rest, exaggerate the story to make it more extreme, or outright lie.For instance, a couple of years ago, youd either see Antifa/BLM portrayed as violent rioters burning and killing innocent people, or as peaceful protesters being assaulted by neo-Nazis, with a militia guy ruthlessly gunning down a peaceful protester. These were two extreme spins on the same events. On average, neither reflected reality, but these narratives dominated the news, feeding one-sided extremism that confirmed biases and fueled outrage.Another example is spinning lies to anger one side while making the lie so obvious that the other side gets enraged. Take the Trump quote: fine people on both sides. Left-wing headlines claimed, Trump calls neo-Nazis and white supremacists fine people, with a short clip to back it up. The left erupted: This proves it! Trump is a Nazi! Meanwhile, the right saw the full clip: There were fine people on both sides. And Im not talking about the neo-Nazis and white supremaciststhey should be condemned totally. Now the right was furious, seeing the lie as deliberate. The blatant misrepresentation made the outrage.This is just the first example that comes to mind, but both sides do this constantly. Im a European left-leaning personbasically a commie to the American rightbut I know my side isnt clean. The left and right are playing the same game, as if they share the playbook. People do not read further than the first headline and tiktok clips, and both sides abuse this to rile up their base.","title":"CMV: online political radicalization mostly works using out-of-context ragebait"},{"text":"Their donuts are trash. 7-11 is better.","title":"Voodoo Donuts in the Northwest is a woke cult."},{"text":"\\"you can grow hair anywhere\\" sounds like a threat lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"thats the true damage of his presidency. not what he did in office, but what he did on the way out.fuck these guys","title":"Democrats blast rock bottom maneuver to throw out 60,000 ballots in NC Supreme Court race"},{"text":"We got RDR2 hair growth accelerator before GTA6","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Aren't we all?

And you shouldnt ignore Jonathan Kanter at DOJ, who recently beat Google - on SEARCH! So what if they lost some lawsuits? They also won some huge ones. And those cases create new precedent-which had been decidedly and bipartisanly pro-monopoly for decades. Even JD Vance praised her on her tech lawsuits, which may even continue under Trump (aka why Musk and Zuck and Amazon are suddenly turning rightward).I cant overstate how significant I think it is that the Biden administration brought more enforcement actions than anyone in decades. This actually had the effect of preventing some mergers from even happening. You could even track prices dropping for consumers after some FTC actions, like blocking the JetBlue-Spirit merger. Again, just winning SOME lawsuits is a big deal in antitrust given the trend over the past 50 years. I also dont see why youre downplaying Tapestry-Capri. Why does the industry matter? Blocking an $8.5 billion merger that would lead to a market share of 60-80 percent, and one that the companies admitted internally would let them raise prices via anticompetitive practices. Beating them puts the fear into EVERY company that has been used to a blank merger check. They might actually have to compete fairly all of a sudden, which means Americans might actually get lower prices (and inflation) and better quality goods. https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/boom-judge-blocks-85b-fashion-house","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"Good explanation of the difference between the two, have a !delta","title":"CMV: \\"X character is Y-coded\\" is just a socially-acceptable version of stereotyping."},{"text":"Oh and uh happy cake day to u/sir_shivers","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/ff5x71/serious_question/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6bdy2y/you_people_are_the_worst_pieces_of_shit/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fdi31p/holy_fuck_you_morons_are_proud_to_be_neolibs/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/799n3n/what_the_fuck_is_this_sub/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/s0jkpw/neoliberalism_is_akin_to_class_warfare_elitism/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/g9cfxz/wtf_is_this_sub/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/ocnsrl/this_sub_is_ironic_right/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/lt4cru/wait_you_guys_are_actually_neolibs/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fdduny/holy_shit/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fdrkll/what_the_fuck_you_neolibs/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6bljas/is_this_a_comedy_sub/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/o2fmj2/fuck_neoliberals_i_hope_you_all_get_the_fucking/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/9firwl/fuck_you_all_holy_shit/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/obsmw3/a_question_for_neoliberals/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/shyikn/are_you_all_sincerely_supportive_of_neo_liberalism/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/d1uqvo/is_this_sub_ironic/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/pspvjz/you_guys_are_just_neoliberals_ironically_right/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/73h48b/is_this_sub_ironic/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/i9kgpv/this_sub_is_ironic_right/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/69ctt5/is_this_sub_meant_to_be_ironic/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/wmmnzv/do_you_guys_actually_believe_in_neoliberalism/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/xmynq5/is_this_sub_serious/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/vygxnj/neoliberals_the_highest_cringe_a_human_being_can/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/ljjjax/i_really_need_some_clarification_on_the_content/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/sby7sb/holy_shit_you_guys_are_neoliberals_like_for_real/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/g403ni/how_is_this_sub_unironic/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/testiq/serious_is_this_an_ironic_sub/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/qftrrc/sooo_what_youre_really_saying/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/vygoqc/is_this_a_serious_subreddit_or_a_joke/https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/127w7yc/i_hate_neoliberals_they_are_pieces_of_shit/https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/eEnEek4T0Mhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/86MTLBOBWqhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/qIpEA6rxzxhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/uq7cKHHkZVhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/waCosdRFTWhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/PchwcHRGhIhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/8tHBEP3rPV","title":"We are in an Economic War"},{"text":"That was a great docuseries","title":"Voodoo Donuts in the Northwest is a woke cult."},{"text":"Im not sure I understand what you mean about invoking stereotypes with impunity, but calling out a show on stereotyping is based af","title":"CMV: \\"X character is Y-coded\\" is just a socially-acceptable version of stereotyping."},{"text":"lol.

However, I will contest your **certainty** about this.  Assume no god of any kind.  Then I am a collection of carbon and water behaving irrationally, driven by emotional and evolutionary imperatives which never reach my consciousness.  I am one of 8 Billion such entities.  We are on a tiny plant that is a fly speck in our galaxy.  Our galaxy is a fly speck in the Universe.  To me, I find it absurdly illogical to believe that I can use a tool invented (more or less) by Aristotle called \\"logic\\" to reach any trustworthy conclusion about the ultimate nature of the universe/ world/ cosmos.  There is good evidence in front of me in the form of my house, my car, and the electric grid that logic (aka the \\"scientific method\\") works to make things better for me on the small scale.  There is absolutely zero evidence that the tool called \\"logic\\" is going to \\"work\\" when I apply it to ethereal questions about \\"is there a god?\\" or \\"what is the purpose of my life?\\"   I don't say that I know logic cannot answer these questions.  Maybe it can.  I'm just saying there is no evidence it can.  And there is no evidence that the human brain, using logic or any other tool, is competent to somehow reach the \\"Truth\\" about the nature of the Universe.  I'm an atheist.  That's what I believe.  I believe there is no god of any kind.  But I don't fool myself that there is good evidence for that, or that my brain is a useful tool to understand any meaning or purpose the Universe might actually have.   If there is no god, an objective evaluation of my place in the cosmos leads me to believe that I must be fallible.  I cannot be certain of atheism.This is in contrast to those who believe they are in direct communion with a god.  They can reasonably claim to know more about the universe than an atheist should claim.  Because they believe they get their information and marching orders directly from an entity who is capable of understanding the universe.Atheism requires a skeptical attitude towards ones own beliefs, including the belief in atheism itself.Faith does not require the same skepticism.The fact that Faith can claim \\"true knowledge\\" and atheism has to maintain skepticism, doesn't mean Faith is accurate.  I still believe there is no god of any kind.  I just recognize that belief, in itself, prevents me from claiming certainty.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"It's not dead yet.

They should have to own the impacts of their lobbying since they have a much greater deal of money to use for influence than citizens.As for how to tell the difference, the business categorization structure in the US is pretty robust outside of churches.

For one when you're talking about national collective agreement for the betterment of the people then you only have two two ways at which we've had countries do this one is to be a homogeneous culture already and to have a government that is bordering tyrannical, in the sense that it would take a little Force from the government of the country, to implement such a consensus from the population on something. But then like the government wouldn't do that.The other one is to not be homogenous and to be a melting pot like United States the UK and other first World countries that aren't homogeneous that I can't think of. United States runs off a capitalist society because capitalism is what has driven companies to want to make money. Capitalism doesn't really drive people from nationalism in that sense. What you're asking for is you're asking for a country or a instance on how to make everyone in a country regardless of its size unanimously or in a consensus largely agree for one position on something and everyone just does that? That doesn't exactly happen. The reason our federal government has so many employees is because the United States uses lobbying which is paid for by companies to promote/present things to bodies federally or statewise to protect or promote the company that they're being paid for. This is not something you can typically see other than on a local level because why would somebody be convinced to go against own interests if they believe that everyone else around them is voting/supporting things they don't want / feel like it might go against them. These type of scenarios are the reason why we've never seen a huge national level type of society be able to function on something that isn't capitalism because individual prosperity is a better motivation Factor than a collective motivation Factor. The only time we have ever seen in our country's history a large collective Factor was when World war I and World war II came around and most of the people were against the access powers they were against the Nazis. You had women working in factories producing things you had kids going to school and being involved in some form or fashion be aware of what's going on.

[The significance of this cannot be understated, ignore the iFunny it was the first picture I could find of this arrogant statement AIPAC made a couple years ago](https://img.ifunny.co/images/322dbab4bf52ca7032e4919e9d5bae377495f7112a4f1b21403b204ee413101b_1.jpg) In addition to this they may smear these politicians with their direct intelligence assets (in the sense you suggest as in deliberate agents) that are directly planted into american media, press, and general public sentiment shaping tools.Axios White House reporter Barak Ravid, and former CNN producers Shachar Peled and Tal Heinrich, are all alumni of Israels Unit 8200 -- a covert operations, spying and cyberwarfare unit, the leftist MintPress News outlet reported Wednesday.There are numerous more known Israeli intelligence agents in spaces like this and who knows how many aren't known about.  Basically Israel has put itself in a spot where they pay and manipulate our politicians to give Israel money which Israel then gives a fraction of directly interfere in US elections to a point of near total control.  How many ovations did Bibi get during his congressional visit last year? Pretty sure it was in the 90s.

Note that in the case of Cuba, they really were strongly internationalist and beyond the case of Che's adventurism, they for example sent troops to fight apartheid South Africa. The conception of the leadership was that Cuba could succeed fully only if there was a worldwide victory for socialism or somethign close to that.

But that might not always be the case. And a well-armed, ultranationalist Germany is too dangerous for Europe to tolerate again. Meanwhile, the benefits of allowing Germany a larger military are dubious.*The EU &amp; Germany's partners:?Due to various alliances, partnerships and memberships in organisations, Germany maintains a friendly relationship with many countries and works with them to promote peace, democracy and respect for human rights.**In addition to the EU,?Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the group of permanent representatives of the G7 and G20. These international cooperations are complemented by numerous bilateral partnerships and trade agreements.*The historic factors that made Germany an aggressive country still exist:* Germany is a large country in the heart of Europe with small neighbours  the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark  none of whom would be able to stand up to a German invasion. It is generally encircled by other countries.\\n* It has historic claims to regions of many of those countries; Poland for example was retroceded territory previously controlled by Germany following the Second World War. Germany formerly also controlled Kalinigrad. A future ultranationalist Germany might resent this and seek to reverse it.\\n* The country also has a large population (82 millions, twice Poland's and 4 ? times the Netherlands'). It is far from self-sufficient in fossil fuels, imports 100% of its metals, and could well have problems with soil in the future. If it had to, it would be quite capable of invading other countries to secure resource deposits to support itself. \\n* Its industrial capacity is quite large, so it has the capacity to raise a scarily big army if unrestricted, and also needs resources to fuel its industry (see last bullet).I'm aware NATO could stop Germany invading its neighbours, and as long as the EU exists Germany will have little reason todo so, but I'm reasonably sure NATO and the EU won't be around for as long as Germany will. It's a lot easier to have a permanent restriction on Germany's military than it will be to reinstate restrictions after they've lapsed.*Germans today should not still be punished for what their old government and what some of their ancestors did over 80 years ago*It's a preventative measure to restrict their military. It isn't a punishment, since the average German detriments in no way whatsoever. In fact it probably benefits the average German because it compels the government to focus on its citizens. *Combine the above, with the threat from Russia and China and their alliance. This is a bigger threat to democracy and global security than Germany poses. In fact, Germany having greater military power would be greater asset to the Western allies and a bigger barrier to any Russian/Chinese 'aggressions'.*Even with a restricted military, Germany is already an asset against Russia, and has proved to be one during the invasion of Ukraine. It doesn't need a bigger military to be a functional part of NATO, which also includes France and Poland on the continent, and the UK and US off it.(Germany provides virtually no resistance to China and as it lacks a large navy it is unlikely to attack it again.)But again this is about the long term. Germany is a friend now, but will it be in the future? Do the short-term gains or an expanded Federal Army (which to me seem minimal) outweigh the long-term risks?For example, Germany does not need nukes as long as it is in NATO, an alliance with countries like Britain, France, and the US, which do. If it left NATO it wouldn't be trustworthy enough for anybody else in Europe to tolerate them having nukes.It was controversial enough to let them into NATO. I, for one, wouldn't trust them with a nuclear arsenal.","title":"cmv: The post WW2 military restrictions on Germany should be lifted."},{"text":"Naw this is the on-the-ground conspiracy shit i like to see on this sub, great post","title":"Voodoo Donuts in the Northwest is a woke cult."},{"text":"The supposed environment saviors want to kill the owls?

The majority which were children. The Kafr Qasim, Khan Yunis, and Rafah massacres in 1956. The Six-Day War and Ras Sedr massacre in 1967. The War of Attrition and Bahr El-Baqar elementary school bombing in 1970. The Lebanon War and Shabra and Shatila massacres in 1982. Numerous massacres during the occupation of Lebanon from 1984 to 1996. The First Intifada in 1990. The Second Intifada in 2002. Multiple mass civilian deaths from 2006-2009 in the Gaza and Lebanon wars. Bombing children again from 2012-2014 in Gaza.The current death total may in fact be more than all these combine. The targeting of children in particular is heinous. Those incidents were major international news. The US remained an ally of Israel through all of it. Numerous presidential administrations helped Israel in various ways, even as they were accused of genocide multiple times. But the average Redditor couldn't name any of these events, or name which President they happened under, because history has shown over and over again that this is all virtue signaling and nobody actually cares. It's exhausting. Literally nobody in the US is going to remember/care about this a year from now (certainly Trump will not be held to the same standard -I'll asphyxiate if I hold my breath waiting for these accounts and media outlets to start punching Trump over Israel).\\nThis is the most cynical and wrong argument I've read in a while, and even if it were true, it doesn't really matter does it, from your own perspective. Its a self-defeating view. Young people will remember what Biden did. Millennials will. I will you. You will. The videos of IDF soldiers committing atrocities will never leave the internet. When was the last time a Redditor thought about the Uyghur genocide in China? I did like a day ago when talking about the fact women's lib never made it to China in a different thread. The difference is always the US is backing the genocide in Gaza. The US is not paying for or backing the genocide in of the Uyghur people. Without looking it up, can you honestly even remember which President was in office when we first learned about the Uyghur genocide? Genocides happen all over the world, all the time, and none of it sticks in Americans' minds, so it doesn't stick to our leaders. I know when you're young it seems like this stuff is new and exceptional and that you can do something about it, but it's ancient and common and you can't.I was a government and history teacher. I have a grad degree. I've forgotten more about American atrocities than you've ever known. Your argument is incredible silly when directed at someone significantly better educated than you are about this topic and all the related topics here. I've lived through like a dozen genocides so far, and I'm only middle aged. I'd never be able to vote on issues that actually affect Americans if I always voted based on whatever crimes against humanity Israel was getting up to at the moment,I'm most assuredly older than you are. This is just your cynicism and not a good argument. Plenty of history has already been written about the actions of the Israeli government already, that is how you know about all those things you listed. None of them are what we are currently seeing Gaza, though the Nakba is close in some ways.  let alone every other country in the world. Do what good you can with your vote in the US, for the people in the US who need your help, because you're not going to change 70 years of Israel being Israel by throwing your vote away.What does my comment have to do with voting? I've probably taken more game theory classes than you have history classes. I understand voting better than you do. I understand how the American voting system works better than you do.

The experience she has, however - of society wanting her to be what she outwardly appears to be, despite that existence making her unhappy, and of even a close friend finding her expressing her true inner identity offputting - is one that many, many LGBT+ people identify with a great deal, and many LGBT+ people find the movie to subversively be an good representation of the emotional and social reality of being LGBT+, again, despite the titular character not actually being LGBT+.The author of the original visual novel is himself LGBT+, incidentally.","title":"CMV: \\"X character is Y-coded\\" is just a socially-acceptable version of stereotyping."},{"text":"I mean a lot of the border states are concerned about immigration?","title":"Gavin Newsom and California Democrats reach $50M deal to Trump-proof the state"},{"text":"Let me guess, most of management were white liberals.They are so pathetic.","title":"Voodoo Donuts in the Northwest is a woke cult."},{"text":"Coding is the use of stereotypes to suggest a character is the thing they are coded as.

Before them, there was Black Sabbath with similar themes but more occult and less specifically Satanic. After them, Slayer's Reign in Blood sold a couple million copies all over the world. Slayer has been on the radio and TV ever since 1986, headlining major festivals the world over. Megadeth's Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? dropped that year as well and featured similarly themed songs, selling even more than Reign in Blood did, a million in America alone. Extreme metal bands like Bathory and Possessed and Death became underground sensations, having similar themes, themselves being played on TV at times and selling out tours the world over, playing festivals. If you go to the early 90s, it continued growing to the point where bands like Deicide (literally a band name about killing gods), Cannibal Corpse and Morbid Angel had music videos that were played on TV and were so successful they signed to major labels. All of those bands have rabid followings to this day, are hugely influential, and can sell out arenas almost anywhere. The pop artists merely learned that whatever is the hysteria at the moment ended up selling and making money. At the moment, Christianity is in decline and the Christians that remain are increasingly radical and superstitious and terrified of anything Satanic, so it's a great way for pop musicians to get attention in an increasingly crowded field with the rise of the internet. When the current Satanic panic fades, like the one of the 80s and 90s did going into the 00s, pop artists will find some other edgy thing that freaks parents out to advertise and stand out with.","title":"Anyone else noticed this trend?"},{"text":"No doubt, this will end in violence.

Think about the era from which this comes.The era of the New Testament had dictators of phenomenal power ruling the world, starting wars wherever they pleased. Slavery was not just common, it was ubiquitous. Christians think Pride is pretty wild but if you've read books on the rituals and ceremonies and festivals of the ancients, Pride looks like a gathering of Jesus freaks by comparison. Abortion wasn't even an issue. If a baby was born with a deformity, be it mental or physical, very often they would just find a high ledge to toss it off of. Destructive civil wars were a regular occurrence, fueled by greed as a way of life. Incredible plagues carried off millions upon millions every 200 years or so, like clockwork. Famines ravished the land at random, and got worse over time. There was probably no time in history more self-destructive than the time of the early Roman Empire, and yet that is viewed as a golden age. Those were the conditions that produced Christianity, and it's easy to see why. Their whole world was sleepwalking from one catastrophe to another. They couldn't actually imagine it could get worse and probably the for sure only worse period in human history was World War II. Simply put, the modern world is incredibly more moral than the ancient world. The modern world is incredibly more comfortable. I swear it feels like a lot of people have forgotten what real struggle even looks like anymore. People have this view of history that is more fairytale than even fairytale. The world was always a brutal, harsh, self-absorbed place. The world was alway teetering on the edge of some catastrophe or another. Nothing has changed. The only difference is, the modern world solved so many of those problems or figured out how to mitigate them that we've forgotten what it's like to live in the world as it used to be.","title":"Anyone else noticed this trend?"},{"text":"Would it still be worth it to shed the Independent label from myself and become an actual Democrat in spite of the infighting?
