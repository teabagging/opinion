We're getting better at securing high propensity voters over the long term, but we need to get enough of them out to cancel the waves of lower-info reactionaries as future elections chug along.I'm frustrated it didn't happen in November, but the fact that we are still winning elections, and kept the house so close, makes it much more clear that we're dealing with a new type of electorate.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 8, 2025"},{"text":"Trump is following Putin's orders:Panama has a ban on Russian shipping: crush them.Greenland has a military early warning / defense base to protect the EU against Russia: crush them.Canada is a major oil exporter and competes against Russia's oil exports:  crush them.Trump is 100% being a dutiful puppet.

Yes you can push down inflation by slowing the economy (probably into recession) but the structural cause of inflation is not consumer spending its that there's good shortages in protectionism and high interest rates  will only buy time. You want an extreme example Russia has 21% interest rates and 9%+ inflation which looks likely to go up. Which leads to 2.\\n2. If the US is making a long-term bet on protectionism the whole point of protectionism is to stimulate domestic production. Raising interest rates (which works in large part by decreasing domestic production by raising borrowing rates) would be entirely contrary to that whole program and guarantee it will fail more than it already will. Now this leads to a debate\\n3. The American people voted to implement Trump's probably quixotic vision of protectionism. On a lot of issues, there is clear moral obligation for bureaucrats to try and protect communities that will be targeted who weren't able to choose that fate due to the majoritarian nature of democracy and opposition here is noble. However, I think the idea that the American people who all more or less have skin in the game when it comes to inflation should not have any say on economic policy and be constantly bailed out of their poor understanding of it by having bureaucrats implement the same policy regardless of what Americans vote for is more dubious in my opinion. Americans, myself included, should get what they voted for when it comes to inflation. This is both because it is democratic and because they should see how populist policies actually play out and no longer be able to hide behind the somewhat fair critique that these stupid policies have never been tried because of \\"the deep state\\"","title":"Fed officials are worried about the inflation impacts from Trump's policies, minutes show"},{"text":"Sadly will be too late for anyone to do anything.

Probably one of the closest and most integrated in the world. And while I dont know the actual numbers, Id be willing to bet that the U.S. pays a larger share. Protecting them from what?!? Russia. Who is being belligerent currently. Because any missiles sent our way will come over the North Pole and through Canada. Its off the cuff remarks that were not polished and were misrepresented by the media at large. Par for the course.Panama: we built the canal and gave it back to them. They are now charging us more than anyone else. Doesnt seem fair. Invasion is probably not the answer, but I imagine its more a starting point to make easing fees for crossing much more palatable.Greenland: I dont know what the thought process is here and why hes being so aggressive on this point. I know the U.S. looked at buying it after WW2, and I think they talked about doing it again in the 90s. The why of Greenland being important has to do with resources under the northern ice sheets countries on the border will get a piece of the pie. Countries without a border there (China) might seek leverage to get a border there. The U.S. already has a piece through Alaska. But Greenland doesnt really have the ability to fully exploit stuff there. But Canada and Greenland would give the U.S. a huge piece of the pie as it were and cut others out from making agreements with them.","title":"Trump Presser: Why We Should Not be Subsidizing Canada to the Tune of $200 Billion"},{"text":"Good thing she got that .25 Raven and an hour at the range trained by her boyfriend to hold the mightiest military mankind has ever seen at bay","title":"Proud Canadian is heading to the gun range to prep for an American invasion due to trumps dementia which will turn Canada into the next Ukraine"},{"text":"Totally agreed.

The US and Panama both accepted that outsource because at the time Hong Kong was a British territory.  They are no longer.So when Panama renewed the deal in 2021, because the company was now a Chinese company, they needed approval of the US that they didn't ask for.  China is controlling both ends of the canal which is a major security risk.Greenland is a similar situation.  China, which is 1500 miles from the arctic circle, has declared itself to be a *near arctic state* and have been working with Russia to establish bases and try to gain control in the arctic over resources.Greenland is actually in the arctic circle.

It was only this past election cycle, and maybe only in the last 2 months of the 2024 election, that MAHA became a thing, citing issues with American food production and how even the EU wouldn't take those goods. The implication being that EU regulations on food were better. This is also the type of issue that would have naturally been a Democratic position but now seems to be a Republican one, at least at the moment. That said, NAFTA, and its successor the USMCA, have been a thing since 1992 and for all the talk of America First, I don't think autarky is the goal. I think during the first Trump term and then into Biden's term, it was decoupling from China and now it looks like a new form of merchantilism. If the unipolar, post-Cold War world where America was the hyperpower is no longer true, we're moving into a multipolar world where regional economic blocks, between states of common values, cultures, and borders are going to become ever more important. But is that a modern conservative position?I don't know if a \\"conservative\\" would want this, but I also wouldn't have guessed that a \\"conservative\\" would've wanted celebrity, playboy, New Yorker Trump in 2016 or for the next decade. Though, to be fair to \\"conservatives\\", a lot of them fought Trump at first. Then, as they saw how the winds were changing, they changed their positions, though kept their labels. I mean, Trump is essentially pro-choice for refusing to endorse a national abortion ban, yet he's still backed by the pro-life people. I think a lot of things have changed in the political landscape and Trump has a bizarre ability to sell kooky ideas. Would \\"conservatives\\" come around to the idea of an economic union with Canada? I dunno, but the macro-economic momentum pushing nation states into greater economic unity is powerful. Better try ride its waves than try and stand in its way.

This like almost everything else Trump does is because he is vindictive. Canada decided they did not like him. Now he wants to use his power to get even.

On January 6, 2021, Trump failed in his attempted coup to stop the peaceful transition of power, through multiple efforts, and in the end, by inciting a violent mob to attack the Capitol. In 1923, Hitler attempted a coup that failed during the Weimar Republic. In 2022, Trump called for the termination of parts of the Constitution. In 1933, the German Constitution was repealed by Hitler when he passed the Enabling Act that gave the Nazis total power.  Project 2025, the plan Trump said he knew nothing about, but for sure does, wants to assemble an army of  conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State, eg, consolidate and put the entire executive branch under the direct control of the president under Article II of the Constitution. I have an Article II where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.Congress is supposed to be a check on the presidency. But what happens when the Presidents Party follows his every order and fails to follow their oath of office? Or what happens when a President flouts the Constitution and rule of law? The Nazi Enabling Act allowed Hitler to issue laws without the consent of Germanys parliament, laying the foundation for the complete Nazification of Germany. As John Oliver put it during a segment on Project 2025, conservatives are playing a game with separation of powers, of rock, paper, scissors, except rock crushes paper and scissors every single time. For those who read history, we are horrified at current events and that voters put this criminal back in office.

How do you turn the country with the second largest landmass in the world into a single state. The logistics make no sense. Youd have a landmass larger than the United States with the same population of California. Of the largest 30 cities in North America, there are 16 in total between Canada and the US. 5 of those are Canadian. That would mean a third of the 16 largest cities in the new US would be in a single state. Not to mention, I dont think most Americans understand just how ridiculously vast Canada is. It is mostly empty space, its almost all wilderness. It just seems ungovernable as one state. The bureaucracy would be mind boggling. How would anything get done. Our federal police would just, what, disappear? What would the budget increase be to hire on the amount of federal employees necessary to cover a state the size of Canada being added to the country? And then the provincial police would have to just conglomerate into one giant department? I also dont understand how the logistics of just swallowing a country would work on a financial level. For example, what would this mean for the Canadian bank that I bank with, for my mortgage and mortgage rates, for my car loan and credit card debt, if Canadian currency is no longer Canadian. And dont even get me started on what this would mean for organized crime. If the largest shared border in the world suddenly disappears, what do you think happens? Organized crime syndicates across the states would RACE to set up shop up here. Guns flooding into a country where most citizens dont have them, and where firearm legislation has only become more strict as the years have passed? Sounds like an absolute disaster. I know Im overthinking all of this, but its just so dumb that I cant help but think of how disastrous this would hypothetically be for everyone, aside from the mega-rich American corporations that want access to Canadian resources.

Consequently, Canadian food procurement and shipping depends extensively on the relationship with the US as well as other American countries. Go to a Canadian grocery store, and you're primarily looking at food produced in the US and Mexico. Further, this would have massive negative impacts on Canadian food production. Dairy is a huge and highly protected industry in Canada, and Canadians pay a ton for very poor-quality domestically-produced dairy. Stick us in the Eurozone and the protectionism goes away, which means domestic dairy production is completely undercut. The plus side being not paying $15 for a single ball of imported mozzarella, but the downside being a massive loss of Canadian jobs and, likely, a massive increase in the price of domestically-produced and distributed dairy products (milk, yogurt). This applies to a range of other Canadian prestige and artisinal agricultural industries (wine, for example) which will be massively undercut by cheap imports from Europe.Furthermore, while Canada likely would not increase their food exports *to* Europe, they would still be stuck adhering to EU food production regulations, which are pretty onerous and don't really have any real impact on food safety. These all make sense for small scale agricultural production (as is typical in Europe) but not for large-scale production (as is common in North America). So, the cost of producing food in Canada would very likely go up, which would further increase Canadian grocery bills. This would also mean that Canada would be stuck *not* importing food from the US which does not adhere to EU regulations, which would create serious issues for Canadian food security and drive the cost of groceries up even further.These regulations ALSO impact other consumer goods, from home appliances to cars to a range of other items. Bringing those goods into adherence with European regulation could be extremely expensive in terms of changing factories and production processes and would probably result in some factories being closed down, driving economic growth in Europe (read: Germany) at the expense of Canadian industry. Canada entering the Schengen Zone would also create even more problems. If you think the current discussions on immigration in Canada are hysterical, just wait until the entirety of Europe suddenly has equal access to Canadian jobs and Canadian housing. Finally, Canada is, for better or worse, heavily reliant on oil production and export. Canada mostly exports that petroleum to the US via a series of pipelines that transport it to refineries in Texas. There's essentially no way to pipe oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to the Atlantic without sending it through the US, and Europe lacks the refinement capabilities necessary to handle it even if Canada did find a way to ship it cheaply to Europe.There is essentially no scenario in which Canada joining the EU doesn't completely crash the economy and dramatically worsen Canadian quality of life with extremely limited upsides that could be accomplished by intelligently streamlining Canadian import regulations.Furthermore, joining the EU wouldn't actually help Canada defend against an aggressive US. Europe in general is pretty militarily weak compared to the US, but there's basically no way at all that Europe would be able to augment Canada's defensive capacity if the US tried to isolate Canada. Unlike Ukraine, where Europe is able to provide over-land supply from major industrial centres, European supplies to Canada would have to be delivered by ship, and the US Navy could easily block such shipments simply by controlling the mouth of the St Lawrence and the Juan de Fuca Straight. Trump is 100% correct that a Canada-America war would be over in a week.","title":"CMV: Canada should join the European Union"},{"text":"So much for the \\"peace president\\" huh.

They frequently get things wrong, and when they do, there's no reflection or growth. They're already busy being wrong about the next inconsequential topic.As for the Heritage Foundation, they're a thinktank - by definition, they're expected to get a lot of things wrong. Thinktanks make proposals, suggested policy, predictions, etc, using multiple contributors who quite often even contradict each other. Groups like the Heritage Foundation exist to win funding, and a strategy used to achieve this is to throw 3 darts and hope 1 hits - i.e., multiple policies on the same issue. When one hits, they spread use it to prove their influence/insightfulness and gain further funding. To criticise a thinktank for being wrong is missing the point.When it comes to the World Health Organisation, I don't think I need to elaborate too much on why they need to be held at immeasurably higher standard than your average grifter or troll. When dictating global policy, there is no room for error. Infallible has to be the standard because mistakes cost lives.

The EU primarily relies on the US (through NATO) for its defence. The EU couldn't realistically stand up to the US militarily in Europe, let alone trying to do so in North America, with supply lines running across the Atlantic Ocean.In terms of trade, Canada is not in Europe, which significantly limits the ability for the EU to be a viable option for trade diversification. Canada already has a free trade deal with Europe, and while it isn't as expansive as being part of the EU, it comes without the downsides, and the additional step of joining the EU wouldn't make much difference.The primary benefits of EU membership don't really apply to Canada. Without a land border the open borders of Europe don't really have any meaning, when the Atlantic is in the way. The currency union wouldn't help either, as it would take away Canada's ability to control its own monetary policy, and link Canada to currency variation that would depend on factors that exist an Ocean away from it.Also, your geographical analysis of Canada's proximity to Greenland, and Greenland's proximity to Iceland seems to miss the issue of where population centers actually exist. Alexandra Fiord is way in the north of Nunavut. The closest major Canadian city is about 3,400 km south of there.Greenland is tiny, with a population of about 56,000 people, and its \\"population centers\\" are still about 1,400 km away from the Canadian East Coastal cities. Iceland is about 2,700 km away, and is still quite small (about 393k people). For perspective, Canada's smallest province (PEI) has 154,000 people (almost triple Greenland), and its second smallest province (Newfoundland) has 510,000 people (well above Iceland).The real population centers in the EU are still a full Atlantic Ocean away from Canada, and keep in mind that a third of Canada's population is located in the Western provinces. Vancouver is almost halfway around the world from the Easternmost EU centers like Poland and Finland.That is part of the reality of Canada. The US is a natural trading partner because it is not only so close, but it is so close to all of Canada. Vancouver is an hour's drive from Seattle, while Halifax's port is 650 km from Boston Harbour.For Canada, it is a good idea to diversify trade, but the only real answer lies in self-reliance. Each of Canada's populated regions trades more with the US than it does with other Canadian provinces, and often the trade restrictions are higher between provinces than with the US, too. We even have a lot of our East-West infrastructure that runs through the US, like the pipelines that feed oil and gas from the Prairies to Ontario and Quebec.What Canada needs to do is integrate with itself, first and foremost, building more and better infrastructure through Canada between East and West, dropping inter-provincial trade restrictions, and building with a united Canadian mentality, instead of the longstanding issues of provinces (cough Quebec and Ontario cough) using their political power within Canada to further their own best interests, instead of the best interests of Canada, as a whole.","title":"CMV: Canada should join the European Union"},{"text":"Changing a name on a map isn't going to pay my mortgage.

But his recent trolling about taking over Canada, acquiring Greenland, and reclaiming the Panama Canal reveals something more complex than rhetoric.These statements, far from harmless social media clickbait, show Trumps vision for America: a return to the outdated ambitions of domination from the Bush era. For a man who once styled himself as the pro-peace candidate, these nation expansion fantasies mark a disturbing pivot toward policies that could destabilize the global order.Now that Trump is president-elect, he has quickly shifted away from the isolationist America First narrative he promoted during his 2016, 2020, and 2024 campaigns. He painted himself as the voice of the forgotten America who would prioritize domestic concerns over costly foreign entanglements. Trump promised to bring jobs back to the abandoned steel mills of Pennsylvania and Ohio, which had been left to rot by elites from both political parties.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-border-expansion-china-russia-1235228892/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-border-expansion-china-russia-1235228892/)","title":"Trumps Imperial Ambitions Are Welcome News to China and Russia"},{"text":"Covid was the only thing to ever beat Trump.","title":"Biden Says He Would Have Beaten Trump if He Stayed in the Race"},{"text":"Vance probably thought he was going to sail right through to the 2028 nomination.

Theres something to be said for an entire group of people whose entire existence continues because they do anything and everything at any cost to win an election; you see why they fought so hard, you see why they lost SO badly and you KNOW this because theyve mastered saying the quiet part out loud. When you say that a certain person is going to end democracy no matter how ridiculous it is, its dangerous. IF it wasnt dangerous, they wouldnt have ever bothered to say and repeat it 24/7. All these mistakes and momentary lapses in security or my personal favorite I dont happen to have those exact figures in front of me senator. would never have happened to any other candidate in history. If Barack OR big Mike even so much as stubbed one of their toes on a folding chair, theyd ban them nationwide out of some kind of principal and yes Im very aware that democrats dont even know what principals are; they also dont know what integrity either but that sure as hell never stopped them from ruining our lives as much as they possibly can. *Everyone wave goodbye to the Obamas now!!*","title":"If you ever need a good laugh.

If the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be deep, solid, and ingenious, that the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE;2 that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty. - Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 70Why have this department in the executive that clearly has power with a significant portion of voters?

He wants continued economic growth to stall inner turmoil in China and just continue as usual.Russia also is not a military powerhouse that could fight NATO without the US. Even if the US was to suddenly disappear from NATO, which is a terrifying concept in itself, then that does not mean Russia could simply march all the way to Lisbon and be done, nor would countries like Denmark, the Nordics, Germany, Switzerland, France and the UK just keel over.

You cannot march through Europe and 350 million people in a few weeks. Especially not with the kind of military losses Russia is currently facing. They are far from \\"done\\", but they are far from the \\"super deadly force\\" they portrayed themselves as either.But what they *can* do is make sure to weaken the US-EU relations enough so that we cannot respond to any *smaller* threats in a more serious capacity when they happen outside our borders. For example, they can grind peace operations such as Kosovo to a halt and confine us to our borders.While we are politically infighting around Greenland and the big orange, Russia can start taking countries like Georgia and Putin keeps his propaganda machine going for a couple decades. Everything Trump does at the moment is meant to pull the western eye back to America and make us fight amongst ourselves so we cannot adequately respond to threats to third-party countries during his expansion. He wants to stop a second Ukraine from happening and make sure that the next country that is NATO-adjacent does not receive help. Trump is doing that splendidly.","title":"France Warns Trump to Back Off From Threatening EUs Borders | The French foreign minister spoke after Trump refused to rule out using military force to seize Greenland."},{"text":"You say this with confidence, but it's based on nothing more than your feelings.It takes time and effort to dig up votes from apathetic/underinformed/undecided voters.

Whether they should join is a matter of debate, but it seems arbitrary to suggest they should simply because of something Trump has said. The European Union is primarily a trade and regulatory alliance rather than a defense pact. For Canada to qualify for EU membership, it would need to make significant changes to its laws and systemschanges that would be extremely difficult given Canadas closer alignment with American systems than European ones. Such adjustments would likely lead to severe economic consequences, possibly leading to bankruptcy.Also, why do you think trump does not pressure EU countries? He has stated multiple times he would leave us to the wolves if we did not do x, y, or z. Canada joining the EU would not change american treatment, it is far more likely they would even penalize canada more in response. NATO is primarly a defense pact, and Canada is already a member. If the U.S. were to invade Canada, it would trigger Article 5 of the NATO treaty, obligating all other member states to defend Canada. This would essentially mean the U.S. declaring war on the rest of NATO, a highly unlikely scenario.That said, the idea of the U.S. invading Canada is absurd. (Not saying you claim this, but this is being spouted widespread) Trump isnt suggesting hes planning an invasion. At most, you could argue he might seek to economically pressure Canada to align with U.S. interests. While youre free to have your opinions on such tactics, theyre far from being a direct threat of war. Canada is not being  targeted, they are actualy treated far better than EU countries.
