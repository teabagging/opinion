The reaction to it is very remarkable, especially after enduring nearly 15 years of the evil superman trope through people like Omni-man, Homelander, and Zack Snyders rendition of the character. It is, according to the stats, *the* most viewed and talked about DC trailer, so its clear that there is a yearning for a more optimistic take on the character. Not only that, but Snyder fans soon came out of the woodwork to bash the new take. If you know anything about the man and his brand of politics, I think that might be a harbinger of how the manosphere and conservatives as a whole are going to react to the movie when it comes out: poorly.Needless to say, this might just be the positive model of masculinity people have been saying we need after the election. Not only does this bring the character back to his roots fighting for truth and justice instead of juggling the question do these people *deserve to be saved by me?*, but having him be recurring across multiple years fighting billionaires and monsters will allow him to *stay* in the public consciousness. That is the key part, I think. *Staying* in the public conscious will be a great tool to combatting toxic masculinity, especially if Gunns politics stay intact (which if youve seen Creature Commandos or Peacemaker, he does not keep quiet about).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 10, 2025"},{"text":"I definitely believe in a religion, but I don't think that it's been identified or has and is simply too corrupt to see the origin of its characteristics.","title":"Do Atheist Republicans exist?"},{"text":"You gotta remember that before politics everyone loved Trump, hes got no problem making friends with people and is generally a likeable person outside of politics.","title":"Trump says he and Obama 'probably do' like each other"},{"text":"So what, make democrats bend the knee for scraps while the GOP pillage the country?

Finally, that the USA is our biggest ally in defending and exporting democracy, which was synonymous with freedom.This has completed the destruction of the United States as an example of good governance, as an example of how the rule of law makes a country successful, and as an example of a country where justice eventually prevails.Watching how Trump tried a coup in 2021 was painful. Watching him getting away with it even more so. Watching Kamala Harris certifying the election of an unapologetic fascist was painful. A peaceful transfer of power to those who campaigned on a platform of destruction of the very institutions that made America the great country it has been over the last centuries, is a mistake of historical proportions. The institutions of the USA are apparently not resilient enough to ensure their very survival. Now this - the complete system that was meant to uphold justice has failed to effectively send someone to prison who was found guilty on 34 counts of fraud and who incited an insurrection.

The opening of the book of John saysIn the beginning was the Word.  And the Word was with God.  And the Word was God.*Word* is translated from the Greek word [Logos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos), which is more of a sacred teaching guiding you toward enlightenment.  It is basically the exact same thing as [Dharma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), which is the uniting concept behind the Dharmic religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Jainism).  So if you realize that Buddhists are onto something spiritual, then I would argue that you believe in Dharma, which means you believe in the Logos, which means you believe in the Word, which means you believe in God.The Logos (or Holy Spirit) is simply the teachings of Jesus..

It means \\"that which is not in accord with the dharma\\".

James Madison (see the Federalist #47 &amp; #51), must be spinning in his grave. In Federalist #47, he warned that the accumulation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers in one entity constitutes tyranny. And now we see that GOP-MAGA is this entity. Madisons considerations follow on from the Constitutional Conventions long discussion of how to hold the president accountable, thus inventing impeachment.  The impeachment of the President was discussed at several points during the Constitutional Convention, with key debates occurring on July 20 and September 8, 1787. Madison documented these discussions, which provide the key basis to understand the Framers intentions on presidential accountability.During the debates, there was *no suggestion that the president should be above the law*. Instead, the Framers focused on how to properly balance presidential power with accountability. Alexander Hamilton cemented these intentions in Federalist #69, where he contrasts the American president with the British monarch, saying that the president would be subject to impeachment and removal from office. This principle is fundamental to the Founders conception of a limited executive power within a system of checks and balances, subject to the rule of law. Presidents have *no absolute immunity* &amp; the Framers made clear he was *never* above the law, being governed by the Constitution itself.Neither SCOTUS nor the lower court should have given him a pass; at best his sentence should have been suspended until his term was over.To do otherwise trashes the clear &amp; repeatedly documented intention of the Framers. So we have no original intent that would allow this either.","title":"Trump sentencing: felon president-elect avoids jail as hush money judge in New York gives unconditional discharge for last years fraud conviction"},{"text":"They know that if they can manage to pass the tariffs, they can blame \\"da DeMoCrAtS\\" for anything negative that happens afterward and people will eat it up.","title":"Trudeau: Trump threatened to annex Canada to distract from tariffs impact"},{"text":"Nah Im good.

(...) The truth was whatever permitted the new fascist man (and woman) to dominate others, and whatever made the chosen people triumph.Fascism rested not upon the truth of its doctrine but upon the leader's mystical union with historic destiny of his people. (...) The fascist leader wanted to bring his people into a higher realm of politics that they would experience sensually: the warmth of belonging to a race now fully aware of its identity, historic destiny, and power; the excitement of participating in a vast collective enterprise; the gratification of submerging oneself in a wave of shared feelings, and of sacrificing one's petty concerns for the group's good; and the thrill of domination. Fascism deliberate replacement of reasoned debate with immediate sensual experience transformed politics, as the exiled cultural critic Walter Benjamin was first to point, into aesthetics. And the ultimate fascist aesthetic experience, Benjamin warned in 1936, was war.Fascist leaders made no secret of having no program. (...) Fascism radical instrumentalization of truth explains why fascists never bothered to write any casuistical literature when they changed their program as they did often and without compunction.

But absent from their critique has been any acknowledgement that climate change has played any role in igniting the catastrophic fires C despite a consensus among experts that they have been caused by exceptional environmental conditions, including near hurricane-strength winds, low rainfall and unseasonably high temperatures....In later posts, Trump called on Newsom to resign and extended responsibility to Bass and Joe Biden, under whose presidency, he said, the Federal Emergency Management Agency [Fema C which last autumn had to tackle destructive storms in several southern states] had no money.The governors office rebutted Trumps claim on water shortages. There is no such document as the water restoration declaration C that is pure fiction, a spokesperson for Newsom said.Newsom himself accused Trump of fixating on politics rather than easing human suffering.People are literally fleeing  People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools, families completely torn asunder, churches burned down, he told CNNs Anderson Cooper. This guy [Trump] wanted to politicise it. I have a lot of thoughts, and I know what I want to say. I wont.Water specialists denounced Trumps depiction of the resources in the Los Angeles area as inaccurate and irresponsible....Writing in Slate, the commentator Nitish Pahwa said the reaction boded ill for the response to climate-related disasters that may happen on Trumps watch C and possibly beyond.Were getting an early-year preview of how the United States is going to experience and respond to these rampaging climate disasters, he wrote.This is just how every major climate disaster is going to unfold online from here on out  in an ecosystem where social media outlets have purposefully hobbled their ability to provide real-time, reliable updates to users, the people affected by those disasters are literally left in the dark.It's pretty clear that with the incoming administration there will be no disaster too severe to use as political fodder for their base. Given what happened in the previous administration with California, states would be well advised to not expect aid from the federal government especially if they are of a different political persuasion from the president-elect.

They have ten provinces with their own systems and so aligning them with the US federal and state systems would create chaos.Yes, this is completely fair. States that previously joined the union were MOSTLY settled by Americans and had limited governing capabilities before joining the Union. The closest comparison point is Texas - geographically huge, culturally unique, and previously established as capable of self-governance. Adding ten Texases would be pretty difficult and would not happen overnight. The most likely scenario is that one or two provinces would be admitted as states first, and we'd figure out how to work it. No current member of any branch of government was an adult the last time we admitted a state, so it'd be starting basically from scratch.Admission would likely be politically fraught. The only way we'd get agreement is to pair admissions: Alberta could join as a conservative state along with the liberal state British Columbia. There are more center-right to right-wing provincial governments than there are center left to left-wing provincial governments, so admitting all ten provinces would likely benefit the Republicans.THAT SAID, people have complained FOREVER about the two-party system. While it's likely that Canadian parties would eventually consolidate and join American parties, it's possible that the changes could create a wholesale political realignment, where Northeast liberals would need to play nice with Newfie moderates if they want to create a workable coalition.**Higher Costs with Few Returns**: We would be taking on responsibility for Canadas infrastructure, healthcare systems, and other social programs. This could be costly, especially since many Canadians expect stronger public services than Americans currently receive.Not really. Canada's healthcare approach fits really well into ours. They have no national health program; everything is at the provincial/territorial level. Sure, there'd be some details to address, but nothing insurmountable. We already have states that have stronger and weaker social safety nets, just as Canada does. They would come on over and continue to manage things themselves.Budgetarily, think about this. In the United States, our federal spending last year was $6.4 trillion; our largest state's spending was $450 billion. Canada's federal spending last year was about $450 billion; its largest province's spending was around $220 billion. Canada's entire federal budget is a rounding error compared to ours, so changes there are trivial, and provincial budgets are no different than state budgets.Because so much is managed at the provincial level in Canada, there's little need to change things if their national flag were to swap to an American one.Again, is it realistic to incorporate Canada as states? Nope. But the US has a pretty long history of expansion and integration. It *could* work if the parties that matter are willing to make it work.","title":"CMV: There are absolutely no benefits for the US or Canada if Canada becomes the 51st state"},{"text":"I think you're overestimating some impacts and underestimating others. I think the whole idea is hilariously unserious, but for the sake of argument, let's say that there is some plausible way that it happens.First of all, there is no scenario in which Canada could join the United States as *one state*. If you think that American states are different from each other, wait until you see Canadian provinces. The most obvious example is Quebec, in which Canadian French is the predominant language, compared to its neighbor Ontario.Canada is *huge*. It's the second-largest country by landmass in the world, one ahead of the US and behind Russia. Every Canadian province would need to be its own state or the logistics would become unworkably unwieldy (the only theoretical way would be to make provinces into counties, but it's just an absurd difference).Now, to your points...**No Strategic Advantage**: Canada as a state wouldnt boost its global influence or military capabilities because we already have partnership through NATO and NORAD.Yes BUT Canada has a pretty robust military for its size. Integration with the American military would add strength in numbers and simplify the movement of troops and bases. You're right, though, that military benefits are probably limited due to our existing, close partnership.**Cultural/Political Differences**: A merger would lead to cultural erosion and significant policy conflicts. Canadian and the US have distinct cultures, governance structures, and political values. The Canadian identity is deeply tied to values like universal healthcare and stronger social safety nets, which contrast with the US's more privatized systems.Two things here:1. You oversimplify Canadian values. Much of Canada looks like the American midwest - quite conservative! There is a ton of similarity in the urban/rural divide in Canada, as evidenced by Justin Trudeau's fall from power as a progressive hindered by persistent inflation and low popularity. Vancouver is distinct from Seattle but culturally closer to Seattle than it is to, say, Edmonton.\\n2. Canadian has a much looser federation than the United States. We have evolved a strong central government that allows some limited decision making at the state level, but all of our big, national decisions are truly national. Canada is virtually completely federated, with a weak central government that basically plays traffic cop to settle inter-provincial disputes (oversimplification).\\n   1. This difference is most apparent in highway systems: The United States has a national standard for construction, architecture, signage, and even things like control points; our highway system is planned at a national level, and while state departments of transportation prioritize construction at that level, they do so with federal money. Canadian highways are owned completely at the provincial level, with no national standards or planning.\\n   2. To put a finer point on this, Canada has an explicit separation of power between provinces and Ottawa. Whereas the United States has overlap (e.g., it is possible to commit a crime against both state AND federal law), Canada only allows one set of laws to exist - national or provincial, not both.What this means is there isn't a big *national* difference, but there are potentially huge *provincial* differences. I could 100% see Manitoban citizens voting to join the United States. Newfoundlanders, on the other hand? I don't think they'd like the added control that Washington, D.C. would exert over them.**Minimal Economic Gain:**?Merger wouldnt add substantial value to the US economy. Canadas economy is much smaller and more resource-dependentDisagree. While there is a free trade agreement among the US, Mexico, and Canada, there are logistical hindrances to cross-border trade:1. Crossing the border requires a valid passport presented at set border control points; crossing outside of those points has put people from both countries into hot water (there was a story a couple years ago of a jogger who accidentally crossed into Canada while running on the beach, and she was detained and charged with unlawful entry!).\\n2. The existence of a closed border makes international infrastructure very difficult. It's pretty routine to build a road between, say, Nebraska and Kansas. To build a road between North Dakota and Manitoba? Giant headache requiring interaction across state, provincial, and two national governments. Same goes for pipelines and railways. Economic gains wouldn't be felt immediately, but they would definitely be felt within 5-10 years.","title":"CMV: There are absolutely no benefits for the US or Canada if Canada becomes the 51st state"},{"text":"Well I commend you for that.","title":"Appeals court allows special counsel's report about Trump's election interference case to be released to the public"},{"text":"I can only imagine how bleak this situation is for you as someone whose education and career is based on a knowledge and love of the law.

Kupchan: The old orderPax Americanais breaking down. Electorates across the West are in revolt as the industrial eras social contract has given way to the socioeconomic insecurity of the digital age. Waves of immigration have sparked an angry ethno-nationalism that advantages ideological extremes. Power in the international system is shifting from West to East and North to South, undermining a global order that rested on the Wests material and ideological primacy. Russia and China are pushing back against a liberal order that they see as a mask for U.S. hegemony. Many in the global South have grown impatient with an international system they see as exploitative, inequitable, and unjust.Pax Americana is past its expiration date, but the United States wont let go. Instead of beginning the hard work of figuring out what comes next, the Biden administration spent its four years defending the liberal rules-based order that emerged after World War II and seeking to turn back any and all challenges to it. The results are telling: disaffection at home and disorder abroad. The old is dying, the new cannot be born, and a great variety of morbid symptoms has appeared.In this context, Donald Trump could be a necessary agent of change. His America First brand of statecrafttransactional, neo-isolationist, unilateralist, and protectionistbreaks decisively from the liberal internationalist mold that has shaped the grand strategy of successive administrations since World War II. But though that mold may well need to be shattered, it will also need to be replaced. And Trump is more demolition man than architect. Instead of helping build a new and better international order, he may well bring down the old one and simply leave the United States and the rest of the world standing in the rubble.Trump will nevertheless be the president of the worlds most powerful country for the next four years. Americans will have to make the best of his efforts to revamp U.S. foreign policy. That means welcoming Trumps recognition that the country needs a new grand strategythen pushing him to pursue change that is radical but responsible, and to reform the world that America made rather than merely destroying it.... Yet even if Trumps America First foreign policy has considerable promise, it is also fraught with risk. His transactional approach to diplomacy could morph into a stiff-necked unilateralism that undermines collective efforts where they are needed. His effort to limit U.S. entanglements abroad could lead to U.S. underreach, leaving dangerous vacuums of power. His reluctance to promote democracy overseas could shade into disregard for democratic norms at home, potentially resulting in irreversible damage to the nations representative institutions. And in his determination to shake up the political establishment, Trump could break the U.S. government rather than reform it. A broken federal government will be in no shape to fix a broken America or a broken world.Trumps strategy could easily descend into excess and incoherence. The work ahead will be to encourage Trumps better instincts, counter his more malign ones, and channel both into something resembling a coherent and constructive grand strategy.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/x4IPOlwf](https://theatln.tc/x4IPOlwf)?","title":"Trump Is Right That Pax Americana Is Over"},{"text":"So much for If you cant do the time, dont do the crime - unless youre a wealthy person living in the US","title":"Megathread: President-Elect Trump Sentenced in New York Fraud Felony Case to \\"Unconditional Discharge\\", Will Not Be Incarcerated"},{"text":"why the charade with arguments, they already know how they'll rule.  it's just court theater.  none of their decisions are based on law, just opinion and how they feel.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"Dude youre not going to believe this but youre gonna need to subsidize our workers even more with that gov socialism.

We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality.\\" C Robert Anton WilsonThe idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation biasthe human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the \\"one true objective reality\\", each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

For example, the company will now allow content targeting LGBTQ people as mentally ill, and content advocating for the exclusion of women and trans people from military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs.**These changes are in addition to news this morning that Meta will end its fact-checking program. Todays sweeping and extreme policy changes represent a wholesale abandonment of the norms and best practices of content moderation.

The price of groceries in Russia has doubled in the last month so their economy is not even close to doing well let alone doing as well as Europes. It is straight up crumbling and has been since the beginning of the war. The only way theyve been able to keep the rouble from crashing is by pulling together some very short term solutions all of which are falling apart, and with Bidens oil policy the price of oil has fallen so much that theyve been selling for a loss half the time.Second of all, Russia significantly lost territory from 2022 to 2023. They lost about half what they had gained from March 2022 to February 2023. Then in 2023 the frontlines barely shifted. In the beginning of 2024 Ukraine started moving into Russia. Its only very recently that Russias made any gains in Ukraine, correlating entirely with public perception that the US and NATO will not support Ukraine in the future because of the outcome of the US election.Third of all, Russia also has a hard time getting troops. Thats why theyre bringing in North Korean troops. Theyve been forcing conscripts that have no experience since the beginning of the war and losing them faster than they can conscript them.Fourth of all, I am absolutely assuming that Putin will burn down the world. If hell do it now, hell damn sure continue to do it after he takes Ukraine. Then hell continue after he takes Poland and the rest of Europe. - Did letting Hitler defy the Versailles and Locano treaties deescalate the war? \\n- Did letting Hitler annex Austria deescalate the war? \\n- Did letting Hitler invade Sudentenland deescalate the war? \\n- Did letting Hitler invade the rest of Czechoslovakia deescalate the war?\\n- Did letting Hitler invade the Klaipeda region of Lithuania deescalate the war?\\n- How about when Hitler annexed Danzig? Did that deescalate the war?\\n- Did letting Hitler invade Poland for 3 days deescalate the war? The only chance we had to stop WW2 was to stop Hitler as early as possible, and thats exactly how we should respond to the Russia-Ukraine conflict today. We have the opportunity to deescalate this war by turning it into an endless slog for Russia, and were actively choosing to let them end the conflict with everything they wanted from it.","title":"CMV: There's nothing to look forward to in the near future apart from \\"survive to better times\\""},{"text":"Meanwhile Obama and Trump were exchanging jokes and Biden is writing Washington Post op-eds.  \\nWe are not a serious democracy.

If we came to a place we're a left 3rd party got 15-20% of the vote. The Democrats would have to make concessions. It would push them left to try and win those voters back. If they don't they can say goodbye to getting those cushy congress jobs that come with lifetime pensions and lifetime health insurance after serving 2 terms. Right now is honestly a perfect time to protest our votes. What's the average Democratic lawmaker's age? Like 70? There is about to be a generation swap by naturally created age limits. For example. With AOC. If you paid attention, you could see she started going soft midway into her 1st term. One by voting for Pelosi and not pushing for a more left Speaker and gaslighting us by telling us that if she protested Pelosi we would've gotten McCarthy as a speaker... which is a lie...That was our sign. Make a tradition of booting them out before they get a 2nd and 3rd term and they don't get all those benefits I listed before... \\"Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at the age of 62 if they have completed (at least five years of service.) Members are eligible for a pension at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after completing 25 years of service. The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of salary. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.\\"So AOC was elected in 2018, and she's hit her 5 years now. She's made. And my guess is you're going to see her not challenge the party at all. No more incumbent challenges, she will tote the corporate party vote when it matters. If the vote has enough margin for a few protest votes, She may protest. Like a defense spending bill or something. But if that defense bill NEEDED her vote. She would vote in favor of it to get it passed. I guarantee it.Long story short. When they expose themselves. Kick them out. You can either better the Democrats or just want to beat the Republicans.

And then you have the Santa Ana winds coming from the desertvery, very high winds, as much as 100 miles per hour. Once you get a spark, those things just blow.Its pretty well established that were seeing increases in the frequency of wildfires, and thats driven by an increase in droughts and a lot of other factors. There have been numerous studies in Europe, in the US and elsewhere that show theres that influence [from climate change], and we would expect that influence to grow.any solutions to reducing the risk [of wildfire] will have to include water as part of that conversation\\n[Oligarch farmers and the fires in Los Angeles](https://yasha.substack.com/p/oligarch-farmers-and-the-fires-in)Its connected to the fact that while fires are raging across the Los Angeles area, there are reports that fire hydrants are being tapped out.

There shouldn't be a line because some older youth are mature and smart and should be able to vote on things that directly impact them. It isn't that simple. It should be. It isn't. And it is because adults fucking suck and would exploit it. Someone has 10 kids they show up at the polls with Jimmy who is 4 months all the way up to Jimmy John Jr who is 17. They all vote the way dad tells them to or they don't eat. In fact, that is a very real situation for some adults. Specifically women.I agree there are outlining circumstances that should be treated differently. I think if you enlist in the military at 17 you should get to vote. And if you are in the military and under 21, you should be allowed to drink legally. If you are under 18 and married, you should get to vote. As a few examples. How much research and reading have you done of voter intimidation in the past and the reason we have the laws we do? There is a reason you can't hold sings closer than a few hundred feet to a polling booth, or to wear a political shirt into the polling both. There is a reason you don't have to tell your boss who you vote for....becuase bosses used to sit at the polls and watch which bucket you put your vote into (before \\"secret\\" ballots). You seem to think the low is there for the purpose of disenfranchising the youth. It isn't. That is a side effect caused by trying to keep money hungry white men in check.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"If the EU \\"fears it\\" then 9 times out of 10 its a good thing.","title":"EU fears Donald Trump rolling back Biden-era measures"},{"text":"Batshit crazy/absolutely idiotic.","title":"What do Americans objectively think of Trump's hints of 'annexing' Greenland?"},{"text":"Is this going to be televised?

But hes not just breaking with Democratic orthodoxy on a particular policy position, hes going out of his way to repeat right wing talking points.  Hes not talking about taking a sober review of trump's appointees and giving them careful consideration, hes talking about how excited he is to vote for them.  Its not like hes made one or two comments in passing, hes antagonizing his supporters and seeking the spotlight to make MAGA comments almost everyday.  Even Joe Manchin didn't do this.

If I am truly to change my view, I need clear, factual counterpoints, not a barrage of emotional accusations.First, the suggestion that I require my views \\"sugar-coated\\" to change is a misrepresentation of my stance. I am not asking for emotional coddling but for logical, well-supported arguments. Dismissing my willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints by labeling it a fragile ego or a demand for \\"lap dogs\\" is both unproductive and contrary to the spirit of this forum. If you believe the data supports your position, then present it in a way that directly addresses the points I have made.You then move to historical anti-Irish sentiment, citing a quote from 1893 to challenge my point about past migrants funding their integration. However, the existence of prejudice does not invalidate the argument that mass migrations in the past relied on migrants own resources rather than state support. For example, the waves of European immigrants to the United States largely financed their journeys and integration themselves, often through family networks and mutual aid societies. Similarly, post-WWII migration from Eastern to Western Europe involved individuals seeking better opportunities, not states allocating public funds to provide housing, food, and cash payments as is done with modern asylum policies in Germany. These historical contexts differ significantly from todays government-funded programs, which are at the core of AfD's critique.Regarding the Nazi comparison, you cite excerpts from the NSDAP platform and claim they mirror modern far-right rhetoric. This is a flawed analogy. Policies restricting immigration or prioritizing citizens welfare are not Nazi. Many countries, including liberal democracies, have similar stances on immigration and resource allocation without being labeled extremist. For example, Japan and Denmark enforce strict immigration policies yet operate as democratic nations.You reference Poppers Paradox of Tolerance and Arendts warnings about treating facts as opinions to justify banning AfD. However, this interpretation misunderstands the nature of democracy. Popper warned against tolerating ideologies that would dismantle tolerance itself. AfDs platform, while controversial, does not advocate violence or the suppression of basic human rights. Banning political parties based on disagreement with their policies undermines democracy far more than engaging with their arguments.Your assertion that \\"millions of Germans voting for AfD makes them all extremists\\" is sweeping and unfair. People vote for political parties for various reasons, often driven by dissatisfaction with existing policies or concerns about issues such as public safety, economic stability, or cultural identity. Labeling all AfD voters as extremists ignores the complexities of voter behavior and dismisses the legitimate grievances that have led to their rise.The comparison to the 1932 NSDAP vote is a weak analogy. The historical, political, and social contexts of 1930s Germany are vastly different from todays. AfD operates within Germanys democratic framework, has not called for dismantling democracy, and has faced scrutiny from the courts and public alike. Equating them to the Nazi Party is hyperbolic and ignores these distinctions.Finally, you state that the truth needs to be said, yet you rely on broad generalizations and emotional appeals rather than engaging with the specific points I have raised. If you want to convince me, show me where AfDs policies or actions directly violate democratic principles or promote violence and hatred. Provide evidence that their critiques of immigration policy and public spending are inherently extremist. Simply repeating that they are dangerous without addressing the content of their platform does not suffice.If I am wrong, convince me with facts and logic, not accusations and false historical comparisons. I came here to have my view challenged, not to be dismissed as insincere or accused of hidden motives. If you believe my position is flawed, engage with it substantively and fairly.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"As long it's legal?

You would hope, however, that they get their say by asking their friends and family who are eligible to vote to represent them. In your example I think parents who refuse to vote to give a voice to their child, or especially who vote against what the minor is asking for, are not good parents.What about younger children, though? There are laws pertaining the the use of child safety seats in cars, for example, that apply specifically to children who I think most would agree are too young to vote. In this case do you think there should just be no laws? Or should we be letting small children, some not young enough to attend school, vote on such things?I also think there is a strong case or laws that impact visitors to the country. While they may not apply only to visitors, most laws do impact them. Surely you don't think that tourists should have a right to vote on laws regarding things like drug use, violence, etc.There are cases where I do strongly agree with your position, though. The primary situation is voting rights for felons. I think it is inexcusable that we take away their right to vote for the very people who pass the laws that make them felons in the first place.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"I agree but American politics is basically the Onion now.

They could not understand a situation in which trump is wrong about something if he's wrong about something it's because God himself into the end and through in a wild card or something.As for actually invading it it will be really difficult and really easy at the same time depending on a couple things. There's only 55,000 people living on Greenland so the US easily has enough soldiers they can spare for an invasion but the ships are going to be the bigger problem, the US has three ice breakers one of which had a major fire recently and ships typically spend about 50% of their time under maintenance and so realistically the Invasion forces only going to have one icebreak most of the time if that is destroyed all of the escorts and possibly the carrier as well have real difficulty getting to anywhere other than the southern tip of Greenland. And if that is destroyed and it ends up being a colder winter than normal they might not even make it to the southern tip of Greenland.Now they can land soldiers in the sudden tip and expand up along the coastal settlements like that but Greenland can get to -70C, which the US has not fought in and hardly even trains in, winter in Afghanistan at the absolute coldest on a mountain peak gets to -33C. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be someone from Texas having to walk along the Greenland ice shelf playing a gorilla warfare roll against people that have lived there their whole life. And anything other than a completely dedicated arctic vehicle will just die so the only vehicles in the US will really have to use will be those weird little box track things which are pretty good at moving soldiers and things about but they're not particularly armored and they have no real weapons of their own. As for the fleet itself destroyers and the new frigates will be in enough quantities but a super carrier might be quite hard to get hold of, the US averages 4.5 supercarriers deployed at any one time with the others undergoing maintenance either between deployments or mid-life rehauls. The 4 places at which the US always has a carrier is the South China sea, the Indian Ocean around the middle east area, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Mediterranean/Atlantic. When it is one of the points that they have that fifth carrier it is typically within the South China sea because of China's Navy. The most obvious place to take a carrier away from would be the Atlantic Western Mediterranean however if they do that the Eastern Mediterranean carrier will have to move because let's face it Europe will at least somewhat help Denmark, and the super carrier task force is very powerful but it is not taking on the whole of the Mediterranean countries solo and so we'll either be destroyed in the Mediterranean or have to flee through the Suez and chill out with the Indian Ocean carrier. And that significantly upsets the US strategy of The middle East where it wants to flank the middle East on each side. Now they have their task calls to help out the Invasion what happens if some European countries defending Denmark send a few submarines, let's just say that recent US war games have shown a distinct lack of ability in anti-submarine warfare. The US uses the Arleigh Burke as a general destroyer, and it is very good for ship to ship and ship to land combat but that means that whilst it has a sonar it is noisier than a submarine and so the submarine will be able to detect one of these further away than the Burke can detect them every single time. About a decade or so ago a cheap Swedish diesel electric sank a US supercarrier in war games and did so by traveling through the entire task force undetected. With the US worrying about China's Navy so much how many supercarriers and ships is it willing to lose for the sake of Greenland.Denmark does have a large Navy then you would expect it to have before a country of its size and it does have some pretty good diesel electric submarines so they might be able to get in a few large kills even if the rest of NATO in Europe peaces out and doesn't do anything, and if they do join I wouldn't want to be a US sailor trying to fight a German diesel electric or British astute class (the quietest nuclear submarine in the world), although the European vessels don't have as much overall fire as a US vessel but at the end of the day a single modern heavyweight torpedo still splits the key of abortion it doesn't matter whether you split the kill five times or just once it's getting sank. So yes the US for almost certainly be able to conquer the inhabited bits of Greenland but the more useful bits for missile sites are a bit further inland (not like the North eastern tip though) and as said guerilla warfare on the Greenland eyes shelf will be suicide fuel for a soldier. But more importantly there is not a single way that the US does not completely and utterly fuck itself by invading Greenland. At best it loses every single one of its allies legitimizes the moves of all of its enemies. At worst it loses maybe two supercarriers along with a fairly large number of escorting vessels and that absolutely destroys its plans for the middle East and China, if that happens to combat China it will have to fully pull out of The middle East with its naval assets and pretty much just leave it alone and hope it ends up well.","title":"CMV: If Trump attacked Greenland and Denmark tried to defend it, his government wouldn't survive it"},{"text":"Bullshit.Proof: I am not successful lmao","title":"Supreme Court rules 5-4 that Trump's hush money trial and conviction are NOT covered by Presidential Immunity and sentencing can go ahead tomorrow"},{"text":"US doesn't have a real big left wing media lmao.","title":"Donald Trump Jr.s visit was staged, says Greenland lawmaker"},{"text":"his government wouldn't survive itThe US elected government doesn't work in the same way as parliamentary governments.

Just reading its platform, the infamous 25-Punkte-Programm, echoes everything they stand for. The most pertinent exerpt follows:??7.

Theres no hyperbole. They violate the social contract by saying this. The idea that Democracy requires ??open debate of extremist lies?? is a deeply flawed idea. This quote, from Arendt, comes to mind:??But perhaps the most striking and frightening aspect of the German flight from reality is the habit of treating facts as though they were mere opinions. () in all fields there is a kind of gentlemens agreement by which everyone has a right to his ignorance under the pretext that everyone has a right to his opinionand behind this is the tacit assumption that opinions really do not matter. This is a very serious thing, not only because it often makes discussion so hopeless (one does not ordinarily carry a reference library along everywhere), but primarily because the average German honestly believes this free-for-all, this nihilistic relativity about facts, to be the essence of democracy. In fact, of course, it is a legacy of the Nazi regime.??The work of Popper on the Paradox of Tolerance and many others also come to mind.Hate speech and disinformation are not, in fact, part of Democracy. They are its opposite. A true free democracy thus requires strong Laws against parties like the AfD. The fact that it is not banned yet is a sign that Democracy is in trouble already.Millions of Germans voted for AfD because they are indeed, now, radical and dangerous extremists. Every single person who voted for this party is an extremist, no matter what were their inner reasons. Facts dont stop existing when enough people deny them.It is worth remembering that, in November 1932, 11,737,021 Germans voted for the NSDAP, then the most popular party.

To my perception, it's a huge difference between that and what you're saying.We don't really disenfranchise them. It's their parents who vote for their interests, as well as large advocacy groups that do take into consideration the opinions of children, but collect them and shape them into actually useful ideas. We do this because children are quite literally very dumb and incapable with practically zero societal experience. \\"But they said the same about women and black people!\\"Yes, and that was wrong. Because we can easily see why it was wrong; either through standardized tests or simply sitting down and talking with a few women and black people, any person can see that they are mostly normal adults who can vote with the same degree of reason - ranging from dumb to smart - as white men.If you would test toddlers and sit down with toddlers, you would see they score like retards across the board, and they'll say stupid shit like \\"is the sun sad when goats are angry?\\" while shitting their pants. You cannot compare women and black people to toddlers.Also, children will be adults with a right to vote. It's just a matter of time. It's very different from excluding entire groups for life.\\"But adults are dumb too! They vote for stupid shit all the time!\\"Yeah, and now imagine those same adults at 5, stuffing Lego's up their nose. I think most of them will have improved somewhat since then, at least a bit.There are smart, average, dumb, good and bad adults in this world. What they all have in common is that they were all once universally stupid toddlers. Even genius children are severally limited by the underdevelopment of their brain and lack of general knowledge and childish impulses.Nobody needs to force anybody to vote. Nobody needs to force anyone to give a shit. The moment a person does give a shit, however, whenever that occurs in their individual lives, they deserve the liberty to give a shit.I would have given a shit when I was 8, and I probably would have voted for something dumb. If children want to give a shit about politics, there's plenty of avenues for them to explore that interest while the wait a few years to vote.Imagine for a second literally anything that we don't age restrict. Nobody is going around forcing all young people to do whatever that thing is that you're thinking of that we don't age restrict. Because that would be absurd. But the moment a person of any age takes interest in whatever the thing is that you're thinking of, they have the liberty to do the thing thanks to the lack of an age restriction.I don't get this argument because you can easily flip it around. Think of everything we do age restrict: sex with adults, alcohol, drugs, driving, gun ownership, prostitution. There are plenty of children who'd have an interest in some of these things before they've hit puberty. Should we let them? Also consider that the mandatory education that we have (at least, until the 6 year olds get to vote to abolish it) is at least in part intended to teach young people enough literacy and general (societal) knowledge to be able to understand what they truly want and need, and to vote accordingly.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"How is a 3 month old disenfranchised if they can't vote?How does my 3 month old register to vote?

I think you are missing a big point about politics. It isn't just about the vote. A 16 year old can still call their representatives and talk. Write letters. Knock on doors. Do all of the things Grete does. She makes a way bigger impact by her activism than she misses out on without a vote. We should be rallying teens to get involved. Get opinionated. And then once they can vote. Vote informed. Get their friends to vote. We are seeing this shift now because of people like Grete and David Hogg.

Is there any cutoff in age that seems sensical to you?  There are laws that have implications that we would not expect a young child to able to comprehend yet. For example, laws that prohibit the sales of gory or explicit materials to minors, young minors might not even know what the material in question even is.  I would not want to impose the burden of exposing children to extreme materials (or even the concept of these materials in extreme enough cases) just so we may have their opinion on it.  Similarly on the prohibition on the promotion of addicting products to minors before they have learned about addiction (with the proper educational scaffolding) seems like it is leaving them open to be exploited.  Are you in favor of any age cutoffs that make sense in these cases?  Even if we say that school-grade is better than age (which it probably is), it still is almost 1:1 with age.Age is imperfect and seems arbitrary as a factor in having a well-formed reasonable opinion but there is decent reasonable scientific basis for at the very least taking it into account.  Consider that our science indicates that the adolescent brain is still developing in ways different from childhood but still quite identifiable as development and plasticity and while it varies from person to person we can fairly safely state that the brains of most 17 year olds are still undergoing adolescence (to be fair this process still goes until \\\\~20).I think it would be more compelling, in my opinion to make an argument against the law itself and saying that older teenagers who are pregnant will be adults or close enough to adulthood that they will not be in the care of their parents by the time they give birth and therefore should be allowed to make this life-choice by themselves.I would also note that you are making two separate arguments, one for voice and one for vote.  I think your demand that young people get a voice in matters that affect them is 100% correct and reasonable.  We could even require it for certain categories of laws and regulations.

I might already know what kinds of things you mean such as my complaint that Hank, who hates androids, is on a case hunting a killer and finds the Traci's who attack him and Connor, and yet for no apparent reason thinks it's a good idea to let them loose into the city even though they might just kill again.  But I'm not sure if that is really what you're referring to.  I am most curious if you think there are other endings or major points where the game totally throws reality out the window to make thematic points like what you are saying gets done with Connor.  I spent some time trying to think if there were any other times in the game, especially endings, where the game chucked reality away and decided to make a thematic point.  Maybe one would be where Markus is peaceful and kisses North and the president decides to tell the military to stand down?  At least with that one, I can't say I find as much fault with it.  It might be cheesy, but it is at least in line with reality.  The public opinion of androids is rising and they are being extremely peaceful.  There is little risk in standing down to at least reassess things.  There is the Kara river ending which I think should get reworked because it is impossible to get a satisfying ending once you don't steal the bus tickets and I have no idea why the developers did that.  They seemed to have wanted to make the point that you have to break some eggs to make an omelet.  Like if you don't do at least that one bad action as Kara, you will pay for it later.  This too aligns with reality though.  Sometime you have to do something bad to get a good result.  I mean, see the Connor ending where he has to kill Markus to save the world.Probably the most heavy handed thematic moment in the game for me is where Markus becomes half-MLK, half-Jesus and is walking down the street remotely converting followers while soaring music plays in the background.  Very heavy handed, but this again doesn't fall far from reality.  Androids are able to communicate wirelessly and Markus seems to control a virus known as rA9 that allows him to convert androids into being his minions.  While the scene is a bit silly to watch, it falls in line with Markus's capabilities and desires to do what he's doing.Outside of the Hank / Traci's moment which is highly unrealistic and done only to show that Hank is becoming more favorable towards deviant androids, I can't think of a moment that defies reality to a grotesque level like the Connor \\"bad\\" ending.  The reason I'd give the Connor \\"bad\\" ending a lot more weight than the Hanke / Traci's moment is because it is literally the end of the game.  It isn't just some fleeting moment that makes no sense but the story carries on.  It ends everything including seemingly the end of Connor as a object.  Maybe if you can point out several other areas where the game will do things that are totally done just for thematics and ignores reality then I might start to see where this game shouldn't even be expected to follow reality, but at least from the time I spent really thinking about this, I don't think you'll find a lot of those moments if any.  I think the reason Connor's ending really bothers me is because 99% of the time this game stays within the bounds of reality.  Obviously it takes liberties here and there, but nothing other than the Hank / Traci's that goes so far outside of reality that it yanks me out of the story and world being built.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"NOTE: I'm getting \\"Unable to create comment\\" when trying to respond and have no idea why.  I'm going to break up my response into smaller segments so you might get a few replies from me before I'm done.I want to give you credit for writing what I think is the best response I've gotten in relation to making me reconsider my position.  While you are correct that another posted said something similar to you, they didn't really explain it in the way you did.I do still want to debate this though as I think you're overlooking some things.  The most important point is that you say robots are objects and thematically get treated as objects.  When you think about an object like a car or even a plate, how CAN you treat it?  Well, you can do anything you want with it ranging from treating it like your baby to utterly destroying it.  Just because it is only an object doesn't mean that you automatically treat it like garbage and in fact it is very unlikely that you will treat it like garbage until it becomes useless.  That brings me back to my lengthy write up that I started this thread with.  Does Connor's usefulness align with how he's being treated at the end of the game or is the game developer completely throwing out the window what CyberLife would do with the object named Connor in favor of giving the absolute worst possible outcome just to make the player feel bad?I also want you to consider a different ending that I argue is more in line with reality AND treats Connor like an object.  Would you agree that if CyberLife turned Connor into a person who made appearances for interviews and signed autographs and showed up for kids birthday parties would still be them treating him like an object?  Obviously Connor wasn't designed for these functions, but they would be in line with helping CyberLife rebuild their shattered reputation on the back of Connor's fame and success.  This is the ending that both shows that Connor is still treated like and object while also being in line with the reality of how this would have played out.  It also could be done in such a way that it gives the player a moment of real reflection on how things could have ended differently.  Like say there is a scene where the cameras are flashing and people are all asking Connor questions and amidst it all Connor takes a moment and looks a picture of himself that shows him as he once was.  A detective android in the field with Hank Anderson as they were on a case.  It could show a moment of longing for that life before he is pulled back into being the PR face of CyberLife.  Connor isn't free here, but rather an android being used by CyberLife to do their bidding.  I would argue this completely fits thematically and sticks with the reality of how things would really be in the post-rebellion world.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"We all thought putin wouldnt actually invade Ukraine, even while he was slapping down troops on their border for an entire year in 2021.

Almost three years into a 3 day special military operation with no real end in sight, a very real possibility of it escalating into World War III, and the people in Russia just go about their day like nothings even happening even while their sons are being fucked up and injured by drones and shitPart of the reason why theyre like this is because theyre being fed constant streams of propaganda on a daily basis and if you speak out against it, youre just gone, disappeared, possibly sent to a fucking gulag at best or on the frontlines at worst.Notice how a lot of media personalities and companies and such have basically, since the election, started to bend the knee to Trump, as an example, the Morning Joe people or Mark Zuckerberg. Hes going to use these companies like MSNBC, FOX News, CNN, etc, to paint this as a good thing that were doing, theyre going to be his propaganda arm. Likely using the same bullshit Putin is using for Ukraine, there are nazis in denmark and its our job to liberate greenland from denmark!His cult will eat it all right the fuck up.

The claim that \\"refugees dont pay for their integration at first\\" is not only misleading but completely ignores historical context. In the past, mass migrations were often funded by the migrants themselves. Take, for example, the waves of European immigrants to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These individuals uprooted their lives, paid for their own travel, and worked hard to establish themselves in a new country without relying on taxpayer-funded support systems. They arrived with little more than their skills, determination, and willingness to integrate into the culture of their new home.Similarly, after World War II, many Eastern Europeans migrated to Western Europe to escape oppressive regimes and seek better opportunities. These migrations were not subsidized by the host countries. Instead, these migrants contributed to their new societies through hard work and integration, funding their own paths to better lives. The modern context, where taxpayers are expected to indefinitely fund accommodations, welfare, and integration programs for foreign private individuals, is a significant departure from these historical norms.Your comparison of AfD to ISIS or a \\"pedophiles party\\" is not only factually absurd but deeply dishonest. ISIS is a terrorist organization responsible for heinous acts of violence, and a party promoting pedophilia would inherently violate human rights and the social contract. AfD, on the other hand, operates within Germanys democratic framework, has not advocated violence, and focuses its platform on policy issues such as immigration control, public safety, and the proper use of taxpayer funds. These are legitimate political topics that are debated worldwide. Comparing them to organizations or ideologies that openly destroy lives and societies is a blatant attempt to shut down debate rather than engage with their actual positions.Democracy thrives on open debate and the free exchange of ideas, even when those ideas are uncomfortable. Labeling AfD as \\"extremists\\" or calling for their ban simply because you disagree with their platform undermines these democratic principles. Millions of German citizens support AfD, not because they are extremists, but because they feel that mainstream parties have failed to address critical issues like uncontrolled immigration and the strain on public resources.History shows us that successful migrations often relied on the ability of migrants to integrate and contribute economically, without placing undue burdens on host societies. Today, however, we see a system where public funds meant for the common goods of citizens, like infrastrukture, education, healthcare, public safety, are being redirected to support foreign private individuals. This creates resentment, not because people lack compassion, but because they see their own resources being misused while their concerns about safety and integration are ignored.How am I supposed to change my view when these kinds of exaggerated claims and false equivalencies are presented as arguments? If you believe AfDs policies or rhetoric are flawed, engage with their positions and critique them based on evidence. But hyperbolic smears and false historical comparisons only reinforce my belief that these attacks are not about addressing real issues but about silencing dissent.","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"What year is it","title":"Jimmy Carter's funeral: Melania Trump distracts with oversized collar as viewers ask if she's in a 'choir'"},{"text":"Those are two different questions.It's easy to imagine a country with very restrictive voting rights, but very easy qualification for the top job. For example the Holy See (aka Vatican), has only about 120 voters. It's extremely difficult to get into the club. But when electing the new pope they can chose any of the millions Catholics from any country in the world. Even a dude who only became a priest two weeks ago, and never visited Vatican in his life. They usually elect one of their own, but they don't have to.It's easy to imagine a country that's very generous with voting rights, but makes it very restrictive on who can be elected. Like when only a members of the ruling family are serious candidates, or maybe no one else is allowed to run. Most democracies are also in this category, to a lesser extreme. For example, in the US, the president has to be citizen by birth and at least 35 years old. The voters just have to be citizens, 18 years old, and not certifiably insane. I think the voting rights of felons vary between states. There is no federal restrictions but states can limit voting rights for certain categories of crimes.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"You folks need to get your house in order, lol.

Labeling AfD as \\"Nazis\\" feels like a complete misrepresentation. The Nazis were responsible for systematic killings and the denial of basic human rights on a horrific scale. AfD has not advocated for violence or anything remotely resembling those atrocities. Without clear evidence of such actions, this comparison seems deliberately inflammatory and designed to shut down debate rather than address legitimate concerns.The comments youve cited from AfD leaders have been interpreted in a way that assumes the worst possible intent. For example, Bj?rn H?ckes remarks about Holocaust remembrance, while poorly received, were part of a broader debate about Germanys historical narrative, not a denial of the Holocaust or a call to repeat Nazi crimes. Similarly, Alexander Gaulands comment about the Nazis being a speck of bird poop in German history was insensitive, but it appeared to focus on the larger context of German history, not on trivializing Nazi atrocities. These statements can be criticized without mischaracterizing them as evidence of Nazi ideology. How am I supposed to change my view when such interpretations seem so deliberately skewed?AfDs actual policy positions, as far as I understand them, are focused on issues like immigration control, public safety, and the proper use of taxpayer money. These are contentious topics, but they dont strike me as inherently violent, discriminatory, or suppressive of rights. For instance, their stance on limiting immigration and promoting cultural integration is a debate that many countries have without being labeled Nazis. If Im missing something here, Id like to understand it, but so far, I dont see how these policies justify such an extreme label.The accusation that AfD wants to deport German citizens of non-ethnic-German heritage also seems misleading. From what Ive read, their policies are aimed at addressing illegal immigration and the integration of migrants, not stripping citizenship or targeting people based on ethnicity. If theres evidence to the contrary, Id appreciate seeing it, but right now this feels like another exaggerated claim meant to discredit them rather than engage with their actual positions.AfDs criticism of Merkels open-border policies is also being portrayed as hateful or extremist, but I see it as a reaction to policies that strained public resources and raised safety concerns for many citizens. These concerns seem valid, and the rise of AfD appears to be a direct result of them. Labeling them Nazis feels like a way to dismiss these grievances without addressing the underlying issues. Why is criticizing a policy that many citizens disagree with automatically equated with extremism?Equating AfD to Nazis doesnt seem productive or accurate. It shuts down meaningful discourse and prevents us from discussing real issues like public resource allocation, immigration policy, and leadership accountability. If AfDs policies are flawed, Im open to hearing arguments about that, but extreme comparisons like this dont convince me to change my view.If Im wrong about any of this, I genuinely want to understand why. However, these accusations and interpretations dont seem to hold up under scrutiny. How can I change my view when what Im being presented with feels more like an emotional smear than a substantive critique?","title":"CMV: Musk and AfD Are Actually Targeted for Exposing Harmful Leadership Policies"},{"text":"Upstate NY?

Not even the kremlin is moronic enough to think that trump will just let them take ukraine. Russia didn't pull out because it is currently winning. They are making slow but steady progress, and their economy is doing better than the EU economy is. They didn't need to do huge waves of mobilization, while ukraine needs to hunt people down to press them into service, because they simply have a smaller population. They could support a war economy for about a decade without issues, because they have no state debt, and a totalitarian nightmare suppressing any public discontent soviet style. This is not the case for the west. It's utterly absurd that you can't see this. Russia has been winning continuously since the winter counteroffensive in 2022. With the failed 2023 spring, then summer offensive, ukraine has continuously lost lives and territory with nothing to show for it, despite increased weapons deliveries from the west.  \\nSure, russians lost a lot of men, a lot more than ukraine, but guess what russia has used in every single major war they were ever involved in? Masses of meatshileds with zero remorse. Because they have a massive populace, and a society that celebrates subjugating yourself to the cause.Numerically it is not possible for Ukraine to win the war. It would be nice if they could, it would be right. But you need to differentiate wishful thinking from fact.  \\nTheir economy, their population, their territory, and their industry is is a fraction of the russian one. As such it was clear from the start that the best outcome would be a negotiated peace with security guarantees for both sides, at a point when ukraine is powerful.EVERYTHING beyond that is the military industrial complex deluding the general populace into \\"oh just let a few more thousand ukrainians die, the russians will give up any minute now\\" while they got absolutely filthy rich with the new incoming orders.  \\nIt's despicable and you should not fall for it.Is it unfair that russia is not going to massively lose? Hell yea. Would it make sense to just stick your head in the sand because this reality is so bad, and wait until all of ukraine is genocided? Hell no. You need to deal with the fact that defeating russia in a land war is not going to happen this time either, and try to plan for the best eventuality.  \\nThis is why anyone not pushing for a ceasefire - when it became clear that the summer counteroffensive of 2023 failed at the latest - is only serving the interests of russia, or the warmachine.Again, to really hammer this home, there is and was absolutely NO analysis ever suggesting any reasonable way for russia to just pull out. The \\"with the certainty of continued arms to Ukraine, Russia woulda pulled out a while ago\\" thing is complete and utter nonsense supported by zero evidence, or rational analysis. It's wishful thinking.And with a continued conflict the chances of NATO stepping in and thus starting a world war would have continuously increased. THAT.

Furthermore, you aren't considering the fact that federal guidelines do not change after they have been modified by case law, which has happened many times in the course of our history, and for many reasons. Going off of the information you provided, for example, one would assume that an 11-year-old could be tried (and sentenced) for a capital offense.Also, I did bring up culpability ?? My comment was pertaining to your red herring, in which you brought up other countries with other systems, as that was outside of the original argument being made.[Quick addition: most recent #s I could find were for 2019. Roughly 700,000 minors were arrested and charged that year, and about 3% were charged as adults. This also exposes a weird legal gray area pertaining mostly to the authority of juvenile courts, as the bulk of that 3% would be minors who were so close to turning 18 that they would effectively not face any consequences whatsoever if charged as minors.

He didnt have to be a good choice for voters, he just had to outrun the other choice.He hasnt bothered to be principled, consistent, wise, or any of those other things we think we want in a leader. He stirred up every resentment he could and made up a few new ones along the way, and slapped Democrats with all of them. In easy-to-understand terms, always moving on to the next thing when the last thing didnt stick.And Democrats did what they do, pulling out the college sociology words, the pronouns and rainbows, always reminding imperfect people of the things they resent  that they have to watch what they say (lest they get it wrong) and feel guilty about their privileges while they feel like the world is going to hell anyway and they are losing ground financially and socially.Heres where I would challenge you to reconsider your view, though: While all of that may be 100% true and they do need to work on a message that feels less judgy, less smug, less preachy, and more accepting of people who dont have a perfect set of progressive attitudes  they still came this close to winning.This despite (1) starting with the first Octogenarian to ever run for POTUS [seriously, an aging leader who hasnt fostered a next generation of leaders has already failed at the job], (2) a failed idiot assassin making a folk hero of the other guy, (3) running a last-minute default (i.e., VP) candidate who was selected by the old white guy who said he was only considering black women for the job and (4) the active interference of the LITERAL richest human on Earth with ownership and control of the loudest social media mob-building machine in existence.So, while your point is valid (and Democrat voters acting flabbergasted that anyone with a brain voted for Trump are NOT helping) they went into this race with heavy weights around their ankles.

Places like France had just come out of a losing war, violently repressed its own capital, then struggled in an unstable period of infighting and other issues such as rampant antisemitism. Europe at the time was messy, they were few good places to be.Regardless, by the beginning of WWI, the highest GDP per Capita were in Great Britain and Switzerland, who played their cards best in this era.About Switzerland, theyre a great example from History. Their dominion on watchmaking can be traced back entirely to the oppression of Hughenot protestants by France. A small anecdote, that says a lot about the mechanisms. If Trump oppresses LGBTQ people in California, they and their allies with find greener pastures. The USA will be left with more Trump voters, who are on average daft and unable to create any kind of innovation, a few oligarchs like Musk, and less clever people who can actually drive the country forward. Thats exactly what Russia is today. From the superpower the USSR had been, to a regional power that struggles to find a way to invade a minor neighbor.Siding with rural reactionaries over urban progressives means you bleed brains. Siding with extremist theocrats who read sacred texts all day long wont yield the same results as siding with scientific-minded people regardless of their religion. Oppressing arbitrary categories of people means you lose a lot of good people who will side with your enemies.

He achieved a national bipartisan infrastructure bill to begin rebuilding crumbling roads, bridges, airports, etc. This is something that Trump only talked about doing during his term. Republicans who voted against it were nonetheless happy to brag to their constituents how they were getting money for these projects in their states and districts. He also passed the Chips and Sciences Act, to gain independence from China in the development and production of computer chips and guarantee American research in science and technology. He also capped insulin prices at a maximum of $35 for more Americans and lowered costs for other prescription drugs, insurance and utilities. His administration saw a record increase in the number of new housing units being built in the last 50 years. He enacted a minimum corporate tax so that billion dollar companies no longer get away with paying zero tax.

One's age does not determine the value of one's opinion.  However, I think you're looking at it the wrong way. Universal suffrage is not about the value of someone's opinion. It's about an essential right. Essential rights must not be linked to skill acquisition, but to the persons themselves. Since we know that for example young children cannot make reasoned political decisions or something like that, there needs to be some types of limits to who has those rights.

Someone in their 20s or 30s was 17 once. The opposite is not true.(2) The law doesnt only apply to them. Other people (ie their parents) will be expected to deal with the consequences as well. To play devils advocate, if there were psychological or physical or social consequences of the abortion. Conversely, if they have a kid, the parents are also going to be on the hook for their grandkid if the 17yo cant take care of the kid.This is not to say that every 17-year-old is identically immature. However the law needs a simple objective criteria to draw the line for voting age, and thats what we have. I would subjectively argue that the worse issue here are people who subscribe to wistful thinking and ignorance about the consequences, and that is not exclusively tied to age.Also, who decides what a freedom is? Because now whoever that is has a lot of power over that group. Is exercising self-defense in response to threatening behavior a freedom? Because now that opens the door to 5-year-olds voting on person-to-person violence, or gun control.That being said, your POV is deeply imbued in country identity (no taxation without representation) so I dont think this is a very unusual ideal to hold.

That failed due to luck and a few brave capitol officers.Trump got elected again, and now has four whole years to ensure he doesn't lose the next election.\\"But he can't run again!\\" He has the supreme court on his side.

We're beyond fucked. Remember the chrisofascist president of the heritage foundation:The president of the Heritage Foundation said, We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.They have no intentions of giving up power or ruling a democracy. They've got the supreme court. They've got the executive. They've got a slim majority in congress, but that doesn't matter with the other two. What do you think happens if Trump just starts jailing a handful of people in Congress? Yknow, just those who refuse to go along with his coup. Well now that majority is a lot more solid, and nobody is going to step out of line unless they want to be next.The supreme court will just say \\"Yep, presidential immunity!

Universal suffrage is obviously inherently unjust, because it treats unequal things as equal. Not everyone's opinion on how the government should run or what the laws should be is equal, since some people are wiser or better informed than others. However, we've found it difficult to determine a process by which we can ensure that only the people who are responsible enough to vote are allowed to while not disenfranchising anyone who deserves to vote. Universal suffrage for those over the age of majority, who have not been convicted of certain felonies, is the compromise position. We as a society have decided that the benefits outweigh the damage done by having few restrictions on who can vote, as opposed to say, only property owners or those who can pass a test.We should not count the vote of a 6 year old who votes at random, because their vote is all but guaranteed to be poorly chosen. Ideally, we also wouldn't count the vote of a 30 year old who chooses at random. There may be a truly gifted 6 year old who could vote well, and we all know there are a lot of adults who can't. The difference is that we know for sure that the vast majority of 6 year olds are too incompetent to vote, while we've decided the majority of 30 year olds are competent. It's an imperfect system; it's a rough guess to try to achieve the best outcome. Now, the exact age where someone is mature enough to vote is going to be different for every individual, and we could quibble about whether it ought to stay at 18 or go up or down, but fundamentally due to the nature of human development, there exists somewhere along the line between conception and death from old age where the majority of people are going to reach a level of cognitive and emotional development where they'll be capable of responsibly exercising their franchise. We've decided that competency tests are not a reliable way to decide who's allowed to vote, so age and felony status are really the best options we have left.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"Its a big club, and you aint in it.

Have you considered that the topic at hand is one of ethics, not logic?If it pertains to values and standards in regard to human systems and human conduct, it's ethical. \\"Logic\\" is essentially a collection of told tools to help us determine if something is true. Many of your own replies in this very thread involve logical fallacies. That doesn't make you wrong, because this is not an argument of logic. Here's where ethics kick in:You're basically describing a situation in which people much choose between two \\"rights\\" (as in right versus wrong, not correct versus incorrect).  To do so, they must assign a value to that which is good, and a value to that which is right (as in \\"just\\").Good: beneficial, desirable\\nRight: morally required, generally more objectiveYes, logic certainly has a place in ethics, but if we could solve ethical dilemmas using logic alone, there would be no reason to have ethics. So, having said that, I'll give this one a go...\\"Having a say\\" has taken on many forms throughout history. Democracy, although not a new idea, has expanded and evolved. Mistakes in the past, referenced by you as well as others, have been corrected, sometimes incorrectly. For example; women are *still* not citizens, according to the constitution. However, the constitution was amended to give them the right to vote. And, of course, blacks were not allowed to vote until about 90 years after the finding of the United States. It's also true that women cannot be drafted, even though the draft age was the primary catalyst for the voting age to be lowered. Rights come with responsibilities. Suppose your idea that everyone outside of the womb should be able to vote. Do you then agree that they should be held to the same standards as everyone else? If a toddler can vote, for instance, shouldn't they do hard time in a jail cell for \\"stealing\\" a piece of candy from the kid sitting next to them, then hitting the kid who tried the candy back? You have 2 arguments here that I can think of (probably more, here's the two that came to mind):(1) Something about how they could vote against any/all laws currently on the books, and would therefore not have to worry about it. (2) They *should* be held to the same standard. That's just an asshole take for a lot of reasons ??So let's just rule out toddlers for a minute. Should 13 year old girls be charged for slamming their bedroom door (that is an aggravating factor when considering domestic violence charges against adults in some states). Should a parent be able to evict a 14-year-old without having any legal obligation to support them whatsoever?I'm not even offering a set opinion on the matter, OP. I'm just hoping that you'll consider the ethics pertaining to the matter at hand. Children are wards for a reason. Yes, the voting age is arbitrary. But so is the age at which we gain majority status. And maybe you could lower one without lowering the other, but by doing so, you're also *intentionally* giving one group quite a bit of power over everyone else, which is exactly what society has been trying to rectify for a very, very long thing.Regards!","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"I was confused by this comment and meant to circle back to it.

When they're 15, we let them make their decisions about what to do when they're left alone at home or if they want to go eat outside, we let them start managing money. It's a gradual evolution in responsibility and choice following the evolution of the kid. So of course we're not gonna let a 5 year old decide if they want to get vaccinated or not.

We recognize that people have certain rights, and when unable to exercise them due to things like mental impairment or incompetence those rights can be exercised on their behalf by a legal guardian. Someone can be a legal guardian of an adult that is incapacitated by a mental or physical disability, but also the parents are the legal guardians of their children. So if children have a right to having their views represented in law then it is up to the adults to decide what those views are. If you want to change my view, make it make logical sense to me (which will of course require that you first make it make logical sense to yourself) that whether or not a person's opinion has value ought to have anything to do with how many times the Earth has orbited the sun.I think we can all agree that a 3-year-old isn't mentally competent to make their own decisions. They cannot vote because their opinion isn't sufficiently valuable to justify counting. At some point they will grow up enough that they are mentally competent and their opinion *is* valuable enough to count. Society has decided that age is 18 years old. In reality of course there are children that mature at a different rate and a comprehensive mental evaluation might judge that someone younger than that point is mentally competent or also that someone older is *not* mentally competent. But all that would be highly subjective and unreasonably burdensome to implement.That then is the connection to \\"how many times Earth has orbited the sun\\". Orbiting the sun relates to time, time maturing relates to mental competency, mental competency relates to our valuation of someone's opinion. Why shouldn't the minor girls to whom the law would have applied and only applied have had the right to voice theirs?Because if we followed that principle then if we made a law relating to 3-year-olds then only 3-year-olds could vote on it. But their views are bad and nobody cares, so we collectively decided that was a stupid idea.A 17-year-old is still technically a child, squeaking in just under the age of majority. Parents are legally responsible for the health of their child and while I am sure 17-year-olds have strong opinions, it makes a lot of sense for the adults bearing legal responsibility for their child's health to have a deciding voice on such a health-related procedure.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"See the thing is.

We citizens want to see all criminals, regardless of race or gender or other identities, face the same penalties regardless of their privilege (this is rarely the case). We want to see all citizens, regardless of status or wealth, have the same benefits and opportunities as their countrymen (this is also rarely the case). So the question of legal participation in lawmaking, it makes sense we would also strive for fairness and equality. Each person that is affected should have an equal say in the matter. Thats the basis of a fair and just society. But in reality, the edge cases reveal that this isnt so cut and dry. Should criminals have the same rights and benefits and normal citizens? Take for example a shop owner of a convenience store. Should they be expected to treat a shoplifter and a regular customer the same? No, that would be ridiculous. This would present a danger to society, the criminal would not be punished, and see incentives to further commit crimes.Your main point seems to concern childrens rights to vote. Similar issues are at stake. Kids are not the best logical thinkers, they make irrational decisions, lack knowledge of the world in many areas, and are heavily influenced by people around them (parents especially). These factors make it difficult to trust them in the decision making process, and they present an (unintentional) risk to society. To be fair, adults are many of these things too. But theres a reason we dont employ children to use heavy machinery or run our space program. There are simply too many things they dont know and arent able to comprehend. The risks with adults are lower in general. Laws on the drinking age or voting age help ensure social safety the same way shoplifting laws guarantee safety. We have collectively decided that society is better off if these laws are in place, regardless of the desires of the impacted groups. I dont think anyone would argue that we should get rid of shoplifting laws because shoplifters feelings are hurt.Basically, kids are stupid and we have laws to keep them in check to have a functioning society.Also Im not going to dive into the abortion issue because thats an entire beast unto itself but you get the general idea of what Im saying hopefully.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":" The vote can't be extended to children because they would be compelled to vote by others.Literally everyone is compelled to vote by others.

Almost no votes are done wisely anyway, almost all countries are ran horribly inefficiently, laws don't make sense, and it's fairly clear that if you ask the average voter about the how the democratic system works, or how the systems of the things he has political opinions on work, he has no clue or grossly misinterpreted it.Democracy is not about people making the correct, wise decision, if you want that, install an elitocracy where only well educated persons who demontrate a minimum level of competency can vote. Democracty is fundamentally about stopping tyranny of the minority and ensuring that the government can't go against the wishes of the people.The average person is far too stupid to effectively decide how a country should be operated and it's blatantly obvious from all the absolutely asinine laws that are voted into existence; it's not about voting wise, it's indeed about giving people about whom laws are a voice to stop them from being oppressed. Are you actually telling me the people that voted on Brexit, for or against, had even the slightest clue what it was about and what it would mean? Of course not, 95% of those who voted had no clue.

They were asked to say yes or no to a vaguely worded statement with the message Oh, specifics come later after you've already voted.\\". The only sane response of sane people who actually care and reason strategically is to demand specifics first, but almost no one did that, because electorates do not make decisions by thinking things through and weighing the odds and costs and benefits; they make decisions based on emotional gut feeling.If the current system work well enough; I see no issue with allowing 4 year olds to vote as well.

The laws in USA and many developed countries are actually all over the place on how young a child can be to be married.Many places a young girl can be impregnated and if parents consent to marriage then it's not statutory rape.There are people who want to overturn this.Ie, a guy my age (mid 40s) commits what the law says is statutory rape of a 10 year old and impregnates her, it doesn't matter how the girl feels or her parents feel, some people feel we should make it a federal law across the USA that he should face the penalty for statutory rape. And he shouldn't have a loophole that he can just marry her and it's ok.I'm all for passing that law.You can vote for it (close the loophole that he can marry her and escape consequences) or against it.But the 10 year old doesn't get to vote. For nor against.If one vote is granting her rights (I would say it makes her safer, ie the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, also, swift and sure justice, and some other basic human rights) then, inherently, a vote in the other direction does the opposite.You can't have a vote that legislates rights and freedoms unless a vote the other way does the opposite and restricts rights.Also the constitution of the USA explicitly states that rights are basically not for the government to grant, they are endowed by the creator, inalienable, and it is the job of the state to acknowledge them.

Our society has generally agreed that individuals who are still in the \\"immature\\" stages of life are unqualified to make \\"mature\\" decisions regarding the fate of the country.A case could be made, however, that this is roughly equivalent to restricting women from voting because they're \\"too emotional\\" or blacks from voting because they're \\"not as intelligent as whites.\\" Someone will always have a reason to strip consent from those whose freedoms they wish to curtail.So why not let anyone capable of understanding speech vote for their own interests?

Children are, for good reason, not extended  full rights in the same way other groups are. We subject them to curfews, force them to spend a vast majority of the day institutionalized in school until at least 16. A practice that would rightfully be compared to the horrors of slavery and colonialism if applied to any other group, due to the restriction of freedom of movement. Because children are held to a different standard than the rest of us, and if they werent wed have to do away with something as civilization-altering-ly important as public education, the struggles they face, and the laws we pass against them are patently different than the examples of slavery and colonization youre trying to compare to. Especially since they dont even have to do with the rights we take away from children, but with the rights we extend to the people responsible for those children.The logic here is simple:  for the good of society we have to temporarily but severely curtail the rights of children in a way that wouldnt pass moral muster on any other group. The stunning difference between their situation, and that of the people who had to suffer taxation without representation (a very different set of restrictions on freedom) is staggering.

And the purpose of voting is so those individuals can ensure that the government secures their freedom. But freedom doesnt simply apply to children because children arent able to independently think and act for their lives. Children cant know how to vote for their freedom, for whats best for their life. Some things are a violation of the childs freedom, but obviously there are many things that parents should do to their kids that would be a violation of the freedom of adults. Like, its not a violation of a childs freedom for a parent to put their child to bed, but you should go to jail if you try to force an adult to go to bed. So, the question becomes by what criteria should the law use to decide when a child gains his full legal rights. Age is the best criteria. Children become able to think for themselves when they get old enough. Age is easy to prove in comparison to other things. Everyone comes of age, so getting your voting rights is inevitable. Age makes it very difficult to disenfranchise voters of their voting rights. If you dont have anything better than age, then youre not serious about freedom. Because getting this right is important for freedom. Whats your alternative?

Bullshit. It's 99.99% responsibility. It's mostly about adults (parents, teachers, family services) have to spend significant amounts of money and are subject to rules and regulations.For the most part those rules are a burden on adults not on kids. We can't have child labor. Kids are entitled to education. Rules on child support. Etc.The concept as I understand it when it comes to the specific law you brought up is mainly that a doctor's responsibility carries more weight vs the parents. It's between the girl mother and her doctor and parents if some laws are passed) might not get to know about it at all.As I understand it the basic justification is in part that for many cases the parents have badly fucked up, ie incest or failure to protect. Basically if they're good parents the mother is going to tell them and seek their counsel, some of the laws are aimed at the cases where the parents have pretty well screwed up and that's why the law empowers the physician, another adult with full voting powers, to care for the child and override parental roles and authority.4) one major thing you're ignoring is that abortions are a surgery that costs money. Where is that to come from? For the most part a minor doesn't have the funds.Sure, I'm all for some kind of universal health care - but that just leads right back to an even broader topic that all healthcare legislature affecting kids is subject to these same arguments.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"I often think back to this [Chris Hayes interview on the Late Show](https://youtu.be/qFk8dEGEtqo?si=1JTEZR2nBJKZuMLs).I'll let it speak for itself, but he hits the nail on the head of what the toll is for letting yourself have whatever words fell out of Trump's thumbs at 3am be what wakes you up or starts your morning.","title":"How to Not Lose It Completely During Trumps Second Presidency"},{"text":"These days , the US Military is the final guardrail of our constitutionWhich is exactly why the fascists want to infiltrate and dismantle its principled leadership","title":"Supreme Court won't stop Trump sentencing in \\"hush money\\" criminal case"},{"text":"Without actually reading this, I was thinking its less about official acts and more about whether sentencing would significantly impair Trumps ability to fulfill his presidential duties (or in this case some of the transition stuff in prepping his administration, which for serious presidents is serious work).","title":"Supreme Court rules 5-4 that Trump's hush money trial and conviction are NOT covered by Presidential Immunity and sentencing can go ahead tomorrow"},{"text":"The republicans then used footage of him wrestling against girls, something they forced him to do, to prove why anti trans sports bans are necessary.","title":"GOP introduces bill to let people sue trans folks for using the bathroom.

Say you have a child who contracts an infection in their arm. The doctors give the child medicine and in hopes that the infection will no longer spread and will eventually get better. After a few days, the doctors note that the infection is spreading despite treatment, and removal of the limb is necessary in order to save your child's life. Now answer this, should the child get a vote?What if the child really enjoys sports, and the removal of the limb would forever inhibit the child's enjoyment of their favorite activity. They will die in about a month or two if the limb isn't removed, but they could enjoy their time doing what they love before then if no you choose not to intervene. On the other hand, the child is young and could learn to adapt with only one arm, but the child, not seeing reason, refuses to get the life-saving surgery. What would u do as a parent? There are limitations to who gets a vote in important decisions such as these because many people who have yet to reach adulthood do not have the knowledge or reasoning or maturity to understand the implications of their decisions. You could argue that many adults still have this problem. To that, I would agree, but there has to be a line, and that line is drawn to reflect the majority, not the fringe cases or the outliers.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"No I mean before women got the right to vote people might've (still looking for evidence) argued that husbands could vote on their wife's interests","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"I think you've misunderstood my point.
