I believe it does have a lot to do with mental health issues too. I lost a friend of 13 years. When I met her she was happy, married and with kids. About 5 years ago she became a liberal lunatic (she is now divorced, alone and non-binary) She is more concerned about womens rights-yet hates being a woman (which these rights arent being taken away) and her changing into a man all of the sudden (wants it to be funded by tax payers very upset it probably wont be anymore) than any real issues in this country. Through all of it Ive been her friend and take the high road and dont discuss politics or ignore comments she makes since she will constantly bash conservatives and Trump and expect me to heel. This election she went insane and baited me yet again and I decided I wasnt going to allow her to spread fake news and lies so she threw me away like garbage (pun intended). She no longer will speak to me because Im a white women conservative, misogynist racist who is politically beneath her- told me Im not intelligent enough to have political conversations with her- when its simply just because I dont agree with her or fact check her.  She hates the fact Im married to a black conservative man with mixed child when she thinks he should be a liberal (like they have ever done anything for the black community) meanwhile, she is a crazy white passing liberal ( 1/8 black) who shaved her head and cuts off anyone who doesnt call her by her made up man name or her pronouns, hates successful black men who think for themselves and criticizes my husband who works hard about how we spend our money to take the kids on vacations and arent struggling to get by. Its really bizarre. I think liberals want minorities to be oppressed so they have the upper hand. Its a sick and twisted game they play calling republicans racist when if you look at the history, its them. Its always been them.

But the close relationships that Kushner developed with leaders in the region over Trumps first four years in office and maintained in recent years will be hard to replicate, sources told CNN.Some former diplomats and critics of the Trump administration point out that Kushner has significant financial interests in the region, but many regional diplomats recognize the value of the deep relationships he has formed.No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust. Jared earned it, he didnt have it at the beginning. He earned it. That takes time to build, said a regional diplomat who worked with Kushner during his time at the White House, noting that Kushner was relatively unknown to most players in the region before he became chief Middle East negotiator in the first Trump administration.Those sentiments are widespread.","title":"Jared Kushner expected to be pivotal to Trump admins Middle East efforts without taking a formal job"},{"text":"Is this possibly (part of) the [little secret](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/speaker-mike-johnson-secret-with-trump-election-house/) Johnson and Trump shared?..","title":"Speaker Johnson moves to block release of ethics report on Matt Gaetz"},{"text":"Vance described Trump as America's Hitler just a few years ago, and now he's Trump's VP-elect.

Harry Potter is a flat arc that has lots of flat characters. The purpose of flat arcs with flat characters is the lesson is *who prevails and why*. So the commentary on human nature isn't occurring at the individual level. It is using the characters for the moral lessons even when the characters don't act like normal humans. Other types of narrative arcs usually require the character to undergo some sort of change. That's the premise of the well-known hero's journey. In flat arcs, the character will have a belief/skill/whatever, get tested, and emerge the same. The point is showing that \\"good wins because our virtuous good guy remained virtuous even when they win.\\" Umbridge is an example where she doesn't change but she's used to teach that power has corrupting potential (and how those thirsting for power can gravitate towards those who promise it and that's why people support evil) and such people lose. What you are looking for is more of a hero's journey or other arc where the characters are round and undergo change. It is in these arcs that characters behave more rationally compared to real world counterparts. The idea is that external circumstances changes people but those changes reveal an inner truth. What Harry Potter is doing is \\"see, Harry was virtuous because under pressure he did the virtuous thing no matter what.\\"James we don't even get to know, we just get told that he was one of the good guys despite of him being a sadistic bully because he was popular in the right social circles (do I see a pattern here?)The thing here is we think of James as a bully because the depictions of him mostly come from Snape's memories. And Snape was antagonistic to them but was bested by them. Consider the scene where Ron tried to make slugs come out of Malfoy's mouth but his wand backfired. Imagine that Ron was successful, wouldn't Malfoy think of Ron as a bully if Ron always bested him even though he was the aggressor? But you can glean here and there - like a scene where Hagrid, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Fudge were talking about Sirius and James not knowing Harry was there to hear, so assuming it is closer to truth, they're talked about as pranksters. The point of their characters is to be a parallel to the Weasley twins. If you look at Harry's social group and James's, you see there's an equivalent for each. You also saw tons of virtuous examples and why they're seen as proof that love wins all. Like how James stands up for muggle borns - whereas Snape hated them - or how he stood buy his warewolf pal, joined a force that stood up against genocidal evil, etc.The whole point of James as a character is to show a blue print of self sacrifice is worth it if you're dying for the right reason, which is what lead Harry to give himself up in the 7th book. Every character in HP is proving that love wins all, and that individual talent alone is not enough, and that the quest for all power will leave a person alone and dead, etc. It's just a story of flat arcs to prove truths of the human condition the author believes in but that requires each character to not act like a normal human but act like a character in a book.","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"We are going on 8 years of people who should know better being completely caught off guardI have come to the conclusion that the average American, on either side of the aisle for that matter, does not consume any legitimate journalism on a regular basis.

It's quite rare for a Prime Minister's term to be shorter than the maximum 5 years. Minority Governments where the PM didn't get a true majority of the vote do fall very early sometimes, but usually they just make a supply and demand agreement with one of the other parties on their side of the aisle to support them in any votes of no-confidence, so they usually survive the full five years too.

If a kid wants to try out social transition toward male for example -it wont work very well if people still yell come on ladies when addressing a group theyre in, or passively address them as missy, miss thing, girl, girlie, etc. when people talk to other people theres usually a lot of gendered extras, how is that always forgotten?","title":"Transgender-rights advocates say the election of Trump and his allies marks a major setback"},{"text":"He wife might be divorcing him already, but she definitely will if he tries some shit like this.","title":"Pence Urges Republican Senators Not to Confirm R.F.K.

That said, the high tariffs *could* be a catalyst for Stagflation: goods produced in foreign markets become more expensive, meaning that businesses that rely upon them for production shed jobs and the economy stagnates but the goods used by consumers also become more expensive, and inflation jumps. Similarly, domestic goods become more expensive (price gouging caused by shrunken supply increasing demand) but as infrastructural development lags (likely on account of the tariffs: we lack the machines necessary to build the machines to increase domestic supply) supply remains low, prices remain high, and inflation remains strong while jobs do not develop apace. So yeah. Stagflation.Edit: in the early 2020s, it looked like we would encounter Stagflation as a consequence of the Covid Supply Chain shocks, but the Biden Administration mostly managed to stick the soft landing, controlling inflation without initiating a long recession.

Maybe for some under the table work.  But if you work at a large farm, you'll usually get paid at least minimum wage sometimes considerably more.  Construction will pay even more.  The bigger issue is workplace safety, since speaking up can get you thrown out of the country.  Would some Americans work these jobs if the salaries went up some?  Sure, but given we're at nearly full employment already, it will be hard to fill these jobs if we send all these workers back, not to mention the logistics of such an action.  So, prices will increase and the economy will have a very severe recession likely worse than the economic collapse of 2008 if we implement this mass deportation.The other much better solution, which may not seem that fair to legal immigrants, is to find a pathway for these people to stay here, work and if they contribute to our nation for many years will eventually have a pathway to citizenship.  This would involve a penalty, some sort of large fine being paid, and then a lengthy say around 15 year process to citizenship.Also, we need a better way at determining labor needs that are unlikely to go filled by Americans so we know how many workers visas we can offer, so rather than come and stay here illegally, workers can come here legally.  Right now, some of these visas are offered, but not nearly the numbers needed.  Most of these solutions have been offered by Democrats with complimentary border security measures by Republicans.  Best example was the gang of eight bill that easily passed the Senate (controlled by Republicans) in Obama's 2nd term, but was killed by House Republicans.  There was a similar bill during the Bush administration which Democrats should have accepted because it was actually more favorable for Dems to what Obama agreed to in the gang of eight bill.  Seems like the longer the immigration issue drags on the more anti-immigrant the nation becomes making it harder to end up with a reasonable and humane solution that will significantly reduce the number of undocumented immigrants in our country.","title":"Rand Paul plans to bring back Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' policy as Senate chair"},{"text":"Do you have a link to that story?

I looked up the Economic Report of the President where he asked for the law. I looked up newspaper coverage from 1963.Everything Griffin said turned out to be true. Everything Marrs claimed was wrong. You could tell Marrs was wrong just by reading the executive order. It didn't even match what he said.","title":"President Trump may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to pay off the entire US debt and effectively END the FED"},{"text":"And any of the moderates that had even a remote of bipartisan rational in their head supported Harris.It's not an argument to say that we've lost our democracy in a sense.

The reason I have decided to not attend tomorrows sentencing in person is because it would only increase my pain. Nonetheless, I write to ask Your Honor to sentence the defendant to time in prison.Biden said that Harris theft of her diary and other items constitute one of the most heinous forms of bullying, not to mention a complete violation of my privacy and personal dignity.After being the victim of a crime in my early twenties, I developed PTSD, Biden wrote, without detailing the nature of that crime.The journal that was stolen was part of my efforts to heal. I am a private citizen, targeted only because my father happened to be running to be President. In other words, the extensive work I have done to move past my trauma was undone by Ms. Harriss actions.Biden also wrote, The defendants actions have created a constant environment of anxiety, fear, and intimidation in which my innermost thoughts are constantly distorted and manipulated.She also wrote that despite the theft happening more than three years ago, while Joe Biden was running for president, because of the publicity it drew  exactly as Ms. Harris intended  I am constantly re-traumatized by it.I will forever have to deal with the fact that my personal journal can be viewed online, Biden wrote. Repeatedly, I hear others grossly misinterpret my once-private writings and lob false accusations that defame my character and those of the people I love.Her actions were not only re-traumatizing to me, but constituted a horrific trauma in and of themselves. This ongoing harm is a direct result of Ms. Harriss intentional actions, the letter said.In asking Sweeney to sentence Harris to prison and a long period of probation, Ashley wrote: She should be held accountable for what she has done.Not only did she demonstrate a complete lack of morality, but she lacks any respect for the rule of law as well, Biden wrote. I have spent much of my life trying to speak up for those who cannot find their voices. I am fortunate enough to have found mine, and I use it today  and every day  to make sure that bullies are held accountable.Finally, I worry that a non-incarceratory sentence will send a message  to her and to others like her  that it is okay to violate and exploit others for your own personal gain, regardless of the humiliation and pain it causes, Biden wrote. Please send a message that these types of damaging criminal actions will not be tolerated.","title":"Why are the GOP running a shadowy conspiracy to protect politicians who are sex predators? \\"WHAT ARE THEY HIDING?\\""},{"text":"Keep dreaming they'll do exactly as their daddy tells them too","title":"Gaetz Nomination Seen as Doomed by Some Senate Republicans, More Than 30 Republican Senators Might Vote No"},{"text":"No shit!","title":"Muslim Voters In Michigan Are Starting To Regret Their Choice After Trump Win: Trump Is Playing Us'"},{"text":"Most republican voters are over 50.

Again, if you think the odds of a child deciding to continue unobstructed puberty are low and it's better for the trans community as a whole to take that chance say that but don't called the blockers reversible. Hormonal birth control isn't reversible to a developing body but a pregnancy would be leagues worse.Trans kids should get to have the puberty they want and control of the development of their own bodies. On the whole I agree with you. I think if they render themselves infertile they can find another way to become a parent.

While there are certainly ways in which both spheres of law overlap, there's already evidence of State-level responses to the Dobbs federal ruling - states have either made constitutional amendments protecting right to abortion, or their State-level Supreme Courts have ruled that the respective State constitution protects the right to abortion. More States have simply codified the right to an abortion, often along the restrictive lines set forth in previous SCOTUS opinions (there were quite a few). To directly answer your question - \\"does that not invalidate the line of reasoning that led to Roe\\" Sorta. At the federal level, yes. But the Dobbs opinion only has the effect of telling people \\"The federal government cannot prevent States (or Federal Congress) from making abortion legal\\". At a practical level, individual health is both a state issue and a federal issue, which often means any massive change in the Federal law is going to be met with a massive amount of lawsuits from any state that doesn't like the change. Which leaves State legislatures.So the current lay of the land - The SCOTUS decisions that went from *Roe v. Wade* up through *Gonzalez v. Carhart* are wiped away. Abortion itself isn't illegal at the Federal level, but individual States can decide to what extent they want to prohibit the procedure within their borders. It's an asinine status quo, made more so by the fact that a bunch of states had \\"trigger laws\\" on the books. These trigger laws were laws that carried no function while *Roe* was in effect, but immediately became binding law in the event that *Roe* was overturned. Kentucky was one of those states.","title":"A pregnant woman sues for the right to an abortion in challenge to Kentuckys near-total ban"},{"text":"I actually wonder if he is a contender to replace the aging upon his inevitable death, Domesticate J.

And framing a fetus as though it's a hostile invader/parasite isn't working either. Both of those stances sound or more to the point *feel* cold and inhumane, frankly, even to a pro-choicer like me. People keep trying to make the other side (in whatever situation) come across to their own point of view instead of starting with the other side's point of view and working from there. If something is right, correct, whatever, there are usually multiple reasons that it is so. Anyway, we need to work within their frame of reference:Even allowing for a fetus to be a human being, absolutely no person or entity has the right to decide between that human being's life and the mother's life except the mother who is carrying it. Frame it as interfering with the *mother's* right to make medical decisions for the child she is carrying. And no one else has the right to make life-or-death decisions about that child except the mother. \\nAbsolutely, there are what some might call \\"selfish\\" abortions although that is entirely subjective. But there is no court or law that has the ability to determine the motivations of someone seeking an abortion, or to prevent the \\"wrong\\" types of abortions without harming actual living humans and it boils down to who has the right to make life-or-death decisions about that fetus given a life-and-death situation, and it's not a remote government official or a law. It's the one carrying the child.

After a year on HRT, if they still show marked and sustained dysphoria and want surgery, the doctors could approve it if parents agree and it is deemed medically necessary.

Usually, I find this ethos despicable; in my experience, suffering only begets more suffering. Im making an exception, however, for Donald Trumps nomination of the former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, a flagrant provocation that is, like a pulpy B movie, so bad its good.\\nWhile Trumps choice of Gaetz to lead the Justice Department is a clear sign that his second administration will be catastrophically chaotic, vengeful and corrupt, that should never have been in doubt. Trump made no secret during his campaign of his desire to persecute his political enemies. Anyone he chose as attorney general would share his interest in turning the justice system into the enforcement arm of the MAGA movement. The selection of Gaetz just rips the mask off. With it, Trump is trolling not just his defeated opponents but many of his craven establishment supporters. Its like Caligula trying to make his horse a consul.Of all the people Trump was considering for A.G., Gaetz is unique mainly for how much he is hated by other Republicans, and not just moderate ones. In the final months of the last Trump administration, the Justice Department opened an?investigation?into whether Gaetz had a relationship with an underage girl that violated federal sex trafficking laws. Though that inquiry was closed without charges, the House opened an ethics investigation into him. It was reportedly set to vote on releasing a damning report on Friday, which Gaetz may have tried to pre-empt by resigning, though it could still become public.When Gaetz was accused of sleeping with the girl, theres a reason why no one in the conference came and defended him, Markwayne Mullin, a very conservative Republican senator from Oklahoma,?toldCNN last year. His colleagues, said Mullin, had seen videos of the girls that he had slept with, which Gaetz allegedly showed off on the House floor. After Gaetz forced Kevin McCarthy out as House speaker, throwing his party into disorder, Mike Rogers, a Republican congressman from Alabama, seemed ready to physically attack him and had to be?restrained?by colleagues.\\nIt should go without saying that Gaetz is not, by any normal standards, even a tiny bit qualified to be attorney general. He practiced law for only about two years before running for office, handling small-time civil matters, like?suing?an old woman for money she owed his fathers caregiving company.His chief credential is not his mastery of the law but his contempt for it. Were proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 to make legitimate arguments about election integrity, he?told?Steve Bannon in 2022. Hes called for abolishing both the F.B.I. and the Justice Department unless they come to heel. If confirmed, he will be single-minded in his devotion to carrying out Trumps will without concern for legal niceties.Gaetz is not the only Trump nominee who seems to have been chosen precisely for his hostility to the values of the organization hes supposed to lead. On Thursday, Trump announced plans to make Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nations leading anti-vaxxer, secretary of health and human services. Pete Hegseth, the Fox News weekend host whom Trump wants to put atop the Pentagon  an institution that is supposed to be scrupulously apolitical  wrote a book describing social justice saboteurs as more dangerous to America than any external enemy. During his first administration, when Trump sought to turn the military against left-wing protesters, his defense officials thwarted him. Hegseth, who accused progressive storm troopers of turning our cities into little Samaras, a reference to an Iraqi city besieged by ISIS, would almost certainly have fewer qualms.Its the enemy from within, Trump said of his opponents at a rally last month. All the scum that we have to deal with that hate our country. Thats a bigger enemy than China and Russia. Some of his supporters thrilled to this language, but others convinced themselves that he didnt really mean it. By tapping Gaetz to be the highest law enforcement official in the land, Trump has done us the favor of stripping away whatever plausible deniability remained about his intentions. Its a show of dominance directed more at Republicans than Democrats, meant to make them abase themselves by acquiescing to a nomination they know is indefensible.Some social conservatives are aghast: The Christian legal group Liberty Counsel put out a press releasing describing the choice of Gaetz as shocking and disappointing, and Ben Domenech, co-founder of the right-wing website The Federalist,?called himabsolutely vile, among other insults I cant repeat here. If Gaetz makes it all the way to the confirmation hearings, the proceedings will be a popcorn-worthy carnival of scandal and backbiting. Having won the presidency and both houses of Congress, Trump could have launched his new administration in an atmosphere of confident Republican unity. Instead, it will commence with the crisis, degradation and melodrama that is his natural habitat.\\nIn the end, Id expect almost all Republican senators to fall in line and humiliate themselves by voting for Gaetz. I completely trust President Trumps decision making on this one, Mullin said on CNN on Wednesday, though he added that Gaetz would need to sell himself to the Senate. Even if a small number of senators find the fortitude to reject such a preposterous candidate, Trump may attempt to go around them by employing a never-used constitutional provision to force the Senate into?recess?so he can make appointments without its consent.And if?that?doesnt work, whoever Trump chooses instead of Gaetz will almost certainly be just as destructive, if less flamboyant in his immorality and lust for attention. Trump picked Gaetz, after all, because hes an excellent representative of the MAGA movement.Once Trump won, decent outcomes for the country were probably off the table. The institutions are unlikely to hold. Establishment Republicans cannot be counted on to protect us. The best we can hope for is that our new rulers will be stymied by incompetence, infighting and self-sabotage. In that respect, Gaetz may be just the man for the job.","title":"Matt Gaetz Is the Perfect Man for the Job"},{"text":"We need a reckoning on the left about the fatal political impact of contempt, because we are absolutely drowning in it.","title":"Editor-in-chief of Americas oldest magazine resigns after calling Trump voters fascists"},{"text":"But on the other hand, imagine losing everything because some clown at FEMA has a political axe to grind.?","title":"FEMA sued over damning revelations agency deliberately ignored homes of Trump supporters: Swift legal action"},{"text":"And yet house republicans are today defending him.

The problem with any \\"the ends justify the means\\" approach is that power shifts hands every 4-8 years on average, by design, and any precedents set by getting creative with executive authority or states rights can be used by bad actors future administrations. If Democrats were to go that route it would be smarter for them to do so while Biden is still in office because as of now the sitting President has almost unlimited executive authority. However, we should be limiting executive authority not attempting to expand it even further. Now, Democrats will likely take over the role of obstructionist party, but I doubt they will do shit like play chicken with shutting down government spending. I do not agree with obstructionism in principle because a functioning democratic republic requires cooperation and compromise to get anything of note accomplished. So as party policy I think it's moronic and damaging, but especially with some of the crazier shit that Trump said he was going to do they don't have much of a choice in the short term. I do agree that Democrats need to change their strategy, but it has so much more to do with messaging and campaigning. Democrats need to stop focusing on cultural issues especially whilst campaigning and instead shifting focus almost exclusively to improving the lives of the working class. Many of those cultural issues are comparatively minor and can be addressed without much attention with executive orders and federal guidelines. I would much rather them focus on improving public education (raise teacher pay drastically to address shortages, get rid of standardized testing completely and fund all public schools equally with adjustments made per capita), shift from the completely disastrous enforcement approach to a public health approach to address the drug epidemic, campaign finance reform and blocking members of Congress from trading in attempt to restore at least some measure of public trust. Issues that everyone agrees need addressing so it doesn't take much political capital and if properly addressed would noticeably benefit the lives of average working class citizens. All of those suggestions have proven templates for success so they will work and in most cases save taxpayer money. Healthcare could be included in that, but \\"socialized medicine\\" would cost tremendous political capital even though it would actually be cheaper than our current system and end up drastically driving down the cost of prescription drugs. That would be another example of an issue we could address with a proven template for success though.The Democratic Party needs to rebrand itself as the party of pragmatism and the working class. Now, I have a ton of issues with our government that both sides abuse many of which are related to corporate/special interest money in politics ensuring that our representatives are beholden to them instead of the people they were elected to represent and the lack of pragmatism/cooperation in addressing issues plaguing the working class that don't cost much political capital like the ones I mentioned above. We can't keep going down this road of divisiveness and obstructionism... We just can't. Nothing of substance will ever get done because things like federal guidelines and executive orders will just be reversed by the \\"opposition\\". Americans have to drop this Us vs. Them mentality in our political discourse and the working class needs to stop myopically focusing on culture war issues so we at least have a chance to unite and force corporate money out of the political process because until we do that both major parties will remain beholden to special interests and their corporate overlords instead of their constituents. Until that happens any progress made will be temporary at best and easily reversed by SCOTUS and/or the executive branch. That's a longer term goal unfortunately with Trump in office and multiple billionaires in his administration. I don't understand why people are politically supportive of billionaires, it makes no sense to me. Kamala Harris took a ton of money from billionaires this election cycle as well which bothered me, but I highly doubt she would be putting them in her cabinet as a result. It's pretty blatant corruption and cronyism, but our laws/court rulings currently allow it. I mean if anyone doubted we have a two tier justice system the past few years have rendered that argument moot. It's so clearly obvious that the obscenely wealthy are borderline untouchable unless they fuck over other billionaires and even then white collar crime results in a slap on the wrist in the rare cases they are actually prosecuted. If you struggle with addiction they'll trap you in the system for life, but manipulating markets and lying to investors and stealing millions from pensions gets you a fine that is so insignificant it's viewed as a cost of doing business. And it sure seems like most of the time they don't even attempt to convene a grand jury unless/until media coverage and public pressure forces them to act.","title":"Trump Wants to End Wokeness in Education.

I feel I'm pretty far left and I don't embrace censorship or intolerance of dissent. People are allowed to disagree on things, but when it comes to a person's or group's humanity being questioned, that's where lefties draw the line. The question isn't whether people deserve to access the tangible quality of their rights (i.e., affordable housing, informed and consensual healthcare, robust education etc.). The question is how are those things best delivered to the people. It seems like many center-minded people feel those things are negotiable as concepts, which is where they go wrong. If a free market cannot deliver the best and most equitable policies and structures, they do not have a place in the market. I feel this is pretty reasonable, and I am not at all happy that Trump won even though Democrats are absolutely selling out everyday people to cash in on divisive politics. Our problem is a weak centrist Democratic party, not annoying leftists (yes, I recognize we can be annoying as fuck) who genuinely want better and are the most passionate and devoted base for progressive change.","title":"I hate Trump, but Im glad he won"},{"text":"Its all theaterBig pharma will never give him real power.","title":"Gaetz Nomination Seen as Doomed by Some Senate Republicans, More Than 30 Republican Senators Might Vote No"},{"text":"I need a journalist with balls to ask this clown and his freaks to define woke?!

You support racism and rape. You dont support Taylor swifts boyfriend? You are a misogynist. We have managed to almost completely equalize any good role models or heros for young men out of the equation. And we did it fast as humanly possible with literally no room to grow or make a mistake. We did that and didnt offer up anyone to replace them. Is someone in your class trans and you used their old name by accident?

Only a matter of time before they say fuck it.We cant even make a good comedy movie anymore because everything makes the liberals camp up and shit all over it. Could we make tropic thunder right now? Absolutely not. The liberals have gotten so smart in everything culture related that they can tell you precisely how insufferable they are. Frankly speaking, I think the mask is slipping because people (white men) are tired of trying to be your ally and then immediately shat all over if its not done perfectly every time. Young men have less patience obviously than an adult, so they immediately say fuck it. The republicans have seen that, drilled in on it and liberals have probably permanently lost those voters. They found that gaming culture is where men had a spot to be ding dongs and say stupid shit to edgelord each other and women and pearl clutchers werent lurking en masse ready to attempt to ruin their life with some type of gnarly accusation.  In college I was put in the middle of the class with 4 other white men in an urban studies class, we were told to sit in the middle as there were only 4 of us in this urban studies class, it was when the whole confederate statues thing was popping off. The professor then said ask these white men why the statues are still up or what their opinion of them are. Kennesaw state university, social sciences building behind the Starbucks.

Click those little imbedded hyperlinks in a news article, it's how they cite their sources.  You'll see a domino affect of how the outlets just quote each other without ever naming the actual sources. My recent example, I tried to convince someone that \\"no-fault divorce is going away!\\" was a lie.  Not mentioned in Project 2025, but plenty of articles saying \\"some Republicans\\" want it.  That's a shitty source, not even Wikipedia accepts that as a source lol I click the links through to find WHO wants it.  Turns out there's like a small-time state rep in each of Oklahoma, Texas, etc that wrote a bill to change the terms of divorce in their state.  The bills were so unpopular *they never even came for a vote*.  So how could something that failed in deep red states be popular nationwide?  How could a Conservative SCOTUS not use the 10th Amendment to strike down a national divorce law?

Anyone who thinks that fluoride should be added to everyone else's drinking water either has not studied this issue or else wants to damage people's health.Note that once it is put into our drinking water, fluoride is highly resistant to filtration. Even if its supposed benefits in preventing cavities outweighed its deleterious neurotoxic effects, there would still be far more justification for adding literally hundreds of vitamins, antioxidants, far less toxic and more nutritious minerals, and health supplements to our drinking water. I mean, if you actually think supposedly preventing a dental problem is a justification for adding something to our drinking water, why not add Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and fish oil as well? Why not add naloxone while you are at it? Just think of all of the lives you could save!!!And if anyone actually wants fluoride in their drinking water, why don't they just add it in themselves? Fluoride drops are readily available for anyone who is dumb enough to buy them. And at least that fluoride is pharmaceutical grade instead of the industrial waste that they pollute our drinking water with.The idea that there is some magic, perfect amount of fluoride at which its supposed cavity fighting properties will **always** outweigh its negative health effects for every individual is one of the most bizarre and non-scientific claims in human history.

In case people missed it, there were tons of memes about Walz coming over to ask for your vote, and helping you rotate your tires and change out your air filter. This podcast goes into the currently problems with young boys and young men:  [https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-are-boys-and-men-in-trouble/)Basically, we gave women more options (which is great), but this started changing the expected roles. Women could be homemakers, OR all this new stuff. And men could be breadwinners, or, no, maybe not anymore, men should feel fine if the women are breadwinners. But also don't be stay-at-home-dads bc that makes you kind of a loser. And slowly but surely, the narrative for young men became thinner and thinner, not because we took anything away, but because women expanded into their domain and nobody gave them a new narrative of what that could look like in a good way. Someone like Walz, a teacher, football coach, governor, memes where you do manly things that aren't toxic, etc. That could have courted these young men. Of course it would have been hard; dems were so far behind the curve in this demographic that it might not have mattered. But someone like Walz could have phrased abortion in a way that resonated with young men. \\"You're 23. You're in college. Are you ready to be a breadwinning father? Do you know this girl enough to commit to 18 years of raising a kid? Do you want her to feel trapped or forced to be with you forever? Or do you still want to explore the world a bit.

No.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and is the primary gas blamed for climate change. While sulfur dioxide released in contemporary volcanic eruptions has occasionally caused detectable global cooling of the lower atmosphere, the carbon dioxide released in contemporary volcanic eruptions has never caused detectable global warming of the atmosphere. In 2010, human activities were responsible for a projected 35 billion metric tons (gigatons) of CO2 emissions. All studies to date of global volcanic carbon dioxide emissions indicate that present-day subaerial and submarine volcanoes release **less than a percent** of the carbon dioxide released currently by human activities.","title":"I'd Google this, but I know Google is just going to feed me 50 pages of bullshit.

Not only is neglect a crime, in every state, it is a crime for people to ignore neglect if they know a child is being neglected. A baby that has been born, a baby that has been cut off from the mothers body, no longer receives oxygen or nutrients via the umbilical cord, it no longer uses the mothers body for 24/7 life support, it breathes with its own lungs now (unless it was put on a ventilator for some reason).A baby, will die without human care. period. You are doing mental gymnastics to support your stance here. If if given food, if just left to cry, it will die. The care doesn't have to come from the mother but we as a society have agreed that there are limits to bodily autonomy for the greater good. If a child is in your care, your liberty is legally limited to promote the greater good and this is the most uncontroversial thing for every situation except for people who have a poor understanding for the justification for abortion.As long as umbilical cords exist, a fetus is an extension of a pregnant females body,?So you are now admitting that the justification for abortion is personhood.... What are we even doing here? If a fetus has a right to not die (as anti-abortionists seem to think), then that right was violated the moment a mortal baby was conceived, because death is inevitable after that event. Pro-lifers are bothered by the thought of graves for fetuses, but dont even blink at graves for everyone else who is born.Now you are arguing in bad faith. I think you know that pro-lifers see fetuses as people from conception. If you read my comment you at least understand this context as a point in the discussion.

No,?there is no human right to live inside someone elses body without their consent.Again. A woman's body implicitly consents. It requires no more consent that healing a scab. You can pick the scab if you want but the scab will try to heal on it's own. A woman's body will grow a fetus with or without consent. Do you think a conjoined twin should have the right to revoke consent over use of their organs, thus killing their twin? I think that would be an insane precedent to accept because it is in effect, killing another person.","title":"CMV: Most Pro-Choice Arguments are Dumb"},{"text":"I cant see these going anywhere","title":"Trump sues for billions from media he says is biased against him."},{"text":"There is a difference between respecting the rights of an adult to make that decision and allowing trans-women to shatter all the women's records on the college sports team.

Excerpt: President-elect Donald J. Trump is wasting little time in taking on the three governmental institutions that most frustrated his political ambitions during his first term and making clear he will not brook resistance in his second. With his selections of lieutenants to lead the Justice Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, Mr. Trump passed over the sorts of establishment figures he installed in those posts eight years ago in favor of firebrand allies with unconventional rsums whose most important qualification may be loyalty to him. The choices of Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence in the past few days shocked a capital that perhaps should not have been all that surprised. Anyone who listened to Mr. Trumps promises and grievances on the campaign trail over the past couple of years could have easily anticipated that he would elevate compatriots willing to execute his hostile takeover of government. If confirmed, Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Hegseth and Ms. Gabbard would constitute the lead shock troops in Mr. Trumps self-declared war on what he calls the deep state. All three have echoed his conviction that government is seeded with career public servants who actively thwarted his priorities while he was in office and targeted him after he left. None of them has the kind of experience relevant to these jobs comparable to predecessors of either party, but they can all be expected to take a blowtorch to the status quo, to use Stephen K. Bannons term for Mr. Gaetz.","title":"Trump Takes On the Pillars of the Deep State"},{"text":"I never understood how being gay and being trans turned into the same thing...most americans don't give a fuck about people being gay and they have FULL rights as American citizens.

Trump's track record on policy does not support, at all, a belief that he can achieve any of this (or is even interested in it). Trump could barely manage the debt (which he blew up) and his administration was woefully inefficient across the boardSo, this is just a very pessimistic take on Trump, and I suppose that makes sense if you mostly hear negative perspectives on him. Last time around Trump was not able to achieve what he wanted to in large part because his administration got filled up with establishment cronies (he said he now regrets picking many of them) and he was strongly opposed by the establishment in general. The whole Russia Gate hoax also limited what Trump could do. So sure you could interpret his inability to do this previously as him being unable to ever do so, but that's not at all an unbiased assertion. Also, this time around Trump has already tasked Vivek and Elon with identifying wasteful spending and identifying aspects of the bureaucracy to cut. And he is bringing in people into his administration who are much more aligned with his anti-establishment views and with reducing the size of the government. If anyone will be able to do it, it's an outsider like him. Certainly, Kamala would not have done this.   \\nOn top of that, nobody that knows anything about public health is reassured to see RFK Jr., a crazy person, \\"reform the FDA\\".?So, let's talk about RFK Jr. He is a lifelong democrat who focused strongly on environmental safety and the health of the American People. He is anti-Big Pharma and is opposed to the mega corporations in the food industry that are making ultra-processed food. Yes, he also has investigated vaccines and was convinced to be a vaccine skeptic by a group of moms who came to him with both personal stories of vaccine injuries and a mountain of evidence of the harm they can cause. I've listened to him go on hours long podcasts and articulate everything with evidence and statistics. This is not some raving lunatic. So, what are you to make of it when the Mainstream Media says he is crazy and completely wrong? Well, the Mainstream Media gets a lot of money from Big Pharma and Mega-Corporations through ads and who it often aligned with the corrupt D.C. establishment who profits from relationships with these same corporations. The most simple explanation (and the most logical) is that he is at least partially correct, but that what he is saying threatens Big Pharma and Big Food and so they pressure the media and politicians to make him out to be crazy. What benefit would it serve RFK Jr. to go around saying untrue things about vaccines, food chemicals, etc.? None- if anything, it has made his life more difficult. But there is a massive benefit to Big Pharma and Big Food if he is ignored, as they can keep making profits unimpeded. So, I think it is fairly delusional to believe that RFK Jr. is just simply crazy. If you actually believe that it just goes to show how effective the media can be.  \\n4 is more pablum. Trump couldn't even negotiate with his own government to get wall funding and some of the people in that government liked him. Meanwhile, he's an international laughing stock. There's no real reason to believe he'll manage to negotiate Putin out of a war, especially since he's shown to be a big fan of him (something that's apparently not worrisome at all for his voters). Again, there's no ground for positive coverage of these things. They're fantasy.Again, just an extremely pessimistic view of things, and factually untrue as well. Trump did get much of the border wall built. The fact that Democrats opposed his domestic agenda says nothing of his ability to manage foreign policy. And no he's not an international laughing stock, that's just more bias. Trump was able to keep any significant wars from starting while he was in office, and managed to develop enough of a relationship with Kim Jong Un to deescalate what Obama had described as the greatest threat to American security (the nuclear threat from N. Korea). Upon his re-election Zelensky and Putin have already signaled willingness to negotiate an end to the war, and Trump is at the very least a skilled negotiator.   \\nSo, what fair coverage of Trump should look like is replacing very pessimistic coverage (such as saying Trump is an idiot and will not be able to negotiate an end to any war) with more balanced coverage (such as saying Trump has shown he is sometimes able to successfully negotiate de-escalation before but may have a tough time in this instance). Reality is not so wholly biased towards your political beliefs that it makes sense for the Media to give him 95% negative coverage. That just isn't how political issues work.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"Yep.

And while it might not be possible for a journalist (or publisher, editor, etc.) to step outside their own political views, it's definitely possible for them to not be bought. Some examples: Reporting that is influenced by pressure to suppress stories or to accept talking points because you might lose access to your sources or because you're getting financial incentives or gifts from them. This is pretty common with White House reporting regardless of the party -- there's a lot of criticism of reporters on the Trump administration being too cozy with them, but not just him; the Obama administration was [notorious for being hostile to the media](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/cjp_report_on_us_press_freedom.php), as were the Nixon, FDR, and Wilson administrations and many others. There's an argument that the whole White House Correspondents' Dinner is a form of this since it injects a fun socializing/fraternizing element between reporters and sources that they might not want to give up. But it's also common in local journalism as well, you see this sometimes for instance with publishing police comments verbatim so the police chief will still talk to you. Reporting that is influenced by personal and/or romantic relationships with your sources. Some of this is based on speculation and some of that speculation is sexist -- i.e., the assumption that female journalists are usually sleeping with sources -- but it does happen sometimes, like with [Olivia Nuzzi and RFK](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/olivia-nuzzi-leaves-new-york-magazine-rfk-jr) or [Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraeus_scandal).

Had no idea who he was and was not a follower, but this summation nails it: I do not believe Robert F Kennedy Jr. would have ever gained national celebrity and been able to launch a national campaign that vaulted him to the heights of Trumpworld had The Science(TM) that informed the Covid response proven even remotely correct. \\nIf the mRNA vaccine had not failed on every stated promise; had the CDC and WHO not changed the very definition of vaccine to accommodate its failure to prevent transmission or infection; had countless working class Americans not lost their jobs for refusing to take the jab, while others were forcibly injected in order to keep their livelihoods, sometimes suffering injury as a result; had mainstream news hosts and politicians including Joe Biden not proposed isolating The Unvaccinated from society, preventing them from traveling, and even from buying food in markets; had the lockdowns not set a generation of children across all social strata back years in their education, while doing nothing to stop the spread; had once-vibrant city centers not transformed to terrifying zombie scenes, shattering countless small businesses, while we were assured by Fauci that it would take just another week or two to flatten the curve; had a dystopian state censorship regime not consolidated its hold over social media platforms, disappearing dissenters from our digital commons those who protested in the streets were often beaten and arrested C had none of this occurred, RFK Jr. would be comfortably ensconced in his home in West LA, still loyal to the Democratic Party, a welcome presence in the world of affluent liberals, and nowhere near the political celebrity he is today. But all this happened and worse. Americans were lied to and abused on a massive scale, and RFK was one of the first to tap into the publics anger. And thanks to his Childrens Health Defense, he already had an established platform to promote his jeremiads (which focused heavily at the time on the erosion of constitutional rights, not always on vaccine-related issues). Though the Covid event was hardly discussed during the 2024 presenting campaign C largely because the corporate media that got almost everything wrong wanted the issue to disappear C it loomed like a heavy cloud. RFKs presence as a Trump surrogate enabled 47 to channel the simmering anger, giving rise to the Make America Healthy Again movement, which became a magnet for alt media-oriented independent voters. Now RFK stands to take over a gargantuan federal agency that has traditionally served as an instrument of Big Pharma and the agribusiness lobby, and which is currently led by a Democrat political operative with no medical or scientific background. The pundits who paint RFKs ascension as an unfortunate triumph of the paranoid style in American politics are whitewashing the failures and sordid deceptions of the credentialed class they represent, while denying the experiences of the millions who paid the price for them.
