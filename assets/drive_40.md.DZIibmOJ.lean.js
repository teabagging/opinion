Right now, only some hardcore MAGA racists actually believe that Haitian immigrants are eating pets by the truckload in a small town in Ohio. But there are *lots* of people who don't pay that much attention to politics and just passively watch top headlines. If/when this story makes it to them, it can spread really fast and lead to a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment that has no reason for being. And once it's out there, it's really difficult to take it back. Put it like this: this story has already resulted in far-right marches in Springfield, and multiple schools had to cancel classes due to threats. The more people see this headline with no \\"hey this is just false\\" asterisk next to it, the more those disruptions to life in Springfield will multiply. With how much vitriol is present in our discourse right now, the wrong person seeing it or not could literally be the difference between life and death for some innocent black person in Ohio (note I say black person and not Haitian, because I have zero faith in someone who believes the story to actually find a Haitian instead of just attacking the closest \\"migrant-looking\\" black person).And by the way this is the problem with your CMV: I agree that it would be better to have everyone make an *informed* decision, but, uh, lots of people are low-info and absorb headlines with very little critical thought, especially when it confirms their biases.

For example, if the government officials in Springfield as well as the newspaper there indicate that there are no cases of pets being eaten by Haitians, that is sufficient for me to believe what they're saying because there's no real indication that they would be likely to lie about such things.On the other hand, there are real world consequences of these lies about Haitians being spread.  I happen to have family in Springfield.  A few of the impacts are -- daily bomb/shooting threats against schools causing children and parents to be scared and children to be held out of school.  Neo-nazi groups marching (that actually started in July to be fair but they're being emboldened and more active after the debate). Haitian people are living in fear now despite not doing anything wrong, and non-Haitian people are treating Haitian people badly.  Even American-born black people are being treated as if they are Haitians now by hate-mongers.None of this impacts you or I, but it does indicate that speech isn't just something without consequences, and the fact that nearly anything is possible doesn't mean that we should act as if our uninformed views matter equally to those who are informed.","title":"CMV: Banning content classified as \\"misinformation\\" is wrong and against free speech"},{"text":"Yes, many of them did.?Idk why people argue so hard that the true believer morons dont exist.

If the mayor was just lying about this, what would stop a citizen who witnessed it from taking pictures of it or taking video of it and sharing it online? A political figure like this knows that it would be political suicide to deny something that would be *very very easy to prove otherwise* unless he was actually confident in his assertion. It's one thing if someone can toss it out in some unverifiable circumstance, like in an online reddit debate and make a false claim that they hope the readers won't bother to check, but it is quite another to announce that claim, as the person with the most authority to speak to it, to the entire world, broadcast on national news media.

If the policy is on your side, pound the policy.

Basically, how much Trump dominated. It's all they had and they were more than happy to take that as a win.Biden couldn't compete on that ground, so Trump was ok. Harris finally did what was necessary and brought the force of personality to burst that bubble and show that he can dominated by someone they desperately need to feel is inferior to Trump and by extension, them. It was so public and so comprehensive, Republicans are struggling to maintain their fiction of Trump as a strong man now Harris has proven she can bang a table louder than him as well have facts and policies on her side. They've had to try and find shelter in outright lies and that's not working out well for them.","title":"Kamala Harris has neutralized Donald Trump's \\"high-dominance\\" advantage: \\"Its finally occurred to the Democrats that Trump and the Republicans are bullies and cowards who will fold\\""},{"text":"The United States International Trade Commission is a hypothetical opinion piece?

But if you're just going to  ignore the actual consequences of your words and refuse to ever take responsibility, and insist that you keep on using a certain type of language despite knowing the consequences have been bad for your friends/society, that shows a level of irresponsibility that one would expect from a person purposefully setting out to cause those bad consequences.

Your friend gets beaten up a couple times, and least one of the people who did it references the fact he thought your friend was going to shoot up the school. Pretty much half the entire school simply refers to your friend as \\"school shooter,\\" even though he has done nothing of the sort and is just more Conservative.At that point, when people tell you \\"hey, cut the rhetoric, your friend is getting beaten up and I'm worried its going to happen more,\\" people are not trying to take away your first ammendment right, they are trying to make sure your friend is okay.

Good and Evil are not objective, not separate from human thinking, and will always depend on the cultural context of the observer.?Someone practicing human sacrifice 5000 years ago thought it was the right thing to do if it meant (to them) the difference between their group surviving or not. Thats an underlying utilitarian principle that we still use, the good for the many outweighs the harm of the few.Progress also isnt linear It could also be that in the future we spurn technology because its decadent and damaging to our spirit and community. Using a website would be considered contributing to evil, would you give up Reddit now to be better favored by your descendants later?I think that we can recognize what we consider evil acts, and even evil aspects of a person. Hell one of my favorite authors, PG Wodehouse, had some pretty racist views in some of his stories. I can recognize those as tarnishing my enjoyment of his corpus, and for some people that aspect would be ruinous to their pleasure in reading it, understandably so. Was Wodehouse evil? He participated in an evil, but I doubt I could ascribe that word to the man himself. I think its more useful to describe evil in larger terms than individual ones, more often than not.?People who want perfect social justice while living in the US also participate in evil, we consume products made by slaves while maintaining the view that slavery is an evil. We contribute to the wanton destruction of our biosphere, collectively unwilling to do ourselves a small amount of harm that would avoid worldwide unimaginable slow moving catastrophe.

The disanalogies between the two are so numerous and obvious that I don't even think it's necessary to point them all out. People have enjoyed intoxicants for thousands of years, but crack-cocaine is still meaningfully more dangerous than chewing coca leaves. People have gambled for thousands of years, but being able to place bets on your phone 24/7 creates more risk of addiction and harmful use than allowing people to participate in a weekly in-person raffles.  Am I saying online pornography is like crack-cocaine? No, that would be hyperbolic. but I am saying that it's clearly more potent, more various, more private, and more easily accessible than older forms of pornography, and that this almost certainly amplifies whatever effects it has on society and on individuals. Also this societal gag order on porn and sex makes it that porn is only place to learn things. That's the only place where you can see the act and there is little real discussion there.There is an enormous amount of discussion of sex online and in other easily accessible media. There are many threads on this very site devoted to sex advice. High school libraries around the country will lend students a book that offers tips on how to give a handjob. I can't speak to the taboos around sex in ancient cultures, but, compared to the last few hundred years of Western society, laws and norms around obscenity are almost certainly more liberal now than they've been in the past.

Certainly by the development of writing and thus the start of written history, we were all anatomically modern humans.

Porn is nothing but a waste of time.The majority of mainstream porn is violent to/degrading of women, especially nowadays when stuff like choking and hitting women has become more commonplace in porn.This is not true at all. Porn is filtered according to taste, just like everything on the internet. If a gayboy goes to pornhub, the front page is filled with exactly what I'm looking for. If its the first visit for an IP, it will be very vanilla, and you can even test that theory out with a VPN. If *you* are seeing violent porn, I've got some ironic news.For some actual fact-checking, though, here are the most searched categories as of a while back: step momlesbianstep sistermilfcartoonebonyteenblackmomthreesomemassageoverwatchanalhentai etc.I did leave out some redundant results there, but none of those categories are violent. Usually, the prudes are most concerned about the incest and teen categories. Not the violent categories. Most of us will go our whole lives without even seeing a Vore comic. Let alone know what it is.porn doesn't teach people how to have loving sex.I think you misunderstand what porn is for. It's nothing more than visual stimuli for people to get off to. That's it. It's the equivalent of a sexual action movie. It's not meant to be an instructional video on how to realistically engage in war. It's *explosions*.Porn promotes unrealistic body and performance standards.This applies to Hollywood in the same way. I don't want to see overweight men with small penises. I want to see stallions. I want to see athetlic, well groomed, and maintained physique. If your ego is so fragile that it can be hurt by the reality of what people want, porn is the least of your problems. Porn is addictive. Oftentimes, the more you watch it, the more you need to watch more and more extreme porn for the same effect.I believe this to be fear mongering stemming from christian culture. I've watched porn for over half my life, often to the point of excess but never tipping into obsession. My tastes and preferences have not expanded. I never suddenly started having a desire for violence, scat, bdsm, CP or any other weird shit. I *do* have a kink, but I've had it since I was a literal child, and compared to the aformentioned, its extremely plain jane. My porn searches do not become curious. I know what I like, and I don't want anything more extreme. By the time I die, I'll have watched porn for hopefully 75 years.I am personally of the belief that kinks form from early childhood, and they can't be removed. If you get hot and bothered by the tail pipe of an 87' mustang, than by golly you better fuck that mustang. But I don't believe that a normal vanilla person without kinks will, suddenly, after years of porn, begin searching for violent, murderous, torture porn, or begin looking at CP or begin enjoying the sounds of a mammoth shitting on a walrus. These things are wired early. As soon as you become sexual, you're fried. Now try and flip the omelet.Is it possible I'm wrong? Maybe.

The movie was made 5 years after the book. Or let's take one of the most criticized films still being discussed. The birth of a nation. It's super racist (but is important in filmmaking history). It was made in 1914, so sure, morals were different then. But then why did the director publicly distance himself from the movie and try to change his legacy?

Because you said most of the time.But I also disagree; you can judge people by the morals they claim to hold. For example, in the late 18th century, people in the United States practiced chattel slavery and did some of the worst crimes against people brought over from Africa. At the same time, they were the product of the Enlightenment and espoused ideals of liberty, fraternity, toleration and so on. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that?all men are created equal, that?**they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are?Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness**.'The leaders of the people knew they were wrong. Jefferson in a draft for the Declaration of Independence: \\"He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought &amp; sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he has obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the Liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.\\"While it can be argued that there have been times and places where The Golden Rule wasn't held or claimed to be held. But many cultures and peoples have claimed to hold it (or something similar). See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden\\\\_Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) . Also, the notion of treating strangers and travelers fairly, of the rights of guests and strangers, is a common instruction or component of moral teachings for many peoples and in many cultures. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality) .We can also find more, and we can possibly argue that such morals are ones that peoples should hold, and condemn the people or culture if they do not hold them. If we do argue that, than for some things we can not say 'morals were different back then' for all sorts of practices. But I think on a weaker level, we can make judgements about consistency of practice with stated morality and about hospitality and about the golden rule. Not necessarily expecting the same form as we have (what is required for hospitality? what form of the golden rule?), but that it is a moral failing if no form of the golden rule is followed.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"Im sorry**WHAT?**","title":"But sure, its the lefts rhetoric thats responsible for the violence"},{"text":"Ancient civilizations and psychoactive drugs are topics that allow bullshit answers to sound legit, and idiots like Rogan to sound informed.","title":"Joe Rogan says Kamala Harris is nailing it against Trump"},{"text":"oh i was over here giving you the benefit of the doubt lmao ill stop doing thatedit: omg you post seriously in mensrights. ofc you do. youre no leftist babe","title":"How the Last Eight Years Made Young Women More Liberal  For a generation of girls raised to believe they could be anything, the Trump era moved their politics to the left, a new analysis shows."},{"text":"Right Hes a fish","title":"Kamala Harris has neutralized Donald Trump's \\"high-dominance\\" advantage: \\"Its finally occurred to the Democrats that Trump and the Republicans are bullies and cowards who will fold\\""},{"text":"It's a clown world.  :)Luckily I think all their plans will fail.","title":"Greta Thunberg.

Although it's interesting thought to think that might be similar to what slavers thought for themselves at the time. Although there were many societies that didn't have slavery even at that time, so it definitely doesn't apply 1 to 1. That said, my counter argument would be to say we don't really have viable alternative right now. Is large scale \\"lab grown\\" meat even possible today? And isn't it more expensive (and therefore more taxing on the planet) than regular meat? Also there is the question of artificiality. A lot of people don't trust processed food because of all the potentially unhealthy ingredients corporations put inside. I'm legit questioning it, I'm not sure what the answer is. But if I would take the argument that we don't have good alternative as a given, would you say hunter gatherers were evil? They definitely didn't have an alternative and we're eating meat just to stay alive. And if I stretch the argument a little bit, would you say carnivorous animals are evil?

Trumps vow to slap?enormous tariffs?(up to 60 per cent) on imports from China would push up inflation and risk the jobs of the millions of US workers who supply overseas manufacturers with goods and services.Trump doesnt seem to realise that US consumers pay the tariffs, not the foreign exporters.The man who still touted the?Art of the Deal seems even less versed in economics than his Democratic opponent.Harriss best bet would probably be telling the electorate what they want to hear, without insulting their intelligence. Inflation IS down, interest rates are falling, things are getting better after some tough years. And the?return of Trump?risks taking America back to chaos and joblessness. If she says it long enough and loud enough, it might get through.I think she?will continue with the message that the economy is improving but the middle class still needs help paying for housing, groceries and medical care, says Todd Belt, a professor of political science at George Washington University. She then will pivot to talking about her plans. Its risky to look like shes resting on the laurels of an improving economy without empathising with people dealing with high prices.But that wont happen if she shies away from?the subject and journalists questions. With just seven weeks to go, it might be now or never for Harris to make her case this week on the economyRead more on i: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472)","title":"The numbers giving Kamala Harris nightmares C and how she could turn it around"},{"text":"This is one of the biggest reasons that Democrats have struggled to sell Americans on the merits of President Joe Bidens economic stewardship, a?*Washington Post*?editorial noted last week. Ms Harris should be honest about that decline, while also explaining why the 2020 and 2021 figures werent sustainable, and why there?are still lots of reasons to think the economy is strong and capable of getting stronger.Major financial news this week might give Harris the opportunity to tackle the subject head on C and set the agenda. The Federal Reserve is expected to finally?announce?a cut in interest rates today, with Wall Street betting on a significant half-point cut.This is Harriss chance to tell voters that the economy?has turned a corner. An interest rate cut will lower mortgage costs for homeowners. The rate cut is made possible by a slowing economy, but on the plus side, inflation has now fallen to 2.5 per cent.So far, her economic promises have centred on tax policy. She has talked about?expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 (4,558) bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 (18,991) first-time homebuyer tax credit and end to taxes on waiters tips. In contrast to Trump, Harris has pledged to raise corporate tax from 21 per cent to 28 per cent. Her opponent wants to lower it to 15 per cent.Harris doesnt have any great economic ideas and her grasp of the subject has left most pundits unimpressed. And some experts are puzzled?over Trumps failure to exploit her vulnerabilities on the economy.Trump hasnt kept a relentless focus on the issue by tying Harris to big government programmes that overheated the US economy, says Thomas Gift, director of the UCL Centre on US Politics. Nor has he made a convincing case that some of Harriss new policy proposals C from anti-price gouging laws to subsidies for first-time homeowners C would only make the economic situation for many Americans worse.Theres a degree of irony that Biden, from whom Harris would like to create some distance due to the cost of living?crisis, has put the US economy on firm footing for the years ahead. The investment that Biden?piled into infrastructure and clean energy?already is reaping dividends for the US economy, which has emerged from the Covid-Ukraine double whammy better than any other Western country.As the?*FT*s Edward Luce notes, Harris is handicapped by her inability to distance herself too much from?Bidenomics, which remains unpopular even though its track record is pretty good.Harris has talked about an opportunity economy. But no one really knows what this means, given her hodge-podge of proposals from child tax credits?and Soviet-sounding price controls to watered-down capital gains tax hikes on the wealthy.","title":"The numbers giving Kamala Harris nightmares C and how she could turn it around"},{"text":"Who could have predicted that this bully would be the exact same as every other bully in history","title":"Kamala Harris has neutralized Donald Trump's \\"high-dominance\\" advantage: \\"Its finally occurred to the Democrats that Trump and the Republicans are bullies and cowards who will fold\\""},{"text":"Theyll say the parties switched to which you respond oh really then why was Robert Byrd a Democrat his entire life","title":"Brief history of the Democrat Party!"},{"text":"The smart money says the 2024 US presidential election hinges on the financial concerns of swing voters in battleground states.And sooner or later, when?Donald Trump?takes a temporary break from his?ridiculous grievances, he may succeed in focusing the election debate in this direction.So how would Harris answer the lethal question that Ronald Reagan posed to viewers during the final presidential debate with President Jimmy Carter in 1980: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Back then, the electorate answered no and put Reagan in power.Its not really a fair question C least of all in 2024 after the American economy, like all other major economies, has spent the previous three years recovering from the inflation shock caused by the?Ukraine war?and the Covid pandemic.The latter event, exacerbated by Trumps ineptitude, saw the Biden administration hand out billions in pandemic relief. This largesse was not sustainable for long. Its been sorely missed by working- and middle-class families.The myth of Trumps financial acumen still persists in the minds of many Americans, despite his list of failed businesses and a record in government of tax cuts for the super-rich that caused the?national debt?to spiral by $7.8trn (5.9tn).Economic growth under Trump was nothing special. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation?averaged 2.67 per cent?under Trump, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So far, under?[Joe Biden](https://inews.co.uk/topic/joe-biden?ico=in-line_link), annual growth is averaging 3.4 per cent.But people have short memories. And here are some of the numbers giving?[Kamala Harris](https://inews.co.uk/topic/kamala-harris?ico=in-line_link)?nightmares:*  9 C the percentage at which inflation peaked in 2023, and the highest in four decades\\n*  34 C the percentage of Americans who say they live?paycheck to paycheck.\\n*  69 C the preliminary consumer confidence reading for September in the?University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index?(CSI). Successful presidential candidates typically score 90 per cent or more.News this month suggests Harris is?closing?the gap?on Trump regarding the publics confidence in her economic competence, and that she is managing to distance herself from the blame attached to Bidens handling of the countrys finances.But even in this survey more respondents thought they would be better off financially if Trump were re-elected, with 40 per cent saying they would either be somewhat or much better off under his presidency compared with 35 per cent who thought they would be better off under Harris.The fact is many Americans were still no better off than they were in the last pre-pandemic year, 2019, a fact highlighted last week by the?United States Census Bureau.Inflation-adjusted household income in 2023 stands at $80,610 (61,236) C a little lower than its 2019 level of?$81,210 (61,692). The gap is worse though, if you look at real income after taxes (and tax credits), which better reflects what households were actually able to spend. Incomes actually increased during Covid shutdowns, thanks to government handouts. But when these ended, real income after taxes dropped significantly.","title":"The numbers giving Kamala Harris nightmares C and how she could turn it around"},{"text":"I work there too, but the Trumpers are a lot quieter this time around.

Because companies never eat losses. They pass it along to consumers. But there is more nuance But this is way worse than just a tax.  A tariff has to be looked at as a fee to import goods.  When America has a net trade deficit, meaning we import more than we export... It will raise the price of imported goods. It will cause the countries to put up tariffs on whatever we make which will lower what we export and lower profits for domestic companies.  And what's more important is looking at market size and resources.China holds the vast majority of rare earth minerals which are in almost every single piece of electronics we have.  That's a bad disadvantage on a trade war which tariffs will cause.  Furthermore, if we lose China, India, and other markets we lose billions of customers.  Where as they lose 400 million. That's a very one sided victory in a trade war.Even worse is, this would devalue the dollar and might even make another currency the defacto currency and that would harm the country dramatically.Tariffs are playing with fire when you don't have the majority of manufacturing or the population.  We traded our manufacturing for slave labor in other countries and cheaper goods.  A tariff can only make those costs go up dramatically, make our dollar worthless which is a kind of inflation, and make enemies.  None of this will make the government have more revenue.Maybe rich people should have to pay taxes.  I am all in on the unrelated gains tax on people with 100 million dollars. I think we should have a different system to collect taxes from the rich, but that probably won't happen. We need to stop the rich from avoiding taxes by using debt  and screwing up the stock market via tax evasion.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"When first announced this whistle-blower was meant to be showing us that Kamala got given questions.

Just as an example, despite seeing Barber as a slave, Johnson left Barber an inheritance after death, complete with a salary and all. (if you want to further learn about this, the history podcast \\"Empire\\" by William Dalrymple has some fantastic episodes on Barber. In fact, I recommend all of their 25+ episodes on the history of slavery.)?? ?I will also add that slavery was seen very very differently in many cultures, eg - slavery to the king was seen as a form of divine right or service to god. And in these cultures every person (rich / poor, the old and the young) in the empire would become slave for a fixed period every year working on things like construction projects (eg the hanging gardens). Everybody in society had to go through this and while rich people could pay someone off to fulfill his quota historical texts indicate that this was very much frowned on.

Infiltrating the highest position of power allows the subversive elements to exert significant control over the decision-making processes and shape the direction of the country according to their ideology.Here's how such a scenario might unfold:Infiltration: The subversive elements would work covertly to place individuals sympathetic to their cause in key positions within the political establishment, including the presidency. This could involve manipulation, blackmail, or grooming of individuals who show vulnerability or ideological alignment with the subversive agenda.Manipulation of Policies: Once the president is infiltrated, the subversives would begin influencing policies and decision-making processes in line with their ideology. They may advocate for measures that undermine the societal values, erode democratic principles, or promote policies that further the subversive agenda.Exploiting Divisions: The infiltrated president would leverage their position to exploit existing divisions within society. They might emphasize identity politics, exacerbate social, economic, or racial tensions, or fuel partisan rivalries to create a sense of turmoil and discord. This would contribute to the destabilization of the targeted society.Promoting Propaganda: The infiltrated president would have access to significant media and communication channels, which they would use to disseminate propaganda that supports the subversive agenda. They would manipulate public opinion, shape the narrative, and suppress dissenting voices or opposing viewpoints to maintain control over the information flow.Consolidating Power: The infiltrated president, along with their subversive allies, would seek to consolidate power by weakening or co-opting key institutions that serve as checks and balances. They may manipulate the judiciary, limit freedom of the press, or undermine the opposition, aiming to establish an authoritarian regime that supports their ideological goals.Repression and Control: As the subversive elements solidify their control, they would suppress dissent and opposition, employing tactics such as censorship, surveillance, and intimidation. The goal would be to stifle any resistance to their rule and maintain a tight grip on power.In this scenario, the president's infiltration becomes a powerful tool for the subversives to advance their agenda and fundamentally transform the targeted society. By leveraging the president's authority, access to resources, and influence, the subversive elements can implement policies and shape the narrative in a way that aligns with their ideological objectives, ultimately leading to the erosion of democratic principles and the consolidation of their power.Russia has taken over Trump in this context and is using him against us, which Trump is perfectly willing to do. I do think when he won the election, you could see it on his face back in 2016. He was not thrilled about winning.","title":"Trump is a threat to democracy.

Even at the peak of slavery or child marriage, there were always people denouncing the practice. It is not like people were not aware of the immoral subtilties of their practices, they just could socially and judicially get away with it.

We have laws against directly calling for murder or inciting a mob, for example; I wouldn't mind if we extended them to cover speech with three elements together: is false, is designed to mislead the audience into believing that catastrophe is imminent, and attributes the blame to a single person.For example, Candidate X gets on stage and tells the audience that Candidate Y is a literal Nazi who will turn the US into the Fourth Reich. Assuming that Y isn't an actual Nazi, this meets all three elements.On the other hand, Candidate A getting on stage and telling the audience that Political Party 2 is full of Communists who seek the overthrow of the US. This would actually be protected, as it doesn't blame a single person.I feel that speech with all three elements is uniquely dangerous because it's scaremongering with a clear consequence: it is likely to provoke assassination attempts against that person.","title":"CMV: Despite the Headlines of Political Violence of the 2024 Election Cycle, Calls for Less \\"Scary Rhetoric\\" are Misguided"},{"text":"Gay sex is just an easy example but what I am saying applies to anything that people have moral disagreements over.You bring up an interesting point about feces. I agree that it tastes bad. Statistically speaking, it probably tastes bad to the vast majority of humanity as a result of our biology that primes us to seek out nutritional food.However, I know that there are people in the world who enjoy eating feces. They have their own groups and meet-ups. Does feces taste different to them or have they just learned to enjoy the taste of it? Either way doesn't really matter because mass appeal does not equate to moral truth.We can agree, statistically speaking, that most people do not enjoy eating feces and that it provides little nutritional benefit to humans. (I specify humans because there are actually many animal species that have evolved to eat poop and derive a nutritional benefit from it.)However, just because most people don't like eating poop does that mean that eating poop is EVIL? No, that requires a leap of logic that is unfounded. Where did this extra element of goodness or badness come from? That was an assumed premise. Just because people dislike or disapprove of something says nothing about whether that thing is good or evil. You cannot derive an \\"ought\\" from an \\"is.\\"You might say, \\"I do not want to eat poop because it tastes bad.\\" However, to say that eating poop is evil because it tastes bad requires you to input your opinion in a sneaky manner. You are making a statement that appears to be an objective fact but really its just your opinion disguised as a proposition.Just because someone has a negative or positive reaction to something does not mean that thing is objectively good or bad. Objectively speaking, it tastes bad to most people as a statistical matter but it is not objectively wrong.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"Tired of being completely covered in lubricant?","title":"P Diddy and Obama"},{"text":"Sorry, u/query626 C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 5:  **Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation**.

That's not rhetoric, it's verifiable fact | Editorial"},{"text":"\\n1. Im not convinced that most porn is inherently violent. Even if violence is an issue in some cases, wouldnt the more reasonable solution be to ban or regulate violent videos specifically, rather than banning porn altogether? It seems like a more targeted approach that directly addresses the problem. Also, I dont believe young men, who are otherwise normal and well-adjusted, suddenly become violent towards women after watching porn. If someone is going to be violent, I think they would have those tendencies regardless of what type of porn they consume.2. On the second point, I agree that most porn doesnt teach intimacy, but I think its too simplistic to say porn cant portray loving or intimate relationships. There are definitely videos out there that show this, even if its not the general stereotype. Using that logic, would we ban a video of a skilled guitarist just because it shows an unrealistic outcome for most people and doesnt teach how to play guitar properly? It feels like a similar argument to me.3. Regarding unrealistic body expectations, while porn may feature some of this, its not unique to porn. We see unrealistic images in TV, social media, magazines, and even in real life with plastic surgery. I think its important to highlight when something is artificially altered, but its strange to suggest that these people dont have *real* human bodies. They are human, regardless of augmentation. Id support addressing this by educating young people on whats healthy and providing disclaimers on altered images. Banning all porn for this reason doesnt address the issue directly, especially when it doesnt apply to every video.4. On point four, I think we need to be careful about treating adults as if they cant make their own decisions. Once someone is 18, theyre legally considered an adult, and just because we might think theyre making unwise choices doesnt mean theyre wrong based on their own priorities. If the concern is violence, abuse, or lack of consent, the focus should be on improving policing of these crimes. We could also regulate the production and publication of porn by requiring formal consent and legal documentation, either at the studio level or during the upload process. The technology for remote verification and consent exists, so its definitely doable.5. As for addiction, Id question whether porn is more addictive than other activities like video games, TV shows, or even things like weightlifting. Many enjoyable activities can be addictive, but we dont label them all as major problems. We already allow things like alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, which can also be addictive, and some people advocate for legalising hard drugs. The libertarian argument here is that adults should be able to make their own choices based on their own risk-benefit assessments, rather than having the state impose arbitrary restrictions.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"Americans are a lot less educated, more religious and more right wing than any country with so much advanced development ever should be.

Women are the ones generally looking for violent power play like Rough / Bondage / Rape.This is not a surprise to anyone who knows how male and female brains are wired.happy relationshipsWhat planet are you from? We're on the blue and green one, third rock from the sun. Hairless apes. Ring a bell?It's mostly about using and disrespecting the woman for the man's pleasure.No. That is a rare category. Mainstream is about the man *being desired*.Go to the main page and look. Yeah, you'll see some choking or whatever. But what's actually happening in the scene? Man exerts control - woman responds positively. That is *not exploition*. Even harder stuff like deep throat, it's the same. She's smiling and putting in effort because *she wants to please him*. That's the fantasy. To be desired. Not violence.A lot of young men/boys nowadays think (consciously or not), \\"Why put effort into making meaningful connections with the opposite gender and finding a girlfriend/wife when I could just watch porn?\\" Loneliness among both genders is increasing, especially for men.

Side note, women also *used to put more effort* into being worth striving for. But you wouldn't dare suggest such a thing, would you?Loneliness is actually much worse for women nowadays.

Just because a person has a negative or positive reaction to an action doesn't make that action good or evil. The reaction is real. However, the moral judgment that you are assigning to it is not. Just because people have a strong reaction to something or just because the physical world is a certain way says nothing about how the world OUGHT to be. The intuition of people is inherently varied and unreliable.For example, when one person sees two men having gay sex they might have a strong negative reaction of disgust. Does this mean that gay sex is evil? What do you say about people who don't have that negative reaction when they see gay sex? Is gay sex objectively moral for them but objectively immoral for the person who had the negative reaction? How about people who have a strong positive reaction when they see gay sex? If there is an objective truth to morality that can be ascertained through human intuition and responses then why do people have different intuitions and responses to different stimuli?What you are observing when the baby has strong responses to various stimuli is merely the behavioral conditioning caused by their evolution as a pack animal and the environment that they have grown up in. If you show a baby a picture of a man eating a steak and it has a negative reaction does that mean that eating meat is evil? What about if it has a positive reaction, does that mean that eating meat is good?Your conclusion does not follow your premises. Just because people have negative or positive reactions to various stimuli as a result of their biology and upbringing does not make those stimuli EVIL or GOOD. You are making a leap of logic to say that these reactions of disgust or pleasure that people feel when presented with certain images imply objective moral truth. Especially considering that different people have different responses as a result of their nature and the environment that they grew up in.Just because something is a certain way says nothing of how that thing ought to be-","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"LINDA!!

Is this true? I can't say for certain, but I've heard the argument often made before about ped*philes using loli hentai as an outlet for their messed up desire, and it being argued that that's overall good. It's arguable whether or not that analogy could apply to the topic you're asking (if the hardcore porn is shot with real people), but at the very least the argument should work regarding animated hardcore porn (which considering the ease and ethics of making it compared to real hardcore porn, animated might actually be more common and widespread than real. So if the majority of hardcore porn doesn't involve real people and serves as an outlet for people who are into it, I think that argument makes sense).","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"So you can't afford a house even with a partner of the same income, you certainly can't afford to have a family, even with a partner of the same income, and you can't even afford to rent your own apartment.

Considering all the progress weve made as a society towards womens rights, women entering the workforce, movements like MeToo and so on, its reasonable to conclude that our views of women have moved into a more positive direction. With more positive views typically better treatment follows. Therefore its not unreasonable to have a view that our current time ( at least in developed countries) is less sexist and less violent towards women, than in the past. 2. Most men watch or have watched porn. Hardcore, being one of the more popular genres, has probably been watched by most of casual porn watchers at least once, but probably more given its popularity. Thats a reasonable assumption. But most men arent violent, most men arent in jail for assault, most men have never even been arrested.So combining these two points, if most men have seen Hardcore porn, yet most men arent violent, AND if we are less sexist now than we were in the past, before readily accessible hardcore, then a reasonable assumption is that hardcore porn doesnt play a role in violence or sexism towards women.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"I do find it funny that while the subreddit was arguing over the pager bombings there was a small schism over the idea that a chimp can beat a human in a fight and that's just kinda funny to me","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Lmao, Tim Pool actually sued Kamala over her campaign posting the clip where Tim Pool and Laura Loomer fantasize about locking up and executing Democrats for \\"crimes\\" (yes, the clip is just as absurd as it sounds)He is claiming he was damaged because Democrats don't want to come on his show anymore","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" GOP senators derided the Democratic legislation, authored by Sen.

There's been a lot of thinking on Reddit lately about how time period doesn't excuse behavior and how it's a terrible excuse, but I'm not sure I agree.That has nothing to do with the title and **you do not agree** that germans and their morality was right to slaughter jews.Assumptions 1-3 are pointless. The past doesn't exist! if we start celebrating Hitler, he, hitler would be like he is right now - yead. So the \\"good\\" argument has nothing to do with him. It has only to do with us.Tomorrow when me an you die, they could either ignore that we ever existed, come and piss on our graves, or erect statues of us - it would have nothing to do with us. By judging the past **we are simply constructing the present**Alexander the Great was worse than hitler. Why do we like him? It's not because his victims loved himBasically I don't know how morals will change and so it's impossible for me to adequately live up to a future moral standard.No one cares that you should, you also do not care and you will never find out whether you did. Again, the future will not judge you, they will not care about you (like with Alexander they might forget the people that you slaughtered). They use you for their ends. Say, if Trump is what his enemies say, and he wins, The leader of the free world will become fascist, and so history books will be rewritten to make hitler sound moral. Note, hitler would not have changed, only the whims of the leaving (like our opinion of alexander the great) You will change my view by demonstrating that for controversial historical customs, such as child marriage, ritual sacrifice, slavery, ect there is some underlying mechanism not tied to current understanding that would have caused a person from that era to avoid such behavior that doesn't also apply to contemporary behavior. We are ok will the slaughter of kids in Gaza, they were ok with slavery.

And even as the polling averages ticked down a couple of points, on Election Day, they showed Biden up by 8.5 points in Wisconsin (he ultimately won by 0.63 percent), up by 4.7 points in Pennsylvania (where he won by just over a point), and up five points in Nevada (where he won by just over half that). Biden led in Florida and North Carolina (he lost both) and within a point or two in Ohio and Texas (states he lost by a lot). Democratic Senate candidates were pointing to polls showing them flipping Republican-held seats in South Carolina, Montana, and Maine (the party would go on to lose all three).When Election Day was over, it appeared Democrats might have blown it. The Senate was out of reach, the House looked lost, and even the presidential race remained too close to call.

But as Democrats now face the same opponent and head into the fall with polls showing a race far closer than it was four years ago, figuring out how Trump came so close back then and has twice outperformed the polls  and by a larger margin in 2020 than he did in 2016 ?has become something that is of paramount importance to strategists on both sides of the aisle\\"","title":"Will Trump Beat Expectations Again? 2020 was closer than it seemed and the reasons why might explain why he could win again in 2024.\\n"},{"text":"like an old-timey jail outfit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Good.

I dont really search it out, but on the very, very rare occasions where Ive tried to find something more hardcore, violent porn has been nowhere in my search results.Also, in my experience, its women who tend to be more into the violent aspects of porn/sex, and I personally started noticing it more after the 50 Shades of Gray movie came out. I, as a man who consumes porn, have never once felt the urge to choke or hit a woman I was having sex with, but Ive had several women ask me to choke them or encourage me to be more dominant and forceful to them while having sex, my wife included.My wife, like many women Ive met/slept with, enjoys being dominated in bed, and she enjoys watching violent rape porn. She has tried to find this violent porn online but has to spend a while searching for it because its not really as prevalent as many people make it out to be.So, I guess my arguments against your position would be that violent porn is more for women, not men, and Id argue its mostly women being influenced by this porn, not men. They ask men to do these things to them during sex, men then believe that all or a majority of women want this during sex, so they just start doing it to every woman they sleep with, and then when a woman who doesnt want to be choked sleeps with these men, they mistakenly believe its the men who want to do these things, and they incorrectly assume it comes from porn, when the reality is it came from other women. This is what happened to me when I was single. After being asked over and over again to choke, tie up, and be much more forceful during sex, I just started doing it by default. Not necessarily to extremes. but Id start by just placing my hand just below a womans throat (she could still breathe perfectly fine) and putting a little bit of my weight behind it. If she seemed into it, then I felt like she wanted more dominate/forceful sex. I honestly didnt care if we had plain-ass vanilla sex or not, I just wanted to get laid, but I had multiple women throughout my life get angry and some verbally abusive when I didnt do these things, so they just became my default.This seems to be the case for many of my friends as well.

He is not really calling for any change to what people say, but rather this is an attempt to miscategorize what people on the Left say as calls for violence. This is just another example of telling their supporters that it is really they who are the ones who are the victims who are kept down by Democrats. It is just like how they keep saying that the Democrats want to take their guns away, or ban them from saying Merry Christmas, or perform gender reassignment surgery on their children without their consent. They want their own side to live in fear so that they vote for Trump.If JD Vance really wanted to tone down the rhetoric, he knows that it would be his boss who would have to make the biggest change to how he speaks. We have all seen Trump calling Harris (and Biden before that) Marxist, Communist, and fascist (the last one being an alleged example of what he claimed was the Democrat's rhetoric). He called his opponents radical-Left thugs that live like vermin. He hard heard him say that if they lose, it will be because the Democrats cheated and that it will be the end of the country as we know it. We have seen the speeches where he said if they lose there will be civil war, and that he will lock up the lawmakers and election officials who dare to ignore his calls to simply switch the election results. And of course, there was also the time where said that if they lose then his 2nd amendment people would know what to do.Then there is the opposite of how Trump refused to denounce bomb threats to schools in Springfield, Ohio after he made up (which Vance admits they did) the outrage of migrants eating dogs.But Vance hopes that everyone will simply forget all that and just \\"remember\\" the new made-up concept that it is the Left who are the ones calling for violence.

They dont actually know. They just know theyre being told to be mad.Exactly. This is at the very core of it. I just want to point out one more thing which is that there are actually two or three components to their indoctrination process:1. They are told by authority (aka. the milgram experiment) as you said2. They are influenced by perceived social proof, which is often manufactured (aka. the asch conformity experiment)3. They are subjected to a lot of repetition and conditioning to ostracize those outside of the group (so you always dismiss what they say out of hand).After a lot of experience talking to people that have been indoctrinated into the left's orthodoxy, I've learned that you cannot argue with them directly because no matter how blatantly the truth agrees with you they will only double down and become even more set in their false beliefs. So the adversarial approach does not work. They have to be made to feel that the idea came from them (because if it's coming from you, they are preconditioned to reject it always - the very fact you said the truth is just more evidence to them that the truth is a lie).

By default I was pro Biden/Harris, and I actually really respect the job Biden did besdies being \\"not Trump\\" (which is more than enough on it's own). But I didn't expose myself to Kamala much and/or she wasn't deployed in ways that captured the attention of someone like me as much as Trump and Biden do. So she was somewhat of an unknown to me relatively speaking vs. the other two. So yeah, for me, the moment Biden stepped down and endorsed her, she had my full attention and I think the way the party came together and those first speeches she gave were really uplifting. Obviously she didn't just become competent or something overnight, but for many people it was the first time we got to see it when it mattered to us, and besides being highly competent, she/they did it really well and haven't looked back since.My Kamila 'bias' was completely neutral in terms of her individual attributes and postive in terms of her assosication with the 'not Trump' team, so not a hard place to ramp up to a favorable opinion from. But I have some friends that had a negative bias toward her having been told she's incompetent etc. by the right to which they have some (or full) leanings, and they were adament her debate performance would be something like Biden's. I knew better by now and assured them it's not the case but they honestly were so firm in that belief that I might as well have been telling them the earth is flat. After the debate, their views did a complete 180. They had no idea. She completely sold them on her competency at the same time as exposing Donald's lack thereof. The best example of perceptions being changed with the right info was one of my friend's parents who has only ever voted R, and was going to reluctantly vote R again despite a personal dislike of Trump's behavior (without being much in the details of the more serious reasons to really be against him!). He hadn't watched the debate and didn't intend to but did hear she went well, and was just curious enough after hearing me talk her up and with a few beers under his belt to agree to watch it with me then and there! We watched the whole thing and he was even rewinding some parts to hear what she said again because he was impressed (and also some LOLs at Trump's meltdowns).\\nBy the end of it, he declared it had changed his vote and he's voting D for the first time in his life. One of the big things for him was his perception that Trump would be better for dealing with other world leaders whereas she'd be pushed around... seeing how easily she worked him over completely flipped the perceptions he had of each of them in that regard. It was really satisfying to witness the penny drop like that for someone.Some of these people don't mean to be so ignorant, there's just so much noise and it's info overload so they shut it all out and stick to a few core beliefs that have survived over decades... if only we could just get them to sit down and watch about two hours of footage, that seriously should be more than enough if it's the right stuff and they aren't brainwashed cult members.","title":"Kamala Harris is favorable to Americans for the first time in years."},{"text":"Wheres that data coming from?

I agree with you that this is disingenuous, as both candidates have indeed called each other fascists and asked the other to refrain from the same.But where I disagree with you is that this is alarming at all, at least when you look at it outside of who is speaking.  What is wrong with saying I dont think presidents should call each other fascists and I think this might lead to violence?

The only way to judge an individual's psychology is in the context of their environment, to begin. Thus, it's not a matter of judging people relative to the morals of their time. It's a matter of judging how well people directed changes in their behavior toward better or worse. *Morality of the times follows rather than leads.* And \\"average\\" is a qualification. Plenty of people, powerful and not, make things worse. They've lost more than won overall, but it's a long and winding road. And there's no reason to expect they wouldn't drag us right back into worse given half a chance. Morality would then follow suit and warp around worse standards.Tl;dr: Individual-local behavior change toward better or worse is what to focus on. The morality of the times follows these changes rather than causes them, even though it still describes the starting point for any individual in a given place.It's a subtle difference yet fundamentally frames it so you're looking at a person's behavioral *accomplishment* rather than merely adjusting standards.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"Can anyone give me the rights platform for reducing the cost of groceries?Genuinely asking","title":"Groceries Still Too High: Kamala Harris Undermines Her Own Economic Record"},{"text":"Right?

However, there's three big reasons the criticism is still often a valid one. I'm American, so I'll be looking at it mostly through a lens of U.S. history.1) If the figures in question were particularly shitty to a specific demographic, members of that demographic  saying \\"I will not respect this person who would have been okay with (for example) enslaving me\\" is tough to take issue with. Sure, that person wasn't an exception for their own time, but it's not exactly unfair to allow the knowledge of how they'd treat you to shape your opinion of someone.2) In at least some cases, either their own words or the actions of others prove that \\"it was a different time\\" doesn't really cover it. Southerners supporting slavery enough to fight a civil war over it weren't blissfully unaware of what they were doing, they were explicitly setting themselves in opposition to abolitionists (really not even that, free soilers were the milquetoast, discount abolitionists) who had spent years making points about how slavery was a monstrous institution. At a certain point resistance to change is willful ignorance.In addition, many of the founding fathers participated in slavery while also condemning it. Sure, popular opinion might not have been against them, but they had the intelligence to realize what they were doing was wrong and yet did it anyway. The hypocrisy and cowardice are condemnable regardless of the standards of the time.3) This is the most important one. How we judge figures from history doesn't matter in and of itself. Whether Washington was just acting as anyone else would in his time or was objectively a bastard is hardly of material concern in 2024, he ain't exactly president at the moment. On the other side, someone wants to call me problematic in 200 years when I'm dust, they can go right ahead, no skin off my nose. The reason these conversations happen is because they're part of a larger political rhetoric.\\nSome people want to prop up the vision of Washington and Jefferson and Adams (aside from the fact that pretending those three had anything resembling a consistent, shared vision is laughable) as the definitive, ideal model by which we should be governed, particularly as a way of resisting progress. If we acknowledge that they were flawed humans with assumptions limited by the world they lived in, both practically AND morally, it opens the door for distancing us from government couched in originalism (or at the very least originalism language). Why should I accept Washington's idea of the acceptable role of the federal government when he viewed part of that role as protecting the ownership of people? Just as an example.There's also a contingent that want to deflect criticism of historical figures as an excuse to glorify a shitty past. They don't want statues of Confederate generals to stay up because they think their views were a totally acceptable view in the proper historical context. Don't be ridiculous. They want to keep those statues up as a symbol of the white ethnostate they either explicitly or more often implicitly support. It's why the statues mostly came up during the Jim Crow era, as a form of resistance to a push for civil rights.Ultimately, this conversation isn't ABOUT Washington, or Lee, or Columbus. The color of their souls is immaterial. It's about the kind of world we want to live in now.4) Bonus point. This is all an extension of cultural relativism. There are cultures out there right now, today, that have a practice of genital mutilation. It's how they've done things since time immemorial, at an individual level they don't have much incentive to question it and a lot of social reasons not to, and I'm maybe a bit of a chauvinist for saying this, but... If I knew someone had participated in that, it would irrevocably change my perception of them as a person. I don't see why it would be any different for a historical figure who believed what they believed due to the environment they lived in.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"It's not like they went on some island together or something","title":"P Diddy and Obama"},{"text":"Shes not his blonde haired blue eyes tall girl type he likes to assault so he might ignore it","title":"Billie Eilish and Finneas Endorse Kamala Harris for President Because We Cant Let Extremists Control Our Lives, Our Freedoms and Our Future"},{"text":"Oh this has been going on ever since.

Straight white male supremacy, in other words. I don't believe this to be the case - far from it - and don't agree with what seems the consensus that they're stuck in the past, as in looking for a specific era to return to \\"greatness\\".Consider seeing it other way around, from their perspective. The left is stuck in the past, continually referencing the above civil rights issues that have already been laid to rest. What law does or doesn't exist that is unfair based on race, sex, gender, or sexuality? What more is there to fight for? Restitution? Those that lived in an unfair age fought hard for the rights we have today, yet no one seems to care much for those heroic battles and sacrifices, still considering themselves oppressed, even with things like college grants and affirmative action favoring those that fit a very specific demographic. Those that do not, even should they come from a less privileged background, are left out in the cold.There are many issues conservatives flock to MAGA for. Keeping their second amendment rights, bolstering homeland security by addressing the border crisis and the advancing crime rate, avoiding international war through tangible negotiations, giving the matter of abortion to the states to vote independently on versus a blanket one-way-or-the-other federal decision in an extremely polarized social climate, a return to public education institutions that teach youth the fundamentals of society (math, science, English) rather than a biased political ideology, advanced learning institutions that teach young adults how to think, not what to think, and of course, economic matters affecting everything from gas prices to essential goods to home ownership.You're reading too far into the slogan.

The answer is that this is just a parliamentary rule of the Senate. All bodies like this need rules to function otherwise they'll just be mobs of people clamoring for their own agendas and nothing will get done. The actual rule in play here is that there are effectively two different votes for a bill: the first is to end debate on the bill, the second is whether or not to pass it (there are other votes too, mostly involving the committees). Why have the first vote? Well the alternatives are either debate is hard capped with a time limit or someone like the majority leader just decides when debate is over. Voting on it seems the more democratic body way of handling it.For the vast majority of our history there was no effective 60-vote threshold for that first vote because the filibuster wasn't used even though it theoretically existed. Then people decided to try and give black people equal rights in the mid-20th century and some determined southerners literally used the fact that the threshold for forcibly closing debate on a bill was 60 votes, not a simple majority, to stand up in front of the Senate and just. keep. talking. As long as they talked, debate wasn't over, so the bill couldn't be voted on. That gave birth to the modern filibuster, which has since been formally codified into Senate rules so that senators don't have to literally read the phone book aloud in front of the senate. But the thing about Senate rules is that they are not laws, and they are nowhere to be found in the Constitution. The Senate decides how to run its business. So the rules can be changed. But so far neither party has wanted to push what has come to be known as the nuclear option by getting rid of it. The republicans weaponize the filibuster far, far more than democrats. But the democrats *do* use it too.Frankly they should at least bring back the old, actual filibuster if they're not going to get rid of it.edit: also, these sorts of rules are not unique to the senate. The house has them too. The only reason they don't have their own filibuster is literally just because they have never decided to allow one. But they do have rules that are just as stupid, and just as not-law and not-in-the-constitution, like a bill not coming up for a vote unless the Speaker brings it up for one *or* they  go through another arcane process involving a lot of votes. So it's basically the filibuster except the only one who can use it is the Speaker. I forget what the exact issues were, but I do remember being immensely frustrated during the Obama years by some bills that literally had majority support in the house, unanimous among democrats and more than enough republicans to put them over 50%, but the speaker simply denied to bring them up for a vote.","title":"Republicans block Senate Democrats IVF bill"},{"text":"This is as bad as Donald Trump being photographed with himself","title":"P Diddy and Obama"},{"text":"Just ask them to explain the position they are discussing in terms a Democrat might explain the position.The conversation ends there 99% of the time.They just don't believe you have a valid perspective that differs from theirs, so they haven't bothered studying the position with any real effort.That's why discussions always boil down to a series of adjectives and \\"ists\\" with them, with no real substance backing up their position.And even when they do back it up, it is always just some tangentially related link that they don't bother proof reading before providing it.  It's usually just there to say \\"see, there's a blue link there, I did something\\".So, asking them to articulate how someone that disagrees with them might think about an issue really just breaks them nowadays.That probably wouldn't have been true 15 years ago, because they actually had some educated people in their party then - but now - they've pretty much abandoned understanding things for \\"understanding\\" things, so they don't really have much of a defense, except to call you names,, block you, and then leave in a self-congratulating huff.","title":"Why are the Democrats so hateful?"},{"text":"Sorry, I'm so confused.

It is just setup.  But all serious investigation requires a lot of setup before you can contribute much, tedious though it may be.  That goes for all fields of inquiry. Something about this process not being as straightforward as dismantling and rebuilding ideas through dialogue doesn't quite sit well with me, but I'm not entirely sure why. It's honestly really hard to imagine any other form of exchange. ... It's definitely not the importance of terminology or history, since I fully appreciate both, so what's wrong with this picture?Ultimately, the process *is* as straightforward as that.  I think what's wrong with that picture is that \\"straightforward\\" does not equate to \\"simple\\" or \\"approachable without preparation\\" (or \\"having implications that fit into your memory all at once\\", hence books as a storage medium).If you read one of Plato's early dialogues, you'll encounter lots of ideas you can dismantle and rebuild right there.  The same process is applicable to ideas that have been built up over centuries, but they're often huge, complex ideas that carry a lot of context - so the straightforward process could take years to apply.  The solution is to have applied that process to the component ideas already, so you can implement the process one chunk at a time, at a manageable rate.Beyond classes and Reddit, have you tried reading and interrogating modern philosophy research - the primary sources - that interests you?  You'll see that they assemble (and show you how they assemble) a vast array of ideas to build up something new.  The assumption is that you have the background, not to know that each element is authoritative, but to accept or reject it, having already taken a hammer to it.Or they may actually begin from the ground up, more or less, and show you all the bits you should hammer on.  I've read a couple of philosophy books (primary sources doing research, not secondary sources) that show you their point from the ground up, and expose the whole thing to the hammer.","title":"CMV: Academic philosophy is not philosophy"},{"text":"Were not all that dumb.","title":"Latest presidential polls: Voters like Kamala Harris more than Trump"},{"text":"Not necessarily.

For example, such platforms must (1) provide users with notice that the website uses such algorithms, and (2) make available a version of the platform that uses algorithms that do not prioritize information based on user data.The bill provides for enforcement through the Federal Trade Commission and states.Further, the bill requires the commission to seek to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the risks of harm to minors by the use of social media and other online platforms.The bill establishes a council to advise on implementing the bill.

US importers of record are.  For example, say pre Trump tariffs \\"They\\" manufacture a product for $80 cost and sell it to a US importer for $100.  The importer (customer) pays $100 to the chinese, and then pays the US government the normal tariff.  In the raw materials industry it's typically 2.5-6.5% generally.  So the US importer is paying $106.50 total, the Chinese supplier is making $20.  Now with the trump tarrifs, there's an extra 25% on top of the normal rate.  China makes it for $80, sells it to the US for $100, and the US customer pays China $100, and pays US customs $31.50.  China still makes $20, but the US buyer is paying $131.50 instead of $106.50.   no nothing changes with China's bottom line, because the rest of the world has increased their price from $120 to $130....just under China's....but not really.  Also they don't have the supply capabilities so it really doesn't matter.  All these raw materials that we import, again which is in the hundreds and going into every manufacturing industry in the US, are now 25% more expensive and it's not hurting China at all.","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"It would be great if Rogan would offer an endorsement of Harris.

Gerrymandering is a small part, but the rural/urban divide and a lack of understanding of the area by the new  urba/suburban power brokers and activists in the party doesnt help. County level votes in that area have grown a bit redder, and those arent boundaries you can gerrymander.1. If you want to win NC, invest in NC-1.

And the allegation that it was provoked by the rhetoric of Democrats is patently absurd and cynical. Let me just make my view about this crystal clear:  The claim that Donald Trump is so outside the norms of our politics so as to put many of our institutions and even our democracy in jeopardy is not a dishonest provocation hoping to incite violent lunatics. It is, in fact, a sober judgment made by serious journalists and scholars of *both* parties about the consequences of prompting a malignant narcissist of this sort riding atop a personality cult to the presidency. None of those facts change because a mad man (or two) make attempts on his life. We can't suddenly pretend that Trump is a different person or that \\"Trumpism\\" is a healthier political movement than it is because of these incidents. The way to talk about Trump and \\"Trumpism\\" responsibly is to say what's true, and one truth is that the rhetoric coming from Trump's supporters is far more demagogic and irresponsible than *anything* that has been said by democrats (before or after these recent attempts on Trump's life). Apparently Elon Musk - genius that he is - Tweeted: *\\"And no one is even trying to assassinate President Biden or Vice President Harris\\"* followed by a \\"thinking face\\" emoji. He sent that out to 200 million people before deleting it after there was a backlash. And honestly that's not even close to the worse thing that he's done on \\"X\\". The worse thing he's done is to repeatedly engage with and promote some of the most odious liars and conspiracists that exists on the platform, and thereby poison our public conversation about more or less *any* topic that is politically polarizing.

You are correct in that our body naturally produces GLP-1 hormone, which binds to the GLP-1 receptor to help regulate blood sugar levels and as a result also helps with weight loss (you feel less hungry).The thing is natural GLP-1 has a very very short half-life, like less than two minutes. Your body produces an enzyme (DPP-4) that degrades it very quickly. So synthetic mimics of the horomone (like Ozempic and other GLP-1 receptor agonists) are designed to have a much longer half-life (resistant to DPP-4) and therefore only require weekly doses.Now what the article says is probably true: Ozempic is hella cheap to make. It is made using a procedure called Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This has  been a well researched and established method of making peptides for decades. The father of SPPS (Robert Merrifield) even received a Nobel Prize for his work in creating and developing this method.Here is the thing most people probably dont know: production of peptides using SPPS is one of the most wasteful processes in all of synthetic chemistry. Essentially the amount of starting materials, solvents, etc that you use to make a small amount of desired product is in very large excess and its overall pretty awful for the environment.So in short Ozempic is a brilliant drug that can really help those folks with diabetes (even though it is mostly used for weight loss now), it is cheap to make, but also extremely environmentally unfriendly.","title":"Bernie Sanders says Ozempic can be produced for less than $100 a month"},{"text":"The race is the voters to lose.

Its just the social and societal pressure to go against the norms and live that morality is too great. When you look at slavery, for example, imagine every billionaire  or voluntarily giving up all of their wealth, renouncing the harm theyve cause with their wealth, and then having to train themselves to just, like, work an office job or at restaurants. Pretty unlikely, right?Well, slaves were the equivalent of that wealth, and not only that, there were a lot of slaves who wouldnt have minded a few minutes with their former owner over a barrel. Justifiably. And in the modern equivalent, its far less likely that, say, Walmarts employees are going to rise up and kill Alice or whomever. And child marriage: obviously horrible, but was the primary way of consolidating power. I find it hard to believe every king marrying a 9 year old never saw the problem there. But again, not engaging in this stuff sometimes met you with dire consequences. Maybe you alienate a powerful ally and your country falls. Or maybe you get killed at a dinner by Walder Frey.Obviously, its great that we were able to push past a lot of these regular atrocities and have a greater semblance of a kinder and less violent order in many parts of the of the world. But one thing Ive learned is that its a lot harder to do the right thing than we are generally raised to believe. Even if you leave aside the physical atrocities that civil rights protesters faced  and we should not!    How many people would stand up for integration today if they knew it could cost them their livelihood?Its not hard to find examples of ongoing atrocities in the world or our country that no one is willing to lay themselves on the line for. The vast majority of the time, deep down, we know when something is wrong.

You'd basically shut down the entire legislative body because....once you have the floor you have the floor and could run the time out to prevent the vote from even going forward. This isn't unique to the US senate, this is a quirk of a lot of legislative procedures where having the floor can be abused. In the US this came to a head when in the 60s and 70s it began to be heavily abused to filibuster civil rights act bills. But with the way the US Senate structured the rules, it shut down all business permanently. All committees, other business, confirmations, everything. So they set it up that a 60 vote threshold could over-rule the filibuster and move the bill to an actual vote.

When the government (including public universities) opens up government property to allow people to speak, it cannot deny certain speakers that benefit based on the content or viewpoint of their speech. [The ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/documents/speech-campus) notes that: The First Amendment does not require the government to provide a platform to anyone, but it does prohibit the government from discriminating against speech on the basis of the speakers viewpoint. For example, public colleges and universities have no obligation to fund student publications; however, the Supreme Court has held that if a public university voluntarily provides these funds, it cannot selectively withhold them from particular student publications simply because they advocate a controversial point of view. Of course, public colleges and universities are free to invite whomever they like to speak at commencement ceremonies or other events, just as students are free to protest speakers they find offensive. College administrators cannot, however, dictate which speakers students may invite to campus on their own initiative. If a college or university usually allows students to use campus resources (such as auditoriums) to entertain guests, the school cannot withdraw those resources simply because students have invited a controversial speaker to campus.So a school doesnt need to allow anybody to speak on campus; however, if a public university allows students to invite speakers on campus, it cannot deny that right to certain speakers because of the content or viewpoint of their speech.","title":"South Carolina students oppose Kamala Harris roast featuring far-right host"},{"text":"All the support he needs at this point is votes and, in the case of those manning the campaign, doing what he needs/pays you to do-he has more than enough money to win by this point.","title":"Why Montana might be the biggest roadblock to Harris' plans | Sen.

But here's the thing:You don't know if it's true that most people thought it was morally defensible. You may assume as much for reasons that don't seem too suspect without examination, but consider for a moment whether any data support that conclusion; odds are, you assume it must, regardless of whether that's the case.Continuing with Washington's slavery issue, I'd wager most people at Mt Vernon didn't think it was moral, but that's because most people at Mt Vernon were enslaved. Do we have accurate numbers? Well, no, of course not. No one really cared if slaves wanted to be enslaved. Then you have all the abolitionists who were vocal opponents of slavery, and the white laborers who had to compete for the same paying work slaves were doing for free. Did they think it was moral? No way to know!And of course that's because we really only consult the opinions of the powerful. This just in: several dozen slave-owning aristocrats think slavery is chill as hell. And that's who we're defending with these arguments, right? Those with power.We might say Cromwell was morally sound in his butchery across Ireland, but I doubt the Irish think so! Sure, we know it's bad to do a genocide now, but how could the stupid, morally unsound founders of the US and Canada have known?! It was fine to kill Indians then. The list goes on.We'd also be incredibly hard pressed to identify a contemporary morality we all agree on, even now, so how in the world can we pretend to imagine one from so long ago? We can't, and most people who deploy that argument aren't trying to find a gray area in the complexity of history; they're trying to justify atrocities.

By the time that deal expired in 2022, the average US price per gallon had more than doubled. Not only was that deal bad for consumers at the pump, but it increased production and transportation costs, and that increased the cost of almost everything.","title":"Biden/Harris was better for economy.

Not every open-ended discussion has to, but if we invest major effort in something professionally, we want to make progress, not just have interesting conversations.  This is the same reason a scientific paper is expected to summarize (and show familiarity with) the current state of the research.\\n- Learning the conventions and definitions typically used in the relevant context, so we don't have to fight over the format and can get to the ideas. That being said, I have developed this habit in recent years where I assume every physics concept introduced to me is false until the only obvious options are acceptance or self contradiction.That's potentially a great habit for a working (or hobbyist) physicist, and sometimes it's how innovation happens.  Not so much for an engineer who just needs to know how friction works so they can design something. Going back to philosophy and applying this same habit (is that even a good idea?), why should I believe authoritative answers if I can't metaphorically bang on them with a hammer?If you're aiming to *do* philosophy, you shouldn't.  In that case, you should think of places like r/AskPhilosophy as a good way to find major ideas and their sources, which you can then go bang on with a hammer.  But they can't do the banging for you, so their job is to show you something you can either accept (if your goal is to know some philosophy, not do it) or go bang on.Same goes for the sort of coursework that's basically just history of philosophy. Despite this frustration, I think I am beginning to see that this might not necessarily be a problem with academic philosophy but instead with how I prefer to learn.I'd say mismatch, not problem - but I'd also stress that we're talking about relatively low-level philosophy teaching, not the academic practice of philosophy in a research context.But, yeah, if you want to interrogate everything thoroughly, a typical entry-level course, encyclopedia, or Q&amp;A forum is going to give you sources to interrogate, at best, not a good space for interrogation.  That's also how, say, a graduate student (i.e., approaching it in a professional academic capacity) would be expected to approach it.You might find it more productive to read, argue with, and discuss the primary sources, rather than a coursework delivery.

The poor decisions in Iraq are felt in the daily rocket attacks across the Middle East. But like you said, being too critical emboldens the opposition and raises doubt about our ideas. The simple act of removing Sadam Hussein kept oil markets stabilized for nearly 2 decades before COVID happened. The growth in the 2010s increased wealth around the world and raised living standards. But can these positives be attributed to neoliberalism? I dont think so. If we separate the military achievement in Iraq from the failed economic policies, we can have a more productive conversation about what economics ideas worked and what didnt.

The specifics are new, but the core ideas kinda aren't.And there have been a wide variety of societies for thousands of years, like how in several thousand bc, the ancient Persians had outlawed slavery as their religion deemed it immoral (though the rich still tried to find ways around it).Basically, what I'm saying is that almost all of these issues aren't actually new, and have always been contested.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"The problem is: it literally is not a tax on American consumers.

Usually, 60 votes are required to bypass the filibuster and vote on a bill. There are some exceptions, like budget bills, that can go forward and pass with just 50 votes.The filibuster is not mandated by the Constitution, and the majority party in the Senate could remove it if they chose. This has already happened in some areas: For example, Democrats dropped the filibuster for confirming inferior court judges, so Republicans dropped the filibuster for Supreme Court justices in order to confirm Gorsuch.Historically, filibustering senators had to speak continuously to delay a vote. Now they've just all agreed to pretend that's happening and require 60 votes to bring a bill to vote.As you might know, neither party has had 60 senators since Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died in 2009 and was unexpectedly replaced by a Republican in a special election. All the big legislation since then has essentially been done through the budgetary process.In 2009, Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) famously killed cap-and-trade legislation, which failed to bypass the filibuster when he joined Republicans in voting against it. His campaign ads after this would show him shooting the bill.Also in 2009, the Senate quickly passed a very rough working draft of the Affordable Care Act before Kennedy's absence, just in case he diedwhich he did. After he was replaced by a Republican, the Senate was unable to pass a better, more refined version of the ACA, and the House had to pass the Senate's draft version, which is what became law. The clunky, sometimes contradictory language of the ACA spawned many court challenges, even after the law's overall constitutionality was upheld. See, e.g., *King v. Burwell*.","title":"Republicans block Senate Democrats IVF bill"},{"text":"Correct.  There aren't US manufacturers for the vast majority of these products, that was my point.

This idea was established in the 1700s but really held on in science for a shocking amount of time. White European and American people had been justifying slavery a myriad of other ways (including religion, economics, and white saviorism), racist science was only one of them &amp; was still going full swing for quite a long time after abolition.
