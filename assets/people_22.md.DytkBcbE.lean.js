Your opinion is bullshit. The bad stuff doesnt reach them. Thats not their fault. Our algorithms and echo chambers dont lead to either side having a clear picture of the other. We see the worst of the worst of republicans but theyre seeing none of that, and only the worst things that democrats say and do.Ask yourself- why do so many people, who are otherwise average intelligence, think Kamala Harris is dumb? Shes a lot of things- but dumb is not even in the picture. The problem is, half the country actually believes she is dumb because thats all theyve seen. A few months ago I was 100% certain Trump was a drooling potato with dementia. I listened to 5 minutes of the Theo Von podcast (Bernie was the only other episode of Theo Von Ive ever listened to) with him- its not true at all. Trump is completely coherent, mildly charming, yet incredibly dumb. There are hours of him on Joe Rogan expressing coherent and lucid thoughts.  Very dumb thoughts, and not at all being challenged, but he doesnt have dementia. I hadnt seen that side of him in my bubble. On the flip side a year ago I thought the right wing rumbling on Bidens decline was bullshit because I had seen clips of him seemingly doing well. Its clear we were wrong about that as well. If we can be wrong and misled by the news and communities we use to communicate our opinions- why does it mean the other side, who are also misled, are the worst people on earth? We can only process what we see, and there are parts of America that are clearly seeing two different presentations.I re-read the Mueller report. When it came out I read it with bias and inserted my existing opinions into the report. It is clear to me Mueller did not think Trump was a Russian asset prior to his campaign. There is no logical reason why Mueller would document attempts by Russians to meet with Trump campaign officials if Donald Trump was already a Russian asset. It doesnt make logical sense, but Trump being a Russian asset has been something I believed since the story started getting reported on. Trump accepted the help, but there was no agreement between Trump and Russia that existed before the campaign. If Trump didnt run as a Russian asset, it changes what kind of threat he is. Hes not very bright, hes hateful, I dont think he makes decisions to benefit anyone but himself. There were a lot of failures leading up to Trump being re-elected, but lets not repeat them. Democrats have run bad campaigns and have slept for decades while republicans slowly built an unstoppable propaganda ecosystem. This bubble exists for the left wing, too. If you see THIS bad of an electoral defeat and respond by feeling so self righteous and you dont question if your beliefs are actually real, then I dont know what to tell you. There is something we are missing, and have been missing for a decade.  Calling them bad people and thinking that explains it is giving up.","title":"Why Did Trump Win?

That statement neatly describes Donald Trumps sweeping electoral victory this week. But Ruffini wrote it more than a year ago.Even though Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he dramatically improved his performance that year among Black and, especially, Latino voters compared with 2016. According to Ruffinis 2023 book, Party of the People, this was no fluke. American politics was undergoing a fundamental reordering in which the old dividing lines of race and wealth were being supplanted by new ones, namely education and trust in institutions. The ties that once bound low-income and nonwhite voters to the Democratic Party, he argued, were breaking. If this trend continues, Ruffini wrote, it would mean the birth of a new party system, replacing the old twentieth-century class divide between the parties.Then came 2024, Karma continues. We dont yet have precise data on how different groups voted, but the geographic swings make certain conclusions unavoidable. Trump made gains everywhere on Tuesday, but the places where he improved the most compared with 2020 were heavily nonwhite counties that have overwhelmingly supported Democrats for decades In Ruffinis view, the Democratic Party can no longer take the votes of nonwhite Americans for granted. I think if they want to win back some of these voters, he told me, Democrats need to stop presenting themselves solely as the defenders of American institutions and instead as a party committed to change.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/G06GyTsY](https://theatln.tc/G06GyTsY)?","title":"The Strategist Who Predicted Trumps Multiracial Coalition"},{"text":"The three lettered agencies did quite well under his tenure.","title":"Why Isnt Bush Hated as Much as Trump?"},{"text":"It feels like hes in the beginning stages of becoming a Bill Maher type like, you can see theres something inside him that knows shits not right, but he cant escape the grasp of his conditioning, so even once he does stop being afraid to call shit out, he'll still vote to keep the shit in place.","title":"Fetterman: Those Who Forced Biden Out Are Responsible For Trump Win"},{"text":"How are his policies not popular if he won?

People in this state are easier to deceive and control. So then they push this narrative, and people accept it without any logic or critical thought. They push it so hard that the narrative *becomes* a core part of who they they are as a person.

Dem policies did pretty good: abortions rights, marijuana legalization, raising the minimum wage, etc so it appears to be more of a rejection of the candidate or in this case the administration, than the parties policies.Kamala may have lost as soon as she said shed do nothing different than Joe.  His approval rating then was in the low 30s. She wanted to be respectful of him but politically that may have been suicidal.This isnt one groups fault.

Im not a supporter, but I do actually just watch his rallies and speeches and they can be funny, engaging, charming, and authentic. He isnt just raving or senile or demented. The MSMs coverage of him is often demonstrably wrong about him, and people see it.?They also see that they dont think hes a fascist or a racist or a sexist, because they dont use those words the same way. Those labels seem as silly as seriously calling Kamala a communist. And a lot of people resent the MSM and the mainstream Democratic Party for what they are trying to shove down the publics throats.?For a lot of Americans, there are a lot of accumulated grievances about stuff like that, from covid to immigration, where they are extremely fed up with the democratic partys messaging. I think on immigration and the economy, people are seeing with their own eyes and feeling those issues on Main Street and at the kitchen table, but the democrats dont have a narrative about whats happening that makes sense to anyone. Trumps explanations arent right either, but at least he talks about the problems in a way that feels real. The democrats wont talk about immigration, for example, as if its a giant crisis, even when many people feel that way and dont want to be labeled racists about it.?And by the way, labeling half the country deplorables and trying to scold and lecture and hector your way into office doesnt work. It makes people hate you. The dems have to grapple with that legacy.?The other issue I think youre missing is identity, which also has a number of other descriptors. Lots of voters didnt LIKE Kamala. She didnt make them feel good about anything. She seemed snobby and standoffish and not their gal. Trump on paper is obviously not an everyman, but yet he connects with the American people and does a better job doing it than she did.?The more conventional narrative has to do with a small number of targeted demographics in swing states (black men in Pennsylvania, Arabs in Michigan, etc. ) and there are interesting things to say about those in detail. Theres also the missing ten million Biden voters. Their demographics are also important. But I think there are some higher-level lessons to be learned as well, apart from sifting through the demographics.?I mean, on paper in many ways, Trump is a terrible candidate. But he is also unnaturally effective with the American people. If youre considering whether its the fact that Kamela is a black woman, Trump is an example of how someone who youd think would be unpopular can win by force of personality. Find that equivalent in a black woman and youd have your president.?Kamala was qualified to be president in n the sense?that Id hire her to be CEO of something. But she didnt win over the American people and thats on her, not in them.?","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"??.

Still today, they love to group people into racial categories. They still have the mentality of overseers/masters of the plantation.I'm a conservative and vote according to policy, not party.

And almost passing a Republican immigration bill. A lot of Latinos are conservative and only sway Dem because of immigration policy. Take that away and you won't get many votes. - they went out of their way to alienate Arab voters with a genocide in Gaza. You can talk all you want about Trump being worse, it was Biden who gave the green light and bypassed Congress to give Israel even more weapons than they would have otherwise received. And then lied about their war crimes like the saying he saw pics of 40 beheaded babies and having to pull that back when it turned out to be made up by the IDF. - they alienate progressives by celebrating the Cheney's meanwhile not giving progressives anything. They did little to fight for a stronger safety net, for universal healthcare, or for an end to dark money in politics. They seem beholden to the corporate bankers and don't serve the people. - they alienate the youth by how they behaved toward the college protesters. They beat those kids, arrested them, called them antisemites even when the protests were led by Jewish students. Or like in the case at UCLA they were called violent because they were violently attacked by pro-genocide counter protestors. - they alienate environmentalists with record oil production. As I see it, the Dems forfeit this election by, not only standing for the status quo, but moving too far right. The Dems say nice things but either don't act or act opposite to their talking points.

The Tariffs increased prices on many goods as a tax on imported goods, making the decrease in taxes for the lower and middle classes effectively worthless.Neither side really have a good plan that can be backed with numbers.  Pretty much since Reagan, it's been an economical landscape that allows companies and billionaires to thrive while wealth slowly transfers away from the lower and middle classes.Main point being, Republicans are allowing corporations free reign while touting ineffective ideals as a solution when they aren't.

First of all, nearly all homeowners *do* overvalue their homes. That's a very big reason they don't sell them. You're talking about *price*, not value.But there are multiple things that would happen. Probably the most important being that many more houses would be built, because the profit incentive to build houses would increase (especially considering that the housing prices aren't going up due to increase of manufacturing costs, but because a cartel has simply decided so.) That's what economics (and Capitalism, specifically) is about. That would increase supply and drive down prices, because it really doesn't matter what people *price* their homes at, they can only sell it for what people are willing to actually pay. Prices go up when demand is greater than supply. Even if everybody who controls the supply gets greedy, it doesn't prevent other actors from stepping in and increasing the supply, fulfilling demand until the profit incentive is reduced (most likely because all the idiots you're talking about realize that they will never sell their house for what they are asking for, so they reduce it to even lower than it was prior to their idiotic idea...because it's worth less now after the increase in supply.)You can extrapolate this to nearly every industry that doesn't have a government supported monopoly.Edit:What would happen?

Whenever they're worried that people are going to the right, it seems like they're determined to show that they're right wing themselves. I canvassed for Sherrod Brown, and when I read through the materials for talking points I could use, it was all about how often he votes with Republicans. It's such a stupid strategy, because if people want a Republican they will vote Republican. All it's going to do is make people feel like it doesn't matter who wins if they're on the left. It also creates this idea in people's head that agreeing with Republicans is the default and desirable stance.What I want to see is Democrats saying 'this is what I stand for, and this is why it's good for you'. Don't focus on 'doing the right thing' issues, because the average American doesn't vote on issues because they'll help those in need or improve the environment. Point out that historically, the economy generally does better under Democrats than Republicans. Explain that more money to welfare recipients usually puts money in everyone's hands, because they usually spend it immediately, which means wherever they spend it gets more income and has to hire more people to service more customers, who then spend more money and it just keeps going in an upward spiral. When rich people get money, while they spend a portion of it and might send a small percentage of it to charity, most of it just stagnates and is essentially removed from the economy. Once people reach a level of wealth where getting more money has no impact on their spending, it is good for the economy to tax them more, because if you just leave them with that money you might as well have lit it on fire because no one will ever spend it.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Clearly you didnt get my sarcasm","title":"Trump voters, are you excited about Project 2025 policies passing or do you believe Trump and the Republican Senate (and House?) are not really going to pass those policies?"},{"text":"We will prevail.

Oh, and they are perfect examples of Dunning-Kruger.Want to know why the cost of your eggs, milk, and rent is high dummies? Here you go:- In 2017, Trump (not Biden, not Harris) signed an almost $2 trillion tax cut for corporations. That $2 trillion in taxes would have remained in the economy but was erased. It went to share buybacks, dividends, and the ultra-rich. No jobs were created. No wages were increased. No prices were lowered. Just a BIG FAT STEAL of money from the US economy into the wallets of the rich- In 2020, a global pandemic hit. Team Trump sent Americans \\"free money\\" with Trump's name on the fucking checks. It wasn't his money, dummies and there is no such thing as \\"free\\" money. Someone always pays. Well, except Trump. He's a well-known deadbeat.- So, all that newly printed money simply devalued the existing currency. Do you know what \\"devalued\\" means? It means the same $1 can buy a \\"whatsit\\" today can only buy 80 cents worth of \\"whatsit\\" tomorrow. That's also called INFLATION, because the cost of things are (stay with me) \\"...inflated\\" to match what the $1 used to be worth.So, to recap for the paste-eaters: - Trillions of your tax dollars (that should have been circulating in your economy) were given to the rich (not you) and then Trump devalued the money in your own pocket, causing your life to get more expensive.And millions of fucking morons eagerly voted for him to do it again.

Even a perfect democracy (and the USA is far from a perfect democracy) will not survive in the long run when only a minority can be counted on to vote to preserve it.The American experiment to build a democracy is over.

They certainly have gotten drastically worse in the last 8 years.Coming from a conservative perspective, I started listening somewhere around 2008. There were legitimately good programs like Car Talk that were exactly what they were - laughing about car problems and possible fixes. The news was already biased though, everything conservative was given a negative slant, everything liberal a positive one. Liberal candidates were protecting freedoms and conservative candidates were supporting business over people.Now every single program repeats every liberal hoax without question or criticality.. At some point around 2020 I wrote a email pointing out several things that had long since been disproven but were presented as non-opinion news and requested that they issue a retraction for their own integrity. I dont think anything they presented about COVID, impeachments, or out of context statements has ever been retracted despite hundreds of demonstrably false statements.I used to listen because I legitimately wanted to understand a wide range of perspectives. Now its just blatant propaganda, hoaxes, and lies presented as news. Its sad that people listen uncritically and consider it some bastion of journalistic ?integrity. Its opinion talk radio and nothing more. All of the non-news shows are so deeply biased that they are offensive to anyone not completely on board with the propaganda - not because they are putting down half the country, but because they are doing it so slopppily and lazily that it looks like middle school bullying rather than good spirited humor.I cant learn anything when all I hear is half truths or complete lies followed by commentary about how stupid I am for not believing or agreeing. It makes the programs, presenters, and guests appear naive or dumb at best, and evil and nefarious at worst. The few remaining unbiased shows (maybe only American Test Kitchen) have to sit next to all of this garbage.

The internet giving people the idea that their Google search is equal to or better than experts, and 2. Social media algorithms pushing only the most extreme takes toward people, giving them a false impression of what's happening in our country, and making men and white people in general feel constantly under attack because of amplified liberal hot takes. Stuff like \\"Man or bear in the woods\\" pushed many men who would otherwise be amicable to liberal opinions and ideas toward the right, and into the hands of Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate. I think 10 years of liberals having higher numbers on the internet has disproportionately pushed more people to the right than the extreme right have pushed to the left. We've played ourselves by allowing the most smug social justice warriors on the internet shout down at people without us speaking up to tell them to chill.This election was decided on internet supported ignorance and algorithm amplified attacks on people who don't deserve it.Harris ran a great campaign, its just that no one was there to hear or understand it. Trump ran a terrible, unplanned mess of a campaign but the general vibe of male and white grievance politics gave many people a place to feel safe and welcome against attacks against them.We as liberals need to do better at communicating things like privilege, feminism, and equal rights. We need to stop calling people garbage, and we need to have in person dialogue with the average person, because despite what we see on social media, the vast majority of these voters aren't hateful bigots, they're low information voters who feel safe in that party. Make them feel safe with us too.","title":"A big cratering: an expert on gen Zs surprise votes C and young womens growing support for Trump"},{"text":"Show videos from the man show.

This is basic economics: *Equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity of a good or service that is demanded is equal to the quantity that is supplied.?It's also known as the market-clearing price*3) Ironically, to achieve this kind of market would require government intervention. We see the inverse happen in places like the labor market. 4) Your assessment of how the market would react to such a scenario is implausible.   \\n  \\n\\\\- People would immediately compensate by downsizing, living together with family/roommates, relocating to more affordable areas, etc.   \\n\\\\- Builders would see opportunity and a huge influx of new housing would inundate the market (again, assuming government red tape wouldn't interfere)  \\n\\\\- Homeowners wishing to actually sell their homes would have to lower their prices to do so  \\n\\\\- These same homeowners need to live somewhere, right? What would even be the point of inflating home values if they need to re-purchase to live in another comparable home, unless they're downsizing/relocating to a more affordable area?   \\n\\\\- Banks, appraisers, and realtors would somehow magically have to be in on this bizarre scheme. People's creditworthiness would not magically increase so your \\"they'd have to pay double and bite the bullet!\\" idea couldn't even happen, realistically. They'd qualify for the same amount as they did before and would just end up with a smaller home than what they wanted. So realistically it would just look like a huge curve -- where selling your home becomes increasingly more difficult the more expensive it gets, as the market for people who even qualifies to purchase it becomes smaller and smaller. for example, electric providers who are the only option in an area.?Another irony, as this is an argument against government regulation and in favor of free enterprise. In most jurisdictions, state regulations effectively grant a monopoly to established utility companies, meaning that other businesses cannot legally compete with them within their designated service areas, essentially preventing new entrants into the market. Public utilities are some of the most regulated markets in the country. If they wanted it, they could 3x their prices tomorrow.?Well no, they couldn't. They're subject to price caps, regulatory mumbo jumbo like \\"fair and just returns on cost\\", etc. I'll stop here, but I don't think you could really articulate and provide details for what you think is \\"greedflation\\".

She's arguably more to the right than some previous Republican presidents.\\nI agree that the idea of Harris being Stalin is ludicrous.  I don't agree that she is a present day centrist though.7. There always has been a battlefield. There always has been a party which fought against the rights of minorities, whether black people, homosexual people or other.\\nI disagree, democracy has been replaces with theocratic Demagogues. 8. You can't transcend the divide between left and right. Some people will want to concentrate power into the hands of fewer people, some will want to spread power into the hands of more people. \\nI argue you can transcend,  through education and conversations. 9. Remember, it's the Republican Party which has a history of fighting against the rights of women, black people, homosexual people and others. They are the ones dividing the nation. They can't be dividng a nation if that side just won the populis vote. It seems in context the side in which you align would be dividing the nation.You're just using a lot of words to do another 'both-sidesism'. When there's a conflict, it's not always the more mature thing to say that the truth exists in the middle of both parties. Sometimes, the mature thing is to recognize that one side is just wrong.Seems as if you are gaslighting me into saying your side is better. Without much evidence of driving home a point.","title":"CMV: It is only when the meaning of life has social proof that we require a nation of support to be comfortable with ourselves."},{"text":"No worries.\\nMy perception of him is colored a little bit because I know someone who knows him and absolutely hates him.   \\nHe is a narcissist, and to protect his ego he lashes out and lies when it comes to his ego.\\nThat said I do believe that he does care about America, even if it is in relation to his own ego.

Compare this to the GOP, where their base was draped in Trump swag and was ready to get out on Election Day, no matter what. Theres definitely something going on when your base, the voters who you can rely on to get out on Election Day, have a feeling of meh about their candidate. But whats the solution to this? Well, thats a harder question. The party has been very transactional in its policy recently, assuming that voters will do their due diligence and compare policy programs for how their lives will be impacted. This academic approach is simply not how most voters make their choice. They make their choice based on their community, their culture, and their personal beliefs. The Dems need to start listening to the voters and meeting them where they are, rather than telling them what they need to do in order to improve themselves.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Yeah, Ive said similar to people I know who watch Fox or other ridiculously right wing media - you are absolutely worse off for having listened to them then even not knowing anything at all.

Of course we all know about Fox and Sinclair, but there's so much more to it than that--look at the LA Times and Washington Post situations--right wing billionaires are buying up media outlets and putting their thumbs on the scale. Then you have Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms, owned by one of the biggest Trump shills on the planet, while Zuckerberg over on Facebook is now saying stopping disinformation is a bad thing.So when the right wing controls the good majority of the media people consume, Democrats are going to have a very hard time promoting their policies. It may already be too late to turn things around--if Harris loses this election, this country is doomed. If she wins, then serious steps need to be taken to curb the influence of a small handful of very rich bad actors over information, or it's only a matter of time before this country is lost for good.","title":"\\"Misinformation works [...] There is NO candidate that can change this.

On a broader point, I do think there's something to be said for educating and actually persuading voters when it's warranted, and not just meeting them where they are on every issue. That's what I was trying to get at with immigration too. Americans are kinda complicated on this subject in polling: I think they both approve of deportation and also a path to citizenship. There was a media frenzy fear-mongering on the subject that greatly influenced the election, but I think it was a mistake for Dems to basically just say \\"yes, you're right about all of this rampant immigrant crime, let's work together to stop it\\" instead of arguing the facts of the case.

People understand what was offered. The problem is that the solutions Democrats provided are not good enough! If Democrats had come out with strong protections for workers in this economy, if they had campaigned on issues that matter, then the choice between Donald and Kamala would have ended up differently. And time and time again Americans told the party what matters to them.... Prices are too high, wages are too low, health care and child care are too expensive, housing costs are too expensive, education is too expensive, and our families are hurting. Actions matter, and when you are given power Americans want to see that you are using it to help them. Period. Instead voters were mostly told that inflation is down... Don't worry! The economy is great... Don't worry! Your wages are up .. don't worry. That doesn't work when Americans feel the pain of inflation and the high cost of living literally every single day. It signals, and rightfully so, that the Democrats are out of touch and don't understand what workers are enduring. On top of all of that you push a democratic candidate down everyone's throats...  One that has been rejected twice already... Once in the previous primary, and again with such a low approval rating in this administration. This further signals that Democrats are out of touch with the people. Democrats offered policies that were too little too late by a candidate that was not liked and not wanted. That is a recipe to lose an election, and a repeat of 2016. You would think they would learn a lesson. Here is the winning formula: pick a candidate that is articulate, intelligent, and will stand up for working Americans. Pick a candidate that can show they understand these problems. Pick a candidate that doesn't bow down to corporate money. Then adopt a platform that helps workers...  Healthcare, housing, lower prices, low inflation, reign in education costs, child care, paid leave, taxing the wealthy, increased wages, strengthening social security, etc. When you are elected, do the things you said you're going to do! Don't cave to your rich donors... Help real working Americans to have better lives. Not a little better... Not 20% better... Significantly better.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Trump doesn't have a 'peace plan' for Ukraine, he has a surrender plan that he knows will be rejected.Europe is not Donald Trump's to hand away.","title":"Trump adviser says focus must be on peace over regaining territory in Ukraine"},{"text":"The wealthy love a good economic crash and disaster capitalism.

Tim Walz vows to fight Donald Trumps agenda while working to understand his appeal"},{"text":"So, one of the things about political punditry is that it so often ignores history, when looking at voter motives and economics particularly. This is arguing that swing voters were difficult to persuade that the *bad* things about the Trump time were his responsibility or fault. They just mainly remembered the economy was good. And thats why they swung Trump in the end. But lets make it less shallow and go a step further: if they remember the good economy as being due to Trump, then whys that? There was a terrible crash at the end of GW Bushs presidency. During Obamas 8 years, we came out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression and rebuilt to a booming economy (albeit with an income gap continuing to widen). Trump took office and, despite him dumping tons more money into the economy during a boom (not a good idea as he increased the deficit and overheated the economy contributing to the inflation that was to come), did not improve the trajectory of any economic indicator from what he inherited from Obama. Much of political media reported at that time the good economic news without the historical context, as they usually do. How many people realized that the unemployment rate was on-trajectory from Obamas term? I blame the political media for a *lot* of the wide-spread idea that the economy at any moment is due to the sitting presidents policies. The president has a limited impact on the economy, but most of what they can do still takes time to ripple through the economy and become noticeable. But beyond that, how one perceived the creation of the good economy during Trumps term was still to a degree a matter of what media one consumed. People who remember it as the greatest economy of all time were already pretty deep in Trump media. There were a lot of showing cracks in that economy, and they were discussed elsewhere. Then, of course, inflation: all the prompts for the growth in inflation were teed-off during Trumps term. These include over-heating the economy by dumping cash through tax cuts (of course the ones for the middle class set with expiration dates but those for corporations permanent), tariffs, and COVID (obviously not Trumps fault, but certainly not Bidens and Trump mismanaged it). Trad political media does a terrible job of reporting economic context. Right wing media of course just openly dissembles (blames Biden for inflation because he pushed money into the economy during a *recovery* which is what youre meant to do; ignores the impact of supply chain disruptions; ignores that Trump pushed money into the economy during a *boom* (that was in full swing at the end of Obamas term) which is just irresponsible. This cycle - Republican inherits a good economy, passes on a bad economy to Democrat. Democrat blamed for bad economy, passes on good economy to Republican. Republican credited for good economy, passes on a bad economy to Democrat, repeat - has been going on since G**H**W Bush. And it persists. Bidens recovery will be credited to Trump, no doubt. How actively will the media report that the decreased inflation and the construction jobs, which lead to further growth, were from *Biden* when the effects are felt in the next few years? And will the *next* President be blamed for the effects of Trumps tariffs if he follows up on that?And in anticipation, how much has the media explained what the effects of blanket tariffs are?The political media has a significant role in peoples false perceptions here. The right wing media cannot be controlled by trad/center or left media. Theyll just lie about it. But the rest could do a fuckload better in economics reporting.","title":"Why Did Trump Win?

The people who control the prices in tier 3 cities can not collaborate, because there are too many of them.That is to say. is it true that housing prices in the USA are exploding? it is not true at all.

Or explain a complex multi-level approach across several sectors.Its also worth noting that when half your base does not expect you to actually follow through on the more drastic measures like Trumps deportation plan or national abortion ban, the truth or accuracy of your statements does not matter. Youve taken both positions at the same time and secured both group of votes.Youre asking democrats to essentially lie as well in order to have a chance at countering the volley of misinformation he spewed. Taking abortion messaging as one example:If Trump says, *Democrats are killing babies at all stages.*How effective is long winded messaging breaking down the medical circumstances for each statistic miscarriages and other health complications which is the truth.\\nVS.\\n*Trumps lying yall!* for a yard sign \\nWhich is technically a lie since they do not distinguish between the circumstances even if the mother wanted the child, only that the pregnancy was aborted and groups like Fox will just pull up the stats without context.Its far better messaging to simply assign blame to someone else, Biden, Immigrants, antifa, woke etc. Theres improvements to be made for sure but Americans seem to want simple answers they can understand to incredible complex problems and generally the bases of each party hold them to different standards.

Until they show up at your doorstep (Que some trumpy moron saying \\"uh huh but just wait they will!\\") they've got nothing on you. Yes, they will cause tangible problems, you will have less money, you might lose your job and your insurance, but I'm not talking about THOSE problems.I'm talking about the mindfuck they want to keep running. Be aware that it's what they're doing - Attempting to demoralize and intimidate - and just tune it out or laugh at. The trumper dipshits will hear it and think \\"yuk yuk that's ownin' the libs\\" but for the rest of us... Don't take the bait. Just prepare for more hostility and stupidity. If it DOES show up on your doorstep, which it almost certainly won't, you have an individual choice to acquiesce or resist.This era WILL pass us by. It is destined to fail and people will wake the fuck up and push it aside in due time. For now, we get to hear the small and obnoxiously vocal minority position that is MAGA screech and hoot and feel like they have a point...

When corporations are forced to provide insurance for employees that they previously did not, that cost gets passed on to the consumer.

Grocery stores for instance, operate on about a 2% profit margin, even though the media will tell you that food prices have gone up because grocery stores are greedy.\\nRestaurants operate on about a 5% profit margin so when the government is forcing restaurant managers to pay $20 an hour to weight staff, that can bankrupt a restaurant quickly.

In fact, they only truly reconciled post Sino-Soviet split once the war in Ukraine started. Before that, there hasn't really been any major progress in warming up their relations post-split. The fact that the propaganda won't tell you is that Russia would've preferred an alliance with the West against China, rather than the other way around. They probably still do.One can keep living in denial, but it's been obvious since early 2022 that what put this terrifying new alliance together is the War in Ukraine and the West's continuous push there. And what's even worse is that there seems to  be a lot more interest towards the new Axis, rather than joining forces with an unreliable and ideologically captured West. Even if Ukraine would somehow push the Russians all the way back to the pre-2014 borders, the cost of this war, coupled with the geopolitical shift it caused are still a huge L for the West.

The outright greed is where the problem lies, and that is directly linked to a breakdown of a traditional moral center. The purpose of business has gone from providing goods and services, and centralizing the market distribution of those goods and services (i.e. consolidating independent sources under an umbrella to facilitate a broader reach and conformity to quality standards), to get rich or die trying. Price controls restrict a free market economy.Kamala had billions in campaign contributions. Where did the money go? I have not heard one word about her campaign spending. Youd think with all that money shed have funded some outrageously slick campaign ads, especially with Hollywood backing. Lets not overlook her ineptitude in interviews and the extremely shady debate antics. Lets also not overlook the fact she has effectively been President for several months while Biden has been unfit for duty. All the stuff she said she would do when she became President could have been done this whole time.Her lack of initiative dealing with the border crisis is also a glaring problem. Everyone is too worried about Roe v Wade, when the SC ruling meant it was a States Rights issue, not a Federal issue. The Federal Government cannot override States authority in many issues. This is why some States can willfully ignore the 2nd Amendment rights of citizens and not be burned to the ground for treason. If you want at-will abortion legalized in your State, replace your State government with one that will legalize it. Everyone is worried about Trumps legal battles and bad manners but say nothing about Congress doing the exact same things. Remember when Congress started raiding the Social Security system to pay for their pork barrel spending? Why is everyone so worried about Trump when none of that has been repaid? 90+ billion USD sent to Ukraine but Americans have to tighten their belts? The government of the United States serves the citizens of the United States, not the world. Yes, it sucks the Ukraine was invaded by Russia. Its a UN problem, not a USA problem. The conflict in the Middle East is the longest running sibling rivalry in history; both Muslim and Jew agree they are both descended from Abraham. Palestine is not Americas problem. They will sort it out on their own. Everyone is worried Trump will pull America back out of the Paris accords and start drilling again to meet our own energy needs, and to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We are not obligated to be a pal and take a bullet for other countries. The United States government is obligated to American citizens above all others. Trumps presumed victory (still watching for the 40 million ballots to be dropped at 3 am with Kamalas name on them) was not due to some poorly managed campaign, or ballot stuffing, or tampering, but because the silent majority voted for America First.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Or they cheated in 2020.Or both, yep both.","title":"Iowa pediatrician tells Trump supporter 'I hope you lose your kid in a school shooting'"},{"text":"After seeing what happened, you think they lazy sacks of shit in this country are going to elect a left leaning president?

They are also subject to regulation by the state.For things like food and shelter without capitalism, who pays for these things? Who grows the food? Who builds the shelters?

Lets say to make the primary debate stage, there are three paths: a) be a billionaire (Bloomberg), b) articulate an economic message on corporate power that resonates with the average citizen, or c) prove youre an effective fundraiser.The right candidate in bucket A could probably pull it off. Thats what Trump did on the Republican side. Bloomberg was not that candidate. You would need a once in a generational class traitor Look how all the major players in the Democratic Party unite to make sure they snuff out any candidates in bucket to B (Warren, Sanders). Practically speaking, these candidates are bad for fundraising. Our election models require billions of dollars to run a campaign. You cant raise that money top to bottom with someone taking on corporate power. The legitimate fear is that they will destroy the party, because they will be outspent from the presidency all the way down to the local school board.So youre left with bucket C. Candidates that have proven willing to play the game, which is to raise a bunch of money while not pissing off the donors. If you make it to the top of the Democratic ticket, you have traded in every value you may have ever had when you started. You wouldve never made it out of the town counselor elections otherwise. Unfortunately youre also left with only Band-Aids as real policy options.Its a bit of a catch 22. Any attempt to touch campaign financing will be considered threatening to corporations. They love buying influence. Also, those billions raised are also billions spent on advisors, staff, commercial , events, etc. There is an entire mini-economy built around this that would collapse if we changed the rules. So a traditional Democrat could never touch it.Unfortunately, I guess that leaves us waiting for the billionaire saviors. Thats the only way we can deliver a message that will resonate with a large swath of the population.Still waiting.Edit: While I agree with your position, I dont see a path to where Democrats could ever deliver an economic message that resonates. So I disagree that messaging is the root cause of the failure.

However, to assert that it was the primary or only cause is somewhat short-sighted. That is also an extremely vague reason.You're fixated on a single issue while ignoring the bigger picture. It's akin to conducting an autopsy and finding a body riddled with evidence of violence: stab wounds, bullet holes, electrocution marks, signs of hanging, blunt force trauma from a baseball bat, a deep axe gash in the forehead, and countless other injuries. Yet, despite all this, you choose to focus on a trace of water in the lungs and label it a drowning.What other contributing factors are there? I am going to surely miss several, but I'll name a few:1: Just a few short months ago women were saying \\"I'd rather encounter a random bear in the woods than a random man.\\" this went viral. It was all over the internet, and it was a major surprise to a lot of young men. Do you think men forgot about that on voting day?2: Attempting to brand the opposition with the label of weird backfired majorly, and it was a losing strategy in the meme war. The right easily countered this one by taking various pictures of progressives that were conventionally unattractive, or obese, or non-passing transgender or unnatural hair color then they put a little speech bubble on there saying \\"You're weird\\".3: There was significant mistrust surrounding the election process. Polls indicate that around 50% of Republicans and roughly 20% of Democrats harbor serious doubts about how voting is conducted and counted. The Democratic stance against voter ID laws and the push for expanded mail-in voting, despite legitimate concerns about election integrity, can make them appear, at best, dismissive of these issues and, at worst, less than fully transparent.4: The past four years have seen record levels of illegal immigration, resulting in significant challenges for communities receiving these individuals. The influx strains local resources, including groceries, housing, and job markets, creating social tensions. By not addressing this issue adequately, it becomes a pressing concern for voters that Democrats often seem to overlook in favor of political correctness. Those who voice these legitimate concerns are frequently dismissed or labeled as racist, which only deepens the divide.5: Grocery prices have surged significantly, yet Democrats continue to assert that \\"The economy is great!\\" Just last week, I spent $120 on groceries and now find myself wondering, \\"What am I even going to cook for dinner today? Do I have anything left?\\" On top of that, I hear Kennedys warnings about the food being contaminated and cant help but notice that many of our food products still contain ingredients banned in Europe. This leaves me feeling that our food supply is not only overpriced but also potentially unsafe.6: Over the past five years, Ive felt gaslighted by mainstream media regarding Joe Bidens mental health. His cognitive decline has been apparent, yet there was a reluctance to address it. Waiting until he was decisively outperformed by Trump in a debate to finally act only reinforced the perception of weakness within the Democratic Party. Additionally, many people feel that Democrats and the media are trying to deceive the public. Right-leaning individuals had recognized these signs of decline long before, with alarm bells sounding years prior to Democrats acknowledging it after the Trump debate.I could discuss this for hours, but I think these six points provide a clear picture of my perspective. Its truly a case of death by a thousand cuts, and yet theres an attempt to isolate a single cause as the fatal blow. If you need more examples or elaboration, just let me know.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Except https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-harris-working-class-vote-trump-election-rcna179186Oh, and Bernie lost to Hillary by a landslide.

I think that resonates with an authenticity factor of why someone would run when it doesnt appear to serve them personally on the level it has served past presidents.

Historian Timothy Snyder puts it better than I ever could in this starkly blunt piece...as you say it does no good to refuse to accept the reality that America voted democracy itself out of existence on Nov 5Unaccountable to the law and to voters, the dictator has no reason to consider anything beyond his own personal interests.  In the twenty-first century, those are simple: dying in bed as a billionaire.  To enrich himself and to stay out of prison, the strongman dismantles the justice system and replaces civil servants with loyalists. The new bureaucrats will have no sense of accountability.  Basic government functions will break down. Citizens who want access will learn to pay bribes.  Bureaucrats in office thanks to patronage will be corrupt, and citizens will be desperate.  Quickly the corruption becomes normal, even unquestioned. As the fantasy of strongman rule fades into everyday dictatorship, people realize that they need things like water or schools or Social Security checks.  Insofar as such goods are available under a dictatorship, they come with a moral as well as a financial price.  When you go to a government office, you will be expected to declare your personal loyalty to the strongman.   If you have a complaint about these practices, too bad.  Americans are litigious people, and many of us assume that we can go to the police or sue.  But when you vote a strong man in, you vote out the rule of law.  In court, only loyalism and wealth will matter.  Americans who do not fear the police will learn to do so.  Those who wear the uniform must either resign or become the enforcers of the whims of one man.\\n____________________________________________Everybody (except the dictator and his family and friends) gets poorer.  The market system depends upon competition.  Under a strongman, there will be no such thing.  The strongman's clan will be favored by government.  Our wealth inequality, bad enough already, will get worse.  Anyone hoping for prosperity will have to seek the patronage of the official oligarchs. Running a small business will become impossible.  As soon as you achieve any sort of success, someone who wants your business denounces you. In the fantasy of the strongman, politics vanishes and all is clear and bright.  In fact, a dreary politics penetrates everything.  You can't run a business without the threat of denunciation.  You can't get basic services without humiliation.  You feel bad about yourself.  You think about what you say, since it can be used against you later.  What you do on the internet is recorded forever, and can land you in prison.Public space closes down around you.  You cannot escape to the bar or the bowling alley, since everything you say is monitored.  The person on the next stool or in the next lane might not turn you in, but you have to assume they will.  If you have a t-shirt or a bumper sticker with a message, someone will report you.  Even if you just repeat the dictator's words, someone can lie about you and denounce you.  And then, if you voted for the strongman, you will be confused.  But you should not be.  This is what you voted for.Denunciation becomes normal behavior.  Without law and voting, denouncing others helps people to feel safe.  Under strongman rule, you cannot trust your colleagues or your friends or even your family.  Political fear not only takes away all public space; it also corrupts all private relationships.  And soon it consumes your thoughts.  If you cannot say what you think, you lose track of what you believe.  You cease to be yourself.\\nAnd:Once this process begins, it is hard to stop.  At the present stage of the strongman fantasy, people imagine an exciting experiment.  If they don't like strongman rule, they think, they can just elect someone else the next time.  This misses the point.  If you help a strongman come to power, you are eliminating democracy.  You burn that bridge behind you.  The strongman fantasy dissolves, and real dictatorship remains.Whole piece here:\\n[The Strongman Fantasy - And Dictatorship in Real Life](https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-strongman-fantasy-text-and-audio)","title":"Pentagon officials discussing how to respond if Trump issues controversial orders"},{"text":"For free!

Everyone is an expert, just like they were all experts before the election, and were all wrong.  I'm a 60-year-old \\"boomer\\" democrat and I can tell you why I think we lost.  \\n  \\n1.  The border.  When asked about open borders, our side deflects, and instead talks about the cruel policies of Trump, racism, the plight of people looking for a better life or to escape a dangerous country, but we never answer the question straight up!!  Two things can be true at the same time.  (1) We can believe America is the land of opportunity, send us your weak etc.  (2) And, we need have strict strong border enforcement policies, and openly state that it should be a priority.  We waited until the last minute to do something and by that time it looked disingenuous and even though Trump killed it, the people saw right through democrats and knew it was a political stunt rather than an important issue to the party running wanting to run the country.2.  Abortion. When asked if it's okay to abort a baby in the 3rd trimester or even \\"after being born\\" (as Trump claimed) when the mother and child are both healthy and viable, we once again deflect, talk around the subject, point to the hypocrisy of the GOP blah blah blah. And by doing so, people heard the answer as \\"yes, we believe a healthy woman should be able to murder a healthy child who is viable outside the womb in the 3rd trimester or even after birth\\".  Dodging the obvious answer is the same as saying yes it's okay and we democrats are okay with it.  And once again two things can be true at once (1) we support a womans right to choose\\" while also saying that we don't support murdering an infant in the 3rd trimester if both the mother and child are healthy and there is not risk.  3.  Voter ID's.  Why is this still a topic?  How many voters do you think are out there clamoring to vote but don't have a freaking ID, c'mon this is stupid!  Guess what my fellow dems, those same fictitious voters you claim exist, are walking around with an iPhone and talking to ChatGPT and streaming movies!  If they're sophisticated enough to utilize modern tech, and sophisticated enough to understand the topics we're voting for, then they're sophisticated enough to get an ID!!  By arguing against this, we push people to the right because it sounds like we want undocumented people to vote for us, as the GOP falsely claims.  4.  Trans issues.  I know this is a complex and sensitive topic, and affects very few people, but it is held up by the MAGA cult as evidence of all other crazy claims they make. Can't we at least directly answer the basic question of whether or not a big burley looking man who appears to be a cisgender male claiming to be a female, shouldn't be allowed in a women's Lockeroom or bathroom, and say it out loud when we answer?  Can't we agree on the idea that a male who spends his life competing as a male and decides at the college level to come out as trans should not be able to use the body he created as man to compete against women?  Again, this is so rare it's ridiculous to even have to ponder, but this is how they paint us into a corner and by not saying we don't support that one miniscule example we confirm their claim, which flies in the face of our other claim of supporting women and Section 8 and all of the other things feminists fought to win.  We can state we don't agree with this one example while still supporting all other trans and LGBTQ issues. We need more Bill Clinton, Barak Obama, Jon Stewart, and Bill Mahar types of straight-talking democrats who aren't afraid to answer the questions head on even when it's uncomfortable and appears contradictory to our message of inclusion.  Our \\"woke agenda\\" is so scary to them that the same people who voted for Obama and then Biden in 2020, ran into the arms of Project 2025 and it's serial sexual assaulting criminal insurrectionist who openly support the most radical right wing racist misogynistic xenophobic positions I've seen in my 60 years.  Let that sit for a while.  How BAD is our message that this is even possible?

There was one interview where she spoke for about 3 minutes on a question and said that she had policies, but did not make mention of any of those policies at all during that interview.    \\nTrump on the other for the first part of his campaign did all the interviews and podcasts he could.

Here come the layoffs.  American workers are too expense?  Get rid of them and offshore it all.Also as mentioned here before, the disparity between the 1% and average worker wasnt nearly so great - its out of control. Billionaires hoarding all of the wealth and influencing policies to keep it that way and probably make it even worse with this incoming administration as thats who Trump caters to.Even the perceived good parts of decades ago can never be that way again and I sense so many uninformed white people, especially males tie in consciously or subconsciously that before women and POC were suppressed and stayed in the background that things were better so they must be the problem and an excuse to not be accountable for their own shortcomings and failures.  Trump goes on about this all of the time and the media are more than happy to give him a stage for it as Trump equals eyeballs / clicks and most media is run by billionaires so he goes on about what a victim he is and how things arent fair, especially to white males and seemingly Latino and Black males have moved over towards him compared to voting for a a woman which is MIND BOGGLING to me.I hope the existing Biden / Harris administration for the last few months can do everything they can to put in guardrails and safety nets to help protect us all during the next 2 (midterms) , 4 (the end of Trump, hopefully) to survive this as a nation.Elizabeth Warren wrote a GREAT piece on what the Democrats can do even assuming they lose the majority of the House (they are still counting but it looks like its going red), along with the POTUS, Senate and Ill include SCOTUS with that even after the switchover in January.

Our Constitution ends that day officially. You dont or cant grasp what happened.","title":"Pentagon officials discussing how to respond if Trump issues controversial orders"},{"text":"I would argue that Trump's victory was primarily a gift given to him by the Biden Administration. Biden wanted to remain as President, so he decided to run for a second term even though his popularity rating really suggested it would be an uphill battle. The only thing to suggest he had a shot at victory was Trump's low approval rating during his term, and his victory in 2020. But the polls showed Biden as behind Trump pretty consistently, so eventually, Democrats that care about winning elections started to pressure him to bow out of the election. After a disastrous debate performance, he did just that.The issue is that by the time Biden dropped out, it didn't leave a lot of time for a proper primary process, and instead, he helped to anoint Kamala Harris as the nominee, despite the fact that she had a lower approval rating than he did, and that she was the least popular candidate in 2020. Others attempted to run against her, but with the momentum she got from Bidens endorsement, it was too late. Kamala became the nominee.The Biden administration, through Jack Smith, also brought charges against Trump, but not until after Trump announced he was running for President. By the time they announced these charges, it was already too late to get them through the courts before the election, regardless of if the Supreme Court had to weigh in. This had multiple effects:1. The Biden administration now has criminally pursued their chief political rival. Whether or not you believe the charges were justified, it gives an impression to many voters that the charges are political in nature, which makes them uncomfortable.\\n2. Trump and his team now knows this election is do or die. If he loses the election, he could face prison time. That ups the stakes of how much they're willing to do to win, which as we saw in 2020, was pretty much anything already. It also motivates his base as a get out the vote function, since their chief candidate could face prison time for his political views, in their perspective.Finally, and to a much lesser extent than the previous two things that Biden did to help give Trump the victory, his messaging at the end of the election about Trump supporters and garbage didn't help. I'm not really going to go into this one, as there is some debate over what was said, and while I would give Biden the benefit of a doubt on what was said, for some voters, they understood that he was calling them trash, which again, serves as a get out the vote influence.My point here is that there is really nothing that Harris could have done from a messaging perspective that she didn't do already. They had Discord servers organizing Reddit brigades, celebrity endorsements, they completely blew Trump out of the water with fundraising for ads. They had their messaging aspect handled. The issue is that Harris was always a wildly unpopular candidate and should never have been the Democratic nominee, as evidenced by the Democratic primary of 2020 and her popularity as vice president. Trump's win is because Bidens actions ensured that the least popular candidate was given the nomination, which gave Trump the best chance at winning.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":" Arab AmericanWe need to stop using all of the hyphenated names and just be Americans.

Replacing workers dedicated to the nation  with loyalists dedicated to trump. The article is a freebie, so please read. \\nSnippets -The closest parallel, Mr. Lewis added, was the spoils system administration of Andrew Jacksons administration nearly two centuries ago, in which government jobs were doled out to cronies and family members....\\nIts clear that there are civil servants with different policy views that work in government, said David E. Lewis, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, who has written extensively on bureaucracies. And in some ways, thats by design. We would expect experts to have opinions about what should be done. Sometimes those opinions fall along party lines, and you end up seeing some agencies with more Republicans and others with more Democrats. But historically speaking, that effect has been small....Several people who were interviewed for this story pointed to Mr. Trumps mercurial character as a factor that might ultimately come to their rescue. Though they did not doubt the sincerity of his hostility toward the deep state, they strained to imagine a 78-year-old man with a notoriously fleeting attention span poring over employee manifests and organizational charts.In the end, what might end up blunting any damage Mr. Trump might try to inflict upon the bureaucracy is its own hidebound imperviousness. One former official at the Transportation Department, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, recalled the more than yearlong effort to obtain the funding for a specific, relatively small project that had already been authorized.It was the nature of bureaucracy, the official said: Nothing could be done, or undone, with the stroke of a pen.\\n...During his first term, Trump outsourced higher education policy to for-profit industry executives who systematically dismantled enforcement and regulatory protections for students, Mr. Ament said. If this term is similar, we could not only see the same harms but find Trump weaponizing the Office for Civil Rights to cut off funds for state universities that teach from books he doesnt like or disagree with him politically.","title":"Inside the Federal Work Force That Trump Has Promised to Eviscerate"},{"text":"At the very least, this is an actual take on policy choices.

I find that worrying over things you can't control brings more stress than any other event happening in your life. I read these headlines and it's depressing. I watch the news and it's depressing. Everything's been depressing and bleak since election night. No matter what I do I can't escape it. The only thing I know to do is tune it all out. I don't know what else to do. But thinking about Trump having \\"near-total\\" power and there being little to stop him in his second term drives me fkng insane. So...I say, good! Let the country get what it deserves. Good! Let Trump come in and fk it all up! Good! Let this country see what it's done. The Democrats best hope? Is for Trump to do his worst, so they have a chance to come back with a more white male candidate since that's all this country will elect. It's not until Trump imposes extremely ridiculous tariffs on everything, drives prices up through the roof, deports 15 million undocumented migrants and shoots inflation up even more from companies having to pay REAL wages to U.S. citizens to perform those roofing jobs or wash those dishes, that Americans will see what they've done. We actually NEED for shit to get bad so that Americans don't make this mistake again with Republicans. I feel like this is honestly the Republican party's last hoorah. It is. Because who do they have after Trump? Vance is even more unpopular than Trump. So whos gonna come in and get Republicans to get up and vote? Who's gonna inspire all the low-information trailer park trash voters that ONLY vote cause of Trump? When Trump is finally gone, the Republican party will be like how the Democratic party was after Obama was done. They struggled to get their footing and it's been costing them ever since. Biden was a nice recovery but they lost their footing again. Biden should've never gone up for reelection. We should've had a primary and let the party select who they wanted. Then we wouldn't have had 15 million of our very own supporters sit the election out. But Republicans are grasping at straws. They really are. They don't have one prospect that is as popular as Trump or will ever be. So this is it for them. I almost feel like we should've gotten this out of the way. Let Trump be reelected 4 yrs ago so he could finish fkng things up. Then inflation would've been blamed ON HIM!! Gas prices would've been ON HIM! This horrible housing market wouldve been ON HIM!! And Dems would've come in each midterm and cleaned their clocks. We would've come in in 2028 and cleaned their clocks. But COVID and people dying and Trump's horrible mouth made people run away from him and elect Biden.

Once the hearings on government abuse begin or when certain states start obstructive legislative or legal actions, then I believe appropriate declassifications and prosecutions will be in order. For example, the censure of Adam Schiff only emboldened CA to give him a promotion. If he so much as looks sideways the American people deserve a full airing of his abuse before giving credence to anything he may start. Those revelations are going to go a long way towards vindicating the mandate given to the Republicans. If they can just stay unified, focused on productive reform and prevent the kind of food fight the Dems stirred up last time, Trump can secure the kind of legacy he deserves.

From personal knowledge I can say that all it takes to be diagnosed as trans is social anxiety and some mild dislike of some aspect of your appearance. It is unbelievable.   I don't want anyone to be made unhappy for what they truly are or truly want.   But the trans agenda has overtaken our schools and the medical establishment and they are creating a generation of kids that will suffer terribly for the rest of their lives.

They should've been touting their accomplishments in weekly press conferences for the last four years.  Instead of selling they were too focused on doing things that their assistants and policy experts should have been doing.  They were too involved in details that they should have delegated.

Isn't that extending the olive branch? But at the same time he states that he was leaving the country because Trump was elected. Called him a criminal. Called him evil.

Said women, children, immigrants, health care, science, journalism, free speech, poor people, middle class, seniors, social security, Ukraine, truth, NATO, democracy, freedom and decency were all doomed.  How it was a horrible day for Democrats. Bragged about how they didnt storm the capitol because they didn't like the results. Also said the Republicans who voted for him will get what they deserve, they just don't know it yet. Said the only thing good about this is Trump can't run again in 2028. Kimmel claimed he will be imprisoned because his side didn't win. Basically encouraged families to disown anyone that voted for Trump. \\nAnd with all of that being said he also says that Trump has the opportunity to bring us all together and be the one who can do something productive. \\nKimmel uses his so called fame to spread his own beliefs.

Many times its started a bit early so that when the person turns 18 or of age they can safely start the process.For many people, knowing that a school is a supportive place where they can talk about who they are without fear can make a huge difference.

China understands that you can't just lift up entire sectors and move them to another country at will, otherwise we (and they) wouldn't be depending solely on Taiwan for all of the world's microchips and nano processors.There's nothing that's going to make China sit at the table and negotiate here. They understand that the American economy depends on Chinese - and global - goods, and that enacting blanket tariffs with the goal to move manufacturing over is only going to knee cap our economy and slow down our sectors while we try to move everything over. Sure, we might see a gradual decrease in importing Chinese goods, but it's going to be incredibly gradual and China understands that.They have the rest of the world to deal with, our economy will suffer, our sectors will lag behind and China will reap the benefits by becoming the world's main exporter while we have to slow everything down.If it does work, awesome man, but you can't tell me to do extra reading and expect that to mean anything when all of that extra reading is just professionals and economists flat out saying these tariffs are a horrific idea, and frankly, the most rudimentary understanding of tariffs and supply/demand is all you need to understand how awful this is going to be.

Issue 1 is cost of essential goods; issue 2 is American labor and manufacturing. It is possible to separate the two, despite what Reddit tells you. Issue 2, the use of tariffs addresses the problem of using cheap overseas labor, which handicaps American manufacturing and American employment. An American who is earning a livable wage with health benefits cannot compete against a CCP slave laborer earning $3/day. That playing field must be leveled through tariffs. Notice I said CCP. I'm not blaming the Chinese people, who are victims themselves of the CCP. Walmart pays a base salary to Chinese laborers of 15 yuan per day, which is about $2/day. Walmart, a hypocritical trash company, needs to get whacked with tariffs so they stop that shit and come home and hire Americans and pay American wages. Yes. We are aware the consumer pays the tariffs. That's the whole point. We are forcibly removing the financial advantage of using cheap labor so that foreign made goods cost the same as domestically made goods. As for necessary and essential goods, such as food stuff, it's not an all or none type of thing where everything foreign gets hit with tariffs. No country can afford to have their food supply fucked with, so necessary food supply generally is left out of trade wars. Because every country needs to feed their citizens, necessities like eggs and milk generally do not get blasted with tariffs. Those items have symmetrical needs, meaning ing every county needs them. If we are talking nonessentials like caviar, then yea, consumers of caviar are gonna be pissed. Those items have asymmetrical needs, where one country might want it more than another. Those will be subject to levy. If Apple is forced to contract solely with American companies and use American workers because of tariffs, your iPhone cost will probably go up. But like it or not, an iPhone is considered a luxury item. It is not an essential. It's highly disingenuous to claim that because a semiconductor chip is going to get hit with tariffs, that eggs and milk will get hit with the same tariffs. Finally, tariffs also force the other party to come to the table and negotiate. That's the most important part of tariffs. Do some reading about this issue outside of Reddit. If there's one thing this last election cycle has taught us about Reddit, it's more of a propaganda machine than any type of reliable information source.","title":"Trump's new trade war with China is coming"},{"text":"Schrodingers Immigrant:  simultaneously bleeding government programs dry, stealing American jobs, committing all the crimes without being caught.This xenophobia is ludicrous but predictable given gops voter base","title":"Reminder to Republicans, Trump is a billionaire landlord who owns a skyscraper in Manhattan.

They're on the Same Team and We Need to be PreparedUnfortunately, i think the Capitalist Oligarchs have seriously f%#ed up and the hammer is coming down.?The insane amount of Quantitative Easing (money printing) that the Feds permitted between 2008-2024 has taken our situation over the tipping point. We have no way at this point in time to pay our bills without QE - we have no industry, no manufacturing, no supply lines, no trained laborers. All we have are weapons, consumers of cheap crap, and pyramid scheme market bubbles. We live way beyond our means, and now we're barely able to pay the interest payments on our debt, let alone pay down one cent of our principal.?Both Trump and Biden know all about it. Since 2008, QE is how we have kept our economy above water - during both of their presidencies. We are in a really, really bad situation as the market has literally crashed three times so far, but we've learned how to smooth it over with printed money bandaids - but every time we print money we drive down the value of our dollar. It's practically like they left the hose on at full pressure for the last 15 years. No wonder the market has been so strangely robust!Our pyramid scheme economy with its artificially inflated stocks and bonds clearly needed a massive overhaul in order to be fixed after the near total collapse in 08 revealed, but nobody wanted to spend the money on fixing it - not even the billionaires. This would require rewinding Reagan's market deregulation grift, agreeing to give all the money they had stolen back to the government so they could resume the New Deal. Nope, instead they wanted to funnel the money into their coffers and invest it in risky get-rich-quick schemes like the colonization of Mars and AIG.?I can see how both parties play into the political theater and are clearly on the same page - meaning they have the same Kingpins. The Dems take the hit for opening the borders, and yet, this gives MAGA the justification to conduct round ups. Reagan deregulated the markets, but then Clinton signs NAFTA into law. Both the Neocons and Neolibs went along with it all -? breaking down the unions, taking the jobs over seas, and robbing the middle class of 40 trillion dollars. Now you can find that money in the asset management packages of Blackstone and Blackrock. Wait a minute, what is the difference between a blackrock and a blackstone? oh yeah, NOTHING - except one funds the Right and one funds the Left.The Fed has been printing and feeding our economy since 2008 and all our markets -stocks, our housing, tech/AI, and crypto - are inflated. And where's the money?? Oh, got it, it's in the 'shadow bank' account. Phew...?the USA is the land of fantasy market mirages and bubbles. And Elon has quite a knack for blowing bubbles full of hot air. When Musk says that it's going to hurt, but then we'll see prosperity I don't think too many of us are going to make the prosperity cut.? ?Im actually very concerned that our whole economic savior was supposed to be the money we made on AIG and other high tech innovations - but Im getting the sense that those are still a long way off, if they ever do realize the kinds of financial windfalls and improvements that Elon has been claiming they will. Its feeling a lot like the deflation of Teslas stocks and Space Xs company town betrayal and abuse of Brownsville, Texas.

We obviously won't know if they would have won with another male candidate of course, but I have a feeling they would have faired a little better.Trump can't run again &amp; even if he tried to stay in power, he's likely not living that much longer after his term (if even then). He is old, tired, &amp; didn't release his health records for a reason.  His base comes out for him in droves, &amp; when you break it down he's been running for 3 straight elections.  And he's been in the political space for almost 10 years, which is keeping his base more attached to him.  Which is why they've been getting the turn out they have those years.  Once he's gone I'm not sure they will be as enthusiastic to get out there in those numbers again. Trump was able to speak to them at a very basic level they understood.  Other candidates on their side are mainly career politicians, &amp; Trump was not (which is another reason they liked him).  It would be very hard to find someone to match what they see in him.Also, since we now know many are only looking at how prices are at that exact time, if he screws over the economy as predicted, people will flip back.  Maybe not those that vote R no matter what, but those in the middle will likely switch.   Don't get me wrong, I think the Dems messaging does need to be revamped, but I don't think it will be impossible as long as they push economy, &amp; in easy terms, to the forefront next term .But maybe this is all just my copium talking.","title":"Why Does No One Understand the Real Reason Trump Won?"},{"text":"It would be a gigachad troll move to just arrest Trump for treason using his newfound dictatorial powers granted by the supreme court.
