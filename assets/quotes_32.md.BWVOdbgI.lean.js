But, whats extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.  With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism. We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.We will miss them both dearly, but take solace knowing they are reunited once again and will remain forever in our hearts.To the entire Carter family, we send our gratitude for sharing them with America and the world. To their staff C from the earliest days to the final ones C we have no doubt that you will continue to do the good works that carry on their legacy.And to all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning C the good life C study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility. He showed that we are great nation because we are a good people C decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.To honor a great American, I will be ordering an official state funeral to be held in Washington D.C. for James Earl Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States, 76th Governor of Georgia, Lieutenant of the United States Navy, graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and favorite son of Plains, Georgia, who gave his full life in service to God and country.","title":"Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Passing of Former President Jimmy Carter"},{"text":"The Democrats are the status quo party, they aren't going to embrace progressives without a complete rebellion.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Knocks Democrats For Being 'Really Stuck In Our Old Ways' - The Texas congresswoman said Americans are looking to see if Democrats are willing to \\"shake\\" things up within their party."},{"text":"The wenches alloweth thee doth t at which hour you're a stellar light.

First of all, medical professionals are almost all exempt from the 85k/year cap (there's some caveats based on the setting they work for, but it's a good rule of thumb).Second of all, to come *directly* on an H1b, your *first* job has to be the one to initially sponsor it. Since non-US physicians almost all have to repeat residency training if they want to practice in the US, that means you need to have a residency program sponsor your H1b - which very few residency programs do, because they have to pay all the various expenses associated with it. The alternative path is something called a J1 visa, which is technically not a visa with immigration intent - it's an exchange program that allows someone to get training in the US *then have to go back to their home country*. Of course, there's ways to waive that \\"go back home for a while\\" requirement, but they consist of a variety of different hoops that someone has to jump through before they can convert from a J1 to an H1 and file for a green card.

It's a valid question. They work on vaccines early because by the time you *know* it's a rare exception, it's too late. It takes literally months of research. They don't roll out millions of doses until they see something has actually transmitted to humans and is taking off in the population. It does cost a lot of money, but when a disease has a possible 50-60% mortality rate in humans, it's worth moving on it early. Anything past 25% in a highly communicable disease that makes people unable to carry out their duties for 10-14 days, and you'll quickly lose too many workers for businesses to function. That includes first responders and medical personnel because they're exposed first, then utility workers including water, power and sanitation, food production workers, transport workers... I'd rather they work on a vaccine as soon as possible. That's why for some types of diseases they start early and spend more.

But, whats extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.  With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism. We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.We will miss them both dearly, but take solace knowing they are reunited once again and will remain forever in our hearts.To the entire Carter family, we send our gratitude for sharing them with America and the world. To their staff C from the earliest days to the final ones C we have no doubt that you will continue to do the good works that carry on their legacy.And to all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning C the good life C study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility. He showed that we are great nation because we are a good people C decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.To honor a great American, I will be ordering an official state funeral to be held in Washington D.C. for James Earl Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States, 76th Governor of Georgia, Lieutenant of the United States Navy, graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and favorite son of Plains, Georgia, who gave his full life in service to God and country.","title":"Biden lauds former President Jimmy Carter's decency and character in remarks"},{"text":"So...

It was a bad look and I do believe it helped the Republicans portray Harris as an out of touch champion of the \\"elites\\".In 1969 the Democratic party did internal reforms through the McGovern-Fraser commission to decrease the power of party bosses in presidential primariesIn 1981 the party organized the Hunt Commission to reverse this trend by imposing new rules including the addition of Superdelegates (remember those guys).Since then the party has nominated Bill Clinton, then his former Vice President Al Gore, then John Kerry who was a powerful US senator that had been in office since the 1980's and in that time had been the chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. After Kerry was Obama who although a one-term senator had influential mentors in Illinois and had given a famous speech at the DNC that propelled him into the spotlight as a major contender. Obama was followed as party nominee by Clinton's wife Hillary who had been Obama's secretary of state (giving direct ties to both of the successful Democratic nominees since the hunt commission as well as to some of the unsuccessful ones).Hillary's time as nominee is where the Democrats really start to suffer from this. It was bad enough with the controversy about her defeating the populist Sanders with a lot of people directly pointing at the Superdelegates/the Debbie Wasserman Schulz scandal as a target to blame, but then the Republicans defeated her with an out of control populist who bullied a member of the Bush family on national television and said he was going to \\"drain the swamp\\"After Clinton 2 the Democratic party nominated Obama's VP Joe Biden who had been in Washington since the 1970's in another controversial win against Sanders that a lot of people claimed was rigged after almost the entire field of moderate/conservative candidates simultaneously dropped out and endorsed him.Biden then dropped out a couple months before what would've been his reelection and the nomination was awkwardly handed over to his own vice president without a primary, who then proceeded to go on stage with prominent establishment Republicans who had lost their influence after opposing the angry populist swamp draining guy.I'm not saying the claims against Harris were true and I definitely had more hope for a future under her leadership than I've felt since Obama left office, but the fact of the matter is that the Democratic party has an absolutely abominable track record when it comes to proving to voters that party leadership isn't a smoke filled echo chamber. People are picking up on that vibe and they don't like it, so the Democrats need to get better at addressing that.","title":"Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney"},{"text":"Well yeah, that goes without saying, and same with all of the other presidents in between.","title":"Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on the Passing of Former President Jimmy Carter"},{"text":"The democrat party is a party of failures and crybabies.","title":"Democrats are stuck in our old ways: Rep.

Have you experienced the past or only read the records of it?Pop culture was always targeted at youth and fronted by youth. The beatles were seen as childish when they stared. Now they aren't seen as childish, because those children who grew up with beatles have become adults.Because children finally are free to express themselves and be heard does not mean that things became childish. In the past there was the saying \\"children should be seen and not heard\\". We are now more aware of children and their worlds instead of suppressing them.And if you think collecting funkopops is childish, people in the past collected stuff like porcelain figurines, which were probably also been seen as childish by their parents who didn't collect those.What is childish constantly changes throughout generations. Things from your parents past was also seen as childish by their parents.Heck, many of the words we see as common and adult have started as a youth slang. Also, i work in a museum and have seen a lot of old photos of adults being silly with each other without a kid in sight.As for impulsiveness nowadays:\\n1. We are more aware now because everyone can express themselves in the \\"public square\\" with not much effort.2. This is what tends to get attention. People are nowadays fighting for attention.3. There were always people like that. If you haven't lived then and interacted privately with those people, then you might not have been aware of the childish behaviours. An example could be people throwing a tantrum when the first black kid went to a public school full of european descent children. Or look at how adults throw tantrums over pronouns.4. There are a lot of kids who had emotionally immature parents. Heck, i see a lot of older people behave in ways that nowadays are deemed as childish.Though we have debunked many things like cultural norms, authority as social constructs. So they became malleable instead of being solid and unchanging. This lack of stability does bring a crysis. What is honourable if the same thing is honourable in one place and dishonourable in another place? What is seriousness if the same thing is deemed as serious in one place and childish in another? Tldr. Stuff of new generation is always seen as childish and starts to be seen as adult when they became adults and have gained political power (notice, that there are barely middle aged politicians, many of them are 50+ years old (so 2 generations behind) and they are forming stuff with policies and laws). Socrates over 2 thousand years ago complained about children being no longer obedient and expressing themselves. What maybe changed is that the internet allowed more children to be heard and not be immediately dissmissed.","title":"CMV: Society and pop culture is becoming more and more childish"},{"text":"\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/1hpd0ma/luigi_and_counsel_rocmil_photoshop_2024/","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I think we just discovered actual election fraud, big enough that it had an impact on the outcome of the election.","title":"Another Democratic defection: Hillary Cassel becomes 2nd Florida lawmaker to flip parties"},{"text":"What about how she promised to have the most lethal military and to expand the border wall?","title":"Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney"},{"text":"Trump railed against H-1B's in 2016- he promised to cut them back and I really don't care to try and rehash all this.

The aggressive tone of debates is partly a reflection of a deeply divided political climate, driven as much by social media algorithms and partisan media as by any individual politician. Trumps no-filter style resonated with millions precisely because it rejected the perceived elitism and insincerity of traditional politics, which many Americans had grown disillusioned with. To blame Trump exclusively for the breakdown of families and friendships overlooks the personal responsibility of individuals in fostering respectful discourse and the role of opposition rhetoric in escalating tensions.Second, the claim of cultish behavior around Trump is hyperbolic and overlooks how political enthusiasm manifests across the spectrum. Obama had supporters crying at rallies, and Bernie Sanders inspired fervent devotion from his base. Trumps supporters express loyalty because they feel he represents their values and fights against what they see as institutional corruption and bias. Patriotism takes many forms, and the flags, tattoos, and displays are expressions of that passionnot blind worship. The accusation that Trump supporters would choose his flag over the American one is an unfounded stereotype meant to delegitimize their perspective.Your criticisms rely heavily on generalizations that ignore larger societal dynamics, overstate Trumps influence, and unfairly demonize his supporters while dismissing their legitimate grievances and values.","title":"What Can You Tell From My Ranking Of Republican Presidents?"},{"text":"The democrat party has continually shifted left for decades now. Obama was seen as a choice that was potentially too progressive for his time and he refused to campaign on a platform of legalizing gay marriage.

Thats not to say there arent issues with the Democratic Party, there are plenty, but acting like they are making an aggressive turn to the right is absurd and always sounds like a convenient excuse for leftists to stay home during elections.","title":"Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney"},{"text":"You should give the source as this was ripped right off from the YouTube channel, Quantum of Conscience, and the video he posted yesterday.

The 1960s had screaming Beatles fans destroying concert venues. The 1950s had teenagers starting dance crazes and moral panics about comic books. The 1920s had young people creating wild new fashion trends and dance moves that shocked older generations.What you're seeing isn't society becoming more childish - it's just more visible now. Back then, adults were just as impulsive and reactive. They started wars over bruised egos, fell for obvious propaganda, and made rash decisions based on emotions. The only difference was they wore suits while doing it.Look at politics throughout history - duels, fistfights in parliament, propaganda campaigns spreading obvious lies. None of that was \\"mature\\" or \\"honorable.\\" In the old days, the \\"public square\\" had little to no room for kids and teensThis isn't true at all. Young people have always shaped culture. Mozart wrote his first symphony at 8. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein at 18. Alexander the Great became king at 20.The real change isn't that society is more childish - it's that we've stopped pretending that being stoic and serious equals being mature. Showing emotions, being enthusiastic about fun things, and expressing yourself openly isn't childish - it's human.

You need to compare like to like, in this case citizen SWE to H1B SWE.The question is what is the decision making between giving a chance at the entry level to an H1B vs an American college grad, considering both probably have very limited work experience to distinguish between them.Anecdotally post-COVID graduates do seem to be weaker but the H1B system has existed for generations. Its a perfectly fine system when an industry is growing and you need more labor than the local supply can provide, but it becomes problematic when you have a situation like now, when the industry is laying off more than hiring and there are many qualified citizens who are unable to get the available jobs, in part because of the H1B system being used to hire in an industry with a labor surplus.Furthermore, assuming by FAANG you mean Amazon (since they have the biggest reputation of being the H1B shop of FAANG), they are a pretty good example of a company using the H1B system to extract as much labor as possible from their workforce, and not because the H1B hires are more qualified. My understanding is often direct hires from higher education to Amazon get a certain title but are paid at a lower rate than industry hires at the same level. Furthermore, Amazons corporate culture is famously terrible but it is propped up in large part by an H1B workforce that cant afford to quit. I have had conversations with H1Bs at Amazon who hate the culture, had to grind their asses off to recover from one or more PIPs, have accumulated enough savings to be able to pay for rent for multiple months, but cant leave because the tech industry is not hiring much and their livelihood in the states is dependent on their continued employment. While citizens can choose to quit this bad culture, or refuse an RTO mandate, H1Bs dont have that luxury. Because of that, companies like Amazon know H1Bs will accept fewer pay raises and will work harder because their options are limited. That does not match with the stated goal of H1B of providing valuable labor that is not being provided by the local workforce, but an abuse of the system in favor of the employer.","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"I sincerely hope Biden outlives Trump.","title":"Biden lauds former President Jimmy Carter's decency and character in remarks"},{"text":"Doesnt matter if the possibility exists","title":"Trump lashes out at extension of debt ceiling and points finger at Democrats and McCarthy over crisis"},{"text":"And you didn't notice that Trump was a dumbass?

Its an obsession that grown men spend all weekend memorizing stats so they can communicate to other men about. Meanwhile, these dudes cant even runs 40 without being g out of breath.  Somethings out of whack in my honest opinion.","title":"Theyre mocking us."},{"text":"There should be a law that says you can only switch after serving/ pre election cycle.

Additionally, spending on sports rose much faster than spending on academics; between 2005 and 2010, per-athlete spending increased by 51%, while per-student academic spending rose by only 23%. The commercialization of college sports has led to significant revenue generation through broadcasting rights, sponsorships, and merchandise sales.

Between January 2018 and January 2024, the median base pay for developers grew by 24 percent while pay growth for total U.S. workers grew 30 percent.Inflation in the same time period is 25.6% so yes Silicon Valley wages are falling meaningfully and overall US software engineer wages have been stagnant for 6 years. when I showed you that the wage an H-1B must be hired at is regulated to be the average wage. H-1B or not the employer must pay someone for that job role the same.More competition for a given opening lowers the compensation a company must offer there by decreasing wages compared to what they otherwise would have been. Additionally contracting companies get around this requirement by underpaying ALL their employees relative to the market.   It sounds like you want role based H-1Bs to not exist and that they must be the top X% for the entire company.No I want top X% for the entire industry. If that means H1Bs dominate fellow level engineering roles then so be it. Bring the absolute best to the US, not the average in each industry. The next time you talk to your H-1B coworkers you should tell them to go back where they came from because that's basically what you're telling me.Not granting new visas is not the same as kicking someone out. That said I do think H1B folks should be laid off before those with green cards or citizenship (with the same job title). The entire reason they were allowed to immigrate was that we couldnt find Americans to fill those roles. That reason no longer holds.","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"Or both!","title":"Yet Another Florida Democrat Lawmaker Switches Affiliation to Republican"},{"text":"Totally agree.

Given that H1B visas last for 3 years and even with renewal can only last for 6. The fact that the job market tightened a ton in 2022 and beyond for software engineers should already reflect heavily in h1b rejections for those roles. And yet software engineering and developer job titles still dominate the granted h1b visas even though there is no shortage of American software engineers.That's the thing. [The number of H-1B completions by USCIS has dropped over the last few years.](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/fy2023_annual_statistical_report.pdf#page=32)|Form Type|FY 2019|FY 2020|FY 2021|FY 2022|FY 2023|\\n|--|-|||-|-|\\n|H-1B|510,400|547,800|418,300|451,100|396,500|Also if a employee is already in a role we both know it's better to keep that employee in that position rather than having to retrain someone new. If an H-1B holder already is employed they're not going to fire them just to hire an American worker. Actually let me be clear, it's illegal to fire someone over their immigration status.And yet software engineering and developer job titles still dominate the granted h1b visas even though there is no shortage of American software engineers.  We can look up employment numbers by industry from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [Here's a graph for employed information workers](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm). Now this covers more than the tech sector we work in it is a decent proxy. We can see from the graph that employment is higher than it was pre-pandemic.If we want to look at raw numbers [BLS says that there's 3,242,900](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm) people employed in the information sector. H-1B's would make up just 12.2% of the sector.The very existence of the hundreds of thousands of H1B visa holders (and green card holders who started on H1B visas) dramatically reduces the competition between companies for software engineers. This drives down wages.[Software engineer salaries have only gone up over time](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary). If you want to argue that they should go up more over time then argue that but software developers are one of the highest paid professions in the US.You claim I dont know enough about the process yet have presented no information I didnt know.You initially said that \\"This also prevents the program being abused to hire people at lower wages than Americans will accept\\" when I showed you that the wage an H-1B must be hired at is regulated to be the average wage. H-1B or not the employer must pay someone for that job role the same.It sounds like you want role based H-1Bs to not exist and that they must be the top X% for the entire company. I can imagine that would backfire in your eyes because instead of having Americans work their way up to high level executive positions, if companies need to hire an H-1B they'd only be able to hire them for high level executive positions ensuring they get paid the top X% for the company.I regularly talk to h1b visa holders I work with.The next time you talk to your H-1B coworkers you should tell them to go back where they came from because that's basically what you're telling me.","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"As a Canadian, I had a moment of silence when I heard the news.

This also prevents the program being abused to hire people at lower wages than Americans will acceptH-1B employees must be paid the \\"prevailing wage\\" for the job they are hired for. [Here's the government page on it](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/62g-h1b-required-wage)The H-1B employer must pay its H-1B worker(s) at least the required wage which is the higher of the prevailing wage or the employers actual wage (in-house wage) for similarly employed workers.What is the prevailing wage?The prevailing wage is the wage rate set for the occupational classification in the geographical area of employment by:1. A union contract which contains a wage rate applicable to the occupation; or\\n2. For an occupation not covered by a union contract, the weighted average of wages paid to similarly employed workers (i.e., workers having substantially comparable jobs in the occupational classification) in the geographic area of employment.\\nThe bar for companies to claim they cant find American talent needs to be much higher and strongly enforced.For a very long time in high demand H-1B fields (basically tech companies) there weren't enough qualified American applicants to make up for the demand that companies had. This only changed once 2021 hit with waves of tech layoffs. Now hiring in the tech market is still tight which makes it difficult for any tech worker to get a new job.The salary in the job listing needs to be in the top 10% of the comparable jobs. Lots of companies claim they cant find someone when really theyre just paying too little. If this program is to bring the best then they should be paid at the top of the market.As stated before employers must pay the prevailing wage for the job. If you think employers must pay a premium for non-American talent that's a discussion to be had but in my opinion that would just hurt the job market by artificially limiting the number of people that can be employed.Additionally the company must show that they dont have unnecessary requirements. X years of professionally using X programming language is almost always not actually needed to perform the job.

No surprise, rent burdens are rare among high earners and virtually ubiquitous among those living below or near the poverty line.Given that renters make up about 44% of California, that's almost a quarter of people paying over a third of their income on shelter. Those people also of course have friends and family who might help them with rent payments thus impacting even more people.

People aren't going to min-max a studio apartment so they can invest the difference in the s&amp;p 500 to beat the average appreciation of a house. No one does this except some fire reddit lords.Most people are going to, at best, just slowly save cash maybe in some hya, probably just their current bank. And most people will just spend any money that would have been saved. And many will be saving for the house they desperately hope to have one day.Most people will still eventually have families, most people have family nearby. Just moving, to another rental that has no guarantees of being better nor stable, isn't attractive\\nHumans have a huge preference for stability, even in societies that are primary renting most aren't moving every other year to min-max. Like should my children have to move school, me have to endure a long commute and likely thousands of dollars of a poorly timed moved because my landlord sold his property to another? This happened to my sister in law, who is a single mom.Add on top is that we de facto punish renters. Home owning, especially the 30 year mortgage and tax incentives ontop, means in practical reality you will basically always be better off owning. Especially if you don't plan to move in the next 10 years, which, especially for families, is the vast majority of people. And if you get a low interest rate as millions did for a few years, it can be the key critical reason for your wealth your entire life \\nLike objectively, if you have the capital to buy a house, and the rates are reasonable - nearly all Americans would buy the home. The lack of capital is why they don't, not because a love of renting.What we do about this is varied. I think for yimby to work,.we have to make renting stop being an literal blackhole.

The old adage rings true: \\"Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line.\\" If leftists want to be catered to by the Democratic Party then they need to continually vote for Democrats no matter what. They can run candidates, make demands, and have debates throughout primaries. But after the point where the nominee is selected, they need to shill for the Democratic party at every possible opportunity. That is how you make yourself the Democratic base, this warm-cold shit sets them back to square one every 4 years. I'm sorry this offends those with delicate sensibilities but harm mitigation demands this.\\nI saw (and continue to see) a lot of smoke from Leftists for Biden, Harris, and the Democrats all through the election but none for the Republicans in Congress obstructing all progress. None ringing the alarm bells about losing the Supreme Court for over 40 years. And no smoke for Trump encouraging Netanyahu to obstruct progress on the Gaza conflict to hurt Democrats. To critique anyone but the Democrats was \\"cringe\\" and judging by the comment sections of most leftist subreddits, this remains true.\\nYou know who was championing the Democrats? The liberals, the neoliberals, the \\"resist libs\\", most progressives in Congress (viewed as traitors to the cause), and even the never-Trump Republicans.\\nLike I said, \\"I have plenty of criticisms for the Democratic party\\" and they deserve their fair share of blame. But to lay NO blame towards leftists for the loss of this election ensures they never learn any lessons for how to conduct themselves in a manner which centers harm mitigation in future elections.\\nYou want to know the winning strategy?

I believe people feel isolated and powerless so an opportunity to be part of something that they can actually affect could be a good attention draw since a new party would need new policies and that opens room for open discussion. But until this new party is a household name, it won't have any legitimacy to create change. As annoying as it may be, democracies function on mass opinions and those opinions depend on people's environment/awareness. If they've never heard of something, why would they want to join it. My recommendation: make it funny. I think the process of making a new party has to be entertaining and fun to overcome the inertia against it.

About 719,000 H2A visas were approved for short-term seasonal agriculture work. These exceeded totals from before and during the pandemic.

Mess with someone's refund, other than to increase it, and they get REALLY angry. They might still be upset if the refund is somewhat larger.I have mixed feelings about getting a tax refund.  Suppose that you usually get back $2000 for your tax refund. The mathematically correct answer is to adjust your withholding to come within some small amount of money that you can easily pay, like $50 or $100 sl that you receive the money as you earn it. I can see the sense in getting a refund if it's hard for you to save otherwise.  You're missing out on $45 or so in interest over the course of the year were you to put the money over the course of the year into a high-interest savings account, but knowing that the money will be there in March (say) is worth something. What I hate are the usurious fees that tax preparers charge for refund anticipation loans.

Easy. You apply your fucking common sense.

This is no secret. His [entire career]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D1j0FS0Z6ho&amp;pp=ygUIQmlkZW4gaXE%3D) really. His entire presidential campaign in 2020 was based on the premise that he was the only person who could defeat Trump. He decided to seek reelection regardless of the fact he was clearly experiencing rapid cognitive decline and his team had assured everyone he wouldnt in 2020. Pelosi outmaneuvered him, constantly leaking information to the press and keeping his cognitive decline in the headlines long after the debate, until he was forced to drop out. His replacement ran against Trump and lost.Now when you see an article about his regret of dropping out that is anonymously sourced you can apply all of those facts you already have on hand and determine for yourself how likely it is.

Unfortunately thats not how companies have been using H1B visas and we apparently lack proper enforcement mechanisms to ensure the program is actually being used as intended.We need to majorly reform the program before expanding it. A few changes that might make sense:* It should not be a lottery to decide who gets to come. Instead we rank by salary the most valuable are allowed in. This also prevents the program being abused to hire people at lower wages than Americans will accept* The bar for companies to claim they cant find American talent needs to be much higher and strongly enforced. \\n    * The salary in the job listing needs to be in the top 10% of the comparable jobs. Lots of companies claim they cant find someone when really theyre just paying too little. If this program is to bring the best then they should be paid at the top of the market.\\n    * Additionally the company must show that they dont have unnecessary requirements. X years of professionally using X programming language is almost always not actually needed to perform the job. Test for competence, not years. \\n    * Also if the job can be done remotely mandating 5 days a week in office would disqualify your h1b application. ??* There should be a yearly fee companies must pay to maintain the visa.

I calls it like I sees it there's no deception. A corporate backed democrat (but muh huge public donations!) who had meh policy and got utterly fucking trounced by a right wing populist? Populism was the name of the game this election, and dems went with tried and true 90's liberalism which was already shown to fail horribly in this current political climate with Hillary and we had 8 years to reflect on. I don't know how you can say with a straight face that she wasn't Hillary 2.0. She literally had people from Hillary's staff on her platform along with a bunch of old guard republicans who got kicked out of maga as if we're still supposed to be reaching across the aisle in *fucking 2024*. Like lmao what year is this, not 2008 I can tell you that. The only functional difference I can think of was hillary was cocky as hell and straight up barely campaigned while harris at least went out and spread her message since she had a fire under her ass with no time left, which btw was also biden's and the establishment dems fault, don't forget that.What did harris support that made her stand out? What made her appeal to progressives, or hell just average people who are clearly upset (justified or otherwise) with their economic and living situations? Some stupid tax credits? A shrugging approach to social issues? Supporting anti immigration that the other side also supported? The only moving goalpost I saw this election was gaza, which in the interest of not getting into yet-another-isreal-reddit-argument, I'll concede leftists were dumb about and should have stfu and got in line on as awful as it is to say (I did, I only care about domestic at this point given our garbage bipartisan foreign policy history and the whole fascism thing). ETA: okay, groceries, I guess. Both sides did the groceries schtick. BidenYeah I knew you'd play the biden card. I'll acknowledge biden and his cabinet has surprisingly been progressive, and the biggest takeaway is progressive movements without good optics are **worthless**. Biden despite being pro union and trying to cancel student debt is utterly incapable of messaging and let media walk all over him. I barely even hear people talk about that stuff. He's old as fuck, has the charisma of a sponge, and is basically an inverse obama: progressive policy while appearing like a moderate. So despite doing good he gets villianized by the right (I've unironically heard him called a satanist pedo by randos irl like wtf), and left wing people feel like he's not progressive because the good being done is watered down on the public stage. The result is some of the lowest approval ratings in history. Like it or not politics is not a black box where a politician beeps and boops and a little receipt gets printed out with some policy decisions. I know for me personally even knowing biden is relatively progressive I still get icked out by him and I would NOT vote him a second time. IMO he only won the first time because of the pandemic and not because he had a winning strategy. A ham sandwich would have won in 2020 for being not-Trump.Do you want to know why FDR was considered one of the most popular presidents of all time? It's because on top of helping people he slapped stickers on literally everything that said \\"I made this\\". Doing progressive policy in the background while theoretically is what government SHOULD be about, does not and has never worked. That's the unfortunate reality we live in. Like I said, \\"good is the enemy of perfect\\".Cool, I still voted blue even despite all that shit. I've read countless stories on here of people who have become completely disenfranchised with the democrat party this election despite voting blue their entire lives. I was disenfranchised my whole life and I voted this election because I don't want nazis running the show, not like I had a choice. What strategy do you think will win? Like I said, populism was the name of the game this election. The best counter to right wing populism is left wing populism.

Then again the outrage over well off people deducting high rent buildings, so maybe it could be capped at something modest. Of course this would in reality probably make the issue worse because you're subsidizing demand and doing nothing about supply.","title":"The Renters Republic: Why vote to save democracy if they can't save the roof over your head?"},{"text":"Theres plenty of evidence that the reason for the h1b Indian skew is related to discrimination at this point. https://insider.govtech.com/california/news/jury-finds-discrimination-in-h-1b-visa-tech-worker-case\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-cognizant-h1b-visas-discriminates-us-workers/?embedded-checkout=true\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-it-prefers-foreign-workers-over-us-citizens-2024-06-27/\\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/fired-americans-say-indian-firm-gave-their-jobs-to-h-1b-visa-holders-6da7cf26","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"The question then becomes: is anti-immigrant sentiment just a response to the scarcity caused by environmentalist/elitist NIMBYism and the negative unintended consequences of a bleeding heart approach to law enforcement that destroys public goods for anyone too poor to afford a NIMBY area or gated community?

CADems don't push back against the either the national party or the big names of the state like Pelosi, Newsom, etc. At the risk of sounding like a succ, the party is instead acting as a rubber stamp for the status quo, continuing a trend of inaction because both the organization and electeds know there's no consequence for it.- On the party side; the [State Central Committee](https://cadem.org/leaders/) know that the same bunch of people are going to stay in leadership until they either retire or move into a more prominent position. Similarly, the [County Central Committees](https://www.sacdems.org/our-central-committee/) are chaired by similar groups of people, who then mentor their own incoming freshmen in a similar manner, effectively keeping the seniority system going.- On the elected official side; there's no challenge to the incumbents, really. This takes place across all levels of government. Statewide Democrats continue to comfortably win re-election until they step aside for their chosen successor, or are challenged by one of their fellows. On the local level, where the chosen successors typically get their start, most races are [uncontested](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/election-uncontested-races.html), so these people are able to continue to fail upwards throughout their career.As other commenters have said, the issue of non-voting is also a factor, leading most electeds/executives to pal around with (again, not to sound like a succ) Big Business, because the \\"youth vote\\" who supposedly can totally change the outcome of a primary election, just don't, creating a cycle of inaction.Meanwhile, contrast that to Minnesota's DFL party, who managed to enact [every item on their agenda](https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-legislature-\\ntaxes-marijuana-abortion-education-climate-guns-dfd84ed5958bfd37dee6cec1127a789f) in 2023 with much slimmer margins.","title":"The Renters Republic: Why vote to save democracy if they can't save the roof over your head?"},{"text":"K well all make sure to consult you the next time we make memes so that theyre up to your standards","title":"Democrats taunt Trump with President Musk moniker"},{"text":"This ironically would've been more of a concern post-2016 (and it kind of was), given states like New York and Washington of all places didn't have blue trifectas.If people are still going on about this, then we should continue squeezing out pessimistic spaces and growing spaces like this one to prevent people from over-spiraling.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 29, 2024"},{"text":"Not the person you're responding to, and not convinced Bernie would have won (although he could have), but I don't know if winning the primary is the best way to determine who will perform best in the general - other than obviously being necessary to get the nomination.The primary relies heavily on which way the engaged base is leaning and favors states like New Hampshire and South Carolina because they vote early, and those states are meaningless in the general election.

This creates an obvious bias because there is no force pushing elected representatives to serve people who do not currently live in an area but would like to at some point.When we vote in our own local elections, NIMBYism is often a rational strategy. It may be selfish, but if there's one thing a study of economics teaches us, it is that revealed preferences are easily understood in terms of self-interest, and stated preferences mostly serve a cultural function of virtue signaling and are otherwise irrelevant.

Just another guy who is commenting on things that he knows nothing about.It seems like most people THINK that H1B visas are for top 1% global talent, and those of us in the tech industry know this is not the case. Some people even think H1B visa is about labor shortages. I know, I know, stop laughing. You could fix the H1B visa system with 3 changes if they wanted to:1) minimum salary should be 1.5X or something of the average for the position they are applying for. This would mean that only above average candidates would be hired. There has to be a high minimum salary set that removes the way that H1B holders are used to undercut the native workforce. The H1B visa must be about high quality employees, not cost cutting. In reality, not just bullshit on paper with enforcement completely ignored for 30+ years. If you really want to increase the quality of the US engineering workforce, and not just add millions of more warm bodies, this is non-negotiable. \\n2) H1B visa holders should be free to change jobs without having to reapply for a visa. They need to be on the same playing field as any other worker, not indentured servants. This is really critical.  More so than low salaries, large companies love this provision because the H1B employee cant get a better job until they get a green card. Lower turnover of H1B visa holders is a tremendous asset to the corporation, ESPECIALLY when the job market is hot and people are changing jobs for big pay increases. \\n3) H1B visa holders need to have college/grad school degree in the US. This would greatly help with the cultural assimilation issues. Big tech projects, more so than most fields, require cohesive teamwork, which is all driven by culture. I highly doubt any of these changes would ever be implemented, as the fundamental role that H1Bs serve is that of cost cutting,  increase labor availability, and reduce labor mobility. This visa has nothing to do with quality of the work force. In fact, it is obviously the inverse of that.","title":"Scott Adams joins in on the Elon Musk/Vivek Ramaswarmy meltdown"},{"text":"Ill go ahead and get people up to speed:Republicans love, love, LOVE trans people.

I obviously cannot go through this entire thing, it would be giving summaries of years worth of education but a large amount of this is misunderstandings, pop sci explanations and clearly lack of actual education, as evidenced by only using the very simplest maths you could understand.

You sound like quantum mechanics interests you, start with understanding the Schr?dinger equation, how to apply it, solve it for different systems etc before starting to look into Quantum field theory, this is plagued by inaccuracies when spoken about by journalists because its simply not accessible to non specialists. The vacuum has a specific definition in quantum field theory that you never use or mention for example, involving creation and annihilation operators, again not very accessible though. 2 very quick and light examples to show what i mean that i can bump out fast. the very mention of virtual particles tells me you dont use textbooks for example, this is a pop sci phenomenon.

Another might be that you say the Schwarzschild radius is about gravitational collapse, its not, again pop sci physics.

You guys like to say \\"not our war don't get involved,\\" as a military vet I tend to want to agree, but my experience and human history, let me know you're wrong. We signed a treaty to basically make sure we can never again plug our ears to the worlds plight and let it build to a level for world wide intervention fighting with EVERYTHING THEY GOT to BARELY win. We decided we would never let that happen again, once some of us older folks died out, you damn young folk are all about letting the same thing happen again. But this time you support the ass holes starting the problem. You want to sit there and act like we should never have got involved, and you're absolutely positively insanely naive. We should have already been involved with the shit going on now, and CRUSHED the FUCK out of Russia IMMEDIATELY. instead we have shown as long as you cater to our president, you're allowed to attack people and nothing will happen. In fact we will sit there and fucking watch it, and it's quite possible Trump is going to actively encourage it and possibly end it in favor of Russia by giving up Ukraine to be taken in a land expansion attack the world, including Russia, signed a collective treaty, preventing wars from doing or being the sle purpose of said war. You want to talk history but you're ignoring the biggest facts of the story to dance on semantics. We should be more involved than we are to be frank. I say this as one of the men who would have been sent first in my younger years.","title":"US to send $1.25 billion in weapons to Ukraine, pushing to get aid out before Biden leaves office"},{"text":"Dunno but Democratic leadership is incredibly toxic.

Unfortunately, that's politically toxic. The next best policy would be to just make the screening process more stringent. Does it really make sense to randomly assign visas to 19% of applicants? Wouldn't it be better to take the best 38% and assign half of them visas? Sure the selection process is subjective but it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to better than totally random which is a low bar.Or if the government doesn't want to spent a cent more screening applicants - then how about having employers bid on visas? This is better than just going based off of salary because it essentially takes into account value above replacement. To give an example, which is better for the country - one replacement level middle aged manager with a salary of $250,000, or one exceptional young budding engineer with a salary of $220,000 who has more potential for growth? I say the second and I claim that the second is going to get higher bids by their employers.And perhaps this is wishful thinking, but I think reforming the system in this way might make people more opening to raising the caps in the future.","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"The DNC literally went out of their way to fuck Bernie over in 2016.

They are harms of directing one's anger at someone. This is crucial. When you are angry at someone, you end up either inflicting physical violence or else controlling the person through your anger, which is emotional abuse and which can be just as bad or worse than physical violence.  There is a way to process anger which involves fully owning the experience of anger. This is the anger that leads to healthy boundaries and clarity in how you move through the world. I'm not overly familiar with the research on venting anger which suggests that this just makes it grow. But my guess is that the participants did not fully own their anger, or they didn't release it fully. Or there was something about the way they vented it which only re-enforced their old pattern of suppression, perhaps because their anger wasn't \\"held\\" with unconditional love by whatever coaches or therapists were facilitating the venting, and so they actually felt more shame about their anger afterwards.In summary, anger is basically the emotional extension of your physical immune system and developing a healthy relationship with it is one of the best personal development levers that I know of. But it requires know-how to overcome all the conditioning which almost everyone has around anger. Because people are so conditioned, you may be correct that it is most frequently a harmful rather than beneficial driver of behavior. But since you say that you yourself have a problematic relationship with it, I wanted to point out that there is a vital benefit that's hidden underneath the glaring examples of harm.","title":"CMV: Anger is overly glorified and has limited utility in the modern world"},{"text":"It would help if national dems actually went on the offensive against the state and local politicans that are fucking this up so badly.

Pundits surmised that Trumps rise was a testament to the crash of the American middle class and the high debts and consequent frustration of millions of Americans. But in their book-length analysis of the 2016 election, the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck found that the biggest shifts in voting patterns were related to education, not income, and that those shifts primarily reflected attitudes about race and ethnicity, not economic anxiety. They concluded that the dividing line between Clinton and Trump voters was not the widespread belief that average Americans are being left behind economically. The real key was how people explained economic outcomes in the first placeand especially whether they believed that hard-working white Americans were losing ground to less deserving minorities. A separate analysis by the political scientist Diana Mutz likewise showed that perceived loss of status, not tangible economic deprivation, explained the 2016 presidential vote. Even so-called deaths of despairsuch as suicides and deaths caused by addiction and overdosein economically devastated white working-class communities seem not to have had the populist resonance that many pundits imagined. Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck found that whites who voted for Clinton were more likely than those who voted for Trump to report knowing someone who had abused alcohol or been addicted to painkillers.from a recent piece by Larry Bartels","title":"The Renters Republic: Why vote to save democracy if they can't save the roof over your head?"},{"text":"Yeah true.

Read the manga. Everything involving the demon, Macht is an exploration of the ideas you bring up. To avoid spoilers, thats all Ill give you, a name.Every demon choses to perfect a single spell over their long lives, often creating spells so good that humans and elves are unable to alter or improve them without intense study.If you read along, this is actually a bad thing since the specialization and longevity of demons can result in spells that are, at their time, insurmountable. Yes, Zoltraak was eventually usurped but during its time, it was NEVER beaten, but there are other curses which are not solved that can actually doom humanity due to the nature of how esoteric and specialized the demons can get. The demons are also strong, capable of rivalling or surpassing the greatest of mages (including frieren) so its not trivial to simply let demons practice their craft unabated and uncontrolled. The nature of magic and counters means some demons will require very specific counters (the demonking being one such) even battle happy giga mages like Serie admit they could not defeat the demon king. It took a perfect storm or even something more by the heroes party.Every demon is confirmed to be an absolute ticking time bomb. Letting them continue their magic training unabated will only spell doom, especially if its esoteric and weird enough to not be combatted and therefore exists as a curse. If you catch up to the current manga stage, we are talking high level concepts in terms of magic control. Imagine if demons could break apart the strong nuclear force that holds atoms together, or time magic or completely nullify human magic mana? There is no known limits to the magic system and that stuff is explored in the manga. Its pointless discussing this further if you are not up to date with the manga that does explore this and should be the basis of season 2. I can give an example using show material, we saw that plant with magic reflective surface use a sleeping curse in a large area. What if a demon developed a spell like that but its global and had bonus penetrative bonuses against the goddess protection against curses (and yes, we see that there are curses that can completely bypass goddess protection). Humanity, overnight, instantly becomes sleeping cattle to be harvested at will and allowed to breed in controlled limits at the demon's discretion as a farmable resoruce because you let a demon develop freely.The season 3 (conjecture, but based off rough arcs, current manga) stuff is even more advanced magic fuckery. Although admittedly it doesnt seem to be demon sourced, it does show that there doesnt seem to be boundaries to the possibility of magic. Giving demons free reign to practice is a recipe for complete disaster.Demons are known to be cunning, its part of your points you acknowledge that they can use long term planning. They will absolutely be using long term planning to break free and destroy humanity.Edit* This is a spoiler/non spoiler but we also dont know the precise mechanisms of demon reproduction/replication. This is just a further massive wrench in any attempts at using them as a controlled resource to extract research from.","title":"CMV: The demons in Frieren could be integrated into human society under certain circumstances"},{"text":"And Trump is hovering around +- atm.

No, in a world without such restrictive zoning we wouldn't even have to think about it so much. People would have homes and apartments aplenty, hotels and AirBNBS could exist to serve tourists without taking anything from locals and you could buy vacation homes without issue and the few people who might not be able to like the disabled could be funded with government programs that are less expensive and more able to create supply to match them.But 1. These policies are quite popular as solutions and it's better to win with a candidate who promotes better zoning and compromise than Trump 2.

People have gotten after [methane] because of the societal impetus and because of the regulatory pressures  and they now have the tools and the data.The steep fall in emissions in the basin  the centre of US oil and gas production, stretching across an area bigger than Britain  suggests a crackdown pursued by Biden is bearing fruit.Methane has a much higher warming potential than carbon dioxide in the short term, but its emissions  typically from leaky infrastructure or the venting of excess gas into the atmosphere  are seen as an easier problem to tackle.\\nMethane is the main component of natural gas, so producers also have an incentive to capture the fossil fuel to sell into the US market or to exporters. When burnt, methane turns into CO?, which also warms the atmosphere, but less quickly than methane.Biden has said that cutting emissions of the gas is one of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade to keep global warming in check, and he has pushed the oil industry to address the pollution.On his first day in office, Biden ordered the federal government to draw up new rules on leaks. Later that year he signed up the US to a pact committing it to cutting emissions of the gas by 30 per cent by 2030.?Rules recently finalised by the USs Environmental Protection Agency forced producers to find and plug leaks in existing infrastructure and tighten requirements on new facilities. A separate methane fee slaps polluters with a fine if they are found to exceed certain thresholds.?\\nBut measuring emissions of the gas has proved difficult. A recent study by the Environmental Defense Fund found the industry was pumping out four times the volume of methane estimated by the EPA.Test data suggests progress is being made. The 2023 reduction reported by S&amp;P and Insight M is equivalent to about 18.5mn tonnes of CO?  or the entire annual emissions of Croatia.?That progress could come under threat as Donald Trump takes office in January with a vow to roll back much of Bidens regulatory agenda. Green groups expect Bidens methane fee, which has been criticised by some in the oil industry and Republicans in Congress, to be unpicked.But analysts are hopeful that producers will have other incentives to uphold the progress, including new EU rules on the methane footprint of fossil fuel imports and investor-driven environmental targets.I dont think that the industry is going to go backwards from what theyve learned and put in place, said Kevin Birn, an analyst at S&amp;P. The pressures are not solely isolated or coming from the US government.The pressures are also international as well. Theyve made commitments to their shareholders, theyve set a plan in place, theyve allocated capital, he said. Theyre going after it, and I think that trend will be continued.","title":"Methane pollution at USs biggest oilfield plunges after Biden crackdown"},{"text":"From what I've gathered for EU citizens there's pretty much just two options: Either work for a few years for a US corp in the EU and try to get transferred to the US on an H-1B (good luck with that), or play the DV lottery (lol).","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"but any supply restrictive acts that benefit the existing renters is suddenly too much.

Finally, it argues that the obsession with competitiveness is not only wrong but dangerous, skewing domestic policies and threatening the international economic system. This last issue is, of course, the most consequential from the standpoint of public policy. Thinking in terms of competitiveness leads, directly and indirectly, to bad economic policies on a wide range of issues, domestic and foreign, whether it be in health care or trade.*","title":"Krugman's \\"Pop Internationalism\\": Essay 1"},{"text":"Biden didn't even run though","title":"US to send $1.25 billion in weapons to Ukraine, pushing to get aid out before Biden leaves office"},{"text":"Most companies aren't going to deal with the bureaucratic procedure and visa fees that are required to hire H-1Bs.It's a lotto system.","title":"High-skilled Immigration 101"},{"text":"No need to guess what'll happen next...","title":"Methane pollution at USs biggest oilfield plunges after Biden crackdown"},{"text":"Idk some of the ppl are awfully stupid and voting against their own interests feels like we have no chance with those idiots shooting themselves in the foot along with the rest of us..","title":"Sen.

Renter households are increasing at triple the rate of homeowners. They are disproportionately young and non-white: over half of Black and Latino households rent, as well as roughly two-thirds of Americans under the age of 35. The median renter household income is $47,000. Nationally, rents are up more than 23 percent since Biden took office, the sharpest four-year increase on record. More than half of renter householdsover 22 millionare rent-burdened, meaning they pay over 30 percent of their income toward rent and utilities, and one in five report severe rent burden, paying over 50 percent. These, too, are record numbers, and rates are even higher for Black, Latino, and young tenants, who are also most likely to live in substandard conditions, with absent or inadequate repairs, heat, hot water, or electricity.The despair goes deeper. Almost a quarter of renters report skipping meals to make their monthly rent payments. The expiration of pandemic-era tenant protections and rental assistance programswhich Biden and congressional Democrats did nothing to preventhas caused evictions to spike back to pre-Covid levels. Homelessness is at an all-time high. Wider economic discontent can also be connected to housing. An astonishing 75 percent of swing-state voters said housing costs were the most stressful economic issue for their families, and nearly two-thirds said housing unaffordability made them feel negatively about the economy. Rent remains the single largest factor keeping inflation high, accounting for half the overall increase in inflation as recently as September.Yes, the concerns about the economy seems largely focused as concerns about housing. Even people with homes are worried about losing them, and worried about their children not being able to find places. Likewise a lot of worry about crime is likely from increased homelessness, a symptom of the crisis.As a former member of Bidens National Economic Council tweeted following the election, I strongly support investments in additional housing supply. But you cant tell a room full of renters facing 25% rent hikes that our solution is more supply that will bring down rents a few years from now. What was our message to those renters?He's right though, \\"we will solve your issue in an indirect way that you don't understand very well despite rents having increased massively under us already\\" is just not a very convincing argument. After all as the article claims earlier, they're not feeling very good. The fault at play here is that efforts to counteract NIMBYs didn't happen earlier. State politicians too scared of pushback slow walked efforts to push through local roadblocks and the federal government is well, even if they had the authority to do much Congress is gridlocked. I think one thing that tends to do poorly is the animosity towards popular solutions presented. Even non-renters grasp the severity of the situation. One recent real estate industry survey found more than 80 percent of Americans support capping rents. Another poll showed 70 percent of swing state voters were more likely to vote for candidates who backed rent controls. This is something we really need to contend with. Rent control is terrible, but it's one of the most popular ideas among the general population and it's a hard sell to say that all sorts of zoning and blocking affordable housing and other supply restrictions by existing homeowners is allowed, but any supply restrictive acts that benefit the existing renters is suddenly too much. Rich suburban NIMBYs block supply, no big deal. Poor renters just concerned about their immediate finacial situation get told to think about the long term, and unsurprisingly they aren't very happy with it. The long term does not help that they're getting evicted *today* So what happens instead?Above all, what Trump delivered that Harris didnt was a complete narrative, one that at least acknowledged hardship and named villains, however unjustly. As usual, the blame fell on immigrants. Trump seized on a bizarre video of armed men knocking on an apartment door in Aurora, Colorado, who Trump claimed were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who had taken control of the housing complex. Local residents, police and elected officials all denied that gangs controlled the complex, whose squalid conditions were instead the fault of the management company, which was being sued by the city of Aurora for creating uninhabitable conditions, including roach infestations, crumbling walls, and uncollected trash. Undeterred, Trump vowed to launch what he called Operation Aurora, the largest mass deportation in American history, in the Denver suburb on day one of his Presidency.While in keeping with the Trumps constant attacks on immigrants, the episode was also an effort to capitalize on widespread tenant misery. He promoted another fraudulent account of Venezuelan gang members taking over a building in Chicago, and J. D. Vance later blamed rising housing costs in Springfield, Ohio on the Haitian immigrants whom he and Trump also baselessly accused of eating cats and dogs. Trump ran online ads with pictures of heavily tattooed Latino men, implied to be gang members, behind the text, Your new apartment managers if Kamalas re-elected. These attacks fed xenophobic bigotry, but they also opened a novel channel for the anger and despair that so many renters feel about their homes. Voters know someone must be to blame for decrepit and costly housing.This refusal to compromise openly with such extremely popular policy by the more moderate parts means instead of getting a plan to build three million houses and a continuation of things like the PRO housing grants (a grant plan to promote rezoning), we get Trump who wants to \\"protect the suburbs\\" and blames migrants.","title":"The Renters Republic: Why vote to save democracy if they can't save the roof over your head?"},{"text":"People really, truly do, love corruption.

The Mongol invasions are terrible if you're part of the Islamic world and East Asian world. They single handedly forced the Islamic world and China from the golden ages into the dark ages. Let me just focus on Song China. If you just learn history from snippets or youtube videos, you would be mistaken for thinking nothing ever changes in ancient China where dynasty rises, and then corruption, and then rebellion, and then falls again, over and over, with nothing changing. But every dynasty is extremely different in terms of culture, legal systems, technological advancements, financial systems, etc. The Song dynasty which was conquered by the Mongol Yuan empire, was in many ways a very forward thinking society. It had very strong legal systems, it had strong institutions, the emperor was not a dictator and his power was limited by institutions and the system, it had a proto version of the Magna Carta called the ancestor law. The Song emperor couldn't just execute a minister or an official if he felt like it. A judge couldn't just execute a commoner without going through proper processes. The Song people respected technologies and had create many world changing innovations such as paper money, watertight bulkheads in ships, moveable type printers, etc. People like to talk of ancient China as hating foreign trade. But that is not always true. The Song dynasty was an extremely mercantile empire and they did not restrict trade. After the mongols conquered the Song, everything went downhill. Not just in the Mongol Yuan dynasty but every subsequent dynasty. The mongol invasion destroyed all the political institutions in China and instead of legal frameworks governing life, daily life became more of \\"might is right\\" system. Institutions which took centuries and millenia to slowly establish got demolished and it allowed emperors to consolidate power in their hands and become dictators. The thing about institutions is that you can't just create an \\"institution\\" and expect people to follow it's rules. The hidden rules need to be sitting in the minds of people from centuries of collective memory buildup otherwise people just won't follow the \\"rules\\". That's why nation-building in the Middle east by the US is doomed to failure from the get-go unless they are willing to be there for centuries. The century long colonisation of China by the Mongols completely erased any such \\"rules\\" from the collective minds of the chinese people by the end of it and only \\"might is right\\" is left.Where the Song in centuries long rule had not executed a single minister and official even in the worst of political maneuverings, the subsequent Yuan, Ming and Qing emperors had people high and low executed left and right. Their status went from citizens to subjects. While power in the West was being distributed downwards to the people after the Mongol invasions in the 13th century, in China, it went the opposite direction. Ordinary people had less and less power. Tbf, this did not just affect China and the Middle East. The problem with Russian institutions and system also had roots from the golden horde.But of course, if you're someone from the West. The Mongol invasion has brought nothing but presents. It opened a eurasian highway where technologies from the Middle East and Asia are brought to Europe non-stop. That's why there is so much focus on information sharing as a benefit of the Mongol invasions from western perspective.

I think sometimes people lose sight of the realities of their country's politics because they live them every single day, and become hyperfocused on the details.Simply put, America's problems aren't really that different from Britain's problems, historically: you're a country on an island trying to relate to affairs that you are geographically isolated from. And I know that America isn't really on an island in the same way that Britain is, given that you do have Canada and Mexico there, but effectively those countries might as well be European to the extent that Americans interact with them.Isolated nations turn conservative. They become needlessly proud of their own idiosyncrasies. Ask any European what a conversation about politics with an American looks like: any suggestion is almost always met with \\"yes but we're America, we don't do it like that\\" or \\"we're not like you, if we wanted to be like you we wouldn't have left Europe.\\"Subconsciously, Americans do not view their country as just another country on a planet full of countries. Americans see America as The Country and everyone else is The Rest of the World. This is also an inherent byproduct of living in a superpower: you kind of become the main thing that matters. For many Americans, this is a point of pride, and understandably so. However, America is in this awkward balance where its superpower status both affords its citizens the ability to not care about anyone else, but is simultaneously determined by how America manifests itself as a power player on the international stage.The refusal to think there might be wisdom elsewhere has lead American politics to remain needlessly stuck on figuring out foundational questions. Are taxes theft? What is freedom of speech, or freedom in any capacity? Should we trust our government or treat them as hostile to regular people's interests? What is the role of religion in relation to the state? At some point in a nation's lifespan, the answers to these questions are supposed to be settled, but in American political philosophy, continued conversation about these issues is treated as elevated dialogue.America will escape the orbit of conservatism once it embraces the reality that it's just a place on planet Earth. Nothing more, nothing less. It needs to get away from its own founding mythology. But it's not easy. Britain struggles with it still. America will continue to struggle with it too.","title":"Democrats are stuck in our old ways: Rep. Crockett on AOC losing Oversight Cmte. job vote"},{"text":"I can't stand Dems.

Turkic migrations had already taken place but they weren't genocidal. The Khwarezmian empire (brutally destroyed by the Mongols) was a Turkic empire but ruled over a multicultural population. A large portion of who spoke Khwarezmian, an eastern Iranian language.Imo the cultural shifts were going to happen one way or another (and it wasn't the first time as the Huns had also influenced the region before as well as other nomads) but the sheer scale of the destruction to entire cities and ways of life the Mongols inflicted was unprecedented. Many cities were destroyed, Khwarezmian and other languages e.g. Sogdian, Kipchak Turkic, Khitan and many dialects as well,  became extinct or severely set back, many people died, even more moved and changed their culture.After which there was a tendency for kingdoms to be far more warlike and nomadic in warfare outlook. Which makes sense. Those were the ones to keep the Mongols at bay. But that just meant a continuation of cultural decline.But the subsequent push to war really did not help the region in terms of its development even if future empires tried promoting intellectual activities as the Timurids did in Samarkand and the Persians did in Isfahan.

Balanced contemporary sources are exceedingly rare, but the work of Rashid al-Din, a prominent Iranian scholar, paints a much tamer picture. In reality, though there was extreme, horrific violence, the Mongols did not raze every single city in their path and did not do so indiscriminately. Their strategy was pragmatic and they knew that a nomadic army could not be sustained in the long term without the ability to gather supplies and soldiers locally (which means a healthy local population was essential). Additionally, they fostered trade and created safe routes along the Silk Roads which enabled the transfer of scientific knowledge, technology, crafts, and art. Rice was brought to Iran from China by the Mongols. Astronomical and mathematical discoveries were brought to China from Iran along the same route. If anything, this accelerated the development of the Eurasian continent.When it comes to cultural erasure, I also believe you are overstating the impact of the Khanate. During the initial decades of the empire, the Khans would keep their ancient ways of life but allow subjects to continue practicing their own customs. In later years, the Mongols themselves merged into the local population and adopted the local way of life, effectively preserving the existing culture rather than erasing it. This is one of the reasons why the empire did not stand the test of time, and it's the primary rebuttal against your argument that the devastation inflicted by the Mongols is the worst ever seen. Spanish campaigns in South America, the colonization of North America and some pages of China's history are examples of a much more thorough process of erasing local culture without any attempt to assimilate into it.Finally, the elements that enabled Europe to experience the Renaissance and then the Industrial Revolution have nothing to do with the Mongols, and they are the main driver behind today's socioeconomic status in the region.I recommend \\"The Mongols: A Very Short Introduction\\" by M.

But you cant tell a room full of renters facing 25% rent hikes that our solution is more supply that will bring down rents a few years from now. What was our message to those renters?He's right though, \\"we will solve your issue in an indirect way that you don't understand very well despite rents having increased massively under us already\\" is just not a very convincing argument. After all as the article claims earlierAn astonishing 75 percent of swing-state voters said housing costs were the most stressful economic issue for their families, and nearly two-thirds said housing unaffordability made them feel negatively about the economy. Rent remains the single largest factor keeping inflation high, accounting for half the overall increase in inflation as recently as September.The fault at play here is that efforts to counteract NIMBYs didn't happen earlier. State politicians too scared of pushback slow walked efforts to push through local roadblocks and the federal government is well, even if they had the authority to do much Congress is gridlocked. I think one thing that tends to do poorly is the animosity towards popular solutions presented. Even non-renters grasp the severity of the situation. One recent real estate industry survey found more than 80 percent of Americans support capping rents. Another poll showed 70 percent of swing state voters were more likely to vote for candidates who backed rent controls. Rent control is terrible, but it's a hard sell to say that all sorts of zoning and blocking affordable housing and other supply restrictions by existing homeowners is allowed, but any supply restrictive acts that benefit the existing renters is suddenly too much. Rich suburban NIMBYs block supply, no big deal. Poor renters just concerned about their immediate finacial situation get told to think about the long term, and unsurprisingly they aren't very happy with it.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"She's not bad looking, but she looks like one of my coworkers.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I respect how this man is actually going to war for immigration.

At least, if you only ever read the English sources that were on the receiving end of their raids.On the other side of the coin, the Mongol Empire advocated the sciences, medicine, the arts, trade, and religious tolerance.
