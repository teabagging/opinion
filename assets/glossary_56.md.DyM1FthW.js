Not a Democrat, not a liberal, a genuine leftist.  My ideology is, in fact, *as far to the left as is possible to go*.I voted for Biden, and for Harris.  I had to hold my nose, but I did it.  It was much, much harder for me to vote for Harris.One of the main promises he made was to be a transitory, one-term president; to wipe clean the stain of Trump and help usher in the next generation of leadership.  This was overridden by arrogance and obstinate hubris as he sought reelection, *knowing* he was unfit.  He clung to this ruinous pride until the debate, when he could no longer hide his decline...and it was far too late for a primary, or indeed for anyone to mount a successful campain.We turned out for Biden, in droves.  One of his first acts as president, he broke the railway strike.  Nearing the end of his presidency, he refused to be in any way critical of Netanyahu.  So our first and last impressions of him were detestable.  Then Harris promised, in so many words, to be the same.But it's *our* fault she lost?She lost because she was a dogshit candidate, didn't have time to mount an offense even if she weren't, and foolishly catered to a demographic that wouldn't vote for her if Hell froze over.  But mostly she lost because Biden shot her in one foot even as she was stepping in crap with the other.And again, it bears repeating:  *I voted for her*.

The first was the handling of Biden's transition from being a one-term transition president to a second run while he was visibly in decline.  I think it would be hard to argue that the lack of transparency and inaction resulting in a late transition without a primary here were not a huge failing of the party and administration.  I think this was the most major failing I will list because it was self-inflicted and purely within the control of democrats.   The rest of the major failures on my list are harder problems where I think there was a mixture of not doing enough, not acting soon enough or perhaps the problems did not have good solutions.The second part that I think can be seen as a major failure is the failure to either do something to tame inflation or at least to be seen as doing something meaningful to try to alleviate the effects on the common family.  Inflation is complex.  One of the main knobs to control it is completely out of the executive branch's hands (interest rates) and a major part of it hinges on externalities such as wars and supply chains.  This quite hard for messaging, but the optics of actually doing something (anything) that would help the common American with high prices was completely absent.  You might bring up the passing of the inflation reduction act but the counterargument is that there was very little in that actually did anything to fight inflation, especially in the short term.  Eventually inflation did slow down, but it's of little help once the prices are already so high.I also think democrats failed on immigration and not in a \\"close the borders\\" sort of way.  When red states started transporting immigrants to blue states this was an opportunity to show the public a positive vision of immigration, of integrating hard-working folks eager for the american dream successfully into communities with labor shortages severely hit by the covid-19 pandemic.  Now this might have happened in isolated cases, but was the exception to the rule.  Instead you had lucrative contracts funneled to private companies where massive overspending took place with very little actually going to help migrant families who could have provided for themselves with expedited work permits.  Eventually this did start to happen in some states, but perhaps too little too late.Finally democrats failed in foreign policy in the middle east.  I get it, it was a lose-lose.  Perhaps there was no good option for the democrats here.  I personally feel that the path they ultimately chose felt like they were talking out of both sides of their mouth and left them open to defections from both sides.  Saying you feel for the plight Palestinians but having your harshest action against Israel be to deprive them of one particular flavor of bomb for a small amount of time feels like the lamest of lame gestures.  It is telling that even Reagan was able to tell Israel \\"enough\\" in a more effective way than Biden did.I write this as someone who voted for Biden and then for Harris, btw (because obviously the alternative was way worse).","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

The country elected a man who has been indicted four times, essentially wiping away any chance that he might face criminal accountability for his effort to hold on to power after losing reelection in 2020. The Supreme Court, in issuing its?[shocking immunity ruling this summer](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/trump-get-out-of-jail-free/678861/), seems newly on board with the idea that the chief executive can more or less do whatever he likes. What do legal restrictions and constitutional processes matter in the face of a politics that has lost any semblance of reason?A great deal, in fact. The country has come a long way from the starry-eyed early days of the Russia investigation, when Trumps opponents purchased votive candles printed with Special Counsel Robert Muellers face on them and dreamed of a criminal prosecution that might end Trumps presidency. Sure, the law is not a magic wand to save Americabut neither is it entirely useless. Acknowledging the threat that Trump poses to American democracy does not require accepting that he is unbound by law. On the contrary, taking the risk seriously requires taking seriously the legal and political mechanisms available to prevent the worst of Trumps intended abuses.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/BaWLWZB3](https://theatln.tc/BaWLWZB3)","title":"Yes, the Law Can Still Constrain Trump"},{"text":"Brother Americans have been trying to overthrow the government since after the revolution.

It's true, there's just hundreds of people in various positions that do things. But those members of a political party have the job to convince people to support them. Those on the left who stayed home becauseThe number of true leftists is too low to swing elections. The Democratic Party, for instance, which is considered a left leaning party, only has 12% of its coalition comprising of leftists. [**https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/**](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/) Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 45 of 50 states and DC. Generic Democratic Party members can expect huge margins in say, New York, where she got only 60%. She lost among a variety of groups. There's more Hispanic/Latinos that voted for Trump than leftists stayed home. By a huge margin. Turning out Latinos in large numbers is why Obama won in 2008 and 2012; in fact, it was so world breaking that it galvanized the GOP fundraising for project REDMAP and ALEC. But, this is a group that didn't turn out for Clinton in the same numbers, didn't turn out as much in 2020, and turned out for Trump in 2024. They're king makers. Florida going from purple to easily red is a death sentence for the Dems. What you're seeing nationally you're also seeing in some states - like California where the share of Latinos going red, or GOP doing better in rural parts of the state, is following the national trend. What will happen in 2028 is New York and California will lose electoral college votes and Florida will gain some. I think Texas too but I'm not as sure.Where you can place the most blame on the Dems as a party is they essentially have nationalized and focus too much on urban areas. They have no presence in rural areas of the country and all their money gets aimed at their national ticket - political science shows people vote more on valance issues than on policy issues. So all this hemming and hawing about particulars around policy issues doesn't matter if there's not a core vein of trust within the party of the person by association with the party.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

She should have stabbed Biden in the back on that issue, for the good of the country.

The inner circle of leadership around Biden was fully aware he was nowhere near where he was in 2020, and only after a legendarily bad debate performance was he finally pressured into stepping aside. But it was too late. The hit to credibility was done. Also it was so late in the process that a primary couldn't be done so Harris was nominated. It cannot be overstated how much Americans despised that move. Second, Harris completely failed to distance herself from Biden. The internal polling Dems had shown Biden losing by 400 electoral points. The dissatisfaction with the administration was palpable. However when Kamala was asked what she would do differently she had no answer. She fumbled the most basic and obvious question her campaign could get. People.did.not.want.Biden. Harris chose to run as Biden 2.0. There were literally states that elected a Democrat for governor and Trump for President.Third, \\"it's the economy stupid\\". Incumbent parties all over the world got ousted because of inflation. Americans were and are pissed that prices are much higher. No one cares that it is worse in other places. Democrats completely ignored this obvious issue and worse kept trying to explain it away. Trump may have spouted utter nonsense about how to fix the issue, but at least he acknowledged its existence.Fourth, \\"the Left\\" is not some huge electoral block that swings elections. Lefties are a relatively small chunk of the electorate. Most voters are not aware enough of politics to be described as leftists. If every self-described leftist that stayed home because of anti-Israel sentiment voted, it wouldn't have won Harris a single additional electoral vote. She got beaten by apathy in the middle. Most people who didn't vote did so because while they don't like Trump, they felt Kamala wasn't worth getting out of bed for. Largely for the reasons stated above. Trump was able to leverage his base to get enough people to the polls to win out over the people who couldn't be bothered.

Why should we vote for people who openly hate us and oppose our interests and then scapegoat us for their loss?Either the left is a big enough voting block to matter in which case the Democrats need to actually take qualitatively left positions (neoliberal tax credits and mandatory health insurance are not left demands, these are ways to try and meet demands partially but in ways that help business more than do the intended popular reform!) Or the left is not a solid enough block to matter in which case it can not possibly have cost the election.At any rate the left needs to divorce itself from the Democrats.

She was unable to articulate and give a solution on any issue that people care about. Take the border issue for example, which was Trumps number one attacking point. She was basically unable to mount a defense at all. The only talking point was the bipartisan border bill, and people were clearly unconvinced.She was unable to articulate why we need immigrants, why historic levels of immigrants were let in, why we should welcome them, why we couldnt let them in legally, and why they eventually decided to tighten it up a bit again. On the other hand Trump offered a solution - a solution you might not agree with but a solution nonetheless.So to put it very gently, maybe she can be a good president, but she wasnt able to convince people of that during her very short campaign.

Unemployment rates and the economy only go so far to convince people. Democrats generally win the Minds argument, but they almost never win the heart.The modern democratic party can't even understand what is meant by the idea of \\"Make America Great Again\\". To them, America is great. They got lots of money from lots of big businesses, and they have control in arguably the most powerful country in the world.The problem is there's millions of Americans who don't give a damn about unemployment rates or economic performance. There's millions of Americans who just want to feel more powerful. The people who vote for Trump wanted to stick it to the government. They simply don't care about the things we think they're supposed to care about.Democrats will continue to fail to inspire people as long as they fail to reach the hearts of people. As much as I hate to say it, Americans don't really want America to be the good guy. Health care? Take it or leave it. Policing the world? Ugh, what a drag. Technology and industry? What, like Japan?At every turn the Democratic party turns away from the firebrands of our time. They continually seek out the moderate - the middle-ground - the compromise. They reject the spirited protestor, they drown narratives in beaurocracy and they don't give anyone anything to believe in.People are, ultimately, idealists. Trump was basically \\"I'm going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it!\\"Can you imagine what it would be like if America had a leader that said something like \\"I'm going to tear down the Health Insurance Industry! I'm going to make them all pay for the Universal Healthcare! It's not going to cost you a cent! No more Insurance Costs full stop!\\"It doesn't matter if it's true, or even possible. Trump proved that. Americans don't want an accountant at the helm. They want an idealist. When Trump said he was going to grab them by the pussy the Democrats blushed.

Remember most people in the bottom 3 quintiles believe the economy sucks right now. Being the pro-status quo candidate in such an environment is not a good idea.

Your opinion about the previous administration, just cherry picks reality.?Inflation has significantly reduced purchasing power, with rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, and energy eroding real incomes. Although unemployment is low, median wages have not kept pace with inflation, leaving many struggling to maintain their standard of living. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation have made borrowing more expensive, increasing the cost of mortgages, credit card debt, and loans. The stock market, while recovering from pandemic lows, remains more volatile and uncertain than in 2019, creating insecurity for retirement savings and investments. Small businesses have also faced significant challenges due to higher operating costs, labor shortages, and decreased consumer spending, leaving the small business environment far less favorable than it was pre-pandemic. Furthermore, ballooning national debt and deficits raise concerns about long-term economic stability. While some of these issues are not solely attributable to Democratic policies, they underscore that the economy is not as stable or robust as it was in 2019, challenging the claim of a thriving recovery under Bidens leadership.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

(Note that the initial EOs often did not follow the APA either)Separation of Powers: Executive actions must comply with statutory and constitutional requirements, even when reversing a predecessor's policies. (even though by the logic the previous EOs would also be invalid)Judicial Oversight: Courts act as a check on administrative actions, ensuring adherence to procedural norms and substantive law. (often what I call selective oversight)\\n1. DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)    Case: Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration attempted to terminate DACA, an Obama-era program that deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\\n    Court Ruling: The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to rescind DACA was \\"arbitrary and capricious\\" under the APA because it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision. The Court did not rule on the legality of DACA itself but required a more thorough process for rescinding it.\\n    Citation: 591 U.S. ___ (2020).2. Clean Power Plan    Case: State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration sought to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), an Obama-era policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and replace it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.\\n    Court Ruling: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the ACE rule in American Lung Association v. EPA (2021), holding that the EPA had improperly limited its authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The repeal of the CPP was indirectly invalidated by this ruling.\\n    Citation: American Lung Association v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2021).3. Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule    Case: California v. Environmental Protection Agency\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration attempted to roll back the Obama-era WOTUS rule, which expanded federal jurisdiction over wetlands and waterways.\\n    Court Ruling: Multiple district courts blocked the Trump administration's repeal and replacement of the rule, citing failures to adequately consider scientific evidence and the impact on water quality, as required under the APA.\\n    Citation: Pasqua Yaqui Tribe v. EPA, No. CV-20-00266-TUC-RM (D. Ariz. 2021).4. Paris Climate Agreement Withdrawal    Key Issue: Although not directly subject to a court ruling, the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement faced legal scrutiny in state courts. Several states argued that federal policies undermining the agreement violated environmental laws. These challenges influenced subsequent federal policies but did not directly block the withdrawal.5. Asylum and Immigration Policies    Case: East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration issued executive actions limiting asylum eligibility for migrants entering the U.S. between official ports of entry, counteracting Obama-era immigration policies.\\n    Court Ruling: Courts blocked these policies, holding that they violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and were implemented without proper notice-and-comment procedures under the APA.\\n    Citation: East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 2018).6. Methane Emissions Standards    Case: California v. Bureau of Land Management\\n    Key Issue: The Trump administration sought to delay and repeal Obama-era regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas operations on federal lands.\\n    Court Ruling: Courts ruled that the administration violated the APA by failing to provide a sufficient rationale for delaying the implementation of the rule.\\n    Citation: California v.

Phone calls she supposedly made to her friends 35 years earlier (1987), but also one friend would never have to meet Trump in 1994-95 if she knew that Trump assaulted her in 1987? Even though she supposedly called her and told her this? There was also a friend, last name Martin, who I believe testified against Trump, that she emailed saying something along the lines of \\"it's our patriotic duty to scheme\\" as to which Martin replies to saying she has something special to show her. Carrol could not remember what that something special from 5 years prior was, however. 2. The Access Hollywood tape where trump says (paraphrasing) \\"If you're a star the ladies will let you do anything\\", which would be uncontroversial if it wasn't said by DJT. That tape was later used as \\"evidence of a pattern of behavior\\", which is fairly weak since it's about the only evidence of such pattern they have, a throw away quote from a behind the scenes interview. 3. The supposed dress of the day she was assaulted, which she had apparently kept in mint condition as some sort of trophy, she refused a request from the defendant to get the dress tested for the defendant's sperm (even though evidence like that could lead to a legitimate CRIMINAL conviction) because it was \\"bad faith\\". Even though her attorney, in the past, TRIED TO DO THE EXACT SAME FUCKING THING.4. Trump took a picture with Carroll once. O-okay? That means nothing.5. The claim itself. Supposedly, in Bergdorf Goodman (at the time a Neiman Marcus property), a luxury goods store, had a completely empty sales floor devoid of employees or customers or security cameras, that Donald Trump pretty much shoved her in a dressing room in the span of three minutes sexually assaulted her, that nobody saw either Donald Trump or E. Jean Carroll, and that she never reported this incident to anybody except a few people over the phone (that totally remember the phone calls except never seem to remember what they've done in the past 5 years).What? Are you shitting me? How is this even getting to court not to mention getting a civil conviction? If this was Bill Clinton as mentioned earlier, this case would've been thrown out like Juanita Broaddrick (which had far more evidence, for what it's worth). It's a joke.

Promising pardons was good red meat for the base, it helped to get him into power, but beyond that there is nothing they can really do for him.

This would not necessarily reduce people's tax burden over-all but it would give states more independence from the federal government. As it stands, grants from the federal govt act as a bribe to keep states from not complying with federal laws (such as gun bans or drug laws). Eliminating grant money takes the fed's ability to bribe states and allows them more autonomy. At that point the citizens of the states can work on lowering their own taxes at a more local level.Unfortunately this would probably require a federal constitutional amendment or two to keep subsequent administrations from undoing it.","title":"What are some realistic libertarian tax proposals?"},{"text":"Crying and ranting over the flag still at half mast at his inauguration.

I'd encourage you to read Reflections on the Revolution in France by Edmund Burke, which is widely considered the foundational text of Western conservatism. In it, he explains that conservatism isn't about resisting all change and creating a state of perpetual stasis. In many ways, the American revolution was a fundamentally conservative effort. It was based on principles and traditions that had been enumerated for centuries dating back to the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Right. On the contrary, the French Revolution devolved into chaos and ultimately the restoration of an absolute monarchy because it sought to randomly invent entirely new rights and methods of governance that were not moored in tradition.If your definition of liberalism is \\"we conserve things that are good and change things that are bad\\" and your view of conservatives is \\"we resist any and all change,\\" no shit there's no reason to have conservatives. Some of your examples are also somewhat flawed. The Great Depression was ended by US entry into World War II, not FDR's New Deal programs. In 1940, the unemployment rate was still nearly 15% after years of New Deal era government programs. I also don't see how \\"defeating the Nazis\\" was a primarily \\"liberal\\" position.

First, because the externalities are totally unpriced and that's unlikely to change in the immediate future.  Second, the pace of the energy transition means that most of these oil &amp; gas reserves will only be economical for a little while, and will soon become stranded assets.  [EV adoption will disrupt the oil markets](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/05/electric-vehicles-adoption-impact-oil-demand/#:~:text=The%20data%20presented%20indicates%20a,in%20the%20evolving%20energy%20landscape.) and we're already starting to see those impacts.  Even though Republicans are doing everything in their power to obstruct it, renewable energy has been steadily displacing coal, and gas will be next.  For the last several years, the vast majority of new electricity generation has been renewable ([example from last year's EIA report](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61424)). Stranded assets means that a lot of ongoing oil &amp; gas development is going to turn into expensive cleanup projects on the governments' dime when the energy transition leaves those projects financially moribund (and the companies fold or spin off the liabilities into shell companies). Also, frankly, if the USA gives any shits about climate change whatsoever (and evidence the median voter is an idiot and thus does not) then we need to be starting to ramp down fossil fuel production, not keep it high.","title":"Biden to ban offshore oil, gas drilling in vast areas ahead of Trump term"},{"text":"Point out that they're so pathetic the only way they can even come close to the appearance of success is to rig the game in their favor.

Among his policies, he saw to limiting working hours for women and children in factories, banning child labour in mines, offering free education to children of poor workers, and he was a champion of the Factories Act of 1847.Industrialisation and capitalism had led to changes in relation between employer and employee, leading to rising poverty forcing families to work their children, but he strove to counter these changes in society (i.e. a conservative), I hope most would say for the better. Some might say he did this out of his Christian convictions, but it remains true that he was a Tory with conservative values and nonetheless was on the right side of a major issue.We are too politically correct as a culture to acknowledge this. And yet this demonstrably destructive ideology is kept on life support.It offers no value to us. We pretend it does because we are afraid of offending and begets we think ideologies are owed respect regardless of results.The assumption hereperhaps one drawn from your lack of good answers to your questionseems to be that progress is necessarily good, that opposing it is necessarily bad, so that conservatism is a dinosaur for opposing it. I disagree.The role of conservatives may not be to implement social reforms (though they may propose bills to avert harmful trends). But they might still be needed to play devil's advocate when progressives propose well-meaning but perhaps misguided or half-baked bills, or when reactionaries propose bad ones. That is why we have an opposition government and shadow ministers.Democracy is built on mutual respect; that each party has something valuable to offer, and may be acting in the interests of the people, or some of them. Most societies, generally autocratic ones, that toss that aside in the interests of action for action's sake! also tend to make stupid mistakes with no one to pull the emergency cord on them.An extreme case would be Mao's Great Leap Forward. If enough opposition to his reforms had been voiced, conservative objections like Peng Dehuai's could not have been silenced and the disastrous proposal (which led to the deaths of perhaps 40 million people) might be altered, planned better, or cancelled.  \\nPerhaps in Nazi Germany, if conservatives had had more voice and reactionaries less, they might not have been so rash as to declare war on half of Europe. u/[genevievestrome](https://www.reddit.com/user/genevievestrome/) has provided excellent American examples.One can be a progressive or conservative and acknowledge that the other side has something to offer.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Its fucking tyranny by definition.","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"Yeah, glance at my comment history for all of 15 seconds and tell me I'm a Trump apologist, ffs.","title":"Trump Sees the U.S. as a Disaster.

Its hard for me to believe that a historical scholar truly has this take. NATO isnt expanding into the East. The East is expanding into NATO. These countries are literally BEGGING to join NATO because they are afraid of Russia. Poland literally blackmailed Clinton into pushing for them to join.Russias entire history, no exaggeration, is territorial expansion. The only time Russia isnt expanding and taking its neighbors land is when its either plotting its next land grab or its getting its ass kicked by a different empire who is pissed at Russia for taking its land in the past. Almost every time Russia has taken land, it has genocided the fuck out of the people. Go back 800 years. Russias expanding. Go back 1500 years. 300. NATO is a defensive alliance. This means the only reason you EVER have to fear NATO is if you intend to attack a NATO country. If Russia opposes Ukraine joining nato, the ONLY logical reason for that opposition is because Russia wants to be able to invade Ukraine. Its really that simple.These Eastern European countries arent in love with the west. But they are so afraid of Russian expansion that theyre begging to join NATO. Go to r/Latvia, r/Ukraine, r/Bolivia. Ask them if they fear Russian expansion. Go to r/finland or any country that used to be part of the Soviet Union if the people there have a fear of Russia one day knocking on their doors.Also, both of the recent wars in Chechnya had absolutely nothing to do with NATO expansion. And those were pretty recent.Its hard for people to accept that Putin is just basically a movie-esque bad guy who wants to take over the world. I think weve seen so many movies and tv shows and read so many books where that bad guy exists that it almost doesnt feel believable anymore because that fictional character seems unoriginal and lacking in writing creativity. But in real life, he exists. And his name is Vladimir Putin.These eastern EU nations feel they have two options to defend themselves against Putin. The first is joining NATO. The second is getting nukes. If we dont defend them, they all start getting nukes. If you understand nuclear warfare, you absolutely DO NOT want any more countries ever building nukes. The more countries that have nukes, the more likely we will see nuclear war one day. And putting nukes into the hands of small, impoverished developing nations that more vulnerable to corruption is especially dangerous.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"*Q: What are some realistic libertarian tax proposals?*:https://preview.redd.it/778hanetyebe1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622e614129e1f59020fd681c5e9c00862c1164bd","title":"What are some realistic libertarian tax proposals?"},{"text":"Lube up America, this is what you voted for (according to Trump).","title":"Trump Orders Congressional Republicans to Pass the Mother of All MAGA Bills"},{"text":"As a descendant of John Marshall, our first Supreme Court Justice, i feel my ancestor rolling in his grave watching this country turn into a circus.","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"[Here's a few good examples ](https://theoriesofthethirdkind.com/blogs/episodes/episode-185-gangstalking?_pos=1&amp;_sid=ae7b72fdb&amp;_ss=r)","title":"[CHAOS THREAD] Let's test Cunninghams Law..

Why not question why Kamala completely failed in the *original* primary before Biden picked her because by his own admission because he needed a non-white woman on the ticket? *This was the joke that so deeply offended the American people*. Her whole candidacy  was just a racist idea that minorities would vote for a colored person because they were to stupid to understand policy.  He picked an unlikable candidate who was completely unqualified in order to look \\"progressive\\". Despite the strong dislike for her she ran for president without allowing a primary. Maybe there is a reason Trump is in office again. The majority wants a strong candidate who people take seriously. Take your bitterness and hatred elsewhere and allow people who actually care about policy and not identity politics to govern for once. Hopefully Kamala has the decency to apologize to the incoming president for her stunts but don't expect much. Lets be honest she has always been completely out of her league. At least she will go to her grave knowing the majority of the population thought Donald Trump would be better for this country than she was. I am sure she can go back to sending people to jail for marijuana in California or whatever else it was she did as the prosecutor in California. She can't do any worse their than she did as VP overseeing immigration issues We can finally get this country on the right track and throw this administration in the trash bin of history where it belongs. This country was smart enough to dodge the bullet that was the Kamala campaign. Just so you remember, this is the *second* time the Democrats put up and unlikable and unliked candidate for president for no reason other than identity politics. They claim to be for the people but they are simply power hungry. They have no real ideas to offer so they appeal to the lowest common denominator. Voters continue to see through this fiction that Democrats actually care about them. There is a reason so many minorities chose to vote for Trump over Harris. The fact you lied to them and hid Biden's worsening senility until the debate probably didn't help. Lets be honest that party only cares about power and not what is best for the country. That is fine just don't expect to win elections that way. Biden is going to go down as own of the biggest political failures in history. This is his legacy. As an afterthought his being to much of a coward to stand up to Bibi while Bibi remains and office and Biden if forced out by voters is a bit ironic.  Maybe they can help each other wash the blood off their hands.Democrats destroyed themselves with their incompetence it was impossible to hide it from the American people. Why not take a look at your own actions and take some accountability for once. The craziest part is Bernie almost certainly could have beaten Trump in 2016 but the DNC knew they couldn't manipulate Sanders so the puppet Clinton was endorsed instead. Talk about a failed party. America chose to do better this election and fix the mistakes of 2020.

Among other things, depending on how big the gap is between the two events, it later quadruples the number of official options for anniversary gifts (traditional and modern), if that's of interest.I can also endorse getting married in a small ceremony at a nice restaurant just after the holidays have died down, as well as not mentioning to anyone, including the restaurant and the guests, that the event is a wedding (we said it was an engagement party). In the former case, things ended up being significantly cheaper because we were able to avoid saying the word 'wedding'. In the second case, we were able to entirely dodge anyone's and everyone's Very Firm Opinions, demands, and whines about how our wedding should look. We revealed the truth after everyone had eaten their appetizers, and we completed the ceremony before the entrees arrived.I should acknowledge the heroic efforts of my mother. She was, and is, a justice of the peace in the state where she raised me, so I had to ask her: 'Ok Mom, do you want to be the mother of the bride for once, or do you want to do the ceremony?' She chose the latter and did not hesitate, getting her official dispensation to be a justice of the peace in my state for one day. She also accepted the rigidly short script we chose for the vows without complaint.Being our officiant required her to keep her mouth shut from just after Thanksgiving to the day of.

Your view is thus that conservatives consistently choose the wrong side, but I am suggesting that perhaps at least part of the cause of the phenomenon is that you consistently label what you understand to be the wrong side as conservative. Your view would thus be correct, but at least sometimes only in a trivial way, if you identify the movements through history, and the contemporary politics through your life, that as conservative in a way that guided partially by your preferences rather than some kind of objective ideological criteria.The ADA, if I recall, was bipartisan. Not something conservatives came up with but ended up supporting nonetheless.The ADA was indeed substantially bipartisan. For example, the template for the legislation was based on the accomplishments of conservative democrats in Virginia, and there was indeed meaningful opposition from conservative Evangelicals concerned about the initial inclusion of Churches in the definition of public accommodations. It also passed with substantial majorities in both parties after it was clear that it was going to pass regardless and be considered landmark legislation for generations. However, the Chamber of Commerce which organized the opposition did so largely within the Democratic party as well as a strange bedfellows coalition that it built with unions, and it passed mostly due to the focus that the Bush administration place on it. I do recall with AIDS that the Reagan admin and conservatives at the time used it to attack the gay population but I'll read into it more.The actions and inaction of the Regan Administration were horrific, and animated by ideology that I agree is correctly identified as conservative. However, it is easy to forget how similarly homophobic both the left and liberals were at the time. This was absolutely not just conservative, [Regan's press secretary joked about the AIDS crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzDn7tE1lU) because essentially the whole country found it funny that gay men were dying. Compassion and humanity outside of the gay community was rare, and not actually that unevenly distributed. We mostly remember the hate as being conservative, because they were willing to say out loud what leftists and liberals were also thinking. Looking at real action at a Federal level however, both the [Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_White_CARE_Act) and its major modernization in 2006 were primarily conservative accomplishments.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"He knows its fine.

It had one major tradeoff, which was that emancipation took 25 years longer, though that does need to be weighed with the consequences. And that tradeoff needs to be contextualized - because sudden freedom for an illiterate agricultural worker who has spent their entire life on a plantation is meaningless, all that happened for most of them was just that they were sharecroppers... after a significant number literally starved to death due to the war.  -DesegregationSegregation only happened due to the progressive approach to emancipation.  -Women's SuffrageImmediately resulted in the Harding administration, the most corrupt administration in US history.  -Child Labor LawsMade illegal after child labor already went away  -UnionizationUnions are fucking evil, the Teamter's are just a legalized branch of the Italian mafia. -FDRs 4 terms -Defeating the Nazis - Pulling the US out of the Great Depression and emerging as a world power -UN and NATOFDR made the great depression worse, and committed atrocities like burning food while people starved.

Even as much of the rest of the developed world has spent the last three decades working to catch up to the standard set by this legislation that was championed by Bush Sr. in a deeply conservative way, and passed with more republican votes than Democratic. \\n* [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief) is the global health funding by the United States to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and help save the lives of those suffering from the disease, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It has done much more than directly save 25 million lives, but also made possible the contributions to society that those 25 million people have made over the last two decades. The $110 billion investment that Bush Jr. championed is one of the primary reasons why sub-Saharan Africa is rapidly developing into a 21st century where it will be the center of the new world our kids grow in, rather than regressing back into the chaos and deprivation of the 60s.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"So a civil war then?

It's a common refrain that what conservatism offers is conservation of the good systems we have as a balance for the change liberals push. But the reality, if you are objective and honest,  is that liberals do not push for change for change's sake. Liberals already do the work of conserving systems, they just don't do so reflexively and are open to change. Liberals for example can be seen today trying to conserve democracy, trying to conserve social security, trying to conserve abortion access. If the claim to success is just that conservatives don't change things (even this is demonstrably not true), then my point stands that. Liberals are the ones pushing society forward while conservatives can,  at best, only preserve the good liberals have given while at worst they oppose the good liberals have done historically and lag behind liberals in that regard. English common law is not preserved by the Constitution. English common law wad what we got away from and when we adopted the Constitution, that superceded any traditions in English common law that came before it. It's also dubious to suggest conservatism is what created English Common Law. Had we merely maintained what we had before, we would not have fought the revolution and established the Constitution. Indeed, at that time the conservatives were called the loyalists and supported the crown. Had the conservatives of that time period, as much as this is inconvenient to admit, had carried the day, the US would not exist. The Constitution would not exist. Perhaps liberalism as the global hegomon would not exist.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Because it is one big club, and you and I aint in it","title":"If everyone say Trump is on the lists, why is Joe Biden not releasing them before he leaves office and declassifying everything?"},{"text":"Where is she getting these nonsensical claims?

When conservatives win stuff just stays the same, which doesn't make it into the history books. Like, for example, the US Constitution was liberal for its time, but it was also in some senses quite conservative - the English common law system, for example, was completely preserved in the US constitution, with traditions going all the way back to Anglo-Saxon times. The framers could have created an entirely new legal system, but they didn't. If they had, and it was considered to be good, you would be listing it out as a major win for liberalism, but since they didn't, and the old system was conserved, we don't even think of this as being a major issue.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Are you sure US conservatism is a good representation of actual conservatism?

Im pointing out the hypocrisy, lies and plain ignorance to say that in the 2016, the election was on the up and up. No complaining, In 2016 when Trump won the election. It was the most fair election in U.S. history. Some people are saying its the most secure election ever. The people had spoken. The people wanted DJT. Trump won. However, magically in 2020, when Trump lost, there was wide spreading rumors that the Democrats cheated. But with all the investigations into the elections, no wrongdoing was found. Fast forward to 2025. Trump wins the presidential election. But now not a peep about election fraud from ANYONE. Especially Republicans. So, does cheating go on in American elections, during elections or not? Im just trying to understand. Were there no shenanigans in the elections this year or not? If so why not? Obviously cheating only occurs when Republicans lose the election. But when Democrats win the elections It obviously that cheating has absolutely occurred. You are obviously either being disingenuous, obtuse, or mentally slow on the up take. I think its despicable, that billionaires owned Media, MAGA, Republicans and others swore that the election was stolen. Trumps supporters logic is mind boggling illogical. Either there are problems with elections or there are not. And why would Democrats that know how to cheat on elections, decide they arent going to cheat no matter how much they didnt want Trump to win. That would be stupid. Especially if they got away with it before. And how stupid are Republicans that they cant prove then Democrats cheated (the pillow guy, the Kraken woman, grand full of shithat Doofus Rudy Giuiliani, Fox News, etc.) and others claiming that not only was the election stolen, but they stated that they had proof.

The problem is that the comparison isn't exactly fair. Sex work is not as ambiguous as what we'd call racist or homophobic. Most times we can agree on what bigotry is but there are a lot of comments that aren't actually bigoted that are taken to be that way because we have very different standards for what qualifies as bigotry.For instance if someone says \\"person of X race shouldn't operate heavy machinery because they have bad coordination\\" then yeah that's bad. But if someone says \\"I don't like to eat food from culture X because the tastes and textures are off-putting to me\\" is that really bigoted? It doesn't denigrate a particular group it simply states that the person in question has sensory issues with a particular type of food. I mean I have ride-or-dies who can't eat most dishes I prepare from my culture because of the way they are spiced and the textures (and yes, changing how it is spiced ruins the dish) but I wouldn't call them bigots.Still we both know there are people who would see this statement and go absolutely insane calling it racist and bigoted.That's why I think we should be more careful about cancelling people for the latter case. Because bigotry is more open to interpretation than sex work in my opinion, and therefore more likely to have people wrongfully accused.","title":"CMV: if you think its okay for someone to be fired from their job for past/current sex work, then it should also be okay to fire a person for past or current homophobic/racist remarks."},{"text":"Yeah but were they a citizen by birth??","title":"Biden says it is awful that Trump is seeking to do away with US birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Thats not an explanation.

Republicans were once war hawks who would have salivated at Ukraine. How did this change? Why would the Republicans become anti-interventionist? From my point of view, Europe and the left have reaped what it has sown, and that letting Ukraine bleed is the only way anyone will learn. This is not good for Ukraine but good for the US and the west as a whole.The USA is endlessly criticized for its military industrial complex and it's world police status. For years Republicans have been called monsters for intervening in the middle east and funding our war machine while remaining dead silent on Korea or Yugoslavia where we did a good thing. Conversely leftists have denounced our military industrial complex and want it untethered from our economy since it is war profiteering. It is those same people who denounced the republicans for defending the military industrial complex and interventionist polices begging for both those things. Sadly, they got what they wanted. Less intervention and a disdain to the military industrial complex. Then we have the issue of NATO members refusing to pay 2%. After the Soviets fell NATO members cut their militaries, and the right wing of America saw our allies dissolve their militaries essentially. The German military was so underfunded they had to spend a year shouting BANG to simulate gunfire. Even Obama said NATO should fund their militaries, and was met with silence. When Trump threatened to leave NATO, Europe still refused. Now we have Ukraine and they realize that the Americans had a point. Now before you say the American military gear is perfect and they are not needed, look at Ukraine. We sent them M1 Abrams tanks, but the Ukrainians can't use them. Our tech is too high end and requires years of training. Instead, the Ukrainians use German tanks since they are simpler and easier logistically. Sadly, Germans don't have many tanks. If Europe had done as the US requested, perhaps we would have less deaths in Ukraine. Perhaps if the people of Europe listened 10 years ago, they would have more tanks. Perhaps if they did as we asked, this war would have ended. We will never know.Then there are things like Nordstream 2. The people of Europe decided to rely on Russian gas. The US had explicitly warned them not to do that and to diversify, and we have videos of politicians laughing at the thought of Russia being an enemy. The right wing was called paranoid and that the era of war was over. There was an energy crisis in Europe as a result of this over reliance. Nobody in Europe is laughing.Only the right wing is laughing.Hypothetically, if the US were to step in, fund everything, and curbstomp Russia, then Europe has no incentive to be introspective. They would double down their past actions and buy more Russian gas, dissolve their militaries because they know the Americans will defend them, and in the same breath criticize the Americans for being world police. The people of Europe would not learn their lesson, and they would repeat it because they have not suffered for their actions. They would continue to grow closer to China and Russia knowing that the US will protect them when the money they send to enemies is used to shoot them. Conversely, if the US is consistently on the verge of just letting Europe go alone, they have to ask themselves hard questions. Are the Americans really worse than the Russians or Chinese? Should we cut funding to our military when the Ukraine conflict ends or should we maintain it knowing that the last time we cut funding, Americans were angry? When the Americans warn us of a critical strategic flaw, should we maybe at least think about strengthening our economy's resilience instead of saying the era of war has ended and laughing? The left will also be forced to ask questions.Should we really be trying to attack the right wing's militaristic culture if that same militaristic culture keeps the Russians back and disincentives war? Should we stop speaking ill of our military industrial complex if it can help Ukraine? With countries like Russia, is it really so bad the US intervenes in foreign conflicts on a regular basis?Ukraine might bleed if we leave, but having Europe and the left learn a lesson that the era of war never ended is an investment for future conflicts, since it would keep the left and Europe from trying to dissolve the military or the US military industrial complex.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Speed running a national bankruptcy under authoritarian rule will take a special person with a lot of experience in this field.","title":"Donald Trumps Steps Down the Well-Trod Path to Authoritarian Rule"},{"text":"No surprise....","title":"Trump Has Stuffed His Cabinet With Oligarchs Poised to Govern for Their Profit"},{"text":"Before I got banned from these subs (or the mods wisened up) I was feeding the Project2025 and Harris sub literal QAnon meme stuff and they ate it up, these people have no self-awareness.","title":"Kamala WILL destroy Trump tomorrow!"},{"text":"Once you drink the cool aid, its too late","title":"Do Americans not realize we're about to get royally screwed next year by Trump?

Second off, our income inequality has been on par with if not greater in some respects than that seen immediately before the Great Depression since 2010, and all of Trump/Musk's policy goals, plus just corporate greed at this juncture will involve a further draining of wealth to the top. Third, private/individual debt is at a record high of near $18 trillion, along with the COVID freezes to student loan repayments ending, putting further strain on a generation that was already crippled by those loans, some of whom are now entering middle age.On top of that, Trump already slashed the on-paper corporate tax rate to 20% (the effective rate is lower than that, like \\\\~12%), which was already nearing the rate seen right before the Depression, but he wants to lower it *even further* to just 15%, while implementing aggressive tariffs, which will only increase the cost of living further when that's essentially at crisis levels. 2018, which was in the middle of his first term, was also the first year since the New Deal, and WW2 that the 400 richest families officially *paid less in taxes than people on the bottom 50%*.Having low, and basically regressive taxes on the super wealthy/corporations, while continuing to drain wealth from the bottom 90% of people to the top, when they already have record high debt, and more than half don't have any real savings is like trying to squeeze blood out of a stone, and is just begging for the house of cards to collapse and one way or another, it will. It's also the same conditions we had under Hoover when it happened, and he tried to implement tariffs to fix things, but made things far worse.The question is: will a president who refuses to recognize any loss, that's also installing lackeys/yes-men across the board, plans on replacing tens of thousands of independent agency positions with loyalists, and will have a DOJ he's been given absolute immunity to weaponize, even allow democracy to work long enough to take him, his party and the oligarchy down when its clear the populace has had enough?","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"You're saying Trump is \\"just another presidency\\"I think we all know that is not true","title":"Donald Trumps Steps Down the Well-Trod Path to Authoritarian Rule"},{"text":"But I was told billionaires were too rich to be swayed by money?   \\n/s","title":"Jeff Bezos' media companies kiss Trump's ringagain"},{"text":"The little guy knows his time is coming, no more bribes, no more money laundering.

Those women deserved justice, but their part in this isn't relevant to the issue at hand. Trump did engage in blatant insurrectionist activities in 2016 and 2020. A republican served as special counsel for the 2016 matter and delivered an iron clad, evidence based report outlining how he attempted to subvert an election, when and with whom. In 2020, we saw how he attempted it on national television. He also made a personal phone call to the Georgia AG trying to talk him into fabricating votes that didn't exist. Those are exactly what the 14th amendment restrictions were designed to address.Those issues also need to be addressed in court. I have been saying this for months. Without deciding definitively one way or another on this matter, Trump's fitness for office must be an open question. It also sets a silent precedent that a sitting president or candidate for president can simply attempt to overthrow the government and, whether successful or not, then take up office at a later date insofar as he was not impeached and convicted by Congress for his crimes. That effectively means voting does not matter. It also means the peaceful transference of power does not matter. If those institutions cease to matter, so does the concept of democracy. At that point, we might as well collectively agree the constitution no longer represents what our government is or how it functions, because an autocrat can arise and take over government at his discretion insofar as no one seeks to oppose him, regardless of how many times or how blatantly he attempted to overthrow or subvert government in order to usher in his regime. That makes us no better nor any more stable than any of the autocratic states we've long held ourselves to a higher standard than the world over. Where I stand, we either litigate this and decide who we are as a nation, or we accept that the constitution is effectively toilet paper.","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"When he tanks the economy some of us might be able to afford housing!","title":"What is the number 1 thing that the trump presidency will positively effect your lives that you're looking forward to?"},{"text":"Well, duh.","title":"After backing Trump, low-income voters hope he doesnt slash their benefits | \\"Now, low-income Americans who voted for Trump say they are counting on him to keep their benefits intact even while his Cabinet picks and Republican lawmakers call on him to reduce federal spending.\\""},{"text":"Can you be more specific?","title":"What is the number 1 thing that the trump presidency will positively effect your lives that you're looking forward to?"},{"text":"How will anti-fascists respond?\\nLoudly I would hope.","title":"Far-left Antifa activists waiting to see Trump actions.

Ukraine was not aggressive, that was Russia. Russia has made a habit of inserting itself into, not just Ukraine, though that is obviously the dominating example, but the entire world, in some form or another, maliciously - from political intervention to outright sabotage. As a result of what amounts to a proxy war, it is the entitlement of the affected parties to, at the very least, intervene in some manner. Unfounded aggression needs to be met with equilateral response.Per the attitude of many Americans who claim to be patriots, we are - supposedly - \\"the greatest country in the world.\\" Think about your neighbors. Would you ever say that your neighbor who never comes outside, keeps to themselves, and doesn't do anything to hurt nor help is the greatest neighbor on the block? No. You wouldn't talk about them at all. And so as antagonistic an idea as American exceptionalism is to most rational people, the very people clamoring it are, themselves, the ones opposing Ukrainian aid. But why? Isn't the most American thing we can possibly do, being the best neighbor in the block? Helping and doing whatever we can to preserve the freedom and sovereignty of another nation against what is, to anyone paying attention, a common enemy, albeit one who has attacked both nations in vastly different ways?You can't have it both ways. People don't want us to be \\"world police\\" but in a world where we, by both our own hands as well as the cooperation of the world, have put ourselves in a position of serious world power, it's not only our responsibility but our prerogative. Our money, our seats of power, the position our ancestors have set us up with have given us, perhaps, undue influence over world affairs, but we, yet, have that influence. We not only should be helping to stabilize the world, but it should be treated as if it is our job to do so, and not because we are better or worse at it than anyone else, but because we have set ourselves up to do so. Our military and funding were set up to do this very thing, reasons notwithstanding. We have the numbers. We have the reach. We have things that most of the world simply does not. The only point of contention is what wars we \\"enter,\\" and why we enter them. Imperialism is not okay. Defense, particularly of another nation, is.There is no more important conflict on this planet right now, than the one being fought in Ukraine and Russia. That isn't to say that the other conflicts are not, themselves, important, particularly for those involved - but because of the nature and the parties, none stand to shape the world more, and faster, than the ones involving the largest countries, both in size and influence, period. And because of this importance, I say funnel Ukraine anything they need.If Russia is simply allowed to walk over them, at any point, it sets a stage that the world is not ready to face, particularly with the unbelievable rise of far-right powers in a significant portion of it.It is a very fundamental problem, yet one that is very fundamentally simple to answer, and almost shouldn't require a discussion.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"what? are you telling me that Elon Musk is a hypocrite, and doesn't just want what's best for everyone?I am shocked!

By giving Russia the opportunity to fight against NATO weapons at a pace that they are able to dictate, what is actually happening on the ground is that the US is creating a far more capable adversary. Their electronic and drone warfare has come along in leaps and bounds as well as their tactics against NATO doctrine. New weapons like the Oreshnik (I've seen people argue that the tech isn't really new, but the design is) represent Russia's ability to innovate and escalate and through so called military Keynesianism and their deepening relationships with China and India they have been able to weather the intense sanctions imposed on them by the West without too much difficulty. I don't think the average Russian is hurting very much... Ukraine is losing land at an increasing rate, and more importantly, they are losing more and more men. I don't believe any of the casualty numbers, I don't see how anyone can at this point given the propaganda value for both sides to claim low casualties sustained and high casualties inflicted, but they must acknowledge Russia had a massive manpower advantage from the start. The US has been pressuring Ukraine to start to draft 18-24 year olds, and I think that is probably a good indication that they are starting to really hurt there.Russia had the strategic advantage from the start, with the West only ever willing to go so far. European dependence on Russian energy has left them crippled economically and beset by considerable domestic political instability which is only growing, and the US faces similar problems at home. This was not an impulsive decision by Putin to invade, it was the result of sober analysis of the geopolitical landscape, the multi-polar world order is at our doorstep, and this conflict is only expediting it's arrival. So to ask you a question - continue funding to what end?","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"True, so many people failed us.

This is just not true and there's no evidence for that. Every recent war Russia has engaged in on its own borders has been reactionary. I- what? just... what? Putin is invading a country that has been independent since the fall of the USSR.Putin is president of the Russian Federation, a government which formed *after* the fall of the USSR and thus never once ruled Ukraine. Russia is NOT the USSR. Ukraine also existed before the USSR. so even if we were going by the insane notion that it's always okay to invade a country that's been independent if it used to belong to you- a notion which would mean most of us are supposed to be british citizens- Ukraine *never* belonged to Russia.  \\n Russia DOESN'T want this war. Putin reached out to NATO PRIOR to attacking Ukraine with a no-NATO treaty to avoid the war. NATO refused saying it has to be an open door policy. This shows Putin was more interested in not having Ukraine join NATO than acquiring Ukrainians territory.?if they didn't want the war, they wouldn't have invaded. you don't reluctantly invade a sovereign nation.  Ukrainian people are dying in droves and losing the war and their territory. Russian people are dying in droves and they are losing their economy and standard of life. Ukraine's not losing, and the Russian people aren't the Russian government.   Russia was always willing to negotiate but the US wanted the war.

The sites merchandise section redirects to WinRed, the Republican Partys main fundraising platform, offering 38 inauguration-themed items ranging from a $12 pair of buttons to a $70 fleece pullover. In smaller print at the bottom of the page and during checkout, the site discloses that proceeds from these sales go to the Trump National Committee, which allocates 20% to Never Surrender, a leadership PAC formed on Nov. 12 when Trumps 2024 campaign committee was renamed and restructured, and 80% to the Republican National Committeecompletely bypassing the nonprofit inaugural committee. While campaign contributions cannot legally be used to cover a candidates personal expenses, leadership PACs, like Never Surrender, are not bound by such restrictions. This gives Trump significant flexibility in how he uses the proceeds from merchandise commemorating his upcoming inauguration. For instance, another Trump leadership PAC, Save America, has spent $93 million on legal fees and shifted another $720,000 to Trumps businesses, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission. Its unusual for proceeds from inauguration merchandise to go to a leadership PAC, according to Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in campaign finance. The sales of inaugural memorabilia are usually used to pay for the inaugural events, Kappel says. As far as I know, this is the first time that the proceeds of such sales are being diverted to a presidential leadership PAC, where they are not subject to the prohibition on personal use. Without addressing why the funds are being directed to political groups instead of the inaugural nonprofit, a spokesperson for Trumps inaugural committee explained that they opted to use a pre-existing partner, WinRed, to sell merchandise due to the short time frame between the election and inauguration (a period thats been the same since the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933). There is no need to prop up an entire online store, while we are focused on planning a once-in-a-lifetime inauguration, the spokesperson told Forbes. In 2017, proceeds from the sole official piece of merchandise Trumps inaugural committee solda $50 commemorative license platewere directed to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, according to an archived snapshot of the events website on archive.org. Similarly, proceeds from official souvenir sales for both of Obamas inaugurations went toward paying for inaugural events, according to contemporaneous news accounts. Reports on Bidens 2021 inauguration store did not specify where the proceeds went, though the shop was hosted on his nonprofit inaugural committees site. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at Stetson Universitys law school and the author of the new book Corporatocracy: How to Protect Democracy from Dark Money and Corrupt Politicians, sees potential legal concerns with proceeds from inaugural merchandise flowing to Trumps PAC and the RNC. Is there a legal problem? Yes, if donors are being misled that they are giving to the inaugural when the money is going elsewhere, Torres-Spelliscy says. This presents a potential wire fraud problem. So the details of how apparent the small print matters. Its unclear where Never Surrender is putting its 20% cut of Trumps inauguration store sales, and details about how it has spent its funds since transitioning from Trumps campaign committee on November 12 will not be publicly available until the end of January. Spokespeople for Never Surrender and the RNC did not respond to requests for comment. Trump, of course, is no stranger to allegations of using inaugural funds for his personal benefit. In 2022, Trumps first inaugural committee and business agreed to pay $750,000 to Washington, D.C. after the attorney general alleged they illegally misused nonprofit funds to enrich the Trump family. The lawsuit claimed that the first inaugural fund overpaid Trumps hotel for event space, hosted a private party for Trumps adult children and settled a debt for the Trump Organization.","title":"Trump Breaks Tradition By Redirecting Inaugural Swag Funds To His PAC"},{"text":"America gave it to him","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"What he already did was way worse than watergate.","title":"Donald Trump Critics Push Plan to Block Him From Taking Power in DC Protest"},{"text":"There was a time when this sort of behavior would get you and the whole sub cheering you on banned","title":"Kamala WILL destroy Trump tomorrow!"},{"text":"The only answer is in changing public sentiment, and Trump losing his base.

Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary all have histories of Russian imperialist subjugation and joined in 1999. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia joined in 2004, shortly after Russia leveled Grozny in the Second Chechen War. Albania and Croatia joined in 2009 after the Russo-Georgian War. Montenegro joined in 2017 and North Macedonia joined in 2020, after the Russian annexation of Crimea and Russian-backed war in Donbas (no, rebels dont spontaneously acquire tons of Russian heavy military equipment without Russian involvement). And most notably, Finland and Sweden joined in direct response to the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Its worth noting that Putins worldview has not been static in the 25 years he has ruled Russia and that it is likely he has been radicalised during his rule (looking at you, Nikolai Patrushev), however he has already engaged in two wars of conquest against internationally recognised nations prior to Ukraine (the Russo-Georgian War and the 2014-2022 phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War). I would also like to add that Ukraine was a constitutionally neutral state prior to the Russian annexation of Crimea.To address a related point, NATO expansion to the Russian border poses zero risk to Russias territorial integrity. Arguments citing Napoleon and Hitler as evidence that NATO is preparing to invade Russia ignore the fact that mutually assured destruction has rendered any comparable invasion of Russia suicidal ever since the Soviet Union acquired nuclear weapons. The only way NATO expansion threatens Putin is if you believe in a Mearsheimer-type concept that Russia has a right to a sphere of influence, which is barely disguised imperialism.2. Valid point, but I will note that the US has used Ukraine as an expendable tool to weaken Russia rather than committing to a Ukrainian victory. Instead they drip-fed Ukraine aid and enabled the Russian military to get its shit together and start slowly advancing.3. Russia denied any intention of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine until a few days before they did it. Russia was under no threat whatsoever if it did not invade Ukraine, and its economy would be in far better shape if it had not invaded. Russia could have just not invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russia, as the aggressor, could theoretically end the war tomorrow if it withdrew from Ukraine immediately. And if Putin had no intention of seizing Ukrainian territory, he wouldnt have seized Ukrainian territory in the process of preventing them from joining NATO.4. The Putin regime hasnt been very subtle about its genocidal intentions and has already committed numerous indiscriminate massacres of Ukrainians.Russia violated all three treaties it has signed with Ukraine since 1991. The Putin regime is NOT willing to negotiate in good faith, and mark my words, Putin will violate any ceasefire that ends the current Russo-Ukrainian War within a few years.I am half-Russian and have family in Russia, I have read the first-hand Russian justifications for the war and I can confirm they are imperialist horseshit.","title":"CMV: The United States should continue to send aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"Oh, trump will have plenty of people lining up for that without hiring the people who couldn't even properly intimidate a bunch of Geriatrics.","title":"Openly glorified insurrection: Judges slap down requests from Jan. 6 defendants to attend Trump inauguration, saying it would not be appropriate or safe"},{"text":"That deserves more than one upvote.","title":"As Trump rewrites history, victims of the Jan. 6 riot say they feel 'betrayed'"},{"text":"Context is important, I dont want someone who sells pictures of their genitals teaching my kids, but I've no problem buying a coffee from them or having them work on my car.

How is society so clueless"},{"text":"?\\t?Surely, there are far more legal hurdles to rounding up 10-30 million people than JUST the constitutional use of the military? If things went this far I think various levels of state and local governments would be in active rebellion against Trump and there would be massive institutional resistance coming from a variety of levels in the military, with scatterings of junior officers to flag officers disobeying.A lot of these things are based on norms. The Brennan Center did a test run actually on how this would go down in a war-gaming exercise that I think involved some retired two-stars. It did not go very well and they actually literally had a lucky roll of the dice that averted catastrophe. Thats not reassuring.You may end up with some resistance and Id say if it were anyone whos not like Hegseth it might be somewhat effective. But he (and people like him) want to gut the entire officer corps, including junior officers. I know that CPI has already been collecting data on federal employees for the purposes of gauging loyalty. I assume this work extends to members of the military. Unfortunately, there are a LOT of people who are already onboard with Trump. It honestly even affected my command relationship and I got out in 2019.The unfortunate reality is that the Insurrection Act gives the President broad authority to act and theres very little stopping him. You have to rely on people to do some rather extraordinary things. Even if the military were to effectively resist, what would that actually mean for us? Certainly nothing good. The immediate consequences are an erosion of trust that the military follows civilian leadership and likely a very unhappy contingent of people on the far-right itching once more for civil conflict. I dont like any of the paths I see.?\\t?I understand the legal arguments for the most part (though admittedly I am not a lawyer), but the entire tone of your article seems highly alarmist and like a worst case scenario, if the stars align so to speak and Trump and his loyalists exercise an iron grip around every ounce of legal and extralegal power and every institution (including the states which I feel have lots of power) just rolls over. Do you think it's actually likely Trump will go this far?Yes, I think theres a good chance he goes that far. Enabling begets more enabling, and there are fairly fast points of no return for him. I am relatively confident that the Insurrection Act will be invoked pretty immediately, but they may wait for something to trigger it. Undoubtedly there will be inauguration protests. Even just that could set off a bad chain of events. For someone who repeatedly asked why he couldnt just have the military shoot protestors in the leg, I just wont put anything past him. And the people hes putting in positions of real power are likely to push the boundaries further than he might even do on his own.?\\t?Is there anything an average guy can realistically do to stop this now that the election is over? Like are we just fucked and the only thing left to do is kiss the ring at this point?Im actively working on ways for us to do something about it. Heres a little preview:https://preview.redd.it/p2eya0myxabe1.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbde7bc7911b241dca5917feee188d88c00bae3eSo I think yes there is a ton you can do. Some of that may be as simple as ensuring that you call your senator/congressional representative. At the very least it means ensuring you have the means to defend yourself and your family, and to relocate if needed. I definitely dont want to sound like an alarmist, but the kind of things you would want to prepare for arent really that far off from what FEMA advises in terms of emergency preparedness anyway.I hope to give people the tools to organize rapidly, to track threats, to find a community of like-minded people nearby, and to respond in-kind to any kind of provocations a potentially proto-fascist government could make. If they escalate to the worst case scenario of lawlessly imprisoning or killing Americans, then this can be used as the basis for legitimate resistance efforts. People frankly give our military too much credit if enough Americans were to actually actively resist. You definitely dont need to be directly part of that effort if its not in your wheelhouse, but there are literally hundreds of ways you can support that effort if required.And if the worst does not come to pass, then we can use the community building were doing to affect meaningful change. Theres no reason you cant translate this kind of activism into honest-to-god community building and put boots on the ground to get Americans reinvested in their political system. I believe that its possible to affect change by helping to build systems of trust. That kind of network is critical for this present effort, but it can also be translated into a system of voting guides in future elections, should we still have them in any meaningful sense.?\\t?Why wouldnt Trumps incompetency protect us during his second term (you said it protected us during his firm term)?The people hes surrounding himself with are far more competent this time around. It wasnt just incompetency last time. He also learned that he didnt like being limited and has sought to kill that. There will still be incompetency. Just likely not enough where it counts, and thats the core issue of his likely misuse of the military.?\\t?I'm curious exactly how far you think it will go. Do you think free and fair elections will be held in 2026 and 2028? Do you think there will be elections but they won't be legitimate? Trump will be an actual dictator by 2028? Honestly I can't imagine the last two happening without legitimate threats of secession from blue states and a complete balkanization of the union.I honestly dont know. My best guess is that they will go the Orban/Putin/Erdo?a route of making elections legitimate enough but essentially rigged, even by 2026. Again, that Brennan Center war game agreed with you and saw there being conflicts between blue governors and Trump. Thats probable. Although also look at how even some Democratic governors are already talking about working with him. Im expecting few to really show a spine. The feeling among Democrats does not seem to echo the kind of sentiment youd have seen in, say, 1860. So Im not holding my breath for really decisive action there. And again, that were even discussing this possibility is just absurd.I will tell you bluntly that I am ready to fight if need be. Like many of my brothers and sisters in arms, I swore an oath to this country and I have not once questioned whether I would be willing to uphold it. The irony is not lost on me that this sentiment is shared by those who might support Trump through all of this. But I just want to be clear that I take the threat seriously enough that I have been personally preparing to take the fight to the enemy, should they decide to be our enemy. This is absolutely not how I want to be spending my time and energy, but here I am.Does that help? I know its a bit overwhelmingnot just in terms of information, but emotionally. Still, I dont think it requires panic, just a clearheaded acknowledgement that there is real possible danger on the horizon but that we do have the means to combat it and perhaps avert it altogether. We just have to be serious about stepping up ourselves, because the institutions we have placed our faith in appear ill-prepared for these threats.","title":"Thune has privately told Trump that Hegseth has the votes to be confirmed as Defense Secretary, sources say"},{"text":"If they all want the same thing, order out of chaos, to be richer and to keep the people *us* poor, then is there really a reason to split hairs and say they are different types of elite??","title":"(Repost) Do not trust Elon or Trump"},{"text":"You mean the bible, guitars, trump black card, cologne, NFTs are all grifts? /s","title":"Trump Breaks Tradition By Redirecting Inaugural Swag Funds To His PAC"},{"text":"Yes, a large percent are cool fascism.","title":"The 19th Explains: How Trumps impact on the federal judiciary could be different this time"},{"text":"Since my family comes from China which is ruled by a dictatorship I am very sensitive to any sense of a dictatorship and people caving in to pressure (even though its impossible to have one in the US), but I feel like Mango is like a school bully.

The inauguration will be Jan. 20.Ethics experts say the director of the Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, is in the spotlight during any presidential transition, but Huitema faces special challenges ahead of Trump's second term, evaluating a myriad of business ties for Trump, his family and advisers.Experts pointed to the short, rocky tenure of Walter Shaub, the last person to hold the job when Trump entered the White House, and noted that several of Trump's latest nominees have expressed disdain for the agencies they will run.After nine years as ethics chief at the U.S. State Department, Huitema will spearhead the OGE's standard task of helping scrutinize dozens of new Senate-vetted nominees and thousands of political appointees for potential financial and personal conflicts.If he does his job well, chances are good Huitema could be fired fairly promptly, Shaub warned in an open letter last month. Huitema told Reuters he has faith in the intentions of most new entrants to government.He shared his views on ethics education and maintaining the public trust, but declined to answer specific questions about the incoming administration. The ethics office only deals with potential government employees, he noted. That means it will not vet outside advisers like billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump has asked to recommend cuts in government spending.Q: What does the OGE do, exactly?A: \\"The ultimate goal is to ensure that federal employees are making decisions based on national interest and policy priorities of the administration rather than any personal interest especially financial interest. ... The OGE itself is a small agency of just about 75 employees, but we work with a team of about 4,000 ethics officials interspersed, who engage more directly with federal employees.\\"One important immediate task, he said, will be \\"with nominee financial disclosure, helping ensure that nominees for Senate confirmed positions meet their requirements for complete disclosure of their financial interests and arrangements. \\"Q. How does the financial disclosure process work with presidential nominees?A: Normally, he said, nominees for top jobs fill out reports early to help the office \\"identify potential conflicts or steps the nominee might have to take if they are confirmed so all that information is available to the Senate and to the officials so they know what they are getting themselves into.\\"Q. What sort of deadlines are there? When do people have to make these disclosures?A. He said nominees should submit a report \\"within five days of their nomination. ... Our goal is to help these incoming officials, help the Senate and do so as efficiently as possible.\\"He noted that \\"any member of the public can request a copy\\" of any financial disclosure report filed with the OGE. \\"The idea is the public, too, can help play a role in monitoring for conflicts of interest.\\"Q. What is the enforcement mechanism if there are conflicts of interest?A: \\"Its not so much if a conflict comes up on the form itself, but whether ultimately any federal employees is engaged with work that then conflicts with their financial interest.\\"The conflict of interest law is a criminal law, so the ultimate recourse is prosecution by the Department of Justice. Our role is to actually help advise employees to avoid that situation ...\\"We will work with the agency ethics officials if we learn of a potential conflict of interest problem to make sure that gets addressed, ultimately we work with the Department of Justice as well if necessary.\\"Q: As the State Department ethics head, what lessons did you learn?A: \\"Most employees, career and appointed, want to follow the law and want to act with integrity and they appreciate the help of ethics officials ...\\"Q: In your Congressional testimony, you said you think the OGE can help in the \\"struggle against the growing cynicism and distrust that can undermine our democratic self government.\\" Can you explain?A. \\"We want to make sure employees ... don't act based on personal interests, especially financial interests and personal motivations. ...\\"In practice the federal ethics rules may be more limited in their actual scope than people appreciate, so peoples assumptions that theres a specific issue with compliance with federal ethics laws may not be well grounded.Q. What are some examples of interests that are not substantial enough to raise red flags?A. \\"The financial conflict of interest laws are ... pretty exact in terms of their scope. Either you have enough stock to pose a conflict or you dont.\\"Q. Can ethics be taught? For people coming from the business side, interactions are often based around \\"How can I use this to advantage me or my company,\\" on purpose.A. \\"I hope so because there are lot of ethics training requirements,\\" he said, laughing. He agreed officials coming from the private sector are used to \\"networking and What can you do to benefit someone so they can in turn benefit you... It is a challenge to make sure those officials and new employees understand that the expectations within government are a little bit different. ...\\"Q. What happens if the DOJ does not take ethics laws seriously? Where does that leave you?A. \\"Criminal prosecution is one extreme, but there is enforcement at the agency level in terms of discipline.\\"Q. The president can grant a waiver exempting someone from conflict of interest laws, correct? Is that something the OGE can push back on, or advise against?A. \\"The president in some cases and agency heads or officials ... can grant exemptions\\" but must consult with the OGE. He said exemptions can be granted when \\"the potential conflict of interest isnt viewed as that significant. Ultimately OGE needs to know when a waiver is issued. They can be made public.\\"","title":"New US ethics czar starts vetting incoming Trump officials"},{"text":"Yeah, Im looking forward to some real bargains on the used market in 2-3 years.","title":"The queer people who are buying guns to prepare for Donald Trumps America"},{"text":"Deciding to start a Civil War doesnt take courage.Brainless bravado, perhaps.","title":"Donald Trump critics push plan to block him from taking power in DC protest (it only takes 40% of Congressional Dems to sign onto this!)"},{"text":"Mr. Trump will never be half the human being Jimmy Carter was.
