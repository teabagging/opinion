Harris would undoubtedly be better than Trump in many ways, especially for Arabs. Even if they don't consider it 'good', it's still better than Trump. And so in this context, the desire for a 'perfect' presidency where a stronger stance is taken over Israel is still the enemy of a stance that is an improvement over Trump.Trump has been openly hostile to people from Arab nations (with policies like the Muslim ban) and has shown a strong preference for Israel over Palestine. While Harris may share some pro-Israel leanings, its to a lesser extent, and she faces pressure from others within the Democratic Party, who hold more balanced or pro-Palestinian views.If Arabs are prioritising Palestine when voting, then Harris is clearly the better option. But prioritising Palestine anyway just shows a level of entitlement to disregard all the broader damage a Trump presidency would cause, just to take a principled stand on a single issue. Voting should consider the wider impact, not just a single focus, especially when the alternative is far worse in many other ways.It's called triage. If youre faced with a choice between cancer and athletes foot, youre obviously going to choose athletes foot. Its about addressing the greater threat first. Prioritising an issue like Palestine while disregarding the overall damage of a Trump presidency is like ignoring cancer because youre more focused on the athletes foot. You deal with the most harmful problem first, which in this case, would be Trumps broader impact.","title":"Arab Voters Are Abandoning Kamala Harris.

Supposedly, some portion of this cost saving should be passed onto the consumer (and if companies are unwilling to do that, the government does have some options using port fees, which are basically a type of tax), but again, that depends on you believing capitalism works the way it should.Now, the flip side of this, is that you do not need as many workers on an automated dock.  However, it does create a safer working environment, and the remaining jobs tend to be more comfortable, and higher paying.Either way, most of the other big ports around the world have already automated, so US ports are now at a strategic disadvantage.  And this has led to fewer US ports being \\"International hubs,\\" and they are smaller than their competitors.Personally, I think that the Longshoreman should try to get a no firing with out cause clause, so they can't be replaced, but accept that new hiring will decrease as automation is brought in.  Those interested can train on the new systems, or just wait for their retirement while keeping the ports running until the new systems are on line.","title":"Biden lauds port strike resolution, hails collective bargaining"},{"text":"Inflation at 2.2%, unemployment at 4.1%, Stock Market hitting record high after record high.Biden did it.

They owe no allegiance to either the hammer or the wrench.They know we value Freedom of Speech, so when it suits them, that's the tool they use to say their horrible things.  But when we try to use the same right, they put that tool down and attempt to block us.These are not their values.  They are only tools.This goes for most of the things we value.  Bodily autonomy?  Their body, yes, everyone else's, no.  2nd Amendment?  Sure, unless you are a minority group they dislike, then no.  Free and fair elections?  When they are winning, yes, when they are losing, no.  Mind your business?  When it is their business, yes.  Yours?  No.  So on and so forth.Our values are their tools.So what are their values?  Power.  Control.  Domination.  Being \\"better than\\".  That's basically it.  They want power over others and to suffer no consequences for their actions.  They must be \\"better\\" than others, but not due to any degree of effort, simply by divine right.Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.","title":"What Conservatives Mean by Freedom of Speech | They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored"},{"text":"Filed under , No Shit, Sherlock.","title":"Democrats suspect Netanyahu of attempting to tilt Trump-Harris race"},{"text":"Gensler is the walking dead the way both parties, albeit moreso Republicans, are talking about crypto.

He was out there immediately: coordinating private organizations and citizens with relief efforts, giving interviews with local first responders to keep people up to date and informed, urging (shaming) the NC and Federal government from doing more.  His action, no exaggeration, probably saved some lives.Robinson is mounting a legal response to the CNN article, which for many people here casts doubt on the legitimacy of the porn scandal.  Folks are now also aware the Stein campaign was involved, and dropping the story on the last day that the GOP could change the name on the ballot is making it seem more and more like a manufactured political hit.I would even go so far to say that his actions in wNC have eclipsed the porn scandal entirely.","title":"Anyone else voting in a very Democrat state just for the popular vote?"},{"text":"If your vote is swayed because of some celebrity statement you shouldnt be allowed to vote.","title":"Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris and calls Donald Trump 'dangerous'"},{"text":"What we should do is have everybody in the country pay a little bit of money then we can budget that money to use for situations like this.

The fact that various metrics got so much lower than the average is why I don't give quite as much credence to Biden's better-than-average economic recovery. I think the only reason why the recovery looked so good was that it dropped further than everyone else, and so just by bouncing back to normal levels looks like more of an achievement. Also, in spite of its stupid name, operation warp speed, which was Trump financing vaccine development, led to the ultimate solution of the problem, so it's not even far fetched to make an argument that Trump's response had extremely good results in the end.That is not quite true. The first vaccine that was developed and given FDA approval was not funded by Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer CEO deliberately did not accept funds from OWS so that their scientists would not get held back by bureaucracy and red tape. They did get a pledge to buy doses from OWS, but the US was always going to buy whatever vaccines they could get their hands on so that is not surprising.That said, Operation Warp Speed was definitely a worthwhile, and the Trump administration should be given credit for it. But to say that it \\"solved the problem\\" is just not true. Many vaccines would still have been (and indeed were) developed without it, although it did lead to a plurality of vaccines which is always a good thing.","title":"CMV: Democrats should be amplifying Vance's Feb 2020 remark that \\"Trump thoroughly failed to deliver\\" on his economic promises"},{"text":"What happened there is obvious tragedy but if youre discussing the storms impact on rural voters in the west then I think its important to mention that Asheville, a decently sized and very liberal town was also destroyed","title":"Anyone else voting in a very Democrat state just for the popular vote?"},{"text":"If you have the energy contact Scott Presslers organization to help with reaching voters!","title":"Anyone else voting in a very Democrat state just for the popular vote?"},{"text":"This is on Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas to deliver this.

There are other problems which are more top of mind for her and while I can see her supporting a ceasefire and a 2 state solution, that has again been supported by many presidents, it is extremely difficult to achieve.Trump would likely be much worse for domestic Arabs seeing as how he wants to deport legal immigrants and has spurred Islamophobia along in the past. I think it depends on if the voter feels closer to being an American or being Arab.I assume Americans would want to choose whats best for living in America while Arabs would likely hold the issue of an independent Palestine as being more important as they may still see their future as retuning to the Middle East in a free Palestine. Its possible a lot of the population dont want to adopt the US as their home country and so I can see why the outcome of the election wouldnt matter to them.","title":"Arab Voters Are Abandoning Kamala Harris.

Otherwise, most of SAVE would seem clearly within the powers granted by statute to establish income-based repayment plans and discharge/forgiveness schemes based on those plans. The rationale given in granting one of the earlier injunctions (can't recall if it was EDMO or the other USDC case this summer), that Congress couldn't have intended for the payment amounts in SAVE because the court couldn't find examples of that payment amount elsewhere is kind of nonsensical, as the original IBR payment amount of 15% of disposable income was itself created out of thin air by the GW Bush administration, and the same was true when the Obama administration created PAYE and RePAYE reducing the amount to 10% and increasing the amount excluded from disposable income. The discharge is arguably more questionable, but it's also easily severable, so it's hard to justify enjoining the entire scheme instead of just that portion (an injunction preventing DoEd from forgiving/discharging anything would resolve any concerns about irreversible harm while letting them continue with the rest of the program, particularly as the MOHELA gets paid per loan, not by the loan balance administered).","title":"Biden student loan forgiveness plan gets win in Georgia court"},{"text":"Same assholes that backed Reagan are backing Trump.

True love, as I see it, involves trust, respect, and emotional safety, and if those are compromised, I question whether love in the pure sense can persist. If we distance ourselves from someone to avoid harm, isnt that a reflection of the fact that their behavior failed to meet conditions we need for a healthy loving relationship?I think it exists on a continuum. In any relationship, the strength of love will fluctuate naturally change over time. Even a low level of love, is still love.There are also different types of love, such as romantic love (eros), familial love (storge) and platonic love. Even in cases where love seems to continue in a different form (such as after a breakup or with an abusive person), its still tied to certain conditions that shaped the relationship. If those conditions break down, the love may change or take on a different form, but it shows that love wasnt unconditionalit was responsive to circumstances.It would generally only be considered *conditional* if it completely ceased because the other person no longer meets some set of criteria, like behavior, status, or appearance. As long as some form and level of love still exist, it would be false to say that *A feeling love for B* was conditional.

Thats the test. Thats the Supreme Court test, Walz said. Tim. Fire in a crowded theater? You guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that toddlers should not wear masks, Vance replied. The equivalence that Vance draws between social-media moderation and Trump trying to stage a coup is ridiculous, but revealing in terms of how conservatives have come to conceive of free speech: They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored. Walz is simply wrong about the Supreme Court standard for what kind of speech can be outlawed, but the invocation of that archaic test does illustrate how safety can become an excuse for state censorship. It just so happens that social-media moderation is not state censorship, because social media is not the government. But the fact that the government can put you in prison points to how matters of free speech are different for social-media companies. Social-media companies cant put you in prison, because they are not the government. They can ban users for not adhering to their standards, but this in itself is a form of speech: Just as the right-wing website Breitbart does not have to publish my writing, social-media companies do not have to publish the content of users who violate their rules. Social-media moderation is not state censorship, and it should not be treated as such. Conservatives understand this when the moderation decisions land in their favor, which is why the union-busting billionaire Elon Musks favoritism toward conservative speech and attempts to silence his critics on the social-media platform X have not drawn the attention of the Republican majority in Congress. Nor should theyhe owns the place; he can do what he wants with it. The point is that conservatives fully get the distinction when they want to. Vances implicit position is that conservatives have a state-enforced right to the use of private platforms; that the state can and should force private companies to publish speech that those companies disagree with, as long as that speech is right-wing. Such a policy really would be a form of censorship. Immediately after Trumps disastrous September debate, conservatives, including Trump himself, began calling for ABC News to lose its broadcast license for fact-checking Trumps lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. These threats of state retaliation against media outletsor anyone who speaks out against Trumpillustrate that what conservatives mean when they talk about free speech is a legal right to use private platforms as venues for right-wing propaganda, whether or not those platforms wish to be used that way. That is a form of censorship far more authoritarian than private social-media platforms deciding they dont want to carry rants about COVID shots putting microchips in your blood that can receive signals from alien invaders. As for Walz, he foolishly cited an archaic standard that the Supreme Court has thankfully abandoned, one that in actuality shows how dangerous it can be for the government to pick and choose which speech is acceptable. Walz has previously asserted that misinformation and hate speech are not protected, a mistaken belief that is unfortunately popular among some on the left. The flawed standard he cited last night explains why such speech is and should be protectedbecause the window for state power to police what individual people say should be as small as reasonably possible. His opponents Trump and Vance, however, do not think that such an approach is dangerous at all. A government that chooses which speech to punish and which to promote is their ideal situation, provided that they are the ones in charge.!ping SNEK","title":"What Conservatives Mean by Freedom of Speech | They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored"},{"text":"The crowd sizes on the tour will have Trump spinning!!","title":"Barack Obama will tour swing states to campaign for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Trump is an 80 year old toddler.When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, Im basically the same.

It gets more interesting the further away you are from one of the big cities. Id love to visit the Northern Territory or Hobart one day.Canada is an embarrassment of a country that lives solely because its inhabitants think America has cooties.

Something like the ACA was the only practical and politically feasible correction to the unacceptable state of affairs, and Republicans know that.  They nevertheless lied and demagogued about the ACA for more than a decade and still have not accepted it, as witness the ten Republican-dominated states that have not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion.  They can't admit that behavior, nor does their antigovernment attitude allow them to accept that such a major government intervention has been necessary and helpful.

The U.S. has problems it needs to fix, but acting like it has already gotten to the worst it can possibly be regarding corruption is dangerous because it can get SO MUCH WORSE.

In total, Trump attempts to dominate and control every situation. His social dominance orientation is centered on hostile sexism, crude masculinity, and of course racism.\\n \\n . . .\\n \\n In a bold move, instead of trying to avoid Trumps perceived strengths, Harris and her campaign attacked them through mockery and ridicule. Trump is notoriously thin-skinned and easily provoked. Harris has used that character flaw against him very successfully; Trump almost always takes the bait.\\n \\n Instead of engaging Trump on his terms, Harris either outright ignores him or responds as though he is an adult baby throwing a tantrum. Where others have backed down, Harris, who is a former prosecutor, knows that the best strategy is to usually directly confront the bullies and common thugs because they are not used to such a response C especially from a woman.","title":"Kamala Harris challenges Donald Trump's masculinity"},{"text":"I was 19 during my first election (2016).

That's going to be *really* hard for his opponent to fight back against.What I'm mostly trying to say is that if the goal is to win the presidency, it's better for Harris to spend time in WI/MI/PA/NC/GA -- and if the goal is to win the senate, throwing money into OH and TX is a better bet while maybe Walz swings an arm over Jon Tester's shoulder in MT.The last several election cycles here in FL certainly make it feel like if FL Dems were handed $250M tomorrow, they wouldn't be able to make a dent in the electorate between tomorrow and Election Day. They don't have the candidates, the energy, the momentum, the GOTV, or enough grass roots support. And that's why I think Harris should be very careful not to try to capture FL at the risk of losing more likely wins in the real swing states.The ballot measures will hopefully pass, but I really doubt that changes the electoral math much beyond that.","title":"Kamala Harris' chances of winning Florida increase as polls tighten"},{"text":"David Horowitz wrote the book \\"Unholy Alliance\\" almost two decades ago. It documents the ugly condominium between radical Islam and the American left. On the surface, it's hard to understand the common ground between the feminist/LGBT/pacifist left and the devoutly pious, anti-women, doctrinaire radical Islamists. But they share a common enemy: Western civilization. Radical Islam sees the West as an impediment to its desire to Islamize the world. The progressive left sees the West as an impediment to its desire to construct a Marxist utopia.Make no mistake folks, if this unholy alliance ever triumphs, the Western left will be devoured by the Islamists....just as the Iranian left was mercilessly devoured after helping Khomeini overthrow the Shah. And for all its barbarism, Islam is a functional system that has survived in the world for 1400 years. Communism is an unattainable utopia that has failed every time it has ever been attempted....(even the CCP jettisoned communism for a mixed economy). So, regardless of momentary exigencies, radical Islam is the senior partner in this unholy alliance and will surely extinguish its leftist allies once they are no longer needed.The Western left has flourished precisely because Western civilization is so tolerant.

To take a European example, I've heard people argue that Sweden should not push for abortion to be legislated on a an EU level, because it might end up with us getting screwed, since many countries have somewhat more restrictive laws that we have. Opting to make each sovereign nation (or state in the US) make their own decisions can be a very valid tactic to let those in the minority keep whatever laws they have. If the US went by pure majority, abortion would be legal everywhere. This is bad for people who are pro-choice. If you push the idea that this should be up to every state, then that would be good for states that are heavily Republican since they can do whatever they want. Even some people in progressive states might end up feeling fine with this compromise because it's safe for them as well, so maybe there wouldn't be a strong push to legislate it. Maybe.

(Media, business adoption, products and advertising) thats capitalism and if it wasnt making that annoying, theyd be doing it with something else. The rules and laws that Democrats try to put in place are not mandates of culture, the issue comes up when an anti-version of it tried to make *their* version into a rule and democrats attempt to stop that from happening. If you want to Blame someone, blame republicans or the religious or whomever tried to overstep morality simply because it was legal at the time, necessitating new laws/regulations to address it. The illegitimate, or rather, immoral/anti-____ grievances use the annoying capitalism stuff as an excuse to justify pushing their religious or what-they-think-is-normal beliefs on others. Those groups blame the left as an entity, as if its being pushed on them by Coca-Cola because democrats made it happen, or put their hands in the scale. Its ridiculous, the countrys culture evolves over time in a way that makes some uncomfortable but trying to keep it is as any given point has no moral or legal justification.\\nFor All else, the issues with politicians integrity, track records.

If they did Trump wouldn't be praising people like musk for firing everyone who went on strike.  The tariffs also have nothing to do with Unions, else they would be targeted like Harris's limited tariff plan is.  Trump just wants the ability to sell countries access to the US market, enrich him and the tariff will go away with your country, don't and it might get increased.  For example a limited tariff on Chinese EVs, helps American based auto plants compete against the heavily subsidized Chinese Automakers while still allowing our manufactures access to less expensive components such as microchips from Taiwan to allow our vehicles to be competitive on the global market allowing for expansion of capacity and more union jobs.  A flat tariff ensures that american consumers are locked behind a price wall for american vehicles, those vehicles can be sold for higher prices, will cost more to produce, and the only market they will be competitive in is the US market thus limiting their growth potential while also limiting American consumers buying power.  Basically it will make our cars worse, more expensive, less competitive, and will lead to overall less jobs and pay for workers in those factories.   It's the reason no political candidate has proposed something so dumb since before WW2. The only reason he is proposing it is because if he's allowed to do it, he gets to renegotiate pretty much every trade deal we have and he can grift the shit out of that at the expense of every American including union workers.   He will ship those union jobs overseas the moment some world leader pays him what he wants without a second thought.","title":"Biden lauds port strike resolution, hails collective bargaining"},{"text":"May Howard Dean's war cry echo through the ages","title":"Kamala Harris' chances of winning Florida increase as polls tighten"},{"text":"Emails revealed Obamas cabinet was chosen by bankers so I don't know","title":"Who Here Thinks President Biden Takes Orders From Barack Obama And Why Do You Think That?"},{"text":"One thing I find so weird is that Iowa is within touching distance, and Texas too, but Ohio is like completely impossible while having potentially a dem senator and most states surrounding it quite competitive","title":"Kamala Harris' chances of winning Florida increase as polls tighten"},{"text":"Agreed.

Thats the reason pride month and awarenesses are large and represented, to prevent being pushed down. As for corporate and Hollywood overusing or making money off it all, thats capitalism being capitalism, the left isnt putting their hand on the scale, opportunistic people are just making money in the money making world we live in. The same goes for the media. The left doesnt put their hand in that scale either, theyre making money. A lot of your talking points Ive heard on Fox News, people complaining about the left and culture and whatnot. Its Fox making money because they are the biggest and most watched news of America, especially rural America because thats all there was out there for a long time. A lot of the rest of the news leans left a bit but by no means unrepresentative of reality. Its clickbaity at worst, which is still annoying but it is nonetheless just people making money, not democrats pushing an agenda. On the note of the media though, Fox News has a lot of the blame for the lack of trustworthiness. They were taken to court over it and won on the grounds that their content isnt legitimate news but  entertainment. Theres more to it than that and theres some segments that are and arnt as I understand but its just a money thing, they make more when they blur the line and make stuff up, they all do. I cant say I can imagine how youd be able to attribute hypocrite to one side of the isle, let alone toward the left specifically. Hypocrisy in politics is everywhere, especially if youre looking for it and/or willing to cross years and subjects to identify it. Realizing that theres a lot of hypocrisy on the left is one step short of reality, its not more prominent there. Everyone wants to be left alone, go to work and go home. The people youre imagining as wanting you dead or hating the country, those people too, in reality, want to be left alone, go to work, and go home. You think youre different than them, different mentality, different goals, different something that makes them less worthy of the default respect youd give to someone not affiliated with the left.

These awards build on the $20 million in MSAP grants the Biden-Harris Administration announced in May ahead of the 70th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision and furthers the Administrations commitment to providing every student with a well-rounded education and improving the opportunities for every student to successfully learn and achieve.  \\n...  \\nThe MSAP awards will support 37 magnet schools with academically challenging and innovative instructional approaches designed to bring together students from different social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Grantees will use their MSAP funds to promote desegregation, increase academic achievement, build educator capacity, increase family engagement and foster community collaboration. The Fostering Diverse Schools awards will support voluntary local and state efforts to enrich student educational experiences and create more diverse and inclusive school communities. The Department will lift these 14 new awards and discuss how school districts can sustain and create magnet school opportunities through other federal grants this week at the 2024 Magnet Schools of America Fall Policy Training Conference in Arlington, Virginia. The Biden-Harris Administration is determined to ensure every student, in every zip code, has access to equitable and enriching educational experiences by making meaningful investments in locally-driven efforts to increase school diversity, working in close collaboration with parents, educators, and communities. As President Biden has often said, diversity is Americas greatest strength, and that is clear in the classroom C where research shows that students of all backgrounds benefit from learning in diverse environments, including through improved academic achievement, social mobility, civic engagement, empathy, and understanding. The Department has put equity and academic acceleration at the forefront of its work. Through the investments like MSAP and FDS, the Department is supporting districts to provide a world class education by providing more students with the opportunities and resources they need to be successful.A list of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:Diversity is Americas superpower. When students learn alongside those from different backgrounds, their horizons broaden, and more equitable access to enriching, well-rounded education can be achieved, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. These new awards will help us raise the bar for academic achievement and educational equitysupporting schools and districts in building enriching, diverse, and inclusive school communities.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Awards Over $67 Million Through Magnet Schools Program and Fostering Diverse Schools Grants"},{"text":"His eloquence is always amazing","title":"Happy Anniversary to Barack and Michelle Obama"},{"text":"The only problem being he doesn't really try, except during the playoffs.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 3, 2024 - 33 days until election day!"},{"text":"Trump has the police union so yep.","title":"CMV: The comparative lack of union support for Harris vs. previous Democratic nominees is a very bad sign for her chances this November."},{"text":"[/r/neoliberal/new](/r/neoliberal/new): [Syriana still relevant](/r/neoliberal/comments/1fvt3rc/syriana_still_relevant/)*Replies to this comment will be removed, please participate in the linked thread*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Considering that Bidens other foreign policy issue was the war in Ukraine and managing NATO, Id say it evens out.","title":"Biden lauds port strike resolution, hails collective bargaining"},{"text":"Yeah I had a run in with them on another thread where they insist that January 6th was just peaceful protest.

Israel could go after Irans leaders, in the same way that it has assassinated much of the top ranks of Hamas and Hizbullah. It could hit Irans infrastructure, in order to push an already weak economy over the brink. In particular, strikes on the oil terminals at Irans ports would stop the flow of its main export and starve the regime of much-needed cash. Two strikes Israel has carried out in recent months against the oil terminal at the Yemeni port of Hodeida, in response to missiles fired at Israel by the Houthi militia, which is backed by Iran, were seen as a trial run for such an attack. Most alluring of all, however, would be strikes against facilities where Iran is thought to be developing nuclear weaponssomething Israel has been contemplating for more than 20 years.Yes, they could develop nuclear weapons in weeks, but in reality, it would take quite a while for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.And, moreover, producing nuclear weapons is one thing.

Eventually the Democrats will get perhaps the 58% of the vote they need in both houses to get a slight legislature majority but it needs to occur during a redistricting session to undo gerrymandering.

By amplifying, I am talking about what the left-wing media and people with large social media followings are talking about.  I feel they should talk about Vance's remark and explore why he might have said those things.  Talk about how GDP growth was so puny during Trump's administration, talk about Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and how they contributed to a quintupling of the federal deficit during his administration.  Talk about how GDP has been much higher under Biden, how unemployment has hit record lows for many demographics under Biden and the budget deficit has halved under Biden.  Things like that.What this does is help discourage those who have thought of moving away from Democrats to vote for Trump because of the economy, and it helps reduce the voter enthusiasm of the Trump voters it doesn't sway.  And undecideds who might otherwise vote for Trump because he might do something about the economy may reconsider.","title":"CMV: Democrats should be amplifying Vance's Feb 2020 remark that \\"Trump thoroughly failed to deliver\\" on his economic promises"},{"text":"I dont think you realize how bad depression can get for some people.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Fuck Id watch that","title":"The ILA ruined my life"},{"text":"[Tue Entire Sonic Movie Vocoded to Gangsta's Paradise](https://youtu.be/VfU7Cx6l9Ik)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It's going outside bro there's no requirement or \\"mental energy\\" wtf?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I really don't know who they made it for - like at least the first one, it wasn't for me but when I saw it I knew a certain demographic would love itthis one feels like it has nothing substantial to offer to any group of people","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"So why do you want your view changed?

And when you hear news of the Harris campaign gaining thousands of new volunteers in both swing states and even less traditionally competitive states, I'd agree. It's starting to sound like people everywhere are getting the message and responding to the calls.I've long since said that the traditional media is no longer the mainstay of democracy, nor should it truly ever be relied on as such. We the people have that role. We are the drivers of democracy, not only in how we vote, but in how we drive and support our own communities.Make plans to vote, help those you know vote, and volunteer in these final weeks where you are able. This is the season where it matters most. Learn when early voting starts. Learn when your state's registration deadlines are. Plan accordingly. No one person will be our savior, we're not a cult like MAGA, but we each can help win this in small ways. Simon has often been a good source of info for cutting through distractions and nonsense, and now late in the game he sees what we've seen for years now.So focus. Don't be distracted. Find a way to help, and ignore the disinformation that seeks to steal your energy. Don't push it. Don't enable it. Just help us focus, fly home and land this thing safely.

And Trump's NLRB was openly hostile to unions, removed the ability to write off union fees as a deductible (a tax on union members), cut overtime pay for 8 million workers, gutted workplace safety rules, made it harder for gig workers to get benefits, and tried to take tips from workers and give it to their bosses.

It pisses me off when the same people who bankrolled Trump and his freaky cronies in secret turn around and tell us that we need to vote for their Trump-lites to combat their despotism. Seriously, people are mad at folks like us for not voting Hillary, but to try to sell her to us as a progressive when she went to bat for Henry Kissinger and was a key reason he never saw the inside of a prison cell for what he did is a slap in the face. Massachusetts and New York perfectly sum up my grievances with how the Democratic Party uses Republican insanity to their benefit and their donor class' benefit to run diet Republicans in their place and sell them as progressives, only to either abandon their progressive platform, or water down progressive proposals to benefit the rich. Public housing and infrastructure turns into a for-profit scheme, low-income neighborhoods turn into corporate vanity projects, calls for ceasefire end up amounting to lip service, promises to address police brutality and corruption turn into record funding and performative activism, and so on and so forth.I don't want Trump to win, but Harris is promising unconditional support for Israel and while I think it's great that Republicans are crossing the aisle to support her, I really don't think Bush's Cabinet and VP's endorsements should inspire confidence in her Middle East policy, especially when she promises to give us the \\"most lethal fighting force in the world\\". I'm also not a fan of how Biden and Harris, much like Trump are willing to ingratiate themselves with despots like the Saudi Royal Family, the Qatari Royal Family, The Narenda Modi Regime, and other despots who routinely do the things to their own people that they promise to protect us from at home. The entire world should condemn and ostracize countries that import their labor force, steal their passports, force their wives into prostitution, and in Modi's case: lead pogroms and promote ethno-religious nationalism.

He personally chose a man in a wheelchair, and look at what unfolded.

To this day, the left is still fractured, and Ecuador is living under what feels like a dictatorship. When selecting someone for leadership, it's crucial to examine their character and commitment to the working class. Once in office, Moreno showed no concern for working people. His actions were so harmful that it's hard to believe there were no signs of this before his election, which was heavily supported by Correa. It seems Correa let sympathy cloud his judgment instead of evaluating Morenos character.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided l'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.","title":"The ILA ruined my life"},{"text":"As much as Reddit tries to delegitimize the idea of abstaining from voting, this person is within their right to withhold their vote based on a single issue.

Trump is winning more union workers as well as more black and hispanic people, particularly men, than Republicans did typically. Harris is winning more women, more college educated people, and more white men than Democrats have won typically. All in all it ends up being a wash, as polling looks pretty close to the Trump/Biden 2020 election, where Biden won the popular vote comfortably but the electoral college was incredibly close.
