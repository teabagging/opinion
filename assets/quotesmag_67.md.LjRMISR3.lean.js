They are in impenetrable bubbles that are based on social media algorithms and bombarded with so much content daily, much of which is misinformation, that they cannot possible tell the real from the fake and start to just internalize what they hear most often or fall back to feelings-based decisions because they can't actually process so much information and make rational, educated decisions off it.People voted on the economy.  Not the real economy.  But their general feelings about what they've internalized the economy to be.  Nothing else mattered much because people cared only about the most immediate, surface-level impact to their lives.

After that, Hitler went all in on seizing power through political means by developing the NSDAP and its propaganda arms.Now all that's left is a reenactment of the [Night of the Long Knives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives), and the US will have done a Germany 2.0.","title":"Potential Trump AG: I Want to Drag Dem Bodies Through the Streets"},{"text":"Honestly, Dems need to work more at having hardcore values. I still voted for them, but a lot of things upset me over the last 4 years that I begrudgingly went along with:\\n- Border Security: This is clearly a huge issue for the other side, why do you insist on letting it be an absolute mess? Executive order that shit and fix what you can. Does the system suck? Yes. Until you can pass bipartisan legislation, don't let it run wild. You don't have to demonize them, but crossing the border illegally is still a crime, whether you like it or not. \\n- Fiscal Responsibility: Point out companies making record profits, bring the facts to a debate! Don't just say \\"companies are price gouging, show it! You're the party of FACTS and science, show us the facts and science! Point out the companies who haven't paid a damn in taxes. You literally have the IRS available, private tax records be damned, give us a reason to get angry! If a mega corporation says they employ 6000 people and the 5500 non management hourly workers all get paid ~40,000/yr, and the company makes $500m a year, do the fucking math! A 10k raise for the year for each of those 5500 people is $55,000,000. Do all of those people probably need it? No. Is $10,000 very drastic. Yes. Push for a living wage comparable for the market they are employed in!\\n- For all the good the Social Justice Warrior stuff is... Maybe tone it down. You don't need to include abortion rights as a separate topic, or trans affirmative care as a separate topic, loop it together. Body autonomy. America is the land of freedom, only parents of children should decide what their children are allowed to be doing. They shouldn't have things forced on them. \\n- Religion is great, keep it out of the government and schools. Separation of church and state. Push for it! I literally **never** heard this topic this election cycle despite this Christian Nationalism being a main aspect of project 2025 and the Republican party as a whole. Everyone has the freedom here to practice what they want, or to not practice. You don't need to rely on a religion to teach morality and basic human decency, and relying on it for you personally isn't a crutch. \\n- Just because you think that you made no mistakes, doesn't mean you didn't. When Harris was on the View and stated looking backshe wouldn't do anything different while also saying her administration would be different, that was very annoying. People obviously cared about illegal immigration. You wouldn't have changed what you did knowing the hindsight? It's okay to admit fault in a problem and to be dedicated in fixing it. We are all humans and make mistakes. Insisting you've made no mistakes makes you feel un-human. \\n- For gods sake, make men feel appreciated for the roles they serve. Criticize the rapey ones absolutely, but when you have supporters cheering about all men being trash, or men in general being trash, it really doesn't make a welcoming environment. For all of the talk Kamala made in the race about her parents, I hardly *ever* heard about her dad. Maybe he wasn't the greatest, I literally do not know. But I heard about her mom literally tons. You have to uplift and point out all the positive role models in your life male or female. Pandering to one side when you are already a woman is just ... Unfathomable. Guarantee if you make it a point to give men gratitude for the role they play in your life, or empower others to thank and praise the men in their own lives for helping them or whatever it may be... You'll gain some traction. So many men walk through life and get treated as it's a completely thankless job. Thank them where it's needed too. \\n- Celebrate the achievements of former democratic presidents while acknowledging their shortcomings. Obama was great, we can't ride his coattails forever. He didn't do some things as well as he should've. \\n- Stop being anti-gun. Stop with the assault weapons bans. You're only banning guns that look scary. Plenty more have immense opportunities for hurt. Similarly, a lot of people, particularly in rural America, strongly associate their identity with firearms. The second you attack their firearms, you are attacking their identity and you shut them out. Is it fully right? No. Is it a compromise this country will have to make for a long time still? Yes. Stop making yourself a demon. The AG from California (state that hates guns) wants to put in an assault weapons ban. That literally just added fuel to the fire that \\"Californians are coming for your guns\\".\\n- Similarly with California, stop looking to California for the answer. Silicon valley is not your friend. EVs are not your friend. EVs are still incredibly expensive and an incredible pain in the ass. Stop letting states impose a forced EV mandate when clearly it's very unpopular. European nations are also starting to roll these back. \\n- Actually deliver on promises you make to young voters on issues they care about. The one thing Biden did for young people was the student loan forgiveness plan, and that completely fell through. He held up his hands and said \\"welp, that's all I can do.\\" So many people, who voted for him, are rightfully pissed. Even when the supreme court decided that presidents can't be held accountable for illegal actions taken in office, he did nothing. Don't be afraid to weaponize Republican's own agenda and achievements of their party against them. \\n- Make young people a visible part of your administration, whether it be part of the EPA, FDA, FCC, Press Office, etc. Show that you want them around. \\n- Have a coalition of young leaders decide the direction of the party moving forward. No DWS, no Pelosi, no Schumer. AOC, Jeff Jackson, etc are the future of your party and can get young people excited for what's to come. Nothing is more annoying/cringe than seeing Schumer on TV acting like he knows what a selfie is or what a \\"brat summer\\" is. \\n- Start showing your damn teeth. The Kamala campaign finally started showing their teeth way too late in general. Call it like you see it, post out facts, with either video or transcripts or audio or whatever. Call it like you see it and call out the bullshit. My biggest complaint (and prediction) is that they'll see the \\"being mean\\" part of this campaign as a failure and reel it back in. That was honestly one of the FEW ways it worked!\\nThere's a lot of ways to go about this. And there's a lot of enthusiastic people out there, and a lot of angry people. Start channelling that anger *now.*\\nBe the party of anger, of genuine outrage. If something gets out of hand and a show store or a Grocery Store gets looted, call that shit out! Protest behavior does not equal lawlessness. That's always inexcusable. \\nI could say so much more... But I'll leave my 2 here. I'll see you all in 4 years when the shit show is over.","title":"Should Democrats change tactics and focus on their core base?"},{"text":"I got 2 young ones and I dont see them getting the future you speak of without a lot of blood being spilled.

MAGA won. Hate won. Many Republicans left the Republican party and even campaigned against their party in an attempt to defeat Trump, Ted Cruz, and others.Trump didn't win on politics. He won on hate. I doubt most of you are ready to acknowledge this, but we are not *really* a nation of good people. We're not. We're a nation of people, and basic math says half of them are less good than the other half. So, how good is the average? C'mon now. Let's be honest.For over 60 years... hell, for over a 150 years... we've been begging our fellow citizens to be good, or at the least be decent, and time after time, so many of our fellow citizens rejected even basic human decency.Donald Trump said the south should have been allowed to keep some slavery, and he WON.And he won.There's an old joke by George Carlin about stupid people that comes to mind: \\"Think about how stupid the average person is, and then realize that HALF OF 'EM ARE STUPIDER THAN THAT.\\"Granted, he should have said Median, not Average, but it's a joke... and a damn good one too.Now think about *THAT* in terms of good vs evil. Think about how rotten the average person is. No, really. Pause for a moment and think about it. Think about how many people you know who go out of their way to do good, vs how many don't give a damn.Like it or not, asking someone to at least be decent is more than the average American is willing to do. That's why conservatives seethe with anger at the thought of someone using a different pronoun.The average American isn't that good of a person. Lots of us are, but be honest. Is the average American? Not really.The average American hates minorities enough to vote to screw them over, every change they get. Hell, even minorities hate each other in this country. Black and Hispanic communities often hate each other. This religion hates that religion. Gays even hate gays who aren't gay enough. I'm a straight guy. Years ago, I dated a bi woman who was active in the gay community. She broke up with me because her gay friends were upset that she was dating a man (even though I'm a man who has marched for gay rights, because good people stand up for other people's rights. I digress).I voted for Kamala Harris, and I am proud to have done so. I was excited for the potential of a Harris presidency. But I'm not surprised Trump defeated her.Trump didn't win on politics. He won on hate, and his voters are using excuses with a wink and a nod to justify voting for hate.The United States is a more-hateful country than most of us are ready or willing to admit. That's why, generation after generation, good people have to fight just to spread basic human decency let alone love.Last night, hate won. But not within me.I just hope the voters, and the nation, can live with the consequences of the embracement of hate.  There's a new Nazi movement rising in the US, though they use a different name.

I couldn't find any facts as to what they were basing that off of, but thought it was interesting.It's too bad the Harris campaign didn't run with that progressive bend and instead tried to curry the favor of \\"flipping\\" Republicans. While that's all very nice, it always seemed that they're the exception, not the rule, and I feel like the Republicans who didn't want Trump to win just wouldn't vote for him regardless of whether the DNC pandered to them or not. I also thought they were leaning a little too much on the \\"secret woman\\" voter. I think you can get conservative women (and people in general) to vote against party on issues (abortion measures, etc., but I don't think that translates to actually voting against party on national races for seats of power as often as the DNC seems to think it does.

Hope and optimism have defined my political career, and I continue to be hopeful and optimistic about Canada. Young people have been a great source of inspiration for me. I have met and talked with so many of you about your dreams, your frustrations, and your ideas for change. More and more, you are engaging in politics because you want to change things for the better. Many of you have placed your trust in our party. As my time in political life draws to a close I want to share with you my belief in your power to change this country and this world. There are great challenges before you, from the overwhelming nature of climate change to the unfairness of an economy that excludes so many from our collective wealth, and the changes necessary to build a more inclusive and generous Canada. I believe in you. Your energy, your vision, your passion for justice are exactly what this country needs today. You need to be at the heart of our economy, our political life, and our plans for the present and the future.And finally, to all Canadians: Canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. We can be a better one C a country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. We can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for our children. We can do our part to save the worlds environment. We can restore our good name in the world. We can do all of these things because we finally have a party system at the national level where there are real choices; where your vote matters; where working for change can actually bring about change. In the months and years to come, New Democrats will put a compelling new alternative to you. My colleagues in our party are an impressive, committed team. Give them a careful hearing; consider the alternatives; and consider that we can be a better, fairer, more equal country by working together. Dont let them tell you it cant be done.My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic.

Whether its done through a build up in ICE or a mobilization of the national guard, the question will always be of manpower. The vast majority of illegal inmigrante should be deported back to their country of origin. I think exceptions could be made for some who have been here for a particularly long time. Anyone of particularly dubious origin (terrorist linked) thats crossed in the last few years or beyond should definitely be at the top of the list of those returned home. 2. Im not an economist, so it would be foolish of me to play the percentage game. I think its important to foster positive trade relationships with long term allies, but to apply tariffs harshly to countries that are double dealing against our global interest.3. Im all for a robust medical system, but the overhead and bloat thats prevalent throughout our federal government needs trimming. Cutting sections of the FDA doesnt inherently mean a lowering in standards. In fact, I think most Trump voters expect a freeing up of resources to explore experimental medicines i.e CRISPR.4. Not sure, not every candidate is going to match my desires entirely. I hope that our system is so that medical debt isnt a possibility. Im not heartless, this just isnt an issue I consider to be on the top of any Republicans mind right now.5.

However, if youre convinced he will make his way into a full time federal position, buy puts on TSLA.6. Just withdraw from NATO and rely on forming individual treaties and alliances with countries that deal with us fairly. This doesnt mean I completely support isolationism, but Russia isnt the global threat we thought it could be. Granted, China is untested, but the games they play seem to be wholly different. 7. Nobody will like my answer for this, but honestly, the best outcome is for both sides to lose. I dont support Hamas, and I dont support a genocide of the Palestinian people. If we have to pick a lane then well pick it, but this isnt an issue I voted by. 8. Well, it depends on your definition of totally. We need to keep lanes open for shipping naturally, and I dont have a problem with legal immigrants from any nation making their way here. However, the incompetence of the current administration in handling the border means that serious, temporary measures should be considered.Now, I do think its important to note, that most of these issues arent really what I decided my vote by.

Dems looked at a 50-50 majority in the Senate and thought they could remake America. In many ways, Democrats have engaged in the same self-destructive delusions the GOP has been so fond of. We convinced ourselves that there was nothing wrong with the border, that Biden was somehow still capable of running, and that people would just completely forget about inflation. Biden's good legacy on industrial policy, green infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing is now completely tarnished by yesterday's result. Everything Biden did was great, but his ultimate failure to lead us out of the Trump-era will haunt him. Then again, the US economy is doing great. However much I don't like Elon Musk's politics, it will be good to have businesspeople in the White House again. Honest to god, I would take a Trump administration that restricts immigration and bans trans people from sports if we are able to build again.

I asked the interwebs to compare jobs growth and unemployment between this administration and the one before:Here are some key metrics comparing job growth and unemployment between the Biden-Harris administration and the prior Trump administration: Job Growth\\n- **Biden-Harris Administration**: Since taking office, the Biden administration has overseen the addition of approximately **15.7 million jobs**2. This includes a significant rebound from the pandemic, with employment levels now about 6.3 million higher than pre-pandemic levels2.\\n- **Trump Administration**: During Trump's tenure, the economy experienced job growth until the pandemic hit in 2020. Excluding the pandemic year, the job growth rate was slower compared to Biden's first three years1. Trump left office with about 3 million fewer jobs than when he started, largely due to the pandemic?. Unemployment Rate\\n- **Biden-Harris Administration**: The unemployment rate has decreased from **6.4%** at the start of Biden's term to **4.1%** as of September 20243. This marks a significant recovery from the pandemic-induced spike.\\n- **Trump Administration**: Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate had fallen to a low of **3.5%** in late 2019?. However, the pandemic caused a sharp increase in unemployment, which was still high when Trump left office.Overall, while both administrations faced unique challenges, the Biden-Harris administration has seen a faster recovery in job growth and a steady decrease in unemployment rates post-pandemic.

Congratulations for the win ?"},{"text":"There are several problems at play, but I think one of the biggest is that the left absolutely sucks at branding, and our messaging and slogans alienate people who might otherwise agree with us. I bet if you asked \\"do we need to reform the police?\\" the majority would say yes. If you instead say \\"ACAB\\" or \\"defund the police\\" you instantly lose half of those supporters because they don't stick around long enough to realize they agree with the policy suggestions behind those sentiments. Similarly, I believe (or at least hope) that sexists are a minority and that most people want equality, but when the rhetoric commonly blames and accuses men, you push away some who might have otherwise been easily convinced to join our fight.Another major issue is that most people don't really fact check, so whoever tells \\"the truth\\" first is the one that's automatically believed and the other side faces the uphill battle of convincing people that they've been fooled. The Republican Party knows this and capitalizes on it. They hit hard and fast with a barrage of lies that sound convincing, and it works every time. This is why \\"when they go low, we go high\\" doesn't work; we can't beat them at their own game because we aren't playing the same game.

Maybe the public opposes gender-affirming care for adults in general (though I doubt it) but they for sure opposes spending taxpayer money on expensive surgeries for prison inmates.

A huge number of positions in the federal government are not filled by appointment, but by competitive hiring practices, internal promotions, etc much more like an ordinary job. These individuals are hired for competency instead of loyalty, and the president has no direct say in their hiring or firing.You can go on Indeed right now and apply for various FBI agent positions, for example. For another famous example, Anthony Fauci was head of NIAID from 1984 to 2022. Robert Mueller was not in an appointed position and so Trump had no authority to fire him.The plan of project 2025 is not just to appoint a new cabinet and such, which obviously every president does. It is also to restructure the civil service so that influential administrative positions *can* be fired by the president, and then to actually do so for a huge number of positions, filling them with loyalists instead. And this isn't a hypothetical; Trump [already issued the executive order to do it](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/) in october 2020.

My point is that your idea that we can remove hierarchies with respect to power is untenable. Hierarchies of power will emerge naturally. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is the naivete of anarchy; that people can self-govern. That may work on a small group of people, for a time, but not at scale. If you remove the system, a system will emerge quickly on its own, and it will likely not be one that is altruistic.  IMHO, the reason modern society is failing is not because of the systems that we have, but the people that are leading it. We have allowed an ultra powerful neofeudalistic plutocracy to have complete control on all aspects of society. Our best bet it to enforce laws that inhibit their capacity for corruption, and increase transparency at all levels of leadership.","title":"I'm an anarchocommunist.

It seems shocking, but sometimes people will choose someone who is diverse _because_ they provide a valuable perspective and voice first, and happen to be diverse.Representing all walks of American life (sans criminals) is what both parties should strive to do from the start, as a default. There should not be one party attacking the other from their inability to respect diverse voices and identities. That said, there exist real issues in rural America that Dems simply haven't platformed strongly on, because they've been too busy playing defense against regressivism and the erosion of rights. For that, ruralites are willing to sacrifice the virtue of diversity if it means they can put bread on the table for another day. You might too if you'd been left to hang as long as they have. So Democrats need to look hard at how they connect with those outside the safety of coasts and major metropolitan areas. Somebody needs to roll up their sleeves and start sowing seeds alongside them, delving straight into the core of their issues, to find means to empower ruralites with merits directly attributable to Democratic policies and initiatives.

This unfortunately rings true today more than ever. Many voters aren't making politically informed decisions, they're making *feelings* based decisions. And that's what got Trump elected, feelings.Biden was supposed to be a one term, \\"transitional\\" president from the start. The beginning of a shift back to normalcy. Back when Biden announced his intention to run again, I believed he should have refused to run for a second term, instead choosing to throw his support behind whomever emerged as the primary winner, while laying low and putting up guardrails in case of a Trump re-election.But now the history books will see this presidency as an effort that tried to pick up the pieces before the next storm arrived. An economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped in and was forced to oversee a recovery. Republicans took advantage of these crises to point fingers and rally their voters around wedge issues and disingenuous campaign talking points, preferring to run on blaming their opponents for the fallout and outcomes that were rooted in causes spanning back years. And now Trump will be inheriting a growing economy, *again*, which is frustrating to say the least. He will take credit for everything he can take credit for, and will avoid taking responsibility for anything that might tarnish his legacy in the eyes of his supporters.Under Trump's last term:- The Natl Debt ballooned by nearly 40 percent\\n- He started a trade war with China\\n- He pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge \\n- He championed tax cut legislation that did not \\"pay for itself\\", and disproportionately and permanently benefitted the rich and corporations. This legislation is estimated to cost the government trillions\\n- His admin took several actions to make it more difficult for workers to unionize and for unions to operate effectively.\\n- He mishandled the covid pandemic at nearly every turn, and left office with the economy in tatters. *All of these things, by comparison, contributed more to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the next administration*- He cozied up to dictators and autocrats around the globe\\n- His foreign policy was disastrous, he escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our position as peace brokers, emboldened and enabled Putin's agenda, withdrew from the working non proliferation agreement with Iran, negotiated with terrorists, weakened our alliances, strengthened our enemy's geopolitical positions, and instituted tariffs that did far more harm than good, among other things.His presidency helped preserve a GOP agenda that's been redistributing wealth to the top and crippling the labor movement for decades. And of course, he facilitated an attack on our Capitol.Not to mention, he's been the most divisive, incendiary political figure in recent memory. He's been a beacon for hate groups, a leader for extremists and conspiracy theorists, a demagogue appealing to the worst impulses, the victimhood and the grievances of Americans, and he's empowered an ultra nationalistic, nativist, anti-intellectual, xenophobic, chauvinistic movement in this country. A movement of people who are extremely cynical, cautious, paranoid and intolerant of not just foreigners, but of a long list of fabricated boogeymen and deep state machinations. Trump is a symptom of a disease yes, but a symptom, nonetheless, that should send you to the emergency room. It was of necessity that Trump be voted out in 2020, two consecutive Trump terms would have been far more damaging. Biden's transitional presidency was supposed to be that trip to the emergency room... But now, he's been sandwiched in between two Trump terms, and we're leaving the hospital against medical advice. However, we should, at the very least, find some consolation in the fact that the last four years might mitigate some of the damage to come, or at a minimum, provide some obstacles for Republicans where there would have been none otherwise.But when all is said and done, Trump won with about the same amount of voters as the last election. \\nDemocrats did not do an effective job at informing receptive voters of basic things like Trump's true economic and foreign policy record. They also failed to communicate on immigration. Specifically the part about Republicans exploiting it as a wedge issue for years, preferring fearmongering tactics, and extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" over practical, humane, economically considerate policies. What's more, Democrats were forced to shoehorn in a candidate at the last minute that millions of Democrats didn't turn out for because an effective case wasn't made and the party didn't account for things that should have been accounted for, like how in some cases, especially when it comes to low propensity voters, they care far more about their immediate circumstances than any threat to democracy, which is unfortunate yes, but a reality for some Americans.And sadly, this may also include the idea that some Americans just aren't willing to vote for a woman when the alternative is a perceived strongman, especially when a culture and \\"crisis\\" of masculinity is on the rise, regardless of its legitimacy. Democrats miscalculated how little Americans care about Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional rhetoric, how some may think Trump's absurdity renders him benign, because, for some reason, Trump has been sane washed and normalized by the media and general public. They also may have miscalculated how many Americans just aren't tuned into it. Either way, it was a miscalculation.Walter Lippman once called the general public an \\"irrational force.\\" A message that should resonate with some of us now more than ever. He was dismayed by the fact that voters don't often make politically informed decisions, they make *feelings* based decisions. And that's what got Trump elected, feelings.","title":"Why Did Kamala Lose? Blame Joe Biden and the Democratic Party | Opinion"},{"text":"Hard to argue that this time.

But to to focus on this group when other groups are actually experiencing their rights being stripped and attacked seems strange when they have not been attacked for generations and the Democratic platform has clearly been advocating for all groups to receive benefits economically, whether that be tax credits, health care benefits, access to jobs, etc. Think theres a very interesting discussion to be had here but again, Im not sure how far to read into this and whether its something worth investigating as Reddit is obviously not the place to read into these things especially on a subreddit like that and is not a great representation of any population. In the end it could also just be white straight males having some sense of superiority and a black women running for president is not someone who they would vote for in general due to their own biases and misogyny and racism.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 6, 2024"},{"text":"SAME HERE!!!","title":"Yall??

They are simply shitty role models. I'm a Millenial, and I have male cousins and friends (and their extended friends groups) who are younger millennials and Gen Z. Besides gaming, all they do is listen to the right wing streamers and podcasters 24/7. It has occupied the majority of their media consumption. I could sit here and type out multiple individual stories, observations and anecdotes. No, seriously. There is some nutty shit going on.These young dudes are frustrated, lonely, sexless and they feel abandoned and mistreated (in their view) by society, only for the PodBros to come in and give them some sense of community and speak to their frustrations and aspirations. Everyone from Andrew Tate to The Whatever Podcast, Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Youtubers like The Critical Drinker and his associates, Ben Shapiro, Fresh and Fit, The Passport Bros, Finance Bros, TradWife Bros etc heck even the female podcasters like Brett Cooper and Baggage Claim spew this stuff as well. Baggage Claim has put out 2 videos with unfounded claims, bashing Kamala and praising Trump.My male friends have been sending me clips, tiktoks, Reels, links of the stuff for years, and eventually I succumbed and even I started to see things from the manosphere world view. Thankfully I eventually realized the Right-wing dog whistles and I snapped out of it but others won't be like me. It is a less visible problem that has been allowed to fester under the radar, but definitely a serious issue we need to address. It's a sophisticated and well-oiled machine at this point.I was just listening to Pod Save America and they brought it up as well. We need our own versions of this type of new media. \\nI also coincidentally listened to Prof. Scott Galloway do an Interview with the Diary of a CEO dude on monday and he mentions the same exact thing. He has been shouting it from the rooftops for years now. Listen [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzLmznS91kM)\\n \\nWe've now seen the effect this has had on an actual election and I'm honestly devastated. I hope we can curtail it going forward. I think being the opposition/under dogs will help us and hinder them. Hard to keep drumming up support by fanning anger and complaining that everything is against you when you are firmly in the drivers seat.Edit: Added link to the Scott Galloway interview where he talks about it.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 6, 2024"},{"text":"He is the reason why his party is in power.

Rushdoony taught that it would provide manspecifically the male genderwith the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own childrens education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought Gods kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.","title":"Politics Watch Kamala Harris deliver concession speech: \\"When we lose an election, we accept the results\\""},{"text":"if victory means the end of civil rights for my trans brothers and sisters, then I do not want to win. if we win on the back of throwing them under the bus, how are we any different? you don't win by becoming republicans, u win by NOT becoming republicans","title":"Capitulating on Trans Issues Would Be a Mistake"},{"text":"I agree, he's awful and I have tremendous anxiety for the future.

My kids didn't grow up being told what to believe and who to support. They grew up hearing where I stand on whatever issue and why. One thing I told them early on is no one politician is going to check every box. You have to decide what matters most and what you're willing to let go of in order to have it. What I care about most is individual freedom. The right to marry who you want, be who want, and have a family or don't. My non-negotiable is self-determination. I'm willing to ignore the consequences of illegal immigration for this. All the first Trump administration did was make me a full-on Democrat. I was an independent who voted a mixed ballot.

On social/gender issues, as we saw with the fall of Roe it could absolutely move at breakneck speed (especially if conservative states have laws already in place to take effect once somethings is struck down or approved). Once Roe fell hospitals in red states started denying abortions pretty much immediate and doctors started cancelling appointments.Building transit systems and energy efficient buildings is definitely a slow process, but denying trans care, outlawing gay marriage, further restrictions on abortion, dismantling healthcare, gutting agencies and getting rid of regulations could absolutely happen at breakneck speeds. And this time Trump won't even have on the fence republicans in his admin. He's culled the John Kelly types, and only extreme loyalists are left.Underestimating the far right and Trump on doing all the horrible shit they campaigned on after they literally just won an improbable election with the crappiest candidate possible is peak denial and sloppy politics.Seriously conservatives will in fight and one up each other trying to be the craziest of all the crazies. Plus congress works what? 100 days a year?How ignorant. It actually depends on the administration and obviously the make up of Congress. Sure in 2010 with Obama and Mcconnel, Senate met 158 times and House met 127 times. 2017 with Trump and a republican congress, House met 192, Senate 195. In 2018 again Trump and Mcconnel/republican Congress, House met 174 times and Senate met 191 times. So yeah, a republican Congress can absolutely double the amount of times they legislate, it's how they pushed through so many conservative federal judges during Trump's first term.The fact that you think they meet such a low amount a times, means Mcconnel succeeded in normalizing legislative fuckery (via the Obama years) with you. Unless Democrats retake the House in the next couple days, Congress will absolutely meet closer on the 200 end rather than 100 times end.

Personal property accounts for personal possessions, items intended for personal use. A house could function as this. A car, a toothbrush, a computer and so on.Private property refers to the means of production. Think things like factories that have a significant impact on the rest of society, things that produce what society needs to function and flourish. Who should control these things?We should ask how do people obtain property (I'm mostly talking about land in this sense since that's what most people think about when they hear 'property') in the first place. They either inherit or buy it. Where do the previous owners get it from? Well you travel down the line far enough and you'll learn they either killed for it or discovered it and claimed it. Surely the act of discovery justifies the lineage of ownership?But does it really? Forget that this all goes back to before history could be recorded. Does the fact that some person came upon this land all those years ago justify the usage of the land to hoard resources and technology for themselves, use it to irreversibly change the planet by polluting it? Does it really justify giving them power over the rest of society? (Is this really fair? Did they earn this power? Another whole debate.) Maybe. If only the people who controlled production fairly compensated the people who actually did the production. But that's a debate that we've been arguing for a long time. Where do you stand on that? As for people who voluntarily band together to defend their property, as long as their little society doesn't oppress anyone by exploiting people, hoarding resources and whatever else is wrong with the capitalist mode of production, as long as everyone involved understands the power dynamics and chooses to be a part of it, well the other anarchists and I have no problem with it.

Also, yes Warren was reelected in Massachusetts, but most of her Democratic allies in Congress on financial and economic topics were voted out. This is a common problem where progressives in safe East or West coast districts create a ton of problems for Democrats in purple districts/states. Warren made her district happy, but screwed over Sherrod Brown in Ohio, for example.Ultimately though, this humiliating election wasnt Warrens fault. The blame rests squarely on Bidens shoulders for backing Israels genocide. A bit also applies to Harris for doubling down on Bidens worst policies.

Seeing as how we agree that our govt is an incestuous parasitic tool for the ruling class's personal piggy bank, how would you suggest you achieve those goals given the structure we're working with?Personally, I've never seen so many people put together who are willing to identify the many systemic problems in our bureaucracy with a real plan in place to remedy it. The fact that Casey and Calley Means are joining the cabinet with RFK to dismantle the FDA/big pharma revolving door to de-poison our food and water, I've never been so optimistic for the future of the health in this country. This is a big move in the right direction.This community would like to see tax incentives that give small and local businesses an advantage over bigger corporations.AgreedWorker owned businesses, worker co-operatives I think the underlying issue here isn't with the govt, it's with the workers themselves. It's a rare thing for enough workers to be invested in the success of the company without having first risked everything to create it. That usually falls onto one person who has the drive to create something for themself.I'd love to see it happen though. Unfortunately those things tend to fail because the risk involved in creating a business requires a central figure who will forego their own profit to make sure the workers and vendors/suppliers/utilities get paid first (or atleast that's what a good boss is supposed to do). That sort of risk can rarely be decentralized.and organized union negotiating power are the types of measures that can democratize our work placesI've held union and non union jobs. IME the major unions have the same corruption problems as big govt at the expense of the worker. Once a union gets too big it tends to follow the type of trajectory that ends in bosses stealing the pension funds, and then getting replaced by someone *else* in on the scam while never being made to replace the money. The boss that leaves winds up moving to another union that does the same thing. It's definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.I'd love to know how this can be remedied so that the workers don't keep getting screwed.Unfortunately we are stuck with oligarchs buying politicians, amassing wealth through corporate ownership and exploiting our ponzi-like stock market.Indeed. I truly hope we see a major change in that power structure. All I know is there wasn't a hope in hell with the current uniparty in power. If absolutely nothing changes in the next four years, it was atleast worth a shot. If we get just a 1% change it's moving in the right direction at the very least. I expect something much bigger though. If it wasn't, the bureaucracy/human traffickers wouldn't try so hard to kill and lawfare the bad orangeman.I also forgot that civil liberties is a major issue that our factions could also agree on.Absolutely. Ever heard of Julie Kelly? She's been the only real advocate for the jan 6 political prisoners. Families have been destroyed, prisoners have been tortured and had their civil liberties violated worse than anyone at gitmo. She's going to play a big role in this administration. With a proper DOJ and AG I expect to see many of these corrupt federal judges and DOJ bureaucrats investigated and prosecuted for weaponizing the justice system against people who did nothing wrong beyond being welcomed in by police.Idk how much you know about the setup/false flag on that day, but it was planned in Gen Milley's office. He, the secretary of the army, and 3 other generals planned the op with the help of the 3 letter agencies, the Pentagon, and a bunch of private contractors. Capitol police had 800 officers off that day on administrative leave, leaving only 200 officers and no NG (at the secretary of the army's orders) after Yoganonda Pittman signed 6 permits for protest, which on any other day would be an *all hands on deck* situation  - just like the *other* 300 protests per year in DC.Lots and lots of people planned what happened that day, and a bunch of unassuming dipshits fell for it. I knew weeks earlier it was going to be a setup when I started seeing advertisements to \\"make it an *armed* demonstration\\" online. They wanted blood, and they had the fake \\"pipe bombs\\" as a backup just in case the agent provocateurs couldn't pull it off. I'm betting we'll see a shit ton of sudden retirements over the next two months leading up to the inauguration.For the record, the US military/state dept specializes in color revolutions. They've been doing it around the world for more than 70 years (a very similar timeline  to when the CIA started controlling the US govt). I find it bizarre that so many people will call them out when they happen to communist regimes in Central and South America, but somehow are blind to the hallmarks here at home.Thanks again for the constructive comments. And just so we're clear, I have no issue with communist idealists. It's part of human nature to want the best for everyone. It's the marxists I have issue with. All they know is how to destroy. They refuse to create anything, and instead focus on divide and conquer while making themselves massively rich.

Most Americans support the overwhelming majority of the Democratic partys platform, from LGBT rights to abortion to expanding Medicare/Medicare and Social Security to making the rich pay their fair share. Americans, and even MAGAs, support the Democratic partys platform. The problem isnt policy, its identity. Americans arent ready for minorities to actually take part in the American experiment. Kamala had concrete plans to make housing affordable. She had concrete plans to make starting a family affordable. Biden has successfully landed us a recession-free COVID recovery. Every GOP POTUS since over the past 50 years has left their office with the U.S. in a recession. Every ounce of economic data proves that the GOP is shit for the economy and the average American, yet Americans believe the inverse. Why? Because the Democratic Party also supports social policiespolicies that are based on ensuring social equality. This means that Democrats talk about trans rights, gay rights, police brutality. Most Americans arent affected by that, but still have to hear the discussions because Democrat politicians still talk about it, because it still exists. Trans people exist. Black people are incarcerated at higher rates than white people, and that still matters. But when most Americans arent trans, or black, or *insert specific minority*, they dont care, they see it as irrelevant, and therefore see the Democrats as out-of-touch, and therefore see the GOP as being focused on the economy.","title":"Old Habits Die Hard"},{"text":"He did not help matters, but he wasnt the main reason.","title":"Democrat blame game begins as Harris accused of picking wrong running mate"},{"text":"Hey, hey you, social media coordinator for democrats.

People considered the lack of senators a bug but as my friend has said it was a feature. As lacking senators to pass legislation the states picked up the job under the 10th Amendment.People need to understand Republicans, Democrats, and in fact all political parties are private companies whose single goal is to get control of the federal government often to hand out benefits to themselves &amp; their cronies.Ultimately though I am hopeful with recent SCOTUS rulings especially regarding the Chevron defense getting gutted. They gave up not only their own power to determine legality but Congresses ability to legislate to unelected bureaucrats leading to the administrative state we have now. But with Chevron getting gutted not only will representatives &amp; senators become more important but all those pesky regulations not backed by law are going to get gutted over time.Thing about the President though is for the most part it should be largely irrelevant domestically unless there's a war or issue with or between the states.","title":"We made the presidency too powerful"},{"text":"His first term in office, he had a lot of terrible people around him, but he also had more people who cared about the country and were genuinely trying to keep him from doing too much damage.We won't have that anymore... project 2025 will remove all of the well-meaning public servants and somewhat level-headed advisors that don't swear a loyalty oath to Trump, and it will be him surrounded by yes men doing whatever he wishes.

They learned with Biden that popular opinion can change, so they just wont let it. There is literally nothing stopping them from declaring an end to democracy. The only question is how. Personally, I think they will wait until it is time for an election and then declare a state of emergency, putting the election on hold until it is resolved. Theyll give updates every week or two about how the election will be soon but never give a date. This ruse will probably last a year, and then there will either be a declaration of the end of voting in general or violent opposition to overthrow the government, or both. Either way is the same result, if you ever vote again it wont be in the USA.","title":"Who do you think may be the democratic nominee in 2028?"},{"text":"You wish","title":"Next steps for 2026 and beyond"},{"text":"With the numbers being what they were its unlikely anyone she wouldve chosen would have made much of a difference.

Things are likely to get really bad.","title":"Potential Trump AG: I Want to Drag Dem Bodies Through the Streets"},{"text":"Here's my take: Democrats basically conceded several policy areas that are important to voters to Republicans, being ashamed of talking about them or knowingly repeating unpopular policy. Instead, they could have attempted to reframe the debate and come up with more serious solutions than Republicans. However, the Democrats being the diverse big tent party they are, are too afraid of enacting bold policies, which gives the much more monolithic Republicans a big advantage. There are 3 main areas where Democrats lacked vision.1. Economy and inflation: Dems allowed the vibes economy to proliferate. Inflation has been going down for a while, real wages never went down, and many economic indicators are improving. However most people still seem to have the impression that the economy is continuing to fail. Not only were the successes not talked about,  there was no plan for the next 4 years. People feel the need to make big changes. Dems could have instead taken the line that while the economy wasn't doing badly, it's important to decrease the cost of living, and that while Trump plans to make it worse tarrifs, Dems can make it better with free trade, anti-trust action, more progressive taxes that alleviate the burden on the middle class, a higher federal minimum wage, etc.\\n2. Crime: Ever since BLM Dems have been stuck between upsetting the activist class by being tough on crime or upsetting the median voters. Harsher sentencing has been tried again and again and it doesn't work, but reducing sentences doesn't reduce crime either. It's time to break out of this dichotomy. Strenghen law enforcement, truly reform the police, and make sure criminal actually get arrested, not just that they get stuck in jail for years on the offchance they do.\\n3. Immigration: Again, time to break outside of the dichotomy here. Most people don't want illegal immigration, but many support increased legal immigration. Get rid of the H1B cap, make it easier to get a green card, but at the same time, make it harder to cross the border illegally. Strengthen ICE and increase the number of visas given.All of these areas were deemphasized in favor of negative things about Trump. Talk about a lack of a bold agenda was dismissed. The Democrats became the party of the status quo, and that was a very unappealing pitch. Without Dems telling voters how they would fix real problems with the country, any voter who didn't feel great would vote for Trumo as the change candidate.","title":"Ten points on what went wrong for Democrats"},{"text":"Post like these are why democrats lose.

AMA"},{"text":"All the takes are correct and yet they also miss the point.Yes, it was insane for the Democrats to think they could win by running a soulless candidate, without a shred of progressive policy vision, pursuing endorsements from neocon war-hawks everybody hates, while arming and funding a genocide, and belittling and crushing those who have enough morality to protest it.  It is enraging that the Democrats are so smug and blind to this.But these are all just symptoms.  The deeper reality is that liberalism has failed, liberalism is dead, and people urgently need to wake up to this fact and respond accordingly. It is a defunct ideology that cannot offer any meaningful solutions to our social and ecological crises and it must be abandoned.Democrats have proven over and over again that they cannot accept even *basic* steps like public healthcare, affordable housing, and a public job guarantee - things that would dramatically improve the material, social and political conditions of the working classes. And they cannot accept a public finance strategy that would steer production away from fossil fuels and toward green transition to give us a shot at a liveable future.Why? Because these things run against the objectives of capital accumulation. And for liberals capital is sacrosanct. They will do whatever it takes to ensure elite accumulation, it is their only consistent commitment.  At home, they suppress and demonize progressive and socialist tendencies. Abroad, they engage in endless wars and violence to suppress input prices in the global South and prevent any possibility of sovereign economic development.The Democrats have done all this purposefully and knowingly, for my whole life, not as some kind of \\"mistake\\" but in full consciousness that it is in the interests of capital.And because liberalism cannot address our crises, and because it crushes socialist alternatives, it inevitably paves the way for right-wing populism.  They know this pattern, and yet they risk it every time - this election being only the most recent example. They did it in 2016, when they actively crushed the Sanders campaign and sent Trump to the White House. They do it because ultimately they (and I mean the liberal ruling class here) don't really mind if fascists take power, so long as the latter too ensure the conditions for capital accumulation. They 100% prefer this to the possibility of a socialist alternative.So, progressives have to face reality. The dream of \\"converting\\" the Democratic party is dead. This is now a fact and it must be accepted. The only option is to build a mass-based movement that can reclaim the working classes and mobilize a political vehicle that can integrate disparate progressive struggles into a unified and formidable political force and achieve substantive transformation. This will take real work, actual organizing, but it must be done and that process must begin now.","title":"It was insane for the Dems to think they could win by running a soulless candidate, without a shred of progressive policy vision, pursuing endorsements from neocon warhawks everybody hates, while arming and funding a genocide, and belittling and crushing those who have enough morality to protest it."},{"text":"I agree.

Democrats were not at fault for inflation, and Biden did a good job dealing with it. Trumps only stated economic policies will make inflation worse. So if inflation and the economy at large really were motivating voters, they should have voted for Harris. And the same is true for pretty much every issue. There are no real issues that Trump or the Republican Party have handled better than Democrats, or that Trump and the Republican Party have better, more popular plans for handing. And thats the complicated problem. Democrats get blamed for things that objectively are not their fault, and get no credit at all for any of their accomplishments. Republicans never have to take responsibility for any of their many, many failures, and despite those failures, people always assume Republicans will deal with things well if given the chance. I dont know how to fix that, but its definitely not going to be fixed by some cosmetic changes by the Democratic Party.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | Common Dreams"},{"text":"Sometimes pragmatism needs to win over idealism.

So Walmart is only making 2 on every dollar in sales. Now you're going to fix their prices? What if the price of gas goes up? What if minimum wage goes up? If a grocery store can't raise their prices to account for higher operating costs there won't be any grocery stores, this is why communism always ends up in bread lines.Housing credits- free money. Free money always causes inflation. It's simple supply and demand. Give people 25k for free and the demand for houses goes up. If supply remains equal prices will rise.Student loans- I assume you mean forgiveness? Same thing. Free money, causes more inflation. Money is a commodity just like every else. The lower the supply the more value it has. Imagine the world if we gave everyone a million dollars. That money would become essentially worthless. People wouldn't be willing to work for 20$ an hour. There would be no supply to match the demand and you would have hyperinflation.

Its the goal end state, but you expend too much political capital asking for too much too soon and as a result you get nothing.We dont drop these issues, they are important and matter but its time Dems realize that American federal legislation isn't the place to be world leaders.  Fight the fight elsewhere, globally, in education, in entertainment media, at the state level, fight bottom up rather than top down, soften the electorate on these issues before you make it a central part of your platform.  The first time Amercan citizens hear about these social issues shouldn't be from their senator or presidential candidate telling taxpayers they are using their money for XXX.  Instead, lead the citizens to realize that this is the correct thing to do on their own.  (I'd say Legalization of Marijuana has worked pretty well this way recently) Dont play the race, gender identity, orientation, sexism card proactively.  Sure maybe your opponent's position is racist/sexist/homophobic etc. but its likely a lot of the electorate doesn't understand the issue enough to understand why. (explaining why school choice is racist isn't something a lot of people would immediately understand), Push the issues that are just spam dunk obvious that there frankly isn't a rational response to: healthcare, workers rights, consumer protections, infrastructure investments, etc.Am I asking for a shift right?  In some senses yes I guess, bi\\nt Id argue its more akin to the \\"snowball\\" method of getting out of debt.  Focus on the most important, achievable issues first, (without outright compromising or changing your beliefs), and then use that momentum to start pitching the newer/more radical ones.

I voted for Kamala, but after doing a lot of reading I can see 100% why she lost. Biden was too stubborn to drop out earlier which screwed Kamala by giving her less time to show Americans who she is and what see can do. Her campaign felt weak and she didnt differentiate herself from Biden. I think Americans put a lot of blame on democrats for inflation when it wasnt democrats faults at all. They were handed a post-Covid economy and I think general Americans are quick to blame current issues that affect their lives on whoever is currently in office, regardless of looking at the bigger picture. Another big reason why she lost was because democrats have formed themselves a bubble, detaching themselves from what the rest of the country thinks and wants. I believe that they lost many votes from the average American and the middle class. I think this country has become exponentially selfish over the last decade. People prioritize three basic needs - how much can I make, how much can I save/provide for family, and how much is food/gas/goods. We are reminded of inflation every single time we step out of our homes. I sometimes wonder if the selfishness is stemming from social media. Online we are seeing young 20-year olds with big houses and nice cars, the perfect suburban mom dancing with her kids in a huge white marble kitchen, people in our social circles flaunting success and materialistic things. You wonder how that is affecting the things we prioritize now compared to pre-social media/internet. Another thing that is being under looked is democrat run cities and states. Seeds were planted when democrats forced vaccine mandates and other stuff during covid that pissed people off. Then you started to see mass migrations out of California, New York, Chicago (which just dropped from the 3rd to 4th largest city, now behind Houston) and other democrat cities. People leaving these places are due to high taxes, crime, homelessness, and immigrants being dumped off by the bus loads. I guarantee democrats lost voters and independents who once supported them due to not doing anything and issues in these cities. I live in Chicago and Ive never seen so much crime, immigrants standing outside every grocery store, immigrant moms carrying babies on their backs while trying to sell candy bars and sodas at stop lights, and apartments/centers filled with immigrants. I also struggle with saving money and barely making it by, living paycheck to paycheck. It sucks and financial stress is some of the worst stress you can experience. Its awful.Last, I think the media is underestimating podcasts and new media. Trump did Joe Rogan which has 45 million views and probably double that on Spotify. Trump also went on other comedian podcasts, live twitch streams, and other interviews with people who have huge social media followings (Logan Paul, Theo Von, Lex Friedman, Nelk Guys, and others). The thing I found interesting after watching clips from some of these podcasts was that Trumps demeanor and the way he talks was completely different than how he speaks at rallies and in debates. I am not shocked that young men came out and voted for him in big numbers. Ive typed enough and could go on and on about other points like transgender stuff, families not wanting hot topics to be taught in schools to their kids, black and Latino votes, etc etc but my fingers hurt.
