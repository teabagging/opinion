Did you go to school in the United States? Remember having questions based off these things?Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, EvaluationThat is Blooms Taxonomy. As described by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt in her book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America - a Chronological Paper Trail, the six parts of Blooms Taxonomy are derived from the three part dialectic used by Hegel and Marx.She saw it as a communist plot to take over education, but the adoption of Blooms Taxonomy was really an attempt to rally all the social sciences background people around something they had in common. But Iserbyt is correct that it serves to prepare the population to accept a leftist way of thinking from an early age.What I am suggesting, is to heed her caution, and use a knowledge of these things to your advantage.

Hitler lost the presidential election. So how does that say anything about historians recognizing why someone lost? Thats obviously not what Hitler is recognized for.And when it comes to those 1932 elections, historians are pretty clear on what caused the fractures in Germany that led to Hilter being appointed chancellor. It wasnt Hindenburg being super old or flubbing a debate, it was a populace hurting from the great depression and WWI, extremists breaking towards fascism on one side and communism on the other, and the resulting fighting and instability driving the broad citizenry towards the authoritarianism. All of which was fueled by hyper-nationalism and scapegoating of Jewish and other minority groups. In other words, Hitlers rise is explained in the context of the citizenry that enabled and supported him, not any specific person losing an election. In the US, should Trump become the horror many people think he will, the fault will lie squarely on the shoulders of the electorate that voted for him despite all the glaring red flags, not anything Biden did.

According to the Vacancies Reform Act, if a vacancy occurs in a Senate-confirmed position, the president can temporarily replace that appointee (such as the F.B.I. director) only with a person who has already received Senate confirmation or with a person whos served in a senior capacity in the agency (at the GS-15 pay scale) for at least 90 days in the year before the resignation.\\"Kash Patel, Donald Trumps chosen successor at the F.B.I., meets neither of these criteria. Hes not in a Senate-confirmed position, and hes not been a senior federal employee in the Department of Justice in the last year. That means he cant walk into the job on Day 1. Trump will have to select someone else to lead the F.B.I. immediately, or the position will default to the first assistant to the office.\\"In this case, that means the position would default to Paul Abbate, who has been the deputy director of the F.B.I. since 2021, unless Trump chooses someone else, and that someone else cannot be Patel, at least not right away.\\"The bottom line is that the Senate has to do its job. Wray is foreclosing a presidential appointment under the Vacancies Reform Act, and  as I wrote in a column last month  the Supreme Court has most likely foreclosed the use of a recess appointment to bypass the Senate.\\"","title":"Christopher Wray to resign as FBI director before Trump takes office"},{"text":"This headline absolutely filled me with rage","title":"Republican Support for Obamacare Hits 12 Year High"},{"text":"Thanks for a year old assessment. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/russian-economy-remains-putins-greatest-weakness","title":"NATO could circumvent Donald Trump on Ukraine peace plan"},{"text":"we have cowards, and coward enablers","title":"FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign before Trump takes office"},{"text":"Nah, hell let them be broadcast.

Im not going to allow men to erase women or womens rights.First of all, trans people statistically do not pose any risk to people in bathrooms and are instead far more at risk of being abused or harassed while trying to use facilities. Yet Republicans, and in typical fashion mind you, pretend like this issue is some widespread, inescapable epidemic.Think about how ego centric this is too. They're the victims at the center of a trans agenda thats oppressing *them,* \\"erasing their rights.\\" This isn't about the rights of trans persons, it's not even an effort to address which bathrooms should be reserved for the trans community, It's about *their* feelings, no one else's. It's about what public restroom privileges they're entitled to. In other words, f*ck the feelings of Sarah McBride, this is about me me me.Someone should ask Mace, or any Republican congressman for that matter, to identify any cases of trans people harassing someone in a public bathroom. And you know what, for the sake of argument, let's say they do identify a case, It still doesn't mean that one incident is broadly representative of how all trans persons behave.What's particularly unnerving here is that Republicans like Mace just presume they will be tormented in public bathrooms by trans people, that they are under attack, that they are the victims here, when in reality, it's not only a presumption attempting to justify discriminatory policy, but it's people like McBride who are the actual victims of harassment in these scenarios.So Mace and her fearmongering coalition of bigots ignore or outright dismiss the fact that it's trans individuals who are much more likely to be hassled in public bathrooms, while Republicans like Nancy are the actual enablers of that harassment, and they're basically resorting to a form of victim blaming.These Republicans just suspect that trans people prioritize using bathrooms to make others feel uncomfortable, that whenever a trans individual uses a public bathroom, it's, first and foremost, for the purpose of provoking others. Instead of the fact that, you know, they're just there to do their own business, and mind their own business for that matter, just like most people who use the public restroom.Republicans presume a whole lot about the LGBTQ community. And most of it is rooted in their own insecurities, their prejudices, their hate. So they pass laws to validate these feelings. If it's written into law, it becomes an official acknowledgement. If there's a law prohibiting Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom, it must be for a reason. And now that reason becomes a reality for them.While make no mistake, this is only one step away from Republican men refusing to share a bathroom with people like McBride. Which is one step away from either banning her from using public bathrooms altogether, or designating a bathroom strictly for people like McBride. You know, just like how bathrooms were segregated a century ago.This is what Republicans do, they incessantly vilify out-groups, foreigners, gay and trans people, \\"the other,\\" so that they can create scapegoats and boogeymen. Then these scapegoats and boogeymen become the targets of their outrage, their hate, their blame, their grievances, their discrimination and ultimately, their legislative efforts. And all of these things are part of a kind of feedback loop.Their fears, their hate, their hostility towards these groups, and the misinformation and propaganda they generate, help them justify the legislation they pass, and that legislation helps reinforce their fears and contempt for those groups even more, which then strengthens their case for more discriminatory and suppressive measures, and around and around it goes.","title":"Nancy Mace Will Double Down on Anti-Trans Hate After Alleged Assault.

People finally asked themselves, what has he been doing all this time, and couldn't come up with any answers.The Catholic Republican Rick Santorum was a Senator here during Bush Jr.'s term, so that shows you how pro-life the state was, or can be. We even had a very unusual court case in 2002 of a man trying to sue his ex-girlfriend for planning to have an abortion that got national attention.Whether the state is as pro-life as it used to be is a little doubtful. The cut-off in the law here is at 24 weeks, which is as liberal as the states get except for having no cut-off. As you go west and south from PA, the states quickly start having tighter bans.Aside from specific issues, Pennsylvania definitely likes \\"maverick\\" politicians. Ones who show some independence from the establishment. This state doesn't like \\"big\\" anything...government, business, etc. They don't like labels like Republican, Democrat, conservative or liberal.

In 2023, he published his book titled, \\"Deep State Gangsters,\\" which Trump praised as a \\"roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign\\". He has also promoted election denying, COVID-19 and anti-vax conspiracy theories.Patel also has a history of supporting Qanon conspiracy theories.. On Truth Social, Patel boosted a prominent Qanon account. According to Media Matters, Patel has shared an image featuring a flaming Q on it and has gone on multiple Qanon shows in order to urge members to join Truth Social. Patel said in 2022 that Truth Social was trying to adopt Qanon \\"into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences\\", and that the figurehead of the Qanon movement \\"should get credit for all the things he has accomplished\\".Patel once proposed closing the FBI headquarters and reopening it as a \\"museum of the deep state.\\" Let's see if he follows through on his proposal.When Trump first proposed appointing Patel to lead the FBI or CIA, it faced significant backlash. Bill Barr even chimed in, writing that, \\"Patel would become FBI director \\"over his dead body.\\"Patel has also proposed making it easier to sue journalists.This next one is pretty relevant considering all of the right wing hysteria around Hunter Biden's pardon at the moment, because as a public defender, Patel often represented clients with firearm violations, not to mention drug traffickers and murderers. He was aide to Devin Nunes of all people and authored the \\"Nunes Memo\\" which tried to discredit the FBI and the Russian investigation. Even though it was regarded as deeply biased, inherently flawed and contained \\"cherry picked facts,\\" it became widely accepted by the MAGA community.Patel claims that the Steele dossier was used to initiate the Russia investigation, it wasn't. In fact, the dossier appeared after the FBI first began its Russia probe. The investigations and findings of both Mueller and the FBI did *not* hinge on the Steele dossier. Patel still wrote a book about it titled *The Plot Against the King*.He was formerly appointed to the NSC, and it was noted by his colleagues that he was severely under qualified. Patel was accused of being a Ukraine policy back channel for Trump, even though he was assigned to counterterrorism. Fiona Hill told investigators that it seems \\"Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump.\\"Patel once argued that former Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, was \\"disloyal to Trump\\" because he refused to send military troops to quell protestors. After the November 2020 election, Patel reportedly blocked some Department of Defense officials from helping the Biden administration transition.In 2022, when Patel had to testify before a federal grand jury that was investigating the Trump classified documents scandal, he declined to answer every question by invoking the fifth amendment. He was also one of the proponents of the idea that Trump had unilateral powers to declassify all materials.That same year: Patel created Fight With Kash, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity, to raise donations for \\"helping other people\\" in need, though more specifically to bring \\"America First patriots\\" together and \\"helping fight the Deep State.\\" Patel has also supported the idea that Trump should seek vengeance against his political enemies.During an appearance on Steve Bannon's podcast, he said the following: We will go out and find the conspirators  not just in government, but in the media ... we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections ... We're going to come after you. Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice, and Steve, this is why they hate us. This is why we're tyrannical.

Tuvieron que tirar el manual a la basura, porque los argentinos eligieron a alguien que hizo todo al revs de lo que deca su manual.?English:\\\\Therefore, today I want to reflect with you precisely about this, we are going to talk about politics, we are going to talk about method, we are going to talk about power. As you all know I am not a politician, in fact, I have always despised politicians and how could I not hate them. Moreover, how could I not hate the State, which is a tool of oppression. It is enough to understand a little bit of economics and see what they did to Argentina to have enough reasons to do so. From a country that had nothing to envy to the main powers of the world, we became a factory of misery, all to sustain the caste model, an apartheid regime where politicians steal the fruits of their labor from the good Argentines to share it among themselves, their friends and their clients. In short, a history that those of us who are here know well and it makes no sense to repeat today. This regime lasted for 100 years, in that framework professional politics developed. Hundreds and thousands of leaders trained in how to behave, how to negotiate, how to communicate, how to speak on camera, what to say and what not to say. And never forget to put their hand in people's pockets, which was the fundamental trait. But last year something curious happened: the political professionals got it all wrong. They had to throw the manual in the trash, because Argentines elected someone who did everything backwards from what their manual said. This is the reference to the \\"100 years of opression\\" Milei made at the CPAC. He's not talking about the \\"post WW2 liberal political consensus\\", instead, he's talking about the literal opposite: Argentina going in the opposite direction of the western political consensus.If you don't believe that the post-war political climate in Argentina was \\"oppresive\\", you're going to have a field day in Wikipedia reading about Juan Domingo Pern first-two presidencies, about the 3 military coups, about the proscription of political parties, about the Dirty War and so much more.Somehow, it doesn't surprises me that such a low-quality and false article comes from El Pas.

It's not something politicians saw coming, even Clinton is not blameless in it as he too also helped repeal key regulations that would have helped mitigate some of the housing crisis via repealing parts of glass-steagal act (1993 and again in 1999). As well as the commodities future modernization act in 2000. The only thing that really changed under bush 2's watch was additional curtailing of SEC, but honestly the guardrails were already sufficiently removed by Reagan, Bush 1 and **Clinton** that the financial bomb had already been completed before Bush 2 even took office, it was just a matter of waiting for it to explode.","title":"Democratic President Rebuilds Economy, Just In Time To Hand It Off To Trump  Again"},{"text":"That King &amp; Spalding 10 million a year beckons","title":"FBI Director Christopher Wray says he will resign before Trump takes Office"},{"text":"Should read, \\"Senior Senate Republican is planning to find out what kompromat they have on him\\"","title":"Senior Senate Republican Is Secretly Planning to Defy Trump | Incoming Majority Leader John Thune isnt bending the knee to Donald Trump just yet."},{"text":"I dunno, I think this is the wrong type of thing to bend the knee on.

I think you may be misunderstanding. The word 'coup' can refer to the overthrowing of a governing group. But it can also refer to a difficult or improbable success more generally. That's what I'm referring to. What foreign policy successes could Biden point to? right because we're the only player in that game...the....international game....The US is the sole global superpower. It gets to play the international game in Easy Mode. Yet, it's pretty difficult to identify meaningful wins for the US and not hard to identify disappointments.disagree. and many scholars do. most people foresee trump's tarrifs as being the real projected failure financially for this country.The research I've read suggests that the Inflation Reduction Act is unlikely to have had any meaningful impact on inflation at this time. I agree that Trump's tariffs are foolish. But so are the tariffs that Biden maintained or introduced. Tariffs are generally a bad idea. But I don't see how that relates to the Act.he was unfit. and he should have seen that earlier. but he did see it. he wasn't defenestrated. he begrudgingly let go. and because he put us in that position in the first place, we lost the election. simple as that.I suppose the histories have yet to be written, but it seemed to me like Joe Biden was one of the last politically conscious people in the country to notice that he wasn't fit to campaign. There was clearly plenty of pressure for him to go before he did. And you acknowledge that this failure of judgement or self-knowledge threw away the election. I don't see why you'd be okay with that.the man you see as our president today is one of far more integrity than the one before, or after him.I think Donald Trump must be a serious contender for the worst president in American history. At the very least, one of the worst in a century. Being better than Donald Trump isn't even the minimum we should expect of an American president. It's the minimum we should expect of any unremarkable, halfway decent person. And, as you've said, Joe Biden bears a non-trivial share of responsibility for delivering the country back into Trump's hands.

They can actually do the shopping around that doesn't happen in the US which is why even though there are options in the US, no one has the options all before them. Hence you can't just make Europe pay more, you have to make Americans pay less in order for European prices to rise slowly as prices normalize between continents. But the prices in Europe would rise if Americans paid less. The competition in Europe drives down prices, but the floor they can be driven down to depends on the seller's costs to cover. To illustrate, if I'm selling drug in EU &amp; US and my costs are $100M for my campaign (stupid low i know but roll w me), I'm going to try to get as much as I can. The fucked US landscape means I charge $80M here, and in EU I make $50M. Great, I made $130M. But now I get word that my competition sells for $90M in the US and $40M in EU. I won't get orders if I'm charging 50 and they're charging 40, so I lower my EU price to 39.99, and then I raise my US prices to $89M to compensate, and to my surprise, I'm still coming away with $129M while my competition is getting fewer orders. Tldr: The market forces that give power to the lowest bidder in Europe create incentive to pass costs to Americans and the fucked US landscape does little to stop them from doing this. But there's basically nothing worth doing to make American healthcare cheaper that makes European healthcare more expensive that isn't just making US healthcare cheaper. Making euros pay more doesn't make US costs lower unless to cap profitability. Ah shit they're going to do profitability caps for pharma/healthcare providers + export taxes (not directly.

It would increase the floor. Vouchers would lower the floor, but would increase the ceiling. They may improve outcomes for some children, but they will not ensure every child has access to education and will mean worse outcomes for others as funds are siphoned towards private schools.

His fortune is now almost double that of the worlds second richest man, Jeff Bezos, whose wealth is estimated at $244bn.?Mr Musk has seen his wealth surge after successfully backing Mr Trump in Novembers election. Shares in Tesla have rallied more than 60pc since then amid expectations that the President-elect will scrap red tape and regulation seen to be holding back Mr Musks business interests.The billionaire himself will have power to do just that after being appointed to run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which is tasked with slashing spending and bureaucracy in Government.?Tesla also could benefit if the new President axes tax credits for electric cars, something Mr Musk has repeatedly called for.I guess that there would be some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly, he said in July.Mr Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars bankrolling the campaigns of Mr Trump and other Republican candidates during the 2024 US elections. However, the recent sharp increase in the value of his investments means he has already more than made back this spending. The entrepreneurs net worth has risen by $155bn so far this year, according to Bloomberg.It marks a major turnaround from the start of this year when there were doubts about Mr Musks ability to lead so many businesses. Teslas share price had fallen from $407 in November 2022 to $147 in January amid worries that he had overcommitted himself.His $44bn (34.6bn)?[acquisition of Twitter](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2022/04/25/elon-musk-buys-twitter-deal-price-takeover-share-price/), now X, in 2022 led to mounting criticism of his behaviour and generated concerns that he is spreading himself too thinly.After the takeover, the social media platform was embroiled in controversy, with advertisers fleeing amid concern over online safety and controversial views expressed by Mr Musk.His on-paper wealth jumped on Wednesday after his rocket business, SpaceX, received a $350bn (275bn) valuation as investors and the company bought up shares controlled by employees. Mr Musk owns a 42pc stake in SpaceX.Earlier this month, a Delaware court refused to allow Tesla to?[award Mr Musk a huge $56bn (44bn) pay deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/02/musk-dealt-legal-defeat-in-battle-over-56bn-tesla-pay-deal/#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20has%20lost%20a,by%20the%20courts%20once%20before.), in what would be one of the biggest executive rewards in US history.Mr Musk had been due to receive the billions under a compensation package agreed in 2018.

Its pretty fascinating and is a great example of different countries implementing different solutions to the same fundamental problem, which is simply to provide affordable healthcare to everyone (universal healthcare). Single payer is just one of the ways its done, and is also called the National Health Insurance model. Thats where people buy into government-run insurance, which pays out private providers.Theres the Beveridge Model, where people pay taxes and in return get healthcare from the government. Care providers are typically owned and run by the government, and the government pays it all out.A more common approach is the Bismarck model, where everyone has insurance funded by payroll deductions, but the insurers are non-profits and have to cover everyone, and prices are heavily controlled. Healthcare is usually provided by private companies.In the US, Democrats tend to pretty widely believe in the concept of universal healthcare, but disagree on which system is the best considering where we are now. Id say the party position at the moment is that healthcare should be a fundamental right, the government should ensure everyone has affordable access, and the best way to get there is by building on the foundation of the ACA.Personally I think the ACA, with a government provided public option to help control costs, and forcing insurers to be a special kind of non-profit, is the best path for us to get to actual universal healthcare.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"School vouchers are (at least based on proposals I have seen) meant to allocate the education funding to whatever school the student attends. That isn't really the same as universal healthcare as proposed, as the latter involves a new tax and the \\"allocation\\" is for all expenses regardless of amount. If a private school costs $20k per year and the public school gets 12k/year, the voucher simply moves the 12k to the new school, and parents would be responsible for the remainder.Specifics aside, solutions aren't universal. It isn't inconsistent to want different methods for different issues.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Even CNN gets it wrong, calling it an \\"honor.\\"It's more like, who has been most in the news this year?Ayatollah Khomeini won in 1979.","title":"Trump to be named Times Person of the Year for second time"},{"text":"Was it down a flight of stairs or out a window?

If a school performs poorly, you can switch. The \\"customer\\" (parent) has real power through choice.  \\n  \\nBut healthcare? When you're having a heart attack, you can't shop around for the best-priced ER. If you develop cancer, you're basically stuck with whatever providers your insurance network allows. The free market simply doesn't work when consumers have zero leverage.  \\n  \\nI work in healthcare consulting and see this play out constantly. Even sophisticated clients with resources can't effectively \\"shop\\" for medical care. Prices are obscure, quality metrics are complex, and decisions often need to be made under extreme pressure.  \\n  \\nLook at Colorado's own healthcare marketplace - despite attempts at transparency, try comparing actual costs between hospitals for a basic procedure. It's nearly impossible.  \\n  \\nThis fundamental difference in consumer power explains why many people can support school choice while opposing private healthcare, or vice versa. It's not hypocrisy - it's recognizing that different services require different delivery models based on how people actually use them.  \\n  \\nThe parties aren't being inconsistent - they're responding to the reality that healthcare and education markets function completely differently.

These positions are perfectly consistent and reasonable once you factor in the structure of the existing institutions, the history of these institutions, and the need to compromise. And of course part of it is that even if the idea is good in theory, neither side trusts the intentions of their opponents. Finally there is a federal vs state issue here which is a big source of contention.Healthcare is already privatized. Education is public. Both sides are moving the institutions closer to their position and thus consistent with their ideology. It's just the starting positions are opposite and there are other practical, historical, and ideological factors at work. And as you pointed out, neither position necessarily represents the perfect ideal, which may represent the need to compromise or other practical considerations. Ultimately, Democrats are not socialists and Republicans are not libertarians...thus judging them strictly by these frameworks is futile.  If I had to pick a major distinction as to why these two institutions should not be considered a double standard, I think the big distinction is regulation. Healthcare providers are specialized, highly educated and strictly regulated. A single-payer healthcare system is at the federal level and can be reasonably sure that the patient is being treated by professional who follows established scientific methods...and they can control what services they pay for. Most importantly, it removes the private insurance industry middleman which is a huge source of the access and cost issue and doesn't have an equivalent analog in education at all. On the education side, the voucher system minimizes or removes federal oversight and risks limiting access to vulnerable communities. The providers under this system would be minimally regulated and thus the public can't ensure that the children are receiving suitable education. If providers were required to adhere to stricter curriculum standards, and access to schools in undeserved communities could be guaranteed... democrats might be more willing to consider such a proposal.This reminds me of the voter ID debate....democrats are not categorically opposed to a voter ID in theory, they are opposed to the ways that Republicans want to implement it.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"National crying doesnt work.

He also shat the bed on the withdrawal from Afghanistan.his decision?*not*?to run for reelection in 24This was not his decision. He did not step back gracefully. I'd like to remind you that he promised to be a one-term president when he ran in 2020. He was already old then, and he was shoved down the throats of anti-Trump voters due to a wild coordinated effort from his campaign and the DNC. He won primarily because of lingering nostalgia for and sympathy with Obama. He was forced out after he showed, time and again, that he was unfit for office.His breaking of that promise played no small role in Harris' loss. tbh I don't know if Kamala would've been the candidate if there were a normal nomination process, but if she were, at least she would've had more time to develop a real platform and gain more supporthe wont have the redemption arc Carter had with Habitat for HumanityRightfully so. He doesn't deserve a redemption arc.I'll grant you that the inflation reduction act &amp; build back better programs were good, but his crackdown on immigration, support of a genocide, and shooting his own party in the foot by stubbornly refusing to back down when it was called for and appropriate (not a mere 3-4 months before the election) give him a deserved spot in the presidential hall of shame.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"...loved in between the pages of a book but forgotten and disdained by your average Americans.that describes most presidents lol.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"There are lots of protections that are clearly in the Constitution that the Supreme Court has cut down to nothing.Birthright citizenship may be next.","title":"Birthright citizenship is a constitutional right that Trump cant revoke\\nIf youre born in America, youre an American, whether the president likes it or not."},{"text":"Right.

The problem with a voucher system is private institutions can deny people they don't want. So all of the smartest kids, most well off kids will be pumping money into these private institutions, meanwhile students who are more costly like students with disabilities, students with difficult home lives, students who cause disciplinary issues will be shunted off to public schools. Those public schools and specifically the teachers will be underfunded, and so essentially you're creating an institution to pump out the next bunch of criminals in society. The reason we have a nationalized education system, is because its a public good. Just like our society benefits from roads being free because all of us are able to engage in commerce, and making them all private would hurt the economy even if it would benefit the new private owner. The same applies for schools, we have public schools, because someone who's educated is less likely to commit crimes, less likely to engage in anti social behavior, is more productive. The more education the more those effects are felt. On the other hand if you underserve the populations most likely to cause problems for society in the future, you're going to be paying for that 10 fold in the future.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"All of this is true, but don't forget that Democrats also have a long history of rigging their own primaries, overruling voters through the use of super delegates, derogatorily calling a lot of men \\"Bernie Bros,\\" offering virtually nothing \\"left\\" to voters economically, focusing on gay and trans issues because you're not \\"left\\" in really any other way, forcing Kamala on us with no primary, turning to people like Hillary to guide the party when it was her horrid leadership that brought us Trump to begin with (pied piper strategy), beg for our money so they can give it to celebrities for endorsements, insult our intelligence by behaving as if we will vote the way Taylor Swift tells us to.

A school voucher system, while somewhat publicly funded, is ultimately a way of moving education further outside the public sphere and making it a more private system. Similarly, on healthcare, the Republicans want something like the current system, which is heavily privatized, based on a byzantine insurance structure. You ask whether the true agenda of Republicans is completely privatized education, but this isn't that important as a question. What's important is that a voucher system would be more privatized and profit driven than what we have now.We can note the same structure of thought for Democrats. A Medicare for all system, or universal healthcare, or even Obamacare's open marketplace, is a way of taking the often private healthcare system and making it more publicly run. The ACA wasn't a perfect way of going from point A to point B, as it is, as you note, a bit more like the school voucher system than it is like a fully public system, but it was a huge step up in public support. And, similarly, the Democrats want a strong public school system that is not about profit. So, I would say that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are particularly hypocritical. Republicans want to move both systems in a more private more profit driven direction, and Democrats want to move both systems in a more public less profit driven direction.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Republicans don't actually govern.

An earlier BBB could very well have resulted in the same sort of thing - with the GOP throwing a fit but then after a few months passed, they just pass chips anyway So it's basically preferences: Do you prefer a BBB with a smaller Climate Change component and no infrastructure Bill or CHIPS ACT, or do you prefer the Infrastructure Bill, CHIPS ACT, and a larger climate change Bill?No, because again, infrastructure came before BBB stuff anyway so either way you get the infrastructure. And the climate stuff was just a carry over from BBB anyway, so it doesn't make sense to assume that Manchin wouldn't have done a similar sized climate spending with an earlier BBB, since despite leftist seething and rage, he was always open to substantial climate actionIt's more like \\"infrastructure, climate spending, and the full 10 years social spending with more policies included, and you may also get chips too\\" vs \\"what we did get\\" Cause you can only do Budget Reconciliation once a year, so two bites at the apple and the Democrats already used one of them for their Covid recovery Bill.Once a *budget year*. Which speaks to another issue where the Dems fucked up massively, though this was more Biden than SchumerDems massively overspent on the early 2021 stimulus which added like 2 to 4 points to inflation at its peak and wasn't necessary given that the economy was already bouncing back and vaccines were already going out. And the GOP had 10 senators willing to pass a much smaller moderate compromise stimulus that was more appropriate for the estimated output gapIf Biden took the GOP compromise rather than using his first reconciliation opportunity for a shitty overstuffed deficit spending stimulus, he could have appeared bipartisan from the start and then immediately pivoted to doing BBB. And that would be a huge benefit for the Dems because Manchin's biggest sticking point for BBB topline spending was simply worries about spending too much and causing inflation. He came up with his $1.5t topline in the middle of 2021 when inflation had already spiked up to like 5% but early in 2021 inflation was still around 1 or 2%. It's hard to say how much more spending he'd allow with an earlier BBB negotiations but one could expect it to potentially be more, perhaps something like $2 to $3 trillion, which wouldn't allow Biden to get all of his initial $4.5t \\"human infrastructure\\" and \\"families plan\\" proposals to go through, but would allow considerably more to be done, and importantly (for getting liberals and progs onboard easier) would allow for the CTC expansion to be done largely in full while still doing other spending too (since the CTC expansion itself was roughly $1.5t)So Dems could have likely gotten more of their social spending goals done while getting a \\"good enough\\" and less inflationary stimulus, and still getting climate spending done. And that all could have been done in the first few months of 2021, leaving the rest of 2021 and 2022 open for the Dems to try and negotiate for bipartisan infrastructure and chips and the other stuff. They'd anger the GOP more with a bigger BBB but would also have appeared more bipartisan from the start by taking the gop stimulus offer, and maybe it breaks even or it just turns out that GOP opposition to infrastructure and chips wouldn't be that popular and would hurt them. And even in that scenario, that leaves the second reconciliation opportunity that started in October 2021 open to be used for other things - this allows Dems to potentially bundle chips and infrastructure and pass them as a reconciliation bill starting October 2021. Which could also make the GOP look worse for not supporting those bills and forcing the Dems to do it on their ownWith inflation being lower due to a smaller stimulus and with the GOP appearing more partisan, maybe that would have also been enough to get Dems the 1% more of the vote that they'd need in the 2022 elections to get 52 Senate seats and hold the house","title":"Democrats stick with Schumer as leader.

I'm for the former not the latter because of the differences between education and health care.  Vouchers for education diverts funding away from education for all. Public schools provide for difficult to educate students, those with special needs. Private and religious schools do not.  Vouchers exacerbate the gap between the rich and everyone else.Vouchers for health care, funded through income tax, doesn't have this effect. Rich and poor would all receive the same basic care. The wealthy would be paying their fair share and so this would reduce the gap providing better overall public health.  I oppose Medicare for all because Medicare is funded through wage taxes, a regressive method of taxation. Income tax is superior because it includes capital gains tax and so taxes workers and investors at the same rate. I'd like to see an expansion of ACA tax credit eligibility, something that outgoing administration has supported. I believe this is what the Democrats and the American people want.Possibly we could model education credits on ACA tax credits. If so they would be funded through income tax and given out to those with higher needs and lower income. The system would be progressive rather than regressive. The credits to a low-income family with high-needs students(autism, fragile health) would need to be way higher than the credits given to star students from high-income families. Another difference is that ACA tax credits are for insurance, not directly for health care. I hold these positions for pragmatic, not ideological reasons.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"This is a ridiculous statement.

You cant just repeat 2020 Biden talking points with barely any change and expect to let Trump dig his own grave. Trump, on the other hand, won because he is really good at stirring up emotions in low propensity voters. Lots of ordinary people are politically disengaged, but many, particularly young men, feel like feminism and political correctness have gone too far. Take somewhere that Trump outperformed republicans historically. Put yourself in the shoe of a young black man in Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee, or Atlanta. Youre a democrat because you believe in a large social safety net. Youve voted democrat your entire life. But in these past few years, youve noticed that all these democrats you elect talk a lot but never deliver, or only deliver something watered down by their corporate donors. Meanwhile, crime seems to be rising in your area, so you feel less safe. Democrats have tightened rules on policing, so it seems like theyre to blame. Then comes Trump. Trump promises to be your retribution. Hell take you back to when life was easier. Hell crack down on the crime in your neighborhood by deporting the illegal immigrants and stopping the fentanyl epidemic. Of course none of this is actually practical, but instead of voting for the same old thing, you vote for Trump hoping something he throws at the wall sticks. Democracy and abortion rights arent really at the front of your mind when you work day to day and paycheck to paycheck, and it seems like democrats are out of touch with your struggles. Trump feels like a natural choice. You see the potential in him for change, ANY change, something seemingly hopeless from the democrats youve voted for all your life. The above is not my view, its just me imagining a lifelong working class democrat who went for Trump this cycle. Its not identity politics, its that Trump openly doesnt play by political rules, and when political rules have led to the same old thing for so many people, those same people want to see someone who comes in and messes up the system.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Yea we know, dont let reddit fool you this place is an echo chamber and it was clear as day leading up to the election that Trump would win big time.

And on top of that, their job is to extract profit from the death and suffering they cause.\\"Brian Thompson was just a cog in a machine\\". This is true. His death doesn't in and of itself fix anything. In my eyes he was equally responsible for the suffering and death caused by this system as an SS officer working in a concentration camp was responsible for the holocaust. Both are just cogs in a machine who are easily replaced by someone else if they're killed, but both are actively participating in evil and I don't shed a tear for either of their deaths.\\"Brian Thompson's life was tragically taken; two young children (most likely teenagers as he was 50) have lost a father and to say you think someone deserves to die is too far.\\"Consider the many tens of thousands of people who die every year because of this system.

The 1st question posed to her was \\"What do you think would be the biggest specific difference between your Presidency and a Biden Presidency?\\" She said they were obviously 2 different people. They have a lot of shared experiences, for example the way they feel about their families and parents, but they're 2 different people and she will bring her own sensibilities to how she will lead. She then gave examples about how an issue SHE'S very focused on is home healthcare, and that SHE'S done a lot of work on and cares a lot about violence against women and children, SHE loves our small businesses and gave a backstory why, and so the influence of a personal experience will have its impact on a Presidency.The NEXT question, by the same journalist was \\"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden, DURING THE PAST 4 YEARS. And after saying there's not a thing that comes to mind in terms of...she went to explain those first few words by saying how she was a part of several key things including how they brought the price of insulin down for seniors, but continued that HER intention is to expand that to all Americans during her Presidency. Then she went on to list another accomplishment they had that was a shared priority.Having JUST answered the previous question posed to her, by the same journalist, there was no need for her to re-state everything else she just stated 2 minutes prior.Context matters. And, as I already said, claiming she was asked what would she do different than Biden and her answer was\\"not a thing comes to mind\\" like the media has repeatedly reported, is a misrepresentation. I watched her interview live. Her full interview. And your assembly of selected 3rd party transcripts and links and incorrect interpretations is a misrepresentation too.As for your suggestion she should have said \\"I would have signed my name on the check,\\"  I don't think she feels that way, and neither do I. So claiming that should have been her answer is ridiculous.All this, keeping in mind, that you interpret her saying that she and Biden have a shared experience of how they feel about their parents and families, as a BS answer that implies Biden doesn't love his family. ??

Barrack's first job was at the law firm of Herbert W. Kalmbach, President Richard Nixon's personal lawyer. In 1972, the firm sent him to Saudi Arabia, where he soon became the squash partner of a Saudi prince. He then worked in the kingdom for the Fluor Corporation, and worked for Saudi princes. Shortly after, he helped open diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Haiti, then ruled by Jean-Claude Duvalier, at the request of investor Lonnie Dunn.  \\n  \\n?

In 2010, Barrack bought $70 million of Jared Kushner's debt on 666 Fifth Avenue. Kushner later avoided bankruptcy when Barrack agreed to reduce his obligations after a request by Trump.  \\n  \\n? In 2017, Barrack sold a $70 million stake in One California Plaza to the Abu Dhabi crown prince's investment fund.

The question right before it was What do you think would be the biggest specific difference between your presidency and a Biden-cy  a Biden presidency?And she gave a BS answer that began with how they feel about their parents and family. Is the implication that Biden doesnt love his family? That Scranton Joe wasnt a blue collar guy? Okay.The circulated clip got traction because Sunny Hostin was asking for specific difference. She dodged it unconvincingly TWICE. Then they moved on to difference on Trump. Which was almost entirely focused on the storm approaching Florida. Transcript:Sunny Hostin 00:04:27-00:04:42 (14 sec)\\nAnd he said there wasnt a single thing that he did that you could not do. What do you think would be the biggest specific difference between your presidency and a Biden-cy  a Biden presidency?\\nKamala Harris 00:04:42-00:05:05 (24 sec)\\nWell, were obviously two different people, and we have a lot of shared life experiences. For example, the way we feel about our family and our parents and so on. But were also different people, and I will bring those sensibilities to  to how I lead. You know, for example, I know were going to talk today, but one of the issues that Im very focused on is what we do around home health care.\\nSunny Hostin 00:05:05-00:05:06 (1 sec)\\nYes.\\nJoy Behar 00:05:06-00:05:07 (1 sec)\\nOh, yeah.\\nKamala Harris 00:05:07-00:05:27 (20 sec)\\nI have done a lot of work as it relates to, sadly, but violence against women and children. I care a lot about that. I love our small businesses. My mother raised my sister and me predominantly, but we had what we called a second mother who lived two houses down who helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner.\\nKamala Harris 00:05:27-00:05:36 (9 sec)\\nI love our small businesses. And  and so, the influence of a personal experience will have its impact on the presidency.[Full interview clip.](https://rollcall.com/factbase/harris/transcript/kamala-harris-interview-the-view-abc-news-new-york-october-8-2024/)We dont have to lie to ourselves. The evidence is there. Kamala did a poor job in moments like this.It was clear the message of the campaign on WHY to vote for her and for Democrats was so terribly muddled, she wasnt exactly sure where to anchor her statements.A conflicting belief that Biden was a good President but also a bad President.
