Both parties had MILLIONS less votes than 2020, also not being COVID harmed the dems because a loss of anxiety around the current world affairs 2) Dems shifted right, and thats not a winning strategy. People want populism and the DNC doesnt. They dont want to appeal to people who are feeling insecure and tired of establishment norms. The Republicans are still establishment fascist, but they dont campaign like it. They appeal in messaging while in reality squeezing them for everything. 3) The Democrats havent used new media outreach anywhere near as effectively. Trump went on every avenue he could while Kamala just instead said lets campaign with Cheney and have Clinton tell Palestine in MI that they deserve to see their families die. They ran a legacy campaign, appealed to the right, and lost hard. 4) Muskfuckery. Elon Musk is an idiot, but he surrounds himself with smart and evil people. America PAC went on a hard media misinformation campaign, leverage social media, and potentially broke a lot of laws to make this happen so Musk could crash the economy and get out of his debt.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n?

Harris ran a great campaign but the voters chose THAT.They chose putting people in camps and mass deportations. They chose televised executions of politicians. That's what nearly 50 percent of the voting public wants.No Bernie Sanders, the blame doesn't fall on Kamala Harris. It falls directly on the voting public who embraced the hatred and the racism that Donald Trump and the Republican Party spoon fed them. This is who we are as a country. We aren't better than this. We ARE this and it's time to accept it.Harris, like Hillary Clinton before her, begged and pleaded with people to listen and not enough did. So did plenty of us.

Tariffs are one tool in a long list of economic changes intended for the country.On their own, tariffs can help or hurt, depending on the context. Using the electronics example of computer parts (many of which are built overseas), simply slapping on a tariff overnight will increase the cost to manufacturers and leave them to decide how much, if any, of that tariff will be passed on to the consumer. That can make things more painful for consumers, no question.Then you look at EVs. Chinese EVs are moving heavily into Europe, and they've taken a quick hold over their own market in China. They are poised to undercut vehicles sold in America right now, and to such a degree that they would probably make investment in EVs for other businesses a massive loss. We've seen Trump call for massive tariffs on Chinese EVs to combat this, which can protect automakers invested heavily into American production, along with their employees.In that first example, part of the counter is that we've already seen work towards increasing silicon fabrication in the US. It's possible that businesses making those moves (like TSMC, the leading chip maker for advanced silicon nodes) get smaller or delayed tariffs that are based on their continued investment in shifting to American production. While that can still come with higher production costs for those companies (relative to cheap labor in SE Asia), the creation of high-skill, high-paying jobs should also mean more talent and money in the American economy.Throw on things like Trump's suggestion to use tariffs as a replacement for income tax, and there's a lot going on that has to be implemented, balanced, and seen as a whole.","title":"Trump-Vance Need To Fix The Debt Bomb Biden-Harris Created"},{"text":"Yeah... its everything and everyones fault, not the candidate.You know 2016 was supposed to be a lesson, not a challenge...","title":"How Trump won - and how Harris lost - the 2024 election"},{"text":"This type of behaviour effectively creates the echo chambers we always talk about.

A huge tax cut was dumping tons of money into an economy that didn't need any stimulation. So we piled on national debt when not in a recession overheating the economy. Trump took an already strong economy and made it \\"stronger\\" so short term it was good. Now Printing money and dumping it into the economy has long term effects. If the money supply increases (money out of thin air which is what our national debt is) the value of all money will be driven down long term. So Tax cuts (more so for the rich) plus printing checks for every American (equal for the poor) created massive inflation as soon as the economy restarted fully. Of course supply issues also added to it, companies had to guess how much to increase prices to pay for input costs and they guessed aggressively as any company would just in case. So Trump got Obamas economy, he juiced it.. Think what you will if that was ok or not. But running up the national debt with tax cuts and then joining in with every other country in the developed world to hand out stimulus... caused inflation for the US and the world at large. So just as you say i shouldn't blame trump for a pandemic, how can people blame biden for inflation? US inflation was the one of the best controlled in the developed world he deserves credit for saving the economy and stopping a recession.","title":"Why Trump, a Liar, Seems Honest to His Supporters"},{"text":"Im already seeing Trump voters freak out about stuff.

The Republicans have really turned into a Christian Evangelical party.  A lot of working class people (especially in the south and mid-west) come from a Christian upbringing (speaking from a working class upbringing in an Roman Catholic household).  A lot of these homes work seriously hard just to scrape by and when they see \\"their money going to others\\" they get upset and are \\"that's MY money.\\"  So a lot of social plans that Democrats put together take money from taxes and put it to social programs that benefit groups such as immigrants, homeless, etc (groups that a lot of these working class people are not a part of).  Then you add in businesses like Planned Parenthood which \\"promote the killing of babies\\" and \\"un-Christian principles\\" of contraptions for birth control.  All the while, the price of \\"essential goods\\" only get higher (double in some areas) during what they perceive to be \\"the President's economy\\" and well, that's that.  Those voters will say, \\"Trump will reduce the burden on corporations which will allow them to lower their prices, which means things will be cheaper.  Then when Trump shuts down all those stupid social programs, our taxes will come down since we are no longer funding them.\\"A lot of these middle and working class families, don't benefit from a proper civics class either, so a lot have developed an idea that somehow the president has all this power (which was not true and hopefully will continue to not be true) that everything that happens is tied to the president.  They don't understand that local elections are actually usually more important than Federal (again until this election).Sadly Democrats just haven't been able to find a consistent way to talk to the working and middle class since probably the 1980s.

America has voted to changing our policies towards Europe - and it is high time.It is high time that the US renegotiate its role in the world. Weve carried the burden for a long time. And while there have been a number of advantages, we are sitting on $35T in debt - the brokest country there has ever been. In the meantime, Europe has lived, secured by our guns as they spend their money on butter.The current state has lasted now for almost 80 years. How long should it last? Whether you agree or disagree with Trump (and how he frames the conversation), the conversation should be one thats on the table and it hasnt been. And if you want to get to the REAL reason why European countries have been against Trump, it comes down to what it almost always comes down to. Money.The Europeans will have to start making their own hard choices because the US gravy train is coming to an end. And - Ive written this a bunch - Russia is 1/4 the population and 1/10th the GDP of the EU. If the EU cant defend themselves against Russia, sorry. Thats on them.I personally believe that we will remain in NATO, but with responsibilities limited to naval superiority, nuclear deterrence, electronic/satellite intelligence, and weapon system development. There is no reason for us to guarantee security for European land wars. They have the money and the men to do that. If they dont have the will, thats their problem.And yes, the feelings will be hurt and feathers will be ruffled. But we are still the largest economy in the world, and even if China eventually overtakes us there, European countries will still want access to our markets. We are not going to be frozen out of the global conversation.IMO it is past time we moved in this direction. Our foreign policy establishment- which has fucked things up around the world for decades - should be gutted and we should start being a more humble in our foreign affairs. A part of the current Russian- Ukraine mess can be traced back to the arrogance of our foreign policy establishment that pursued a policy of global hegemony following the fall of the wall and dissolution of the USSR. Once Russia got its act back together to a significant degree the bill came due and its being paid for by Ukraine.","title":"Think you know how bad Trump unleashed will be?

This would mean that any fundamental contradiction in human life can be worked out within the context of modern liberalism and would not need an alternative political-economic structure to be resolved. Now that the end of history is reached, Fukuyama believes that international relations would be primarily concerned with economic matters and no longer with politics or strategy, thus reducing the chances of a large scale international violent conflict.\\"...\\"The essay centers around the idea that now that its two most important competitors, fascism and communism, have been defeated, there should no longer be any serious competition for liberal democracy and the market economy.\\"...All I can say is, wow, just wow.

I also think that parents and moderates may simply be voting similarly based on the GenZ experience that they witnessed for their own children.Ive read through a lot of the comments in this thread and believe that we have just hit the inflection point of pushing the equality pendulum too far. I say this as a 0.1% who has had the luxury of voting for things like global warming, womens reproductive rights, and ethics.  As I read these comments and reflect on them, I see their point and cannot fault them for it.  Im currently reflecting on the process of college applications. For large state schools, the most common essay asked had to do with explaining how you are diverse and what diversity you will bring to the university. Also true for private schools.This question is the results of decades of social progress, which is now explicit.  Yet that question contains a very strong reverse implicit bias, or a micro aggression towards white males.  These are the terms used in DEI, but in reverse. They make white males feel guilty about out how/what they communicate with others.In regards to the essay, being a white male in an upper class neighborhood means you have to dig deep to put something on there that you think the university wants to hear. Growing up playing organized sports going to the lake on the weekend, traveling to see national parks, or other countries is probably not what an admissions committee is looking for, or thats what the implicit bias is.Sure I understand that some demographics may not have access to the same resources and education, but it doesnt change the fact that the Gen Z kids had nothing to do with all of that.  Yet indirectly, though essay prompts like above, they have grown up feeling that they are part of the problem.  in fact, the word Incel is just another thing that will reinforce their feelings.  This sentiment is also expanding outside of GenZ and white males.  There was a huge article written by NYT recentyl about DEI at the University of Michigan and how it actually has had some reverse effects. Specifically resentment that it needed to be explicitly acknowledged discussed and upfront in every corner of the university from undergraduate to super advanced scientific fields.  The point being that those fields probably dont really need/want to spend much time or energy talking about social programs.  Also, resentment towards minorities simply as a result of this additional work.So for huge swaths of the country outside of the coasts, this has been their experience. I think that if some of this   progress didnt exist, many of them wouldve voted for a female of mixed descent.  Suggesting that people are racist, misogynist or uneducated as a result of the election certainly does nothing to bring them back to the middle. Its a simple reinforcement of why they voted the way they did. I didnt understand it before. But I think I do now.","title":"Men of Gen Z backed Donald Trump, fueling his political comeback, polls say"},{"text":"Never liked Musk.

Clayton Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Mosbacher Senior Fellow in Global Democracy at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.\\\\]Since the beginning of this historic year of elections worldwide, it was apparent that none would be more important in shaping global democratic prospects than the presidential contest in the United States. Across a broad span of countries and partisan leanings, people who value freedom, democracy, and the rule of lawincluding leaders of government, opposition parties, civic activists, businesspersons, journalists, or ordinary citizenswatched with growing trepidation as political polarization intensified in the United States and Donald Trump drew closer to retaking the White House. With Trumps decisive victory in the election, these admirers of the long arc of the United States democratic journey, if not necessarily all its global policies, now fear what might come next for the country and, by extension, democracies across the world.The rise of autocratic regimes across the world over the last decade and a half has put democrats on high alert. In the last year, successful efforts to beat back antidemocratic movements and governments have provided some indication that this protracted [democratic recession](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/how-end-democratic-recession-autocracy-larry-diamond) could be reversed. But Trumps victory has dealt a blow to these hopes.?His triumph in the Electoral College and the popular vote leaves democratic friends and allies of the United States wondering: Will a Trump presidency demand more burden-sharing from them, or even abandon them altogether?

That some people are just happier when they are allowed to transition. That some teens just have better mental health outcomes if they are permitted to go through the opposite puberty than the one they'd undergo without intervention. People always accuse us of \\"denying reality\\" but the reality the right is constantly denying is the fact that a certain portion of our population would simply live better, healthier, more fulfilling lives if 1. We are allowed to transition, and 2. This is treated as acceptable and social norms around names and pronouns change to normalize it. Society would not be harmed by any of this. You are not harmed when you respect a trans person's name and pronouns. You are not harmed when trans people get to transition as teenagers and are happier for it. Cis women are generally not harmed by the presence of trans women in sports (this is a bit more complicated, as hormone level DO impact athletic performance, but most research suggests that a trans woman who went through a female puberty is on-par with a cis woman performance-wise, with some research suggesting they actually perform WORSE than most cis women).This entire narrative about trans people being a huge social problem is bullshit.

Being anti illegal immigration is part of being pro worker. Being for slow, controlled, and limited immigration in general is also the pro worker stance.

Forcing US factory workers to compete with foreign laborers earning $0.04/hr means the US workers lose their jobs. Environmental policies that make things like steel mills impossible to run in the USA cost people their jobs. The worst pat is that shutting US steel mills down actively makes climate change worse. This goes for nearly all climate change initiatives. Telling working class people that their livelihood is a sacrifice you are willing to make is a losing position. This is just a few of the most pertinent issues imho but the current narratives around social issues are a problem as well.The crazy part is that Democrats don't even need to switch sides on these issues.

Companies did merge with the state, the way it was done was essentially nationalization, with some autonomy granted by the party because when these industries were taken over, they were given to card carrying party members. The distinction between this and direct nationalization is incredibly thin. Hitler also created a massive union for workers.The thing about Nazism and by extension Fascism, is that they are collectivist and totalitarian, and *expansionist*. Therefore, and the left hates hearing this, its strongly on the left. There arent many things that actually separate communism and fascism other than how they practically applied their regimes, and what their commune was. For Hitler it was the German race, for Stalin it was the working class, and for Mussolini it was the Italian people. They all favored totalitarian collectivism and were all aggressively expansionist. Communism, unlike Italy and Germany, still believed in an international revolution. Many people forget that even before Hitler and Mussolini became relevant the communists had formed Comintern that advocated for an international revolution (and was succeeded by Cominform).Add to all of this that, as another commenter said, Hitler hated the Jews because he said that they were international capitalists. The reason that communists and the burgeoning Nazi part kept fighting in the lead up to Hitler becoming chancellor, was *not* because they were diametrically opposed in ideology. They disagreed on how to apply socialism (so example 1,304,678 of the left eating itself)So you have 3 ideologies that are totalitarian, collectivist, and believed in aggressive expansion. This is far from what the right would be propping up. What frustrates me the most is that historians (I am guessing that they are somewhat lefty in their own right) defend the notion that fascism is on the right which logically just does not make any sense. Unless we are talking about strictly leftist forms of government where national socialism and Italian fascism are slightly to the right of that, then sure they are on the right.","title":"Liberals dont actually know what fascist means"},{"text":"Yes but...everyone wants to move their asses now when all this would've been nice BEFORE the election even took place.","title":"Biden to push through anti-Trump plans as he vows to make last days in office count"},{"text":"\\"You about to see Twitter vs Truth Social like two trailer park folks fighting over a bologna sandwich.\\"\\nTweet i read this morning.","title":"Elon Musk in a Trump administration?

But the pendulum swings back their way the very next election. To break this cycle it's going to require the party to do something different.

It's going to become the norm as long as we have leaders that couldn't get elected in a normal election but win only because they're not the incumbent. Hillary was seen as a 3rd Obama term. Trump was denied a 2nd term. Harris was seen as a 2nd Biden term.

The impact of tariffs on the U.S. depends on how they are structured and what goods or services are targeted, but generally, the effects are as follows: 1. **Higher Prices for Consumers:**\\n   - When the U.S. imposes tariffs on imported goods, the cost of these goods typically rises. U.S. businesses importing these goods pass on the additional costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can lead to inflation, particularly for products that rely heavily on imports (e.g., electronics, clothing, or food). 2. **Reduced Choices for Consumers:**\\n   - Tariffs can limit the variety of products available in the market. If tariffs make foreign goods too expensive or unavailable, U.S. consumers may have fewer options, which could lower their overall welfare. 3. **Impact on U.S. Exporters:**\\n   - If the U.S. imposes tariffs, other countries may retaliate by imposing their own tariffs on U.S. exports. This can reduce demand for U.S. goods abroad, harming U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and other exporters. Industries that rely on foreign markets can see their sales drop. 4. **Job Losses in Some Sectors:**\\n   - While certain U.S. industries might benefit from protectionist tariffs (e.g., steel and aluminum), industries that rely on imported materials or export markets can suffer. For example, U.S. companies that need imported components to produce finished goods may face higher production costs and potential job cuts. 5. **Distortion of Markets:**\\n   - Tariffs can distort market dynamics by favoring domestic producers over more efficient foreign producers. This can lead to inefficiencies in the economy, as industries protected by tariffs may not have the same incentives to innovate or improve productivity. 6. **Political and Trade Relations:**\\n   - Imposing tariffs can strain trade relations with other countries, potentially leading to trade wars. This can result in a cycle of escalating tariffs that negatively impacts global trade and economic growth, which in turn can harm the U.S. economy. 7. **Increased Government Revenue:**\\n   - On the flip side, tariffs generate revenue for the U.S. government. This additional income can be used to fund various programs, but it does not offset the economic damage caused by higher prices or retaliatory tariffs from other nations. 8. **Short-Term Protection for Certain Industries:**\\n   - Tariffs can provide temporary protection for U.S. industries facing competition from foreign imports, giving them time to adjust and become more competitive. However, this protection is often not sustainable in the long run if it leads to inefficiency or higher costs for U.S. consumers and businesses. In Summary:\\nWhile tariffs can help protect certain U.S. industries, they often come at the cost of higher prices for consumers, strained trade relationships, and reduced global market access for U.S. exporters. The overall economic impact depends on the specifics of the tariffs, the industries involved, and how other countries respond.","title":"Trump favors huge new tariffs.

Even in basic event preview articles, most students can't write the article without injecting something like, \\"So make sure and attend for a great time!\\" I have to remind them over and over: You're not taking a stand on this or trying to get people to attend; you're just reporting the details about something that's happening and if people want to attend, whatever. They also have a really difficult time understanding how something can be true but also biased, which is a huge issue these days especially with political reporting. You can write the headline \\"Congress passes bill to cut government spending\\" or \\"Republicans cut funds for poor people\\" and technically both might be true, but one's telling you what happened objectively and one's got an obvious slant to it adding a value judgement to the mix.","title":"College \\"education\\" equating to higher intelligence is one of the greatest conspiracies of modern times"},{"text":"[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U\\\\_OI\\\\_hq8Bjk&amp;t=70s&amp;pp=ygUgcGVvcGxlIGxlYXZpbmcgdHJ1bXAgcmFsbHkgZWFybHk%3D](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U_OI_hq8Bjk&amp;t=70s&amp;pp=ygUgcGVvcGxlIGxlYXZpbmcgdHJ1bXAgcmFsbHkgZWFybHk%3D)","title":"Question about election."},{"text":"Make no mistake, what's about to happen to the deep state isn't revenge.

This period marked a transformation rather than a definitive end to the Roman legacy. Aristocrats under this empire often intermarried across borders, reinforcing power structures across generations.In contrast, the American identity has developed without noble heritagewealthy but lacking ties to aristocracy. Donald Trump exemplifies this; powerful yet crude, he doesnt stand apart as an outlier. Rather, he reflects a deeper aspect of American society. Trump isnt merely a symptom; hes a mirror to the nation.By drawing on links to historical and cultural contexts, this explanation offers additional insights into how America allows Russian influence.

They think themselves independent of the government but by having the most assets their status in society is the most dependent on the government defending the rule of law and the current socioeconomic order. All they had to do was pay taxes on their income and they would forever remain the country's elite.

The steady ratcheting of more and more lies from the Republican party since the \\"Southern Strategy\\" started in the mid 1960's, pushed into overdrive during the 1990's with Newt Gingrich.  The major media (even those not Fox News) has mostly gone along with it, and the Democratic Party has also relatively gone along with it, making at best denials acting like it's \\"Politics As Usual\\" rather than heavily eroding the Public Trust.  The result of which is that we have no ... I guess I'd say *immunity* as a body politic against wild political lies, and Trump stepped into that opportunity in 2015.To be very clear, the Democratic Party is also at fault for coordinated political lies, like continuously saying \\"National Healthcare is a Terrible Idea\\", and that we need such a large military budget.  This all helped to put us into this situation.  EDIT:  Adding that another example of this was in not correctly blaming corporations for the fact that greater than 50% of the \\"inflation burst\\" that happened during/after COVID was due to record corporate profits, NOT in more traditional inflationary reasons.  They then turned the screws on the general populace with increased interest rates, actively trying to decrease employment.  Maddening.It doesn't help that the voter public has for a long time had a kind of feeling that they were being duped and held down, leading to higher and higher frustration.  \\"Low Information Voters\\" in particular are frankly easily duped by it.So, along comes Trump I think on some level Trump is the \\"burn it down\\" option in their minds.  Sadly they don't realize that he and his oligarch friends are just going to loot the country during the ensuing chaos and the general US populace will just suffer *far* *more* during it and after than before.We're left in a sad state here and I'm not sure what can be done because so many of our media institutions and political bodies are caught in the quagmire of not being willing to shake things up and be honest about where we are and why.","title":"Why Trump, a Liar, Seems Honest to His Supporters"},{"text":"If someone talked about my wife the way Trump talked about Ted Cruz's, I'd dedicate a lot of time and effort to ruin them.

Biden was not well liked, he was simply more liked than Trump in 2020. Biden gave Harris a glass cliff to fall into. Biden made his campaign about himself and positioned himself as the only answer to Trump instead of actually uplifting the rest of the DNC like he said he would. Biden fumbled the bag in maybe the most iconic and tragic debate performances in history. Something that shouldve been a layup became an absolute failure- and that reflects in the result we see today. Biden was also stubborn and reinforced that he was the only one strong enough to beat Trump in a moment when it was important to be open and excited about possibilities. He lied about not running again. Biden ran on fear, status quo, and opposition. The Whig party would have been proud.The DNC was too focused on hushing descent and not listening to peoples base desires and needs. There was not a real robust primary held to hammer in on messaging that would activate the base for elections down ballot and to consider the future of the party. There was almost no time spent highlighting the rising stars within the party, except for when Biden was under question. The DNC does not understand populism, and its exactly why Clinton lost, why Bernie is still an icon, and why Trump remains a dark force within this country. The active voting population right now listened to their paychecks from yesterday, and apparently nothing else.Harris had to choose between distinguishing her own platform or taking up Bidens bones, and picked somewhere in between that didnt capture people like she would have hoped. Her campaign turned into Republican light, and that confused a lot of voters on the left and didnt impress the ones on the right. All of them are to be blamed for this  and its severely disappointing.","title":"Biden gets blamed by Harris allies for the vice presidents resounding loss to Trump"},{"text":"Lmao where the hell is Ann Selzer today?

He has shown no signs of altering course this time around, stating throughout his campaign an intent to use military force against the enemy from within, to fire any military officer associated with the chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan after he left office in 2021, and to reverse what he and his supporters have denounced as woke decisions by the Biden administration that include?[renaming several Army bases](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/24/confederate-base-renaming/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)?that had honored Confederates.The greatest danger the military faces under a second Trump presidency is a rapid erosion of its professionalism, which would undermine its status and respect from the American people, said Richard Kohn, a professor and military historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Generational wealth in a country that respected the rule of law and defended their property meant that previously no matter who was in charge they and their family would keep their generational wealth. They could afford to not have personal relationships with the country's leaders and still keep that wealth. They could even freely criticize that leadership if they wanted to.In a country that doesn't respect the rule of law at the hint of disloyalty or disagreement they can be arrested, have their wealth seized, or killed. At one point in time Mikhail Khodorkovsky was one of the richest men in the world but then he criticized Putin. Jack Ma is one of the richest men in the world but went missing for a notable amount of time after he criticized the CCP. Billionaires were included in the Saudi elite that Mohammed bin Salman held under house arrest and at gun point they had to disclose and give up wealth stashed elsewhere in the world. I don't know if Fethullah Gulen was ever a billionaire but he used his influence and media empire to help Erdogan consolidate power to move Turkey towards authoritarianism and then eventually Erdogan saw Gullen as a potential threat so Gullen had to live decades of his life as an exile in the US until he died. The billionaires in the US did not learn from any of this and seemingly do not understand that it is the government that uses its armed forces, police, and courts to protect their private wealth. They think themselves independent of the government but by having the most assets they are the most dependent on the government defending the rule of law and the current socioeconomic order. All they had to do was pay taxes on their income and they would forever remain the country's elite. Instead to hoard even more wealth they pushed the country toward authoritarianism and now they will need to constantly kiss Trump's ring and the ring of who ever comes after him in order to be allowed to remain as the country's elite. I also don't think Trump will like any of them being richer than him.One of the biggest core beliefs of a conservative is supposed to be their desire to keep their current socioeconomic order exactly as is. Supporting coups and abandoning the rule of law should have been seen as incredibly anti-conservative, but over time they all convinced themselves that conservatism simply means supporting lower and lower taxes with no concern for stability and no fear that an autocratic would ever turn his unlimited power on them.","title":"Trump campaign quietly distances itself from RFK Jr after new vaccine safety comments"},{"text":"Your argument makes sense if it was the actual democrats people were voting against.

Which is why I said: There are far better approaches to our \\"immigration problem\\" than this. I personally favor ones that allow them a clear and legal path to citizenship so they can be paid a livable wage and contribute more to the economy via taxes and spending. In addition to the valuable labor they provide society.It is clear American's won't do this work until conditions and pay improve. The solution should be to improve those conditions and allow for currently illegal immigrants that are willing to work those jobs to get fair pay and safe conditions. One way to improve those conditions? Hire MORE people. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-of-labour-fallacy.aspHowever, I would encourage you to look into the Lump of Labour Fallacy.

I just think creating conditions of mass human suffering on the tax payer's dime simply because \\"they're illegal\\" without measuring the actual impact society is not the approach. We should be supporting workers, of all types, and ripping this shit out of the hands of corporations that just fuck everyone over.

That or they will simply 13th Amendment these people and force them into slavery after sending billions to private contractors.Look at Alabama HB56: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_HB_56https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/06/25/cruel-legacy-alabama-anti-immigrant-law-remembered Part of the law which was very racist and convenient was that house workers were excluded from violating HB 56, he said. The rich could still have their housekeepers, they could keep their landscapers and their yard workers.They literally carved out a provision that would allow their personal services to remain unimpacted. and not only that, Americans just didn't want the jobs: https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna44981872 The jobs fucking suck. Amazon has a high turnover rate and that's hard indoor warehouse work with above minimum wage pay. Working fields is a completely different level of misery. Complaining about the economic impact is why we get bank bailouts and corporate tax cuts while everyone else sees wages stagnant and benefits cut.I'm complaining about mass human suffering that also comes with a hefty price tag. You seem too fixated on the price part when my initial comment was simply to point out that this is going to just be another government wealth transfer to the rich program.","title":"Trump allies, private sector quietly prepare for mass detention of immigrants"},{"text":"Oh give me a break. First of all, considering women are majority of domestic abusers it is not a gender based issue that happens only to them. No definition was changed. Family court is overwhelming pro woman virtually everywhere. All the way to that point that even abusive mothers have more rights than good fathers. Currently Florida is one of the few states that is equal, so you are seriously complaining about equality. You literally just said word for word you would take your kids from their father because only you matter. Not him, not even them. And considering you refuse to elaborate further I seriously doubt he was abusive. Not to mention he never would have won partial custody of the kids if he was to them. To you is a different story. But do you know how many men every year are not allowed to get help while they are being abused by their wives thanks to feminists? Hundreds. You know what?

I wasnt excited about voting red this year, and agonized over whether to vote at all, but protecting states sovereignty, promoting national defense, overhauling the FDA, and stimulating American manufacturing to decrease foreign trade reliance are important to me. I dont consider myself pro-Trump at all.
