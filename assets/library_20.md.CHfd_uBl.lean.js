All around the world, incumbents have lost elections over this.  So both Biden and Harris were running as underdogs, and nobody - nobody really cared about the other issues in the election.  Not the slide toward fascism, not Ukraine, not climate change, not reproductive rights, or 'fiscal responsibility' or gun-safety or the lopsided SCOTUS.. nothing.  Harris ran on those issues, and did not connect with enough people to win.  It was a real eye-opener.  Meanwhile, Trump was describing the country as being flooded by millions of immigrants.  It didn't matter what the real #'s were., or that they were blocking the legislation to fix things.  That lie was repeated a thousand times, and it worked.  It's a primal fear, and it changed voting patterns.I remember thinking in 2020 that I liked Harris, but she couldn't ever win the general, so giving her the VP spot might be a mistake.

American Empire is on the decline anyway, and our further loss of power and global influence is assured following this election but that doesn't mean that Russia will control us. They are only interested in preventing our interference into their affairs and a return to multipolarity. This is not the first cold war, they are not seeking to gain the upper hand in an ideological struggle like the USSR was. They in fact are of a very similar ideology to the republican party which is why they get along so well. Russia is a very conservative country right now that serves as a bit of a role model for how the far right Republicans want the state to enforce Christian Nationalism.The issue here is not that the US will be a puppet state so much as the republican party has been convinced to ally with Russia as a more ideologically aligned long term partner or at least frequent collaborator. Lets be honest, the US only got involved in Ukraine because we wanted to contain Russia. We really don't have that much to gain from our involvement there in terms of core strategic interests. That part of the world does not matter to us that much from a strategic point of view. The democratic party still wants to maintain complete hegemony over world affairs but we just aren't that powerful anymore and we have significant competition from new or resurgent powers. Our relationship to Saudi Arabia and Turkey is kinda similar at this point as on paper we supposedly support countries that \\"love freedom\\" but realistically that means whichever despots have oil or are willing to fight our proxy wars. Honorable mention goes to the European Imperialist powers (UK and France) who assist us in destabilizing developing countries so our corporations can extract their natural resources for cheap. I agree that a withdrawal of support from Ukraine is quite likely and will lead to very predictable results. That being said, there was never that much conviction in the support that congress was willing to give to Ukraine. I agree that this stuff is all quite concerning but I don't think the independence of the US is at stake. I do think that there is a great deal of internal destabilization on the horizon. I really wonder what the consequences of a military purge will be and I am not sure how the military will respond to that. Personally i find it quite disturbing and I am sure many soldiers and officers who are not trump fanatics also find this quite disturbing. At the same time I think it will galvanize people against the impending fascist takeover of the country, whether or not that is enough to prevent us from bringing our brutal habit of violence home to our own people in force remains to be seen. Personally I find a civil war  unlikely but that's only because the far right is in a much more organized position with regards to being armed and ready to inflict violence on their political opponents. Liberals are still clinging to the idea that we can \\"save our democracy\\" by voting. Clearly the democrats were not up to the task which means people need to take matters into their own hands with regards to protecting and growing our rights.  I'll put it this way, I gave up faith in electoral politics a long time ago but I still have hope for the future, provided people are willing to actually take a stand when push comes to shove. Fleeing the country or cowering in fear is not how we deal with fascists.","title":"CMV: The U.S. will no longer be an independent nation by the end of this decade, and this is a sober view."},{"text":"shocker","title":"Trump Is Running His Transition Team on Secret Money"},{"text":"Thats a strangely specific, low-profile example.

For instance, the way government uses platforms like social media to suppress or manipulate information, censoring dissenting views and limiting coverage of whistleblower reports on surveillance programs. Legacy news downplaying or even completely omitting these stories, while academia and big tech companies align to influence public opinion to speak over others' being censored. These coordinated efforts work against informing the public to make informed decisions.X may also be part of it, but the focus from this end is on the bigger picture, like the way systemic forces shape what were told is true.

Theres a reason that no other country on earth that became a democracy after us implemented our flavor of it. From a political science standpoint, its not an effective form of government. We need to have switched to RCV or similar and moved our legislature to be MMP and put term limits on all non-elected positions (the courts) and implemented actual enforceable ethics laws. Nobody likes any of the candidates which creates apathy. Other countries dont have this problem. It is a US problem. The people arent educated enough about systems to make those kinds of reforms. Its too meta. Those reforms need to be pushed by experts.","title":"Biden must Trump-proof US democracy, activists say: There is a sense of urgency"},{"text":"Remember when Reagans tax reform resulted in tax increases by eliminating deductions?

Have you read the summary on Trump as a fascist? Much of what you describe here, but the fact that he is where he is currently, and despite your damning list above, is his ability to con. And through the internet, social media, sound bites, he has conned the lower informed voters who live on fear.https://archive.ph/2024.11.09-143222/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/dispatches/what-does-it-mean-that-donald-trump-is-a-fascistThe one thing that is not arbitrary about the choice of an enemy is that it must exploit vulnerabilities. The Trump ads projected a fantasy of Kamala Harris allowing millions of sex-changed foreigners to take jobs from Americans. This touches, all at once, on gender, economic, and sexual vulnerability. We are unprotected and impoverished and will be replaced by something alien. And this is all orchestrated by a shadowy enemy in the backgroundin this case, a woman of color who knows how to laugh.What amplifies Trumps presence more than any other medium is the Internet. He is a natural with its quirky rhythms. And its algorithms make the rest of us open to exactly his sort of talky fascism. On social media, we are drawn away from people of complexity and toward blunt stereotypes. We ourselves are categorized, and are then fed content that brings out, in Vclav Havels term, our most probable states. The Internet does not just spread specific conspiracy theories; it primes our minds for them.

Why certain groupings have lower literacy rates and IQs is not important. I'd say it is, are these differences inherent or the result of discrimination? Assuming IQ is even a useful number in the first place, if IQ is going to be affected by societal factors, like access to education and nutrition, then using IQ as a standard for who gets to make political decisions that involve how education and nutrition are distributed risks creating a feedback loop. If some people are too illiterate to vote that their children deserve to be taught to read, then their children are going to grow up without a say too and you're entrenching the problem. Unless you think people who benefit from discrimination are going to vote to end a system they benefit from. And yes you're right. But the pendulum has swung to the opposite end, with diverse ethnicities being favoured in colleges. The correct balance is in the center - you get a job or college position based on merit.The trouble is then how you measure merit and again whether merit is inherent or circumstantial. For example are the students who score 80% on a test inherently better students than those who score 60%? Or do we want to account for the circumstances people come from?Say we have two students who scored 80% and 60% on our entrance exam and we want to decide who is more likely to be a successful students in college? Now 80% is an achievement and that's impressive. But if we have the context that the other student achieved 60% while going through chemo therapy it's worth factoring that into our assessment of who's going to work harder. Part of the reason programs like affirmative action are valuable is because no every student is going to have the same access to help in schools so even students with equal ability (if ability as a quantity exists) are going to preform differently given their circumstances. A single set of tests can't capture the range of factors that go into how well some students do. Not to mention not all circumstances are permanent, someone who did okay within an underfunded school system could do more than okay when given access to more resources at a prestigious college and so we can't judge their potential just on their performance before now. There's also the question of how we correct for systems that historically have been discriminatory, just saying 'from now we will be 100% fair' doesn't necessarily work when the consequences of the unfair system are still present. You're also assuming that selection is entirely about finding the best individuals, vs forming the best group. It's not necessarily true that just getting the best people will inherently make the best group. A plurality of perspectives could be more valuable. A college with academics with a range of backgrounds and experiences is potentially better than one that just has the very best professors. Historic discrimination can mean that the very best professors have noticeable gaps in their experience and understanding. Especially if we want to make changes going forward to address underserved communities, having people from those communities in positions of power to express their views and address issues that kept people from their communities out.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"The US was winning in Vietnam in so far as it was holding territory and had very positive KD ratios.

Its because it benefits somebody. Why did Trump tell everyone immigrants were coming to eat their pets? Because this gets people to vote based on an emotional response. Does this vote benefit the voters? I would argue, no. They are voting for something that isnt real, and has been presented to them to elicit an emotional response. Who does it benefit? To me, it benefits Trump, who gets more votes now. Its hard to actually punish politicians for lying. If they get fined, the party will pay it, and they dont even have to issue an apology or something. If they get called out during an interview, theyll say its an unfair question, double down on the falsehood, and cast doubt on the interviewer. Its next to impossible to remove someone from an election because they blatantly lied about a lot of stuff. What if, however, a politician directly hurt their voting power by telling lies? To me that would actually encourage them to tell the truth more often. Telling lies has no consequence right now and actually a lot of benefits as it gets people to vote for you, and thats all that matters towards getting elected. However, if those votes were weighed down based on how poorly informed they were, it would encourage them to tell the truth more. Thus, even lower education people would be in a better spot because they would be lied to less.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"Honestly, consider Warren buffet did the same thing,  it's plausible.

They made that kind of spending out to be a bad thing and the media was on board.It was a horrible idea in practice. It is the job of the House Representative at the Federal Level to bring home the bacon. Because that Federal Money goes towards jobs. As a result we got more than a decade of less spending in things like infrastructure and just basic growth.But what it did in practice that was beneficial to the Republicans as the time was make running on rhetoric the only thing a congressperson would and could run on. If they couldn't go home and campaign on the Federal Funding they brought into their district then all they had to run in was rhetoric.That made the small scale big. It paved the way for your MTG's and Boeberts that can't and won't run on anything they did legislatively and just on national rhetoric.The rhetoric that you keep saying is something that Republicans are very good at crafting.

There's the obvious question of what kind of content would be in the test? And who is responsible for creating that content? Who is responsible for appointing the people in charge of the test? It's impossible to even get to the the conception stage without it being the result of the current democratic system - the very system you say is so inherently broken and untrustworthy this drastic overhaul is necessary. Despite what you claim to believe, you are no more entitled to voice your democratic than anyone else just because you claim to be more politically savvy or knowledge. People have every right to vote for whoever they want for whatever reason they choose. If a voter carea deeply about a single, important issue they are no less entitled to their section than the terminally online who consume nothing but political content.Another huge issue is the discontent and division it would cause. The self-appointed smartest people in the room love sneering at those they deem uneducated, especially the working class. Fact is, many of these people contribute far more to society than your average inner city office drone, tenured academic, career activist, etc. Plenty of people are too busy with life to obsess over political issues. They're too busy growing your food and building your apartments and maintaining your infrastructure - they're the lifeblood of your country and you want to deny them a say in who gets to run things? I don't think that will pan out the way you want it to.The idea is also pointless..Do you honestly believe a more informed electorate would change anything. You'd never vote for Trump even if he came out with the most progressive agenda ever seen. And the other side fans wouldn't vote for your candidate either. Americans don't vote on policy, if anything you vote in spite of policy. You're right that your system is broken. It's farcical. Instead of campaigning and engaging, informing and educating the electorate, it's just a dumb contest to see who can fire up more of their own diehard supporters, with a side pot of a few hundred thousand people in a handful of states.I would advocate the exact opposite of your idea. Compulsory voting isn't without it's flaws, but the pros outweigh the cons. You claim your biggest concern is uninformed voters? I say can you blame them? Nobody engages with them. Their votes are taken for granted and counted before they're cast. Compulsory voting forces the candidates to be better. They actually need to sell themselves and their plans to the electorate. They need to EARN peoples vote and their trust. Candidate spend months actually campaigning. They face public scrutiny at every turn and elections are better for it. You guys just obsess over who can throw the bigger party or invite the biggest celebrity. Your election campaigns are a travelling circus, nothing more..You think you're more entitled to have your say than your fellow citizen who has little interest in tbaf farce you take so seriously? That your say should be worth more and the system is designed to fail? Why weren't these concerns aired over the last few years? Weren't the Democrats supposed to be saving democracy? Did they drop the ball? Or do you all actually just fucking hate democracy when it works as designed? Would anyone be pushing ludicrous ideas voter tests if your candidate somehow managed to win? Of course not.Every proponent of this concept needs to change their mind. It's just bad on every level. A change of attitude wouldn't go astray either. None of you are better than anyone else. It's true your current system is ridiculous and is rightly mocked around the world for the unserious trainwrexk that it is. But your solution is even worse, and is the complete opposite of what you all should be seriously considering.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":" Its not just democrats.For real.

Federal Workers are doing their jobs for cheaper than the market rate \\n2. Services burdened by layoffs/ furloughs will have a security and efficiency impact of critical services \\n3. Unemployment rate will go up\\n4. Unforeseen disturbances in the economy \\n5. Regulations will be ignored leading to public health and safety issues\\n6. A more lean government workforce  could ultimately means A less effective presidential administration. \\n7. Private industries might not be able to cover the gap if the federal workforce is tampered with. The United States of America has A large federal workforce because it is necessary for our way of life. Federal workers serve EVERYONE for the greater good of our country. Unlike private industries there's no profit for these institutions and they're the \\" BONES\\" of our society. With out them innovation and efficiency is only obtainable if it's profitable.

Like who the current two candidates are.

What happens when the side you disagree with inevitably gets into power, and the questions start becoming \\"is social security bad for the economy?\\" or \\"does human life begin at conception?\\".I agree with you that voting should be more restrictive. But I don't see how this proposal works, logistically or practically without making the US less democratic when the questions become biased and subjective.The problem with widespread suffrage in general is that the population isn't knowledgeable enough to know what they're voting for as a whole. If you had symptoms of a medical problem, you wouldn't give a list of conditions to 100 people at random and get them to vote to diagnose you, regardless of their previous medical knowledge. So why do we do it with governance?And you can't decide who votes based on \\"education level\\" because a lot of degrees are irrelevant to politics. The average Reddit user on this sub knows more than the graphic design graduate - regardless of whether the average Reddit user is formally educated or not.Historically, the most common metric to decide this, in dominant democracies, was male land owners (over 21 years old in the case of the US). Rome also had a similar system. Athens was somewhat similar, with male citizens who completed military service being given voting rights. Whether this is a better system or not, who knows.

And sometimes big things like the Republican's 9/11 or the Democrats' Covid.\\n* The debt grows to be ENORMOUS while they ALL line their pockets at our expense, burdening future generations with mountains of debt.So in the end, all this bickering of Democrats vs. Republicans? It's ridiculous, because those parties are both on the same team. The team that's *against us*. But as a whole we are too dumb to see it because we're too busy fighting with each other over stupid things.And that's why they keep us distracted and fighting.","title":"Trump doesn't eat fast food"},{"text":"Because it's painfully obvious","title":"Why is Trump appointing all Israel supporters to top cabinet positions?"},{"text":"Paywall-free link: https://archive.is/aMVbv","title":"NCs next governor: Republicans are already taking away power from Democrat Josh Stein"},{"text":"No worries - just remember to turn the lights off when you leave your airbases and other spheres youve got your fingers stuck in around the UK.

So you can imagine how Republicans (conservatives) felt about that, and swing state voters who were independents, they NEVER bought into all of this January 6th \\"insurrection\\", GOP \\"threat to Democracy\\", rhetoric, they thought it was bullshit all along, and in the end Trump actually benefited from a sympathy vote from people who felt he and his supporters had been treated unfairly.That's why I voted for Trump too.

Imagine there is a knowledge test... But it's written by the upcoming administration. Clearly, an important piece of basic knowledge in a Christian nation is the admission that Christ is Lord, right? Nobody who denies that basic fact should vote. Clearly that's not a great test, but if there's a test to vote, people in power will try to use that to suit their will.My second issue is that, try as you might, I'm not sure there's a reasonable thing to expect. Are you measuring IQ? That tests pattern recognition, which I don't think is worth denying someone participation in democracy over missing. Fact-checking? Same, people have harmless misconceptions all the time, I can't imagine any test question that would be helpful without taking away voices that should be heard. Literacy? Emotional intelligence? Minimum education? It's a nice enough idea, but ultimately you'd probably end up silencing valid voices unfairly, which is a big problem for democracy. I think this point is a lot more subtle, but a small unfairness over hundreds of millions of people ends up being pretty big.And finally, let's say you made the perfect test - I don't think you'd exclude a large enough number of people to make a substantial difference, _especially_ in our two party climate. 1/100 people being excluded feels _way_ too high but still wouldn't have been enough to change the popular vote of the most recent election.

West Virginia used to vote ALL DEMOCRATIC, it was full of unionized coal workers, etc, and now it's ALL REPUBLICANS.  Same people, different party, so it isn't like they all just turned into a bunch of racists.And it is because of that kind of rhetoric and \\"othering\\" and dehumanization of rural and working class people, that they are reacting.It was literally the Democratic Party, starting with things like Obama's \\"God and guns\\" rhetoric, and Clinton's \\"deplorable\\" rhetoric, etc, that created Trump and made him what he is to the GOP.What you perceive as an attack, is actually a counter-attack.

Stop coddling themStop coddling Dem leadershipNobody has been able to explain this to me besides vibes- What was so bad about Kamala Harris as a candidate?You say that as if vibes means nothing. Howard Dean's campaign went down the drain after he made a weird noise on stage. Everyone knows that every politician lies out of their ass, so sometimes vibes are all there is to go off of.What was so bad? She failed to reach voters and convince them to vote for her. She was unpopular before being coronated. She was complicit in the gaslighting of the American people about the mental status of Biden. Biden was unpopular and she refused to distance herself from Biden, other than saying that she would have a republican in her cabinet while touring with Liz Cheney. She failed abysmally to give her base any hope on the Gaza situation, which demoralized a big chunk of her base and kept many young people from coming out to vote. I'll speak to all the specific examples of her unpopularity that I listed before:Lowest VP approval rating:Considering that the Vice President only has a single functional role (To break Senate ties) this is a statistic I openly laugh atIt is completely foolish to ignore that when considering running that person for President. It is a gauge of how the public viewed her, which was not good.The VP function other than a tie breaker is to do some public relations work via speeches and interviews. Every appearance she made as vice president was marred by awful interviews, circular talking that made no sense, or weird laughs that were off-putting. They kind of hid her after a while.Dropping out before Iowa:\\nOh, she ran a bad campaign then. Here's the thing: This year she inhereited Joe's much better run campaign, so that's not an issue this time around. It wasn't just running a bad campaign in 2020, she got wrecked on the debate stage. She also has some pretty wild stances back then that she immediately abandoned when she took the candidacy this time around.If the campaign she inherited was that well run, then it's even more of evidence that she was unelectable.In regards to the Bernie part:Economic populism didn't matter this year.While that is a bit debatable, it wasn't my point at all. My point was her dropping out that early had nothing to do with the Dem establishment response to Bernie. That's how unpopular she was WITH DEMOCRATS in the 2020 primaries. Most of the other candidates that dropped out did so at the behest of party leadership because Bernie was poised to win if they didn't consolidate around Biden. I've seen many people try to throw Harris in with that group, but no she fizzled out long before that happened.With regards to polling:\\nI'll try to dig some of it up tomorrow, but it was mostly from reporting that I heard from places like breaking points. It's pretty difficult to Google search for specific polls from early in the cycle but I will do my best. The 400 electoral vote defeat for Biden was talked about on pod save America and they were referring to rumors that it was internal polling, here are tons of articles on it.","title":"Trumps Republican Party is increasingly winning union voters.

They backed off of it in the media and tried to distance Trump from it but they're still very much working on this actively.","title":"How to Stop Trump Before He Starts"},{"text":"'Member when they hated DEI because they claimed it put unqualified people in positions they didn't deserve ....","title":"Trump Picks Fox News Medical Contributor To Be Surgeon General"},{"text":"The law only applies to you plebs.","title":"Trump sentencing in Stormy Daniels hush money case indefinitely delayed by NYC Judge Juan Merchan"},{"text":"Nah.

They even shouted anti-Christian remarks in parliament. Then, in the mid-1990s, they noticed a gap on the political right, so Orbn began steering Fidesz in that direction, though their anti-Russian stance remained intact. Until 2009, Orbn was one of Russias loudest critics in all of Europe.  But in 2009, when it became clear that Orbn and his party were going to win the 2010 election, Putin requested a meeting with him. After that meeting, the critical rhetoric against Russia disappeared.  In 2010, Orbn won the election and, with the help of EU and state funds, quickly turned his family and friends into billionaires. These billionaires acquired the two largest online news portals, the biggest TV channel, all regional daily newspapers, 90% of radio stations, and all billboard advertising spaces in the country. Through these channels, they broadcast Russian propaganda.  Today, Orbn is Putins biggest defender in all of Europe. In just 30 years, Fidesz transformed from an anti-Russian liberal party into a far-right, populist, pro-Russian party.","title":"I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

Sweeping tax cuts signed into law by President George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2012, creating an expensive fiscal cliff. The Obama White House made the same argument as Mr. Crapo: The cost of legislation should be measured against current policy, which assumed that the Bush tax cuts would continue, not current law, under which the cuts would expire. The thinking allowed the Obama White House to claim that the deal it made to extend many of the Bush tax cuts reduced the deficit by more than $700 billion over 10 years. The budget office, using the current law base line, said it actually increased deficits by roughly $4 trillion over that time frame.IIUC, there is a notable difference between extending the other party's bad policy so that you don't lose the election due to raising taxes versus extending your own party's bad policy.

Direct action isnt one tactic, however, its a broad term that encompasses pretty much any activity in which the people use their own power and agency to achieve their goals in a direct (sorry) fashion. [I know Wikipedia isnt a terrific academic source but the article does a good job summarizing.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action)What Im saying is that the tactic youre choosing here of going out to march and chant for an afternoon is ineffective. Without direct action, nothing will come of the march. At best it serves no practical purpose for furthering your cause and makes the participants feel better because, hey, at least they got off the couch and made their voices heard! (Heard by who? Probably not the powerful folks youre trying to stand against) At worst its actually counterproductive. Time, money, and resources are wasted on marches that dont work instead of on direct action tactics that do (boycotts, sit-ins, and strikes are just some examples of direct action that are nonviolent and generally more palatable to the public). The marchers believe in the power of asking their rulers to stop enriching themselves, but not TOO loudly, or TOO noticeably, or TOO disruptively. And as a result it stops them from doing anything about their situation.I dunno, I guess my point is that unless youre willing to threaten their power and livelihoods, to do damage to their power structures directly, to force them to act differently, then why would they ever change their ways? They dont give a shit if youre in the streets chanting except that theyre glad youre too complacent to actually end their monopoly on power and drag THEM into the streets. Vladimir Putins greatest fear is getting the old Gaddafi (dragged out of hiding, beaten bloody, sodomized with a bayonet, then shot in the head.

There's a lot of things that simply aren't possible for him to do alone, or even with all the people he's appointing.  Many, many, MANY things are stuck behind Congressional actions.  There's also many legal things that would require bills to be written and passed or the Supreme Court to intervene and go against well established law and precedence, and this could force impeachment proceedings through Congress for Justices who start to play with hard bias and against major laws.  (people think that's already happened, but it has not)The biggest fear is Congress will let Trump do what he wants, back what he wants, and start writing and pushing bills to allow the abilities he wants.  I'm hoping this doesn't happen, but we'll have to see how far the Republican party collectively (not just extremist outliers) goes with allowing Trump to be Trump.A saving grace is for the entirety of his first term, he did not get to do anything.  Much of what happened was of the desire of the Republican party.  My guess is it will be the same.

He's continuously exploited his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system and avoid being incriminated. In January 2023, a federal judge fined Trump and his attorney nearly $1 million, characterizing him as \\"a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries\\"Trump's M.O. has always been to seek legal vengeance against his adversaries. He has even threatened to jail or \\"go after\\" his political opponents, his naysayers in the media, journalists, congressmen, civil servants, \\"radical leftists,\\" anyone who he believes participated in stealing the 2020 election from him, and the list goes on. Then there's this nugget: In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) commissioned a report to highlight Trump's excess litigation, entitled \\"Donald J. Trump is a Libel Bully but also a Libel Loser\\", but initially declined to publish it fearing being sued by TrumpMore on Trump's legal history:Trump's been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which included financial crimes, tax and state law violations, corrupt business practices and defamation suits. Trump has lied about his wealth for decades, and he threatens to sue anyone who dares to speculate about his actual net worth.He is a serial fraud, con artist, adulterer and cheater. He cheats on his wives, on his taxes, he cheats at golf and he commits financial fraud whenever the opportunity presents itself. He's even been indicted for attempting to defraud the United States!He's not only failed at or bankrupted practically every business venture he's been involved in, but he's consistently screwed over small businesses, colleagues, patrons, employees, and financial partners who have had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor.His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire, an example of the luck and privilege that he's exploited all his life.Before The Apprentice, Trump had squandered his riches, and if it weren't for the luck of this reality TV show opportunity being dropped in his lap at just the right moment, he'd be known far and wide as the failure that he was always meant to be.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime. .Don't forget the time Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposesAdditionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation.. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Don  Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlement required the Trump Foundation to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.Then there's Trump University...In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term \\"university\\" to describe his grifting scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, \\"misleading and even illegal.\\"Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.There was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the \\"university\\" public. Trump University was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs. Trump was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.Other cases involve his legal battles with Casino patrons, multi-million dollar real estate disputes, countless defamation lawsuits and over 100 tax disputes as well.But apparently, *he's* the most persecuted man in American history. Maybe the world, I dunno...He conflates accountability with persecution because he's spent his entire life exploiting his own wealth and privilege to evade being held responsible for his crimes and misconduct.On more than one occasion, Trump has evaded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a Supreme Court that he packed with kowtowing loyalists. Trump has also been accused of obstructing justice on over a dozen occasions.And despite all of this, Trump and his supporters claim that it's Democrats who have \\"weaponized the justice system\\" against Trump.Mr. Law and Order everybody! The convicted felon himself!Don't forget the indictments related to his utterly negligent and most likely nefarious mishandling of classified documents after deceiving and misleading the National Archives and the DOJ for over a year.Yes, Mr. Law and Order who has been accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women, including one of his own ex wives.Mr Law and Order who advocated for shooting peaceful demonstrators so he could take a photo op in front of a churchAnd despite his incessant complaining that he's being \\"persecuted\\" by the justice system, he has vowed to use the power of the DOJ to seek vengeance against his political adversaries.Mr Law and Order who has indicated that he will disregard the constitution to achieve his goals, that he will become dictator on \\"day one.\\"Mr. Law and Order who has decided that he's entitled to broad immunities and unitary executive powers that will dismantle our system of checks and balances..Trump also uses Law &amp; Order rhetoric on the campaign trail to promote racist dog whistles in the same way conservatives like George Wallace, William Rehnquist Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan did back in the 60's and 70s. Mr. Law and Order who was sued by the justice department for violating the fair housing act and discriminating against black renters. And after having to settle the case, he declared it a victory.Mr. Law and Order who has obstructed justice at every opportunity, who is a serial grifter and cheater, who cheats on his wives, on his taxes, even at golf!Because Mr. Law and Order never loses... Life is a zero sum game and he is always the winner, no matter what. Which is precisely why every election is \\"rigged,\\" every failure is someone else's responsibility, every investigation is a \\"witch hunt,\\" every criticism is \\"fake news,\\" every indictment is another effort, organized by the deep state democrats, to \\"weaponize the justice system against him\\", which is why every well prepared journalist or interviewer is \\"cruel\\" and \\"terrible at their job\\" for not asking him softball questions, which is why every former staff member or colleague who speaks out against him is \\"disgruntled,\\" and the list goes on and on.The party of \\"personal responsibility\\" can't seem to take responsibility for a goddamn thing.","title":"Trump sentencing in Stormy Daniels hush money case indefinitely delayed by NYC Judge Juan Merchan"},{"text":"If destroying them from the inside doesn't work, he will make the people hate the agencies so much that it will fall from the outside.","title":"Jon Stewart Knows Why Trump Is Picking All the Worst People for His Cabinet"},{"text":"Its open source until its not, buying it would be pointless, so was paying 44$billion for a company that never turned profit.","title":"The Right Has a Bluesky Problem"},{"text":"I hope we can one day send Elon to Mars... involuntarily.","title":"Donald Trump ally warns Keir Starmer the US will crush the UK economy if it helps arrest Benjamin Netanyahu"},{"text":"just wait till the rest of his clown car crashes the economy on them too..","title":"'Booo!'

This same polling also indicated that there were gettable votes from disaffected Republicans. The lets save democracy messaging with Cheney was aimed at those Republican voters. It was never a move to the right by the campaign in general. It drives me crazy that people dont understand that a campaign is supposed to do what Harris did to appeal to different constituencies.

We do get some numbers in the article. There were over 223,000 migrants/asylum seekers (illegal aliens), with city taxpayers paying $352 per night for them. There are a ton of factors to this (for example, if there was ever a peak of 223,000 concurrent illegal aliens all at once, or if the numbers fluctuated over time), but can say that, basic napkin math, city taxpayers would have been paying $78,496,000 per night. That's about the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, for comparison's sake (at 80-100 million).NYC's annual budget in 2024 was $107 billion. That number of illegal aliens, sustained for a year, would have come out to about $29 billion, 27% of the city's budget. That, based on a breakdown of NYC's budget in 2023, would have been the second largest expenditure, behind only elementary and secondary education at 34% of the budget. Even halving it (which I think is fairer anyway) would still make it third place, inbetween social services at 13% and public safety at 17%. The Federal Government did very little to help with these expenses. In summation, if you're wondering why Mayor Adams is so pro-Trump, or why the city got closer to flipping to the GOP than it had in decades, this is probably the biggest reason why.

No good deed goes unpunished.I asked chatGPT: What happened to the politicians who voted for the ACA (Obamacare)?The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 had significant political repercussions for its supporters. In the subsequent midterm elections, many Democratic lawmakers who voted for the ACA faced electoral challenges:* **House of Representatives:** In the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats lost 63 seats, resulting in a shift of control to the Republicans. This substantial loss was partly attributed to backlash against the ACA.*    **Senate:** Democrats experienced a net loss of six seats in the Senate during the same election cycle, reducing their majority. These outcomes suggest that a significant number of legislators who supported the ACA were not reelected in 2010. The ACA's unpopularity at the time contributed to these electoral defeats. However, it's important to note that public opinion on the ACA has evolved over time, with favorability increasing in subsequent years. --According to a report from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Democratic Party has lost a net total of 13 Governorships and 816 state legislative seats since President Obama entered office, the most of any president since Dwight Eisenhower.https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/under-obama-democrats-suffer-largest-loss-in-power-since-eisenhower/","title":"I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

Trump fans say they are 'disheartened' after he gives 'slap in the face to MAGA'"},{"text":"Outside of politics as well too, from what I've seen, you can curate your feed to be about things you really like in Bluesky. I have zero politics on my feed in Bluesky. Most of my feed are pretty much cooking recipes, nature, and memes. Absolutely no politics bleed into my Bluesky feed because I explicitly do not like it on there, and early on, I trained my feed to focus on my interests only. There really isn't anything else bleeding into my Bluesky feed unlike on Twitter. Twitter, I tried really hard to keep it on the same things I have on Bluesky, but a *LOT* of politics bleeds into the feed (Like if I had 10 tweets on my screen, 7 of them are related to US politics, the remaining 3 are the stuff I'm interested in), even when I go out of my way to avoid all politics on Twitter.It feels like Twitter is forcing people to get involved in politics and forcefeeding it down the users' throats. Those people who are trying to avoid it then get angry because they're being forced to deal with it and then you have people on there point and say, \\"See? They can't handle opposing viewpoints because they're snowflakes\\". No, I don't like seeing politics on my feed at all because I have to deal with it to some extent during work. Why do I want to think about work when I'm on my off-time at home in my boxers and a tanktop on? It's just adding stress to my already stressful life, and I'd rather have my time off be based on things that I enjoy rather than having my off-time remind me of work when I'm off work. If I want to get in politics on my off time, I'd play Democracy on Steam or something.It's not be being a \\"snowflake\\", it's me wanting to use my off time to relax. This is why I left Twitter for Bluesky. I left it because it has been actively and constantly reminding me of work when I'm off the clock for the weekend, even when I spent a good chunk of my time training my feed to not show politics. On my Bluesky feed, I'm mainly seeing landscape photos that people take, recipes that I want to try out, and silly memes. I like that a lot more.","title":"Democrats flee X for Bluesky amid Musk-Trump alliance"},{"text":"Not Thomas Massie.","title":"Lindsey Graham Tells Allies Were Gonna Crush Your Economy if They Arrest Netanyahu for War Crimes"},{"text":"Bonus- big boobs.

We urge the Senate to confirm all of our highly qualified nominees. Holds on our nominees undermine our military readiness.Then this lol:Mullin, 47, is a former plumber and cage fighter who entered Congress in 2013 and won a Senate seat in 2022. Famously pugnacious, in September 2021 he stirred controversy by trying to enter Afghanistan on a private mission to rescue US citizens and Afghans who worked with the US, as Taliban forces advanced.Im not Rambo, Mullin was moved to say.

Everyone else is having to make sacrifices like not having kids to be able to afford a home, or just living in poverty, renting, getting by but always a health event, injury, or car accident away from being wiped out. Its 100% the fault of deregulation, and tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, and loopholes for everyone who doesnt need them.Why can a billionaire write off their private jet, its hangar and operations costs, etc. when people cant write off the rent for their shitty apartment? Why is there a write off for taking clients out to dinner and for expensive golf games, when poor people cant write off the food they feed their kids?
