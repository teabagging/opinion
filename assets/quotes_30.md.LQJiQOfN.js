You correctly recognize that you and I have more differences in our outlook than similarities, but there is nothing I respect more online than a civil and cogent thesis laid out the way you did. I genuinely appreciate it.  Heck, I actually *enjoyed* it.I'm not sure it makes sense to respond point by point; I tend to put people to sleep, so I'll just start replying to a few points and we'll see how it goes.*I think society is slowly rejecting the idea that there are inherent roles men and women are meant to play and that there are fundamental biological differences between them that are expressed in their respective personalities.*I agree society is currently rejecting this. I think it remains to be seen how far it will go. I think to some degree it is wonderful that the old sex roles have been relaxed. This may sound contradictory to my overall approach, but I obviously recognize that on the masculine-feminine continuum, not all men are at the same place, and that indeed, some women may be on the masculine side and some men may be on the feminine side. I think that's always been true, at least as long as we've had civilization. I just think that people on the \\"other side\\" of the continuum from what you'd expect are *very* small numbers. For example, I don't think you'd get an even distribution of women across the masculine-feminine continuum. If that was so, then the terms \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" would never have been given labels associated with the sexes.? Regardless, people should be able to be comfortable where they are, and if someones personality does not fit their natural place on the F-M continuum, I have no problem with them acting in the manner with which they are comfortable.? My only caveat would be that *most* people (regardless of their profession on the matter) do actually have sex-based stereotypical expectations, and that it is incumbent upon that atypical person to accept the feelings of the great majority of people, *more* than it is incumbent upon that majority to accept him or her.? Hopefully the person in question will be able to find other people who do accept them as they are (and this must be easier today than it was just 50 years ago).So heres another continuum:? The traditional F-M roles on one end, and on the other end the indistinguishable F-M roles so many left-wing iconoclasts believe is the ideal.? I think that the traditional roles were almost certainly too rigid and deserved to be relaxed, because people come in a range.? But I think the extreme postmodernist view, which can literally be held to deny that there are any behavioral differences between the sexes that are based in biology, that *all* differences are social constructs, is just plain idiocy.  While we may be moving in that direction along this second continuum, we will never get there.? Society will in the end reject this critique because they will find that yes, on average, women are more nurturing and, on average, men are more aggressive (which is not necessarily a bad thing).? No telling, of course, where well end up, but my guess is that, a century from now, the argument that men and women only act differently because of the way they have been raised will be laughed at (much as Marxs dialectical materialism gets an eye roll by most reasonable people today) and we will be closer to my traditional end of the continuum, as we teach women that they *truly* can be anything they want, including roles that fit into feminine archetypes, which is something that is rejected by some radicals.*I hope that our past ideal of man as protector and woman as nurturer stays permanently dead and gone. It just doesn't align with the way human beings work fundamentally.*Like I think Ive implied, I dont think this will happen, because there is a significant biological component to these differences.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

There is a common belief that women are more generous, and care more about equality, than men. Also, many people believe that women tend to be underconfident. None of these beliefs are true, according to a couple of recent research papers.One paper  Men are from Mars, and Women Too focuses on self-confidence. The paper starts by surveying hundreds of experts, finding that 77% of them think that women are underconfident whereas men are overconfident. Next they do a comprehensive survey of all experimental tests of self-confidence that have been published in the past twenty years. The key result: 72% of all studies find that *both* women and men are overconfident. Only 18% of published studies support the commonly held view.The other paper considers social preferences. Using data from 15 studies and 8,979 individuals the paper finds that women are believed to be more generous and more equality-oriented than men. [...] Yet this believed gender gap is largely inaccurate. The authors?find little to no evidence for gender differences in behavior or attitudes relating to social preferences.So, women and men are much more similar than commonly thought. Sure, people differ in their social preferences and self-confidence, and actually differences can be quite substantially. But gender is not predictive of such differences.Why is this important to know? Why is it important to correct these misperceptions about women and men?One reason is that misperceptions may affect selection and sorting in the labor market, in politics, and in society at large, resulting in a misallocation of talents and traits.For instance, if people think that to be a good leader one needs to have sufficient self-confidence, they may be biased against women, as they mistakenly believe that women tend to be underconfident.Likewise, people may be biased against men when selecting for positions that require generosity and care, mistakenly thinking that these qualities are mainly or only present among women.Read the full papers below (all open access!):Oriana Bandiera, Nidhi Parekh, Barbara Petrongolo, and Michelle Rao (2022), [Men are from Mars, and Women Too: A Bayesian Meta-analysis of Overconfidence Experiments, Economica](https://lnkd.in/e6_dMRyG):Christine Exley, Oliver Hauser, Molly Moore, and John-Henry Pezzuto (2024), [Believed Gender Differences in Social Preferences, Quarterly Journal of Economics, forthcoming](https://lnkd.in/ecZCS2er): https://lnkd.in/ecZCS2erAnd see also:Esther-Mirjam Sent and Irene van Staveren (2019), [A Feminist Review of Behavioral Economic Research on Gender Differences, Feminist Economics](https://lnkd.in/ejJ8S6iX): https://lnkd.in/ejJ8S6iX","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

That's because I brought up the sacred cow - our education system really is broken and no one wants to talk about that.This has been an issue for me for the longest time, partly because i know quite a bit about Science and math education in our public schools. I know how unbelievably unequal the schools are and the huge - unbridgeable gaps - between those who get to go to the good schools and those who don't.I taught classes in University where the gap between incoming students in my own science field (Physics) was so large that I had to start grading on a scale of 125%, just so that the B students will not be crestfallen that a 76% was all they got (which was fair). As for the C students - a normal grading curve would put them in the range of 60 to 75%. What happened was that there was a gap of well over 10% in the curve, meaning an 85% will make you an A-. Yet I'd have usually 2-3 students who'd score in the 95 percentile. This huge gap between those who actually can handle the subject (and this was Physics 101, ie, pretty basic - the kind I studied in High School in my home country) boiled down to insufficient fluency with basic Algebra, more than say, handling Physics concepts.This gap, which has a few way at the top (who are as capable as any student anywhere) and the next cohort of the so-called B's (who are in truth, C's) is something that happens across the country, per what I hear. This is what's reflected in the abjectly dismal scores American students got in the latest int'l TIMMS study.We DO have a problem in this country with the STEM subjects and on this Musk is right. We simply don't produce enough capable engineers ( who'd have had to take that Physics 101 as well as 201 later). I have not done the numbers but I know from experience we don't have enough engineers, especially in Mechanical, biomechanical, electrical and computer sciences. The ones who do graduate from a good university with at least a BSc in these fields (a master is preferred nowadays) find jobs rather easily. If they are American citizens the Aerospace companies swoop them up, leaving far fewer for private industry. Which BTW points to another part of the problem, namely the behemoth size of the aerospace leeches wthat receive the lion share of the non-discretionary budget (nearly 2/3 per my calculations, if military outlays are included!).That's what I think has come Musk's way. And like me and many others he has no doubt observed that the lion share of the graduates in these fields have foreign sounding names. They may be first generation or even second generation but still, not very many American natives. That may be why Vivek talks about American \\"culture\\" and Musk talks about the unfulfilled need for \\"top talent\\".I do wish that instead of piling on Musk we used this opportunity to talk about what's wrong with our K-12 education system and how to fix it. But not much chance of that because it's a lot easier to turn this into a spit ball fight than address a very thorny and difficult-to-solve problem.Which BTW a problem that neither Musk nor Vivek will know how to even start addressing, IMHO.","title":"Why all the Musk hate!

The market has already accepted that people will starve to death if they make less which is generally the bar the market seeks to achieve. Min wage is supposed to artificially up the bar and force companies to pay something resembling livable wages, otherwise what is the point of having min wage?12 dollars in the 20's does not achieve that goal.

In general, progressives in the US seem to run on 80-year cycles; in which they start the cycle with a cause and no clue; over time end up ramping up their goals but failing to get any ground, before eventually convincing enough of the country that they are correct to force through a few incremental changes, then massive gains in the last decade of the cycle, only for the leaders to be killed or put into office, at which point the entire movement collapses and the next one forgets all of the lessons about how to get results - which means the next cycle has to start from scratch.The American Revolution saw the first murmurs of unity in the 1670s; and first started organizing political power in the 1680s; but it wouldn't be until the 1760s that they started getting enough popular support that they were able to get anything meaningful done. The antislavery movement was already underway during the American Revolution; but wouldn't start seeing results until the 1850s. The American Labor Movement got it's first legal success in 1842; but wouldn't see meaningful results in forcing legal changes until the 1900s, with the major wins coming in the 1910s and 1920s. The Civil Rights Movement started in the 1890s, with Plessy v Ferguson a failed attempt at securing rights in 1896; but it wouldn't be until the 1950s that they started getting victories; and the major wins would come in the 1960s.The current American Progressive Movement started some time between the elections of Nixon (1968) and Reagan (1980). Based on that, and the roughly 80-year cycle you see in US progressive movements, you the first small victories should come between the late 2020s (2028 is a good chance if Trump manages to piss off enough of the US and push them into progressivism) and early 2040s. The big wins the current movement will be getting will likely come between 2040 and 2060.But it takes everyone along the way. We don't get Martin Luther King Junior without Michael King taking up the movement in the 1920s, and changing his name and the name of his son to Martin Luther. We don't get the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations without the Knights of Labor. We don't get John Brown and Harriet Beecher Stowe, nor the success of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, without Moses Brown and Thomas Paine. It takes time - and people's effort - to build the organization and support.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"They are, and she reached 75 million two weeks ago when the last state certified the results.

The majority were in a detached garage, and were sorted by colour. Some were labelled lethal.Several bombs were found loaded into a wearable vest, said the court papers.More bombs were found completely unsecured in a backpack in the home. The exterior of the backpack was labelled #nolivesmatter, said the court papers.Nolivesmatter is a movement that promotes extremist ideology, targeted attacks, mass killings, and criminal activity, and has encouraged members to engage in self-harm and animal abuse, according to the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness.In addition to the pipe bombs, investigators say they found a jar of a highly volatile explosive called HMTD, which the FBI notes is so unstable it can be exploded merely by a temperature change and does not require a detonator to explode.The jar of HMTD was labelled Dangerous and Do Not Touch, and was being stored in a freezer next to food that was accessible to the children, according to the court papers.The neighbour also told investigators that Mr Spafford had discussed fortifying the property with a turret for a 50-calibre firearm on the roof.Mr Spafford, who worked at a machine shop, had also said that missing children in the news had been taken by the federal government to be trained as school shooters, according to the court papers.A lawyer for Mr Spafford said on Tuesday that the governments claim he was dangerous was rank speculation and fear mongering, because the suspect had no criminal record.There is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical, the lawyer wrote.The federal judge overseeing the case ordered that Mr Spafford be released with electronic monitoring.However, that decision is on hold as the government seeks to keep the suspect in pre-trial detention.","title":"FBI Finds Largest Explosive Cache in Agency History on  Virginia Farm: Used photos of US President Joe Biden for target practice"},{"text":"Hahahaha as a lifetime Dem voter who will prolly always be a Dem voter despite the fact that they are all despicable neoliberals who accomplish the bare minimum once every ten years before making a hard pivot to the right that screws everyone what can I do but laugh.

We are a broken country full of awful people and us citizens forced to break our backs to get by and still have the energy to advocate for our causes but are still constantly screwed by idiots who vote against their interest, politicians who care about prestige, continuity and pocketbooks over all else and a system so stacked that even if 90% of our time didnt have to be devoted to survival it is difficult to see a path away from what we currently have. What else is there to do but continue to vote for people who I hate less than the others, simply because they are slightly better no simply because they are slightly less worse. Apologize for the word salad but goddamn wtf are we supposed to do? Biden was the most progressive president of my lifetime and I will be forever thankful for many of his stances, including his strong pro-union position but this man still is responsible for an ongoing genocide and made what is basically 2016 Trump immigration policy the Dem norm while letting Trump get elected because his EGO was too damn big. At this point Im just waiting out the death of most of these people because maybe theres a chance the next generation will be better. Not that Im confident about that. I am the next generation and Im about to sell out myself because at the very least I can make sure myself and my family are taken care of and I can do what I can in my community.

Our OSHA recordable incident rate is 0.00, with only a single recordable in the past decade. This is a basically \\"any incident that results in an employee missing work or being unable to perform their normal duties\\".This reputation, backed up by yearly third-party auditing, is how our company thrives.Our second largest \\"human\\" expense is centered on incident response activities. That's: lost billable time/equipment (personnel still paid, equipment still rented), investigating the incident, transportation for personnel (including helicopter flights offshore), and (the two biggest parts) medical evaluation and training.And that's with no one getting truly injured.  Example: We spent approximately 110k USD on a single non recordable incident, an event with zero physical impact and zero missed time for the involved person.Why?Because *one* person who had 17 years of experience decided to unlatch their fall protection lanyard from an anchor... Then promptly fell off the scaffold they were sitting on. (Thankfully it was only about 12 feet and he landed on his feet and rolled).We had four days of billable time/equipment for the 10 person crew they were on, emergency flight to shore (this occurred offshore), Sunday callout rates for the occupational medicine clinic to do x-rays and MRI, and uptraining 147 people with fall protection competent person (not worker/awareness leben which is industry standard) to hammer how important fall protection is and cannot be ignored.We had 20 non-recordable incidents this year.Even not going to lengths our company does, the cost for the above incident would be about 50-60k USD solely based on the minimum effort our clients require to retain the MSA contract.  So yeah This is probably the most wrong subject that gets laid at an employers feet as being a case of the company being \\"only about the numbers\\" when even a company that TRIES to do everything right absolutely HAS to budget for potential injuries and incidents.","title":"Bernie Sanders: Amazon Accepts Worker Injuriesas the Cost of Doing Business"},{"text":"No woman, his wife and daughter included, had any business voting for the sexual assaulter deviant that is going to return to the White House.","title":"We have to do better, democrats.

The reason why we started advancing at a quick pace after the Renaissance Era was due to the proliferation of knowledge and education, even more so once the printing press was invented, when the telephone was invented, etc. The easier the general public can access information and communicate with others different than them, the more educated and progressive people become.It's hard to conceptualize this, but societies views on war, people of color, marginalized groups, how we govern, have radically changed in the past 100 years, which is practically instantaneous in the grand scheme of things.

And although *sometimes* people get upset about that, *usually* they don't.The stuff people get upset about is usually more sinister/problematic than that, though. u/yumdumpster brought up Gladiator II in another comment and I'll continue talking about it here. In the film, Caracalla is presented as an effete near-insane decadent and soft wastrel who will sap Rome's greatness with military folly, and the heroes are strong military types who will revitalize Rome's masculinity.Now, if those characterizations were roughly historically accurate, that would be one thing. But when they are notably historically *inaccurate*, it sets a different cast on it. The historical Caracalla was in fact a brutish and aggressive military man. Maximinius Thrax, another villain of the film, characterized as a bisexual and soft merchant, was also historically an aggressive military commander. Why did Ridley Scott decide to make *historically false* characterizations of his villains as decadent and effeminate perverts?

They also pressure politicians to pass protectionist policies. In short, unions are basically defined by their commitment to anti-competitive practices. They are objectively rent-seekers trying to obtain more wages and benefits in return for their labor than they can get in a free market.Unions don't just \\"advocate\\" for higher wages. If you ask your boss for a raise, that's not rent-seeking. If you ask your boss for a raise, and he says no, and you respond by getting your co-workers together and saying you'll all stop working unless you all get raises, that's rent-seeking because you don't like what your labor is worth on the free market.

Another change is that with Britain as dependent on Southern cotton as it was, Britain probably wouldnt have abolished slavery when it did.

People who spend their youth buying funko pops and taking vacations don't deserve to be bailed out by the people who actually settled down and started families.Social security is a bailout for the irresponsible. Parents with few or no children *could* have invested into the future-- they *could* have fostered deeper social ties, or put more money away, or just had more kids. But they didn't, and now they want to use what the responsible, dedicated parents build up.Luckily, the status quo is that social security is guaranteed to fail sometime within the next few decades. The larger the deficit becomes, and the more inflation goes up to match it, the more the buying power of social security is reduces. Alternatively, if higher taxes are levied, companies and young people will simply flee the country for better economies and the actual labor-buying power of social security payments will disappear. And if the government *does* intervene-- either to make it cover a smaller proportion of the population, sapping its support base, or to make it more profligate, accelerating the earlier process, it disappears even faster. Parents with plenty of children will still be totally fine-- their children can send them renumerations from foreign countries, or alternatively perform unpaid and therefore untaxable labor to maintain their quality of life.

It often feels like neither side truly represents the people, instead prioritizing the interests of the corporate oligarchy. Policies like the Patriot Act, which expanded state surveillance, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which stripped away fundamental rights, are glaring examples of how our system fails to protect or serve the public.When it comes to the Democratic Party, their inability to deliver real, transformative change isnt surprising given their internal divisions. They encompass a wide range of ideologies, from moderates like Joe Manchin to progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This diversity could be a strength, but it often leads to watered-down policies and an unwillingness to challenge entrenched systems. For example, AOCs loss in her bid for the Oversight Committee demonstrates how leadership often prioritizes seniority and caution over the bold ideas we desperately need.Then theres the Senate filibustera rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority for most legislation. This procedural hurdle has made it almost impossible to pass significant reforms, even when Democrats have held majorities. Efforts to reform or eliminate the filibuster have been blocked, often by members of their own party who seem more concerned about maintaining their power than addressing the urgent needs of the people.The real issue, though, goes beyond the Democratic Party. Both major parties are deeply influenced by corporate interests, and this shapes their policies in ways that protect the wealthy and powerful. This isnt just about campaign donationsits about a system that prioritizes deregulation, privatization, and wealth concentration at the expense of ordinary people. The revocation of Roe v. Wade and the continued expansion of state surveillance and militarization are bipartisan failures that demonstrate how both sides perpetuate systems of control rather than challenging them.Youre right to feel disillusioned. The system, as it currently stands, serves to protect itself rather than the people. But that doesnt mean change is impossible. Grassroots movements and local organizing have historically been powerful tools for pushing back against oppressive systems. Look at how workers' movements have historically fought for rights like the eight-hour workday or how civil rights activists challenged systemic racism. These victories didnt come from within the establishmentthey came from people demanding change from the outside.The key is recognizing that real progress will never come from a single party or politician. It comes from sustained pressure on the system as a whole. Whether that means advocating for reforms to weaken corporate influence, dismantle state surveillance, or rebuild protections for fundamental rights, the fight for change requires challenging the structures that both parties seem intent on preserving. Its a long, difficult road, but its one weve walked beforeand we can do it again.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Okay, I chuckled at the idea of Trump learning something.","title":"Biden named the one thing Trump could learn from Jimmy Carter.

Money is the token we use to adjucate the allocation of resources. If you put a $100 dollar bill into a bank in the year 1800, and take it (plus interest) in the year 2000, there things you can buy with it are simply incomparable. It's not just that the value of the *money* has changes, it's the the value of *absolutely everything* has changed. You can buy more computing power with that $100+ dollars than was available to the entire planet in the year 1800, but alternatively if you want to buy *land* then you'll only be able to afford a much meaner parcel in a much worse location.When they were young, our elders made decisions about how much labor-value they wanted to put into the bank, and how much labor-value they wanted to expend toward having and raising a family. As a direct result of the choices they made in response to the incentives in front of them, labor will become increasingly scarce. So, what makes them entitled to retrieve specifically the same *unit-value* of labour? If you do me a favor and help me move out of my house when we're both jobless and broke, I certainly owe you a favor back... but if the value of my time changes dramatically, for example because I'm in the middle of a wedding ceremony, you're not entitled to show up in coveralls and demand exactly the same favor back.If you're dead set on your framing of social security as a bank, then I propose a compromise-- we let our elders take out *exactly* what they put in: the exact cash value they paid into social security.But I don't think you're going to accept that compromise, because it's obvious to both of us that social security is not a deposit of value, it is a *transfer payment*. And while I'm not against transfer payments in general-- I'm pro-UBI, pro-Medicare-for-All, and pro-LVT-to-pay-for-it-- I *am* against a system that demonstratably and visibly is in the middle of eating its own tail. Forcing young people to pay payroll taxes so that old people can benefit decreases the amount of time they have to have children... which forces them to demand even higher payroll taxes when they in turn become old... which results in even fewer children, and a continuation of the vicious cycle.We live in a gerontocracy? Can't you see that? Policies like social security directly contribute to the welfare of a bloodsucking elderly population at the expense of an increasingly deprived younger cohort. Social Security borrows from the future in the exact same way as unsustainable CO2 emissions and deficit spending.Yes, it's going to suck for whichever generation gets the rug pulled out from under them. But it has to happen to *someone,* and the earlier, the better. I'd support a more graduated transition if I thought it was politically feasible... but that fact that you accused me of being JD Vance without realizing his policies align more with yours than mine makes me think the population is not nearly educated and informed enough for that to happen.","title":"President Biden Should Veto the Social Security Fairness Act"},{"text":"New headline: Biden departs swanky St. Croix beachfront retreat to be served soup in another place.","title":"Biden departs swanky St. Croix beachfront retreat and to face harsh reality of his final days in office spending nearly 40% of presidency on vacation\\n"},{"text":"Cant wait to see Hillary Clinton memes with Musks face on them","title":"Elon Musk channels Hillary Clinton in calling Trump supporters contemptible fools amid H-1B visa debate"},{"text":"\\\\has pretty much become one of the untouchables of the oppositionYou mean they figured out that it's wise not to fuck with her?

Investigative journalism helps, but it tends to preach to the converted. There need to be news channels and media outlets for getting messages across to non-metropolitan areas dominated by far-right news sources. Liberal-minded billionaires should not sit idly by as they did in Hungary, watching the right take over the media. The New Right is also significantly more embedded in social media than liberals are. Those of us who favor democracy cannot let Elon Musks and Andrew Tates control the public discourse. Progressive influencers: Time to log in and post away  theres a narrative battle to win....To win the fight against autocracy, above all, the Democratic Party must reconnect with the working class to preserve liberal institutions. There are simply not enough educated moderate suburbanites for an electoral majority.First, this means creating new and strengthening existing local organizational structures, especially labor unions. Popular mobilization is crucial to energize the base. Yet, such mobilization sometimes focuses on issues important to the active base only  a tactical error that should be avoided. For example, the most mobilized segments of Hungarian society tend to focus on media freedom or democracy, but these are not the primary concerns of ordinary citizens, leading to repeated failures of mass mobilizations. To create the groundwork so ordinary people will mobilize during elections, its important to engage with them outside elections, focusing on issues that matter to them.Second, party financing should shift from the corporate elite to small and micro-donations. Fortunately, Democrats already have a strong base of small donors, but it needs to grow. This is the only guarantee against elites capturing the Democratic Party and provides a solid foundation to push through popular reforms that elites oppose. Freeing the party from elite capture will allow it to talk about things that matter, from the decline of middle America to inequality.Third, commit to left-populist economic policies. Republicans have stolen key populist messages; Democrats need to reclaim them. If done smartly, populist economic policies work and are popular in swing states, even among right-leaning voters. Championing issues like breaking the chokehold of pharmaceuticals over the health system, fighting inflation or increasing the minimum wage are key to overcoming the chasm separating low- and high-income Americans and would allow Democrats to regain their pro-worker bona fides.Fourth, learn symbolic class politics. In their free time, most Americans go to McDonalds and not to the opera. Democrats must learn to avoid coming across as condescending intellectuals and learn to valorize the working class. Instead of solely focusing on abstract aggregates dear to experts, Democrats must pay more attention to the lived experience of economic change. Embrace the mundane and be down to earth; it will not compromise but will enliven your transformative vision of justice and democracy.Hungarys key lesson is you dont protect democracy by talking about democracy  you protect democracy by protecting people. Only a democracy that works for the people is sustainable.","title":"Gbor Scheiring: I Watched Orbn Destroy Hungarys Democracy.

I always find this such a weird standard. What people when they say this really just mean is that in that specific case they think the **interests** of one person matter more than that of the other. Absolute free speech is paradoxical issue because it would allow speech that advocates for the suppression of speech itself, such as calls for censorship or authoritarian rule.Yes, and that's not paradoxical. That's why speech isn't actions and why some people believe in absolute free speech. Becausing advocating that people not be able to say everything is not the same as making laws that punish them for saying certain things. That's why speech is in an entirely different class from actions and why many believe in free speech. There is indeed no one who preaches free actions for this reason. If we compare, the only significant difference between parties like the AfD and the Ba'ath Party is that the Ba'athists were Socialist-ish. Absolute free speech has allowed harm through the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and dangerous ideologies (such as far-right xenophobia and religious fundamentalism), undermining societal cohesion and trust. It also enables incitement to violence and defamation.So has religion and many other things.this is always my gripe when people talk about harm the standard is always so ridiculously unfair and things that are objectively speaking far more harmful than many things that are banned are allowed because they're socially acceptable. It was never about harm, it was always about arbitrary social acceptance.If Abrahamic religions didn't exist, and I would write the old Testament and everything in it today, it might very well be banned in many countries. Of course, the standard with regards to what drugs are banned because they are harmful is always also completely ridiculous.  misinformation is also always purely applied to misinformation I personally take social offence to while all sorts of other forms of outright lies, such as, again, what is written in about every religion on the planet is allowed a pass because it's socially acceptable.If Abrahamists can preach that the world was created by a fictive diety 6000 years ago, then any other lie should be allowed as well. They are all lies, nothing more. If Jews can stand up and proclaim that Hebrews were enslaved by the Egyptians, something which with all overwhelming probability is not true given all historical evidence, then Nazis should be able to stand up and claim that the holocaust never happened, a claim just as false. Historically, unrestricted hate speech has contributed to atrocities. During the early years of post-2003 Iraq, the US under Bremer and later through Al Maliki let sectarian TV channels and media outlets to be completely free. Which fueled tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, contributing to the violence that accrued. The same thing happened during the Rwandan Genocide, unchecked radio broadcasts (Mostly by the Radio Tlvision Libre des Mille Collines aka Radio Genocide) incited mass killings and violence.Yes, so did, again, every religion that's legal today. How many wars have been and still are fought over religious differences? How many people were mass murdered because they had a slightly different interpretion of the Abrahamic god than those who mass murdered them? How many people were tortured by the inquisition because they held scientificaslly accurate beliefs that went against the religious docrine?I'll believe it when the standard is fair, but that will never hpapen. And tbh, no society permits absolute free speech. Even in societies like the United States, where free speech is a fundamental right, certain speech, especially in politically sensitive contexts (such as criticism of foreign governments like Israel or criticism of a formerly oppressed group), can face legal restrictions. This reflects the limits on free speech that exist in every society, where speech that undermines national interests or incites unrest can be controlled, even in democracies.Even? The U.S.A. has about the least freedom of speech compared to about any other developed country except maybe the U.K.. I don't understand why it keeps saying of itself that it has so much freedom of speech when there are literal free speech zones and fines for swearwords on television there.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"No he didn't do much better than 2016.

We live in a cooperative society that relies on social norms for strength. A degree of conformity (like we all drive on ONE side of the road) as well as healthy skepticism/ individuality is needed.Nerds get \\"beat down\\" for a reason, as do autists, miscreants, bullies, rapists, losers, etc. It's \\"teaching\\" the other people.Someone smells? \\"Hey smelly go take a shower\\" -- sure Bullying can go overboard or irrational or not constructive, but -- it actually does have some useful elements.... But anyway, man cannot be \\"dainty pussies\\" and fellow men and women tend to reinforce this. Now, that doesn't mean violence per se, but, that is one aspect.2. social manipulation. Usually pretty obvious in high school, but also Kamala baiting Trump on the debate stage.\\"Hey dare you to run outside shirtless in the freezing cold\\"\\"Nah I'm good\\"\\"C'mon you pussy. Man up.\\"See it's just a manipulation tactic to get you to do what the aggressor says. Can be a man or a woman..... Now people greatly debate what is acceptable 'male virtue' - what is the paragon of being a man, man ideals. This is hotly and often debated by anyone &amp; everybody.The primitive belief, ala the 1980s, Tate, Islamist fundies .... is some \\"ultra Macho\\" male who is primitive, has giant muscles (useless vs. firearms) ... proficient in firearms, smacks his \\"bitch ho\\" and keeps her in line, doesn't TOLERATE insults ever, super insecure, always reacts to insults, thin skinned, never apologizes, zero social awareness, needs to buy a massive SUV, counts his worth via his strength, women bedded, and financial assets ... loudest mofo in the room. Etcetera.Many people obviously disagree with this. The 4th wave feminist ideal of a male is the following: a vegan pussy who voluntarily gives up all power to the women around him; pays them, works for them, averts his gaze downward, and has printed Sexual Consent forms in triplicate.Obviously most people believe in male virtues that fall somewhere in between these two idiotic ideas.A man who is strong to protect those who are weak.Making difficult decisions. Sacrifice.Actually having social awareness and empathy. ... Learning when to react to, and when to ignore, his own emotions and irrationality.Honor and integrity. Learning when to fall on his sword and when to stand up.Having humility. Confidence when warranted.Not being afraid of a pink cocktail or wearing drag if he so desires. Laughs at himself.This is just \\"one version\\" but you get the idea.

It's an incredible quality to have.I think society is slowly rejecting the idea that there are inherent roles men and women are meant to play and that there are fundamental biological differences between them that are expressed in their respective personalities. It may not be entirely false, but in my personal view it's nowhere NEAR as true as you seem to assume inherently.I respect that notion more than I respect believing that it's a man's job to be masculine and a woman's job to be feminine. It isn't my job as a human being regardless of what's between my legs to be anything for anybody. I can lose my job, go home and cry about it and have my moment of vulnerability, then wake up the next morning, open my laptop and start looking for jobs.I can pity myself for a moment, cry, be vulnerable and weak, and still work and be productive and take responsibility for who I choose to be and fulfill my obligations to the ones I love and provide for them and protect them.I've had emotional breakdowns at work. Yes I stopped working, but after I called the people I needed to who came to support me, like magic I started working again. It happens. I'm human, you're human, we're all human. I didn't need to hide my pain from anybody. I didn't need to pretend like I wasn't hurting. I just didn't care what anybody thought of me while I cried.When others provide for me, as a man, I feel no shame. When I let others lead me instead of the other way around, I feel no shame. I feel gratitude. You're free to look down on me for this. But I like life better this way.I think that men are struggling because we're slowly freeing ourselves from the shackles of gender roles and like any person held in bondage that's been freed, there is a period where we will be lost and confused before we can find our way forward.I hope that our past ideal of man as protector and woman as nurturer stays permanently dead and gone. It just doesn't align with the way human beings work fundamentally. If it did, so many people who struggled agonizingly in life and who died may still very well be here with us today.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

Why shouldn't people want or dislike or like things in media that touch on things they care about?

The Democratic Party has to account for that in their future campaigns.The Right Wing can run idiots, ogres or others from the bottom of the barrel and continue to give them their solid 30% support even if they have a track record of failure.  Examples are GWB, Trump, Reagan, Ted Cruz and in Canada Rob and Doug Ford.  And then there's Berlusconi.  Their standards and expectations are low to non-existent.But everybody else has to be more perfect than God to maintain their support from their own.  Obama's expectations were so high, he got the Nobel Peace Prize.  But a lot of Democrats were disappointed with Obama because he watered down the ACA and didn't push the fight on climate change hard enough.  He won his second term but barely.Between Harris and Trump, specific groups like Latinos and Arabs are measuring Harris by a different standard they are not giving Trump.People continue to be worried about the economy under the Democrats even though the historical record shows the past 10 recessions started under Republican Presidents.  The latest Democrat was Carter.Even when they agree with Harris' position on many things like climate change and abortion rights, they can't support her because of her non- commitment against genocide.  You can't argue with that. Paraphrasing  from interviews, Harris had to earn to votes from democrat supporters.  But Trump is not subject to the same judgement.  Trump doesn't need to earn anybody's vote.  He's got the Republican vote locked-in regardless of his track record of failures.Meanwhile, Trump gets a pass because they think the institutional checks and balances will keep Trump from becoming a dictator.  (Haven't history taught them anything about that?) They disregard his past actions of stacking the Supreme Court and appointing judges who are loyal to him personally.  Those two alone are why he has survived and gone so far in this election.  And if elected, he'll go further for which his supporters will continue to be in denial.But talk of Harris stacking the Supreme Court, the argument against that is that it would set a bad precedent for each successive President to keep doing.And interviews with voters the day after, it's the same things: the economy, not speaking to/ resonating with common people.Post- mortum analysis says the Democrats disregarded the situation of normal people.  Huh?  I thought I heard Harris address that many times.

Since you asked, here are two constructive criticisms for your (generally very good!) post - one argument that is right but for the wrong reasons, and one that I think is missing.The correction (to argument 2.1): even if SSFA becomes law, people won't get Social Security benefits from jobs at which they paid no payroll taxes. The issue is how much benefit they get from the jobs at which they did pay payroll taxes. SS benefits are progressive, meaning people who earned less throughout their working lives get a greater benefit for each dollar they paid in payroll taxes. WEP/GPO are meant to prevent high-earning people who split their career between covered and uncovered employment from getting the same return as a low-earning person who spent their whole career in covered employment. It does so imperfectly, which is why we need a reform (rather than repeal) of WEP/GPO that ensures people with the same lifetime earnings get the same replacement rate. I wrote about what that would look like a few years ago [here](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/one-social-security-reform-that-democrats-and-republicans-agree-on/).The missing argument: in addition to being bad substantively, this is a big *political* blunder. There is no shortage of Hill Dems who are pissed that Schumer blindsided everyone by bringing this up for a vote when he did. From [a piece I published](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benritz/2024/12/12/democrats-last-act-shouldnt-be-expediting-social-security-insolvency/) right after he announced it:Yet even Democrats who dismiss their concerns and believe the Act is good policy should be wary about how it is likely to backfire politically. Benefits would start being increased during a time in which Republicans have control of the U.S. House, Senate, and presidency  meaning they are likely to get the political credit. This wouldnt be the first time voters credited one administration for its predecessors actions: a?[New York Times survey](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/upshot/abortion-biden-trump-blame.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare)?earlier this year found that roughly one in six voters blamed President Biden for the overturning of?*Roe v. Wade*?because it occurred during his presidency, even though the policy change was carried out by Supreme Court justices who had been appointed by Donald Trump.Vetoing the bill would both give lawmakers a chance to address WEP/GPO in a truly fair way and leave the headache for a Republican government to deal with, since there is no way Thune is gonna bring SSFA for a vote.","title":"President Biden Should Veto the Social Security Fairness Act"},{"text":"It really is!

They'll have to bring the crime to near zero. Then they'll have to use their economic leverage to make red states hell to live in so there will be a clear contrast between living in red states vs a blue state and people will flee to blue states for the better social safety net.

It may not seem obvious today, but this populist right shift would have seemed unimaginable a decade ago. In the wake of Obama's presidency, the Republicans' post-mortem actually recommending that they moderate on key racial issues in order to draw in minorities who otherwise lean conservative. The current political order will seem stagnant and unchanging, until all at once underlying currents break out into the open, and a new realignment occurs. This could happen four years from now, it could also happen decades from now. Either way, the only way for this eventual shift to break in progressives' favor is to build political power from the local level up. This is what conservatives started doing post new deal, when the Democratics were ascendant, and decades later it paid off with the rise of neoliberalism in the 80s.On my optimistic days, I can imagine the Democrats picking up on the intense populist anger that MAGA feeds on, and using it to fuel a left-populist campaign that recenters the working class as the key constituency of the party. It's difficult to imagine the path that would take us there, but at the same time it would have been difficult to imagine a path leading to Trump as president 10 years ago.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"I have a modification. Historical accuracy is important when an uneducated adult about the time period may think you are trying to represent it as historically accurate. Either generally or specifically. If you want to portray the Civil War era US but take creative licenses to do something like the show \\"The Great\\" did Elizabeth the great it can cause harmful confusion in general knowledge of history.  I think \\"the Great\\" handled it well It did a tongue in cheek notification at the beginning of each show with (*an occasionally true story). I think in later seasons, when they went really off the rails, it update to something like (*a very inaccurate story) or something. If you are going to say this is someone's life or this time and only halfway do the accuracy, you should do some disclosure. I believe \\"The Crown\\" ran into this issue?I think that using historical backdrops creatively is just fine. But creators should try to help the uneducated public have a bit of a hint on what is fiction and what is not.Now, if we are talking about LOTR rings of power having black actors be an elf as not historically accurate, they can go pound sand. Any adult should know that LOTR is not a historical representation of anything. Maybe they can whine and complain about being off of source material, but that is a preference and not actually harmful. I would also say that things like \\"Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter\\" would be fine without a disclaimer. I would also think that movies like \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" would be fine as well without a specific disclaimer.

After the assets appreciate, the taxpayer uses financial products to obtain cash, and the cash is swapped into the trust in exchange for the appreciated assets. The reason for the swap is that the asset needs to be included in the taxpayers gross estate for federal estate tax purposes in order to receive a basis adjustment to fair market value on the taxpayers date of death. The financial product gives the taxpayer two things: an asset (cash) and an equal and offsetting liability (the contractual claim/debt). The liability is deductible from the clients gross estate in computing the taxable estate.Done effectively, the result is that the appreciated assets are included in the gross estate (thereby eliminating income tax) and the taxable estate is reduced to zero (thereby eliminating estate tax). Meanwhile, the assets in the trust are held for the benefit of descendants, tax free.","title":"The \\"Buy, Borrow, Die\\" Method: Succs Beware"},{"text":"3/3:\\\\What bothers me even more is how critiques of historical inaccuracy often feel politically motivated. For instance, right-wing groups, who frequently twist history to suit their agendas, are among the loudest voices decrying inaccuracies.This, I must say, I find to be a slightly stranger point! Of course, people pointing out historical inaccuracies are likely to hold a bias - we all do - but I'm not sure if it's the ones critiquing historical inaccuracies who are trying to \\"twist history\\".I remember a controversy some time ago in the UK over a Doctor Who episode set in early 19th century London - that is, the Regency period. It displayed a city with extraordinary levels of ethnic diversity, akin to the kind you'd find in London today, despite the fact that, while there certainly were ethnic minorities in the London of 1811, they were, comparatively, vanishingly rare. It later came out that the writers of the episode knew they were being economical with the truth here; Steven Moffatt admitted to \\"Bending history, but in a progressive way\\".Now you could say this is a silly point to raise, given that the episode also featured a giant alien water snake (and while the non-white population of Regency London may have been around 20,000 at a high estimate, the alien water snake population was most certainly 0) - but the trouble still stands. Who's twisting history here? The producers of the show, with a clear agenda, or those who point out the inaccuracy?Let entertainers do as they please - but while I wont disagree right wing grifters certainly exist, I don't think it should be controversial for historians to point out when history is twisted in popular media, without themselves being accused of twisting history.I've gone WAY overboard here; but I hope this gives you some food for thought OP!","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"2/3: Now this can be fairly benign; a diet of American McGee's Alice, Emilie Autumn, and various Tim Burton movies gave me a wildly inaccurate view of mental health care in Victorian Britain - which, while embarrassing to look back on, and doubtlessly irritating for anyone with an academic specialisation in the subject, was generally harmless. However; sometimes, the consequences of these historically inaccurate movies can be, potentially, much more harmful.Braveheart, for example, labelled \\"The most inaccurate movie ever made\\" by some reviewers, lead to a surge of nationalist feeling (and attendant anti-English sentiment) up in Scotland - even leading to a number of [physical assaults](https://web.archive.org/web/20131219024934/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/most-race-attack-victims-are-white-the-english-exiles-1069506.html) against English tourists in the months and years after its release.Over in India, the movie RRR (which I haven't seen, I'm sure is wildly good fun, but do know is -far- from a documentary about life in mid 20th century British India!) has also proved a boon for vicious Hindu nationalism - having been accused of both [casteist ](https://www.vox.com/23220275/rrr-netflix-tollywood-hindutva-caste-system-oscars-2023)and Islamaphobic overtones, as well as (once again), strident anti-British sentiment. I'm sure I don't need to go into how such sentiments have the potential to lead to dreadful violence in Modi's India.There are numerous other examples too, of course (Gods and Generals was fuel to the fire of \\"Lost cause\\" propaganda over in the US); but the point stands that, regrettably, since most people are either not interested in, or simply too busy to, research the real history of a period in all its nuance and complexity - they'll take what they see in movies as the truth, and this can have bitter consequences.","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"They received a free lesson on Newtons third law.","title":"Parents looking for an alternative to Christian instruction settle on Satan.

If I may then, I'd like to try to change your perspective, even if I do see where you're coming from.\\\\Most period-piece games, movies, or shows use history as a backdrop to tell a compelling story, not as a lesson in authenticity. Theyre rarely trying to be accurate, nor should they be.Now this is certainly true; the primary purpose of media such as movies and video games is, as you say, ultimately to entertain their audience, not educate them. Both \\"The Patriot\\" and \\"300\\" are among my 'guilty pleasure' movies with a historical setting, even if their take on that setting is painfully inaccurate ([see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5WJY_tqtmA&amp;ab_channel=BrandonF) for an example of how the battle scenes from the former drove one 18th century warfare expert almost to the brink of madness). They're both cheesy, over the top action flicks, and can be wildly good fun - not to mention a great source of some of my favourite reaction memes.But here in lies the issue, and the problem with their historical inaccuracy: because just consider for a moment - how many people have seen \\"The Patriot\\", versus how many people have actually sat down and read a full length history book on the American Revolutionary Wars, never mind two or three from a range of historians with a range of perspectives? Many hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions, versus tens of thousands at best, would be my bet.This of course leads to the problem that people will go away into their busy lives using what they saw in those movies as the basis of their knowledge about the period they were set in. And, yes; even though we all (should hopefully!) know going into a historical movie or game that it's ultimately a piece of fiction with an old-timey wardrobe, and thus should be taken with a huge grain of salt - as I said, unfortunately, many people can, and do, take historical movies at face value, as the truth of how things \\"really were\\" back then.","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"Wow this is my favorite one youve posted, this one is so real.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 31, 2024"},{"text":"Nominate someone with the Caliber of Bernie or AOC.","title":"We have to do better, democrats.

They have Western democracies in a vice grip and will milk public spending until it runs dry. With the US, UK, Spain, and France already at debt-to-GDP ratios of around 100%, that might be sooner than we'd like. A 2023 [study](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels) from Wharton estimated that financial markets would start to unravel at around 175% debt-to-GDP, which gives the US a couple decades at most.People don't want to accept the cultural changes that would accompany an economy robust enough to support the amount of social spending they want. There are measures we could take to turbocharge the economy, like freer trade, freer movement (i.e. more immigration), an LVT, and fewer land use restrictions, but they're socially uncomfortable so people reject them.

I'm trying to point out that obviously there are forms of discrimination by the government that cannot be engaged in when deciding on what contracts can be offered to whom.  You said that discrimination in contracts based on political speech is not violating any rights or restricting speech because it just results in the loss of a business relationship.  The same consequence exists in a case where the government discriminates based on race, yet you think that somehow does violate rights even though the consequence for the targeted group is the same.  Why is one form of discrimination a legal restriction and the other is not?The alternative, of course, is that we demand complete ambivalence and when Westboro Baptist Church LLC fills out the right forms and offers the most competitive bid to provide supportive outreach for gay youth in rural Kansas, we refuse to hold their political beliefs against them and award the contract.  If we're not going to do that, we've accepted that prudential political judgments can be made wrt contracting and the only remaining question is which movements are to be excludedThis is an absurd comparison.  If the goal of a gay youth outreach program is to help gay youth, then the overt expressed beliefs and goals of the WBC would demonstrate that they clearly would not be a good choice for that role.  So if you had a government program that was specifically about facilitating business with the Israeli government then it would be perfectly reasonable to decline to grant a contract for that role to a pro-BDS organization.I'm not saying there can be no standards or requirements for government contracts.  What I don't think is appropriate is saying \\"the government can't grant any contracts of any kind to anyone who expresses this particular political belief for any reason\\".  It means it's a voluntary restriction you have to agree to in order to be subject to it.  You can also abrogate it at any time, but will face the consequences you accepted when you accepted the contract.So you can put in any restrictions on a contract you want and if the person doesn't agree with it it's entirely on them?  So the government could, for example, refuse to hire contractors unless they agreed not to hire a particular racial group?  Or they wouldn't hire people who follow a specific religion?That seems like a pretty weak argument to me given the unequal power present in contract negotiations.And you absolutely do think that they should, because I suspect that if Texas awarded a contract to Richard Spencer and defended itself by saying he offered the best bid and his private behavior was nothing of their concern, you'd be perturbed.\\nThe Texas government has contracted and does contract with organizations and individuals I find reprehensible. For example they use public health funds to support organizations that can provide medical advice without a license (because that advice is anti-abortion) and support explicitly homophobic groups.  They have contracts with all kinds of clearly discriminatory organizations, yet somehow they're banned from contracting with companies or individuals who participate in boycotts against Israel specifically (though not boycotts of any other kind).When you're sitting there minding your own business, say something unapproved to whatever audience you can reach, and face a legal consequence.  Not when something you say triggers elements of a contract you acceptedOkay, so then by this logic you think the government can discriminate in contracting by race because there is no legal consequence.  You're saying that if the government requires contractors to not hire black people and the company hires a black person they can terminate that contract and all of that is fine because none of that is a legal consequence or restriction.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"\\"Historical accuracy in media doesn't matter\\" in OP's headline reminded me of NPR's boss agreeing, which is frightening.

When you advocate for giving the government any specific power, I would suggest imagining the worst politician you can think of wielding that power and ask if youd trust them to do that and not destroy the country. I do not trust even the politicians I vote for to wield that type of power.The reason I disagree with you on the principle (ie, why I would oppose this type of law even if it would always be perfectly enforced), is that free speech *is about* the type of speech you want to restrict. Freedom of speech means absolutely nothing if it only protects popularly acceptable speech. If you accept regulating extremely authoritarian speech or misinformation, at some point you are saying this view is so evil that you shouldnt even be allowed to say it, or we think thats false, so you shouldnt be allowed to say it. Allowing the government to weigh in on what political views people are and arent allowed to express makes the government precisely the type of authoritarian state you claim to want to avoid. Your government, in this case, would be the one shutting down public speeches and banning books.Lastly, on the point of any type of misinformation regulations, I think there are precisely no reasonable rules that could be established here. If I say something that I believe to be true, but you believe isnt, how do you determine that truth? In a century, science will have progressed and we will likely have a very different understanding of the world. What if Im ahead on that understanding? What if Im behind? Why should I not be able to reject the current view, since thats literally the core of the scientific method?And if I say something I know to be false, you might say *that* could be criminalized. But how about a joke? How about satire? Do you suppose a politician or judge or jury should sit and decide if I was being serious or not?In short, there are a myriad of theoretical and practical problems with restricting speech. The U.S. does not restrict controversial speech, hate speech, or misinformation, except when that speech can be shown to cause a tangible harm. In those cases, its not the speech thats illegal, but the harm itself - if the speech hadnt caused the harm it did but was otherwise exactly the same, it would be legal. All slander, libel, defamation, and similar cases are based on proven harms caused by speech, not the veracity of the speech itself (though the truth is a defense to libel, falsehood alone is not grounds for a lawsuit or prosecution). All incitement cases are based on *results*. If I tell a toddler to blow up a building, I have not actually incited a crime and that would not be punishable. These are not speech restrictions, these are *harm* restrictions.The free speech standard in the U.S., established in *Brandenburg v. Ohio*, is that speech must incite and be likely to produce imminent lawless action in order to be criminally punishable. Brandenburg, the plaintiff, was attending and leading KKK rallies that advocated violence against minorities and pushed racist conspiracy theories, and he invited reporters to broadcast these rallies. The law in question was struck down because it criminalized mere advocacy of violence which is *still* a violation of the First Amendment in the U.S., so I think your conception of what speech can and cant be prosecuted in the U.S. is way off.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"Youre assuming people can tell the difference between tropes and facts","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"For once, I'd like someone in the media to actually address the sanewashing that's been going on for years to Trump's benefit.

It's about respecting the stories and struggles of real people who came before us. Say a show's about the Indian independence movement, but the creators decide to drop some major historical figures or events because they want a \\"cooler\\" narrative. How would you feel if they downplayed the efforts of those who fought for the country's freedom? Historical accuracy matters to honor the real people and events that shaped our world.Plus, completely ignoring accuracy can have unintended consequences. People might start accepting a distorted view of history if it keeps getting portrayed in media inaccurately. Over time, this can shape perceptions and understandings in ways that might not align with reality, which can have real-world implications, especially in a place like India where diverse histories and identities are crucial to shaping society.And sure, some right-wing groups might complain about \\"inaccuracies\\" for political purposes. But that shouldn't undermine the genuine importance of maintaining a balanced and respectful approach to historical representation. It's possible to create engaging, cool stories that are also rooted in an earnest representation of the past. So, enjoying creative liberties is fine, but blending it with historical sensitivity and authenticity is important too.","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"The problem was that the wrong woman was running.

To take one of the worst examples I can think of, Braveheart, they changed nearly the entire story of William Wallace. If you're going to change characters, personalities, and even the order of events, why bother with the history part at all? And you risk miseducating people who don't know any better, who have now learned a horribly inaccurate version of history. A good example is the film Amadeus, which notoriously depicts Salieri as a bitter rival of Mozart's, who contributed to his death...which is nonsense. So now millions of people think Salieri was awful, when that's not true at all. In short, I agree that some people can be overly pedantic about accuracy - especially when politics get involved. But I do think that if you're going to use history as your source material, you do have at least some responsibility to keep the basic narrative intact. If you can't, just write your own story.","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"The old equipment is replaced by new, built in USA, someone is paid for, then they spend it where they live.","title":"Biden administration to send billions more in aid to Ukraine"},{"text":"The race baiting is his entire point, my friend.","title":"Vivek is a literal scam artist.

Some things aren't going to change in 2025, like me being a big dork.As of yesterday, the Virginia SD-32 and HD-26 specials have seen 2,987 early in-person voters and 3,494 accepted mail votes, for **6,391 total votes.** Our two big goals before Tuesday: Get the 8,318 unreturned mail ballots in, and get another big day of early voting this coming Saturday.I know turnout is low, but I was curious how this compared to past elections.  And back in January 2023, we actually had a couple of comparable specials in Virginia!  Here's a comparison with those elections - Senate District 7 (a highly competitive race that Dems narrowly flipped) and House District 35 (a deep-blue district that saw little investment but is right next door to the current districts).(Note: The HD-35 district took place in a House district, which has fewer voters than a Senate district.  SD-26 has about 2.5 times as many registered voters as HD-35 did in 2023, so I multiplied the HD-35 numbers by 2.5 and put them in brackets to give a rough estimate of what turnout would have been in an equivalent Senate district).| Type of vote  | Senate District 26 (Jan. 2025)   | Senate District 7 (Jan. 2023)     |House District 35 (Jan. 2023)\\n|:|:|:|:|\\n| Early in-person       |**2897**   |4392   |  2,042 (~5,105)\\n| Mail votes  | **3494 (8318 outstanding)**|5893  |2,914 (~7,285)In other words, I could see us catching the SD-7 early numbers pretty easily, and maybe the HD-35 numbers if we really hit the phones.  We want a strong early showing to make it clear that we aren't putting up with GOP bullshit.  And we'll find out how it went in a week.But until then, you know what to do.

Only it frames it as a contract for small businesses or disabled veteran-owned companies or minority-owned companies and so on.  If it's a contract effectively *for* a specific group, it's *not for* everyone else.)What about banning contracts with people or organizations that support the NAACP? Is that okay?That would be the kind of thing we would leave up to legislatures making laws and regulations for contracting.  In principle, there is nothing wrong with a state or the federal government refusing, as a rule, to support companies that affiliate with certain causes.  For the NAACP in particular, I would say probably not - but if it behaved in certain ways, my opinion might change.The alternative, of course, is that we demand complete ambivalence and when Westboro Baptist Church LLC fills out the right forms and offers the most competitive bid to provide supportive outreach for gay youth in rural Kansas, we refuse to hold their political beliefs against them and award the contract.  If we're not going to do that, we've accepted that prudential political judgments can be made wrt contracting and the only remaining question is which movements are to be excluded.Just because the consequence of said political speech is not getting a government contract (or being prevented from expressing political speech for fear of losing a contract or job you already have) doesn't mean it's not a restriction.It means it's a voluntary restriction you have to agree to in order to be subject to it.  You can also abrogate it at any time, but will face the consequences you accepted when you accepted the contract.And it's worth noting that individually, you're still free to say and support what you want.Sure, the question is whether the state should be able to force contracts to discriminate against particular political beliefs or types speech. Personally I don't think they should, you apparently do.They already do and have since the inception of government contracts.  And you absolutely do think that they should, because I suspect that if Texas awarded a contract to Richard Spencer and defended itself by saying he offered the best bid and his private behavior was nothing of their concern, you'd be perturbed.What consequence is sufficient to count as a restriction by the government?When you're sitting there minding your own business, say something unapproved to whatever audience you can reach, and face a legal consequence.  Not when something you say triggers elements of a contract you accepted.Feel free to have the last word.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":" What about some Tulsi Gabbard smears?They don't want to elevate her name and risk her running in the GOP primary in 2028.

If you're making something historically inaccurate, I think there has be something more focused on saying \\"this is not historically accurate\\".Braveheart is a great movie and so is the Patriot. But they are not as accurate as you'd think.Netflix's docudrama 'Queen Cleopatra' was panned by many for claiming to be representing history, but really having sources that were...not historically accurate to say the least.Netflix's \\"The King\\" is inaccurate in terms of characters/characters deaths in the battle (Falstaff, The Dauphin) but overall the movie itself was enjoyable and had some great depictions of Agincourt. Napoleon had...Napoleon fire cannonballs at the Pyramids. Never was that recorded but obivously that would piss off a huge amount of people who would use that as an excuse to hate Napoleon (I think there are better reasons to hate him). Enemy at the Gates, bought a lot of attention to the Stalingrad war, but added in tons of things that weren't verified or simply untrue such as the German sniper or him thinking the girl was dead and not finding out she had survived until years later after the war.I think historical inaccuracy in regards to \\"Oh they used a sword with this handle which wasn't invented\\" during a battle is fine since the overall battle/story is the historical plot. I even think them using trebuchets in Gladiator 2 was fine (though me knowing it was inaccurate made me chuckle). But when it switches to changing the literal face of history, such as Gladiator 2's \\"twist\\" taking place over teh course of a few days when really that was a few years, is when it gets kind of dumb.Even Gladiator 1 was an enjoyable movie, though Commodus dying to a random general in the arena was inaccurate, there are those who didn't realize that.  \\nI think a great movie to look at for period piece is Master and Commander. For the most part it takes place during a \\"war/years of war\\" where the events are possible/plausible, with characters that are not based on real characters so you're not changing history. And the technology/uniforms/etc itself are extremely accurate so you get an idea of what life was like then for those people rather than someone trying to show you the specific life of a specific person or event and getting it wrong. Overall, historically inaccurate minor things like technology usage/uniforms/battle tactics are minor nitpicks and annoyances, but don't change the course of history. Historically inaccurate things like deaths of characters, battles that didn't happen, race swaps, time being scrunched into a much shorter thing change the actual perception of the historical event and knowledge overall.","title":"CMV: Historical Accuracy in Media Doesnt Matter as Much as People Think"},{"text":"Shit, I called here it ten+ years ago, in the early days of theredpill and such.

Theyre rarely trying to be accurate, nor should they be. These stories use the appearance of history to create an immersive atmosphere, and thats enough.Which is perfectly fine... as long as it's made explicitly clear that this is so: That this is not History, but rather a fictional version of history, made for the story.The problem happens when people watch these 'fictional histories'... and believe that's how *real* history went.  Sure, there's a disclaimer saying it's fictional... but who reads those?  And, as the saying goes: 'seeing is believing'.  If we witness something, we tend to believe it on a primal level, even if the 'intelligence' part of our brain is telling us it isn't necessarily true.So, if you show someone enough 'fictional histories', they'll start to believe them. Partly because many people don't have another source of information about history, other than perhaps a dry history book in school. This is related to the idea that if you 'tell a big enough lie, and say it loud enough, people will start to believe it'.Oh, and remind me again, what was one method 'Big Brother' used to control people in 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'??

I'm not calling men who try to be masculine sociopaths, the idea of masculinity is a notion that tries to get men to act sociopathic or live up to standards that only a sociopath would find easier to live up to. Also, I'm not demonizing sociopaths, it is possible some members of your family had sociopathic tendencies, especially if they were involved with the military or special forces especially.The way you describe them is similar to what I witnessed, maybe a bit more toxic though sure in my case, the men I'm thinking of were charming and hard working but I saw another side as well - That the women or friends who hung all over these men because of what these type of men gave them - One of them was cheating on his wife with no one else none the wiser, one would quickly go into a mode of violence to \\"protect his girlfriend or others around him\\" when the way he handled it wasn't called for etc. other examples such as things like these, I've witnessed myself. I saw through the person they are, and others just struggled and were criticized harshly when they showed weakness, such as not being able to provide, or even just simple things like crying or not being able to fix something simple in the house.Thing is, just because they live on principle and are able to abide by it, it doesn't mean they are inherently good. It's the image of good. Men who are not sociopathic have a harder time being like this, and being able to do successfully what the better example of masculine men in the family were - these guys would develop what other masculine men see as weaknesses, and they would make them feel less than, not realizing that maybe that way of life isn't suited for them. Roles are dangerous things, and masculinity as a concept is one of them. It causes loneliness in most men, depression, and anger because from the day they were a kid they kept being told to man up or stop being a pussy etc. It's a very subtle thing... Not a lot of people know how to honestly deal with problems, without becoming shut off and developing grit and a hard way of thinking about and dealing with life...

You're still allowed to say what you want, you just may have to sacrifice a business relationship with the government just as you might with any other customer.Okay, so you don't think the government would be violating anyone's rights if they, for example, said that black people couldn't get contracts?  What about banning contracts with people or organizations that support the NAACP?  Is that okay?Just because the consequence of said political speech is not getting a government contract (or being prevented from expressing political speech for fear of losing a contract or job you already have) doesn't mean it's not a restriction.in accordance with the contract you agreed to.  This is a business relationship, and I certainly agree that Texas changing the terms mid-contract was unconstitutional.Sure, the question is whether the state should be able to force contracts to discriminate against particular political beliefs or types speech.  Personally I don't think they should, you apparently do.And my point is that your speech is not legally restricted when the only consequence involved is a lost customer.What consequence is sufficient to count as a restriction by the government?

So he dropped women, instead trying to win men in 2024 and he won.Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. **Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.**https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdfThe issue is that there still exists plenty of men who believe women should remain under coverture law.

That seems pretty blatantly targeted at opponents of Israel.  Whether it's constitutional or a violation of relights or not, it's still a legal restriction on criticism of Israel specifically that does not apply to any other political movement.Besides this isn't even touching on efforts to redefine anti-semitism to include virtually any criticism of Israel or radical Zionism, which definitely has problematic free speech implications.\\nyou are entitled to criticize Israel to your heart's content, but if you do so in conjunction with the BDS movement you might not get a government contract to which you were never entitled.

Personally I think that shouldn't be the case and it's the exact reason why a Texas anti- BDS law was ruled unconstitutional by the court of appeals.Again, my point wasn't to say that nobody is ever allowed to criticize Israel, it's that there are legal restrictions in the US targeting political speech critical of Israel specifically.

Gender is not being invoked because you've isolated out that variable. A mother is not \\"manning up\\" because she isn't a man. Her responsibility as a parent is being invoked. If she fled instead of defending her daughter, we would ask, \\"What kind of mother are you?\\" and not, \\"What kind of man are you?\\" There's no contradiction here.In this situation, delegation based on gender implies increased responsibility on the man because of differences in physical ability. Strength is fairly unique in this regard, as the disparities between men and women are vast. We could go into that if needed, but the gist is that even women two standard deviations above the mean struggle to equal the average man.Those differences only exist at population levels. Take any two randomly selected individuals people, and their magnitude of their differences is larger than the differences in averages. These gender studies are super flawed, and the way they are communicated to the public is problematic.Sure, they're heuristics, and that implies heavy limitations. However, these heuristics are undoubtedly useful in navigating our environment and reflect common experiences. No one goes through life without using heuristics, and discussing people in terms of heuristics is necessary and unavoidable. They're effective models, if you understand their limitations.In any case, it's my understanding that gendered social roles are not going away because men and women understand they can't perfectly co-occupy symmetrical social roles. Gender roles are asymmetrical because men and women are asymmetrical. If your situation doesn't conform to traditional gender roles, that's perfectly fine. But these asymmetries persist, and ignoring them only tends to exacerbate the problems associated with them without offering viable alternatives.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

You cooked bloody!"},{"text":"I think if you dropped the race baiting in this post you'd still have a narrative. A. Vivek Ramaswamy is a scam artist - TrueAll politicians are scam artists. They do it in business, they do it in court, they do it in labs, they do it to get votes. It is less about ethics or integrity and more about winning at all costs. Buzzwords like Freedom and Rights are the currency of all politicians.B. Vivek Ramaswamy wants foreign labor as a cheap alternative. - TrueBut this is a basic math problem. American cost of living is high, various sources put it between 7th and 14th in the world. Countries like Switzerland, Denmark, and Ireland have higher cost of living, as does Israel and Singapore. But beyond that most of the countries with higher cost of living are Islands with the cost of goods increased through the logistics of an island economy.Meanwhile - India is one of the lowest costs of living.Cost of Living is a somewhat subjective number, because it needs to take into consideration living standards and expectations of those people in those countries. The US not only assumes infrastructure as a need, but also technology like internet and mobile phone service as a basic need. Other countries with lower costs of living may achieve this by living in a way that would be undesirable for those that are used to paying more. Still others like Switzerland have a higher cost of living than the US but also have a higher average income. Switzerlands Cost of living is about 25% higher, but their average incomes are also 18% higher than the US. So the difference feels more like 7% than the total costs per month suggests.C. America falls beyond in STEM fields (Science Technology, Engineering, Math). Countries like China (3.5M) and India (2.5M) are literally churning out MILLIONS of people educated in STEM fields, while the US is only 820k. By comparison to percentage of students China has 41% of their students in STEM compared to the US at 20% according to a study done at Georgetown University. We can't have our cake an eat it too. We can't fail in scientific literacy and then wonder why other countries surpass us in science. D. For example RACE, which much of this post is about is NOT a scientific concept at all. Skin color does have a genetic component, but it is a fairly arbitrary designation in terms of social importance. Yesterdays target of hate is now todays \\"White\\" man (Irish, Italian). You might know some people that are Arab and you just thought they were \\"Mediterranean.\\" Words like Aryan and Causcasian have origins in Asia. So I doubt we would all agree what the term white even means. E. Chicken or the Egg - Are Americans truly unscientific and unteachable or is this just something the tech guys are telling us? Are they creating the problem or just telling it like it is? I suggest the later. The numbers of STEM students, and more tellingly the percentage of total US student in a STEM field (20%) seems to be a pretty obvious indicator or where we stand Tech wise. While I think it is true that Elon and Vivek can save money by hiring educated foreigners. I think that there is also matter of quality from foreign sources that make these people generally more eager to work harder. They may have lived without this technology and therefore see the tech as a path forward rather than a constantly evolving expectation as those in developed countries have come to take for granted.F. America the Land of Opportunity - Americas super power is the desire for others to visit, live and even migrate and become citizens. We are basically the Popular kid that everyone wants to be friends with more because of what America can do for them than true admiration. And like wise America uses these other people too. There is a pattern that you see in history. Self Made Successful People breed ungrateful children. They work hard, they succeed, they are compensated well, perhaps the next generation picks up some good habits, but by the 3rd generation they never knew struggle and lost that thirst for more. Humans thrive in struggle, not comfort. And so America needs to feed off that struggle from around the world to feed their success. Because those that already live here feel like it's their right to this country, rather than something they need to work for. Of course that is not ALL of Americans. That is why the rich like to tell the most disadvantaged Americans that it is the immigrants causing the problems. If these people put as much effort into Science Technology Engineering and Math as they do falling for the rich mans lies about hating the foreigners. We wouldn't need to import that work.","title":"Vivek is a literal scam artist. He's a smooth talker like Barak Obama and people fall for his smooth talk and charm. He is a duplicitous opportunist.

How is it a trauma response? Don't cry when you're truly sad, by being made fun of and called a loser and the f word, you get traumatized into conforming. You are super prickly and defensive and willing to fight to save face? Because you've been traumatized by family bullies who are viciously enforcing masculinity, and will do anything to prove how tough you are. You treat women like shit? Probably because the family treats women like shit and you get treated like those women if you don't conform. It seems like ideal masculinity is not a static mode of being. Masculinity must be proven over and over again. The perfect macho man is not really even human, it requires you to crush and trample so much of your true feelings, so much of your real self, to be this abstract, unhealthy ideal of what it means to be a man. I've personally thought that a lot of this was to make men more willing to leave their wives and kids to fight in war. If you never respect your wife or really let yourself be human and emotional with your children, it won't be that hard to leave to fight. And if you're tough and unfeeling, I guess you'll be a better soldier.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

It's a given for most people circa 2024. What you've just said though, is rather extravagant. You're under the impression that a global crisis is *exclusively* the purview of one strongman in Russia? Geopolitically, how would that even make sense? The war effort is massive and is in no way being carried out without significant resources from satellite states and loose alliances. The reduction of all meaningful political discourse to naming this loud blowhard or that loud blowhard and pointing at them isn't helping. A proxy war does not continue for this amount of time, in active and protracted struggle, without serious vested interests on either side stoking the furnace. And, by the way, the seated Democrat party is funnelling large volumes of support into *two* proxy conflicts, currently. Is Putin's fragile ego why we're allowing the Israel crisis to become a protracted mess of human rights violations? Or do you think there's maybe some other, less transparent reason behind our continued support for that particular nation? It isn't \\"reluctan[ce] towards Ukraine\\" that's undermined the effectiveness of the war effort, it's that European nations have been unwilling or unable to stand alongside us with sanctions and sequestration due to the stranglehold Russia has on energy on the continent. Besides Putin's ego? There are several things at play. Recompense for the breakup of the Soviet Union, for one. Russia's centuries-long play for direct and easy Black Sea access is another. The waning internal power of a value extracting economic system in Russia creating the need for more resources (human and otherwise) to keep the pyramid upright.

Someone who was slandered can go to court saying \\"Here is this false thing that was said about me, here is proof that it was false, here are the damages I incurred as a result, make me whole.\\" Someone who was defrauded can say \\"Here is the false thing that was said to me, I relied on it and this harm was done, make me whole.\\" Or in the case of incitement to violence, the government can say \\"He advocated for these specific acts, this other person took this specific act, harm was done, we're holding him responsible for incitement to violence.\\" In these cases people can go to court, openly discuss the truthfulness of statements and the harm that resulted.

Like, think about a firefighter running into a burning building. In that moment, you want someone whos got strength and courage, right? Someone who can put their emotions on pause and just handle the situation. Focus on the task, not on themselves. Lets be honest, someone asking for a safe space isnt exactly gonna help in that scenario.Now, dont get me wrongemotions do matter. But there are times when being able to temporarily put them aside is absolutely necessary. That doesnt mean guys should suppress everything all the time or avoid their feelings altogether. Its about balance. Oversharing every little emotion or relying too much on venting isnt always the healthiest move either. Theres a middle ground here, and each person needs to find their own middle ground.Honestly, this obsession with emotional hygiene or whatever can backfire too. Like, if all youre doing is navel-gazing and overanalyzing your feelings without actually doing anything, thats not really helping anyone.And lets not forgetdifferent men thrive in different ways. Some guys are at their best when theyre out there taking on challenges, pushing themselves, breaking limits. Others are more introspective and thrive in quieter, more reflective spaces. Both are valid. A lot of dudes recharge through solitudenot isolation, but intentional alone time to think, reflect, and reset. That might not work for everyone, but sharing your feelings or doing Reki, is not the ALWAYS the best way for men process stuff successfully.It's a myth that men are somehow less effective at dealing with tramua than women. They often deal with it differently. Some men don't deal with it well. Some women also don't deal with their stuff well too.What Id love to see is a society that teaches young men to be strong and resilientlike, how to actually handle lifes curveballs without immediately turning to meds or quick fixes every time theyre feeling low. But at the same time, weve gotta stop acting like all men need to fit into one mold - whether it's the maculine one OR the more feminine mold.More sensitive, emotionally in-tune guys shouldnt be forced to live up to outdated expectations that dont match who they are. The real issue isnt masculinity itselfits immaturity or the toxic behaviors that come with certain versions of it - and certain suffocating versions of femininity too. The answer isnt to ditch masculinity altogether; its to modify it. Keep the good stuff, toss the harmful crap, and lets move forward.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

The legislative branch isnt much better, with only 8.3% of the 120 seats in the Knesset occupied by non-Jews, even though they make up 25% of the population. Women are also underrepresented, making up only 25% of the Knesset, almost the same number of women in parliament as in Iraq. Unlike Tunisia which has 31%, a country which Middle Eastern Progressives actually look up to which also allows abortion at will, meanwhile Israel only allow it to preserve health like Saudi Arabia and Iran.","title":"CMV: Absolute Free Speech is both stupid and a lie"},{"text":"This is huge cope for someone stuck in the 90s.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"It doesn't matter.

If you are a lawyer, and I am wrong about something, please don't correct me. I don't want to be embarrassed. Thanks!)They literally tried to do that and similar ideas, and Biden and the Dems had to give up on the idea because of constant misinformation it would apply to small farmers (despite explicitly only targeting higher amounts to avoid that backlash) https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/02/the-white-house-wants-to-close-a-tax-loophole-used-by-the-ultra-richThe goal is to close a gaping loophole. Wealthy Americans must pay capital-gains taxes of at least 20% when they sell assets. But when assets are inherited, the price at the time of the transfer forms the new basis for calculating capital gains. In this way the ultra-rich can shrink their tax bills: they owe nothing on unsold assets while alive and their heirs then benefit from the stepped-up basis for capital gains. Economists in the Biden administration have calculated that the 400 wealthiest American families pay an average federal income-tax rate of just 8%, far below the rates paid by most in the middle class.A simple way to close this loophole would be to recognise all capital gains upon inheritance. Indeed that was Mr Bidens preference in legislation last year. But opponents tarred it as a death tax that would bankrupt family farms. **Although that charge was unfairalmost all farms would have been below the tax thresholdthe Democrats dropped the idea.**\\nAnd no, it wasn't even just Republicans pushing back. It was the rural Democrats too https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/gop-groups-ad-spins-biden-tax-plan-on-family-farms/Nonetheless, the Biden proposal has met with opposition not just from Republicans, but also from Democrats from rural areas concerned about its impact on farmers. A Wall Street Journal op-ed from former Democratic Sen. Max Baucus  referenced in the ad   warns: Eliminating the step-up would force family businesses and ranchers to liquidate when an owner dies and to lay off employees while bringing in little revenue for Uncle Sam. Baucus said past attempts to create carve-outs for farmers have proven ineffective. We were unable to reach Baucus for further clarification.Notably, one of the leading voices in opposition to the proposal to eliminate the step-up has been Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the very person targeted in the ad.\\nIt's the same thing that happened with the BMIT and this sub/aligned pundits. The Biden admin came up with a clever workaround they thought would be more popular to fix it, and it got unfairly tarred as a simplistic capital gains tax when it actually had some interesting provisions in it to help solve classic criticisms and no one gave a shit.","title":"The \\"Buy, Borrow, Die\\" Method: Succs Beware"},{"text":"Non-paywalled link:\\nhttps://archive.is/2024.12.30-054743/https://www.ft.com/content/350ba985-bb07-4aa3-aa5e-38eda7c525dd","title":"What the year of democracy taught us, in 6 charts: The billions who voted in 2024 sent an angry message to incumbents, and warmed to populists on left and right"},{"text":"Trumps 2020 loss couldnt have gone any better in the end.

What precisely is the difference between \\"absolute freedom of speech\\" and freedom of speech?  The only conceivable and honest answer must be that freedom of speech is like absolute freedom of speech, but with various restrictions that make it not exactly free.I can *say* I'm in favor of freedom of speech, but if I start making exceptions I'm not actually for that.  I'm for permissive controlled speech.However, I personally believe that one's freedom ends where it encroaches on the freedoms of others.This doesn't mean anything.  Two people can claim to agree with it in principle while disagreeing on virtually every practical point based on disparate understandings of legitimate freedom.  For example: you obviously don't regard freedom of expression as fundamental and inherent, but rather contingent.  So you're willing to ban certain speech to protect the freedom to not be exposed to misinformation - I think that's absurd, but we can still both credibly say we believe your initial claim.Absolute free speech is paradoxical issue because it would allow speech that advocates for the suppression of speech itself, such as calls for censorship or authoritarian rule.That isn't really a paradox.  If someone appeals to their right to freedom of speech while calling for suppression of speech, it would be hypocritical.  But there is nothing contradictory, paradoxical or hypocritical about someone advocating for freedom of speech saying \\"yes, that too.\\"  You're misapplying the paradox of tolerance.that doesn't mean far-right parties or remnants of old regimes should have the right to participate in it.I mean...they will whether you want it or not.  They'll do it under other guises or in extra-political ways; de-Baathification in Iraq proved that when former Baathists caused a bit of a ruckus after being kicked out of Iraq's government and military.One of the most important benefits of free speech is *clear sight.*  People are allowed to say what they think, and you in turn know what they think and so know what your real political situation actually is.  Without that, you're simply betting that, just because you've excluded them from your field of view, the ideologies you want to ban won't one day grow strong enough that your ban just doesn't work.Germany has extremely stringent speech laws that were aimed at preventing the existence of a politically ascendant far right.  The AfD nevertheless exists and ascends.  Did the laws work?Historically, unrestricted hate speech has contributed to atrocities. During the early years of post-2003 Iraq, the US under Bremer and later through Al Maliki let sectarian TV channels and media outlets to be completely free. Which fueled tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, contributing to the violence that accrued.Yes, if only there had been more suppression of sectarian media, the conflict between Sunni and Shia in post-Saddam Iraq wouldn't have blown up.Come on dude.  That's wishful thinking at best.Even in societies like the United States, where free speech is a fundamental right, certain speech, especially in politically sensitive contexts (such as criticism of foreign governments like Israel or criticism of a formerly oppressed group), can face legal restrictions.....what are you talking about?  There is no legal restriction on criticizing Israel or \\"formerly oppressed\\" people.

They are 100% the ones behind it all and suddenly global events and politics make complete sense when you research with that fact in mind.  Most or all of the elite today are Jesuit educated (and there are only like 27 Jesuit out of thousands of colleges/universities in the USA).This society has always been up to no good, they were behind the gunpowder plot in the 1600s to overthrow the government by literally blowing up UK Parliament. There are many more events like this around the world in history that they were held responsible for.In 1773 due to their worldwide shenanigans they were suppressed by the church and Catherine the Great preserved them, hiding them in secret masonic lodges then in 1776 the Illuminati formed.  132 days later the United States was officially declared.  They also practise kabbalah, due to the scottish rite of freemasonry being the secret society they adopted some of their practises during their suppression, of which numerology and gematria is included which I want to spread the word about.Today they broadcast this all over the world because of technology being lead by the likes of Bill Gates in the early days who is a Jesuit Puppet (look up Melinda Gates family) they have set it up exactly how they need to carry out their religious rituals for the entire world to see.  \\"William Henry Gates\\" = 201 like the founder of the Jesuits, \\"Ignatius of Loyola\\", and like the current (and first ever) Jesuit Pope, \\"Jorge Mario Bergoglio\\" all equal 201 by this code, proof to the theory that many or all celebrities/elites are born into these roles.  This Pope has just made [Suite 201](https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-francis-live-vatican-guesthouse-not-papal-apartments) his new home in the Vatican, the building's name is \\"Domus Sanctae Marthae\\" which equates to 201.  For the record the founder of the Jesuits \\"Ignatius of Loyola\\" = 201.201 is important to them because the jesuit order were suppressed to 201 Priests during their suppression.  The Bill Gates sponsored Pandemic Simulation that conveniently took place just before Covid was called Event 201 !!The Jesuit Order = 201, Order of Illuminati = 201. State of Israel = 201.

[English Cipher is default](https://gematrinator.com/calculator) - they standardised the English language on a global scale via education, and the Gregorian (12 month/52 week) calendar was created by Jesuits and they now use both combined using Gematria.I can provide a [Youtube link](https://youtube.com/@gematriaeffectnews1983?si=IGSBUu2ZMmNcY1DB) to a channel explaining how and why they code numbers into words, dates, people, exposing them and when you actually realise they almost have the population brainwashed into thinking these rituals are only coincidences when called out, you just got to look it up and realise the amount is statistically impossible to be random as many believe, but I feel that's because they haven't taken the time to investigate the historical important of numbers/letters to the Jesuit Order (and many other) religion/societies (cults..)I'll add lastly its probably why 2001 (numerically equalling 201) was chosen as the year, and 9/11 being due to Genesis 11:9 was the last part about the tower of babel falling [putting the 'script' into the word scripture.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011%3A1-9&amp;version=NIV). \\nThe Holy Bible = 201.  Vatican = 119.  The rabbit hole only gets deeper from here so if you read this with an open mind, you'll see it can only be a so called coincidence so many times before it becomes a pattern.

The democrats dont care about liberation of people, they care about using you to perpetuate their neoliberal capitalist ideals. They have literally supported a genocide, so no they dont care. The same is true of the republicans, except they are more outright fascist. We are seeing the same thing there with the MAGA crowd being ripped about by the fact that their billionaire supporters dont actually care about their views and just want exploitative labour in the form of h1b visas. And no Im not an advocate for a totalitarian dictatorship of the proletariat, we see the same problems in state socialist societies - Stalin, Mao, pot etc. Once the workers are elected into power, they are no longer the working class and are part of the ruling class. To quote anarchist philosopher Mikhail Bakunin - when the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called the peoples sticks.

This is mainly due to the growth in the number of wind farms and solar panels. This is reported by Energieopwek.nl, which keeps track of the production of electricity. Of the total amount of electricity generated in 2024, 54 percent of renewable sources come as solar, wind and biomass. Last year, the sustainable share was 50 percent. The total production of green electricity is 121 terawatt-hours this year. That is 11 percent more than last year. The growth is partly due to the fact that two offshore wind farms have gone into operation. In addition, more people have laid panels on their roof. In eight of the twelve months, the share of green electricity was greater than 50 percent, with April as an outlier. At that time, 68 percent of the electricity was generated with renewable sources. The low point was November, when only 38 percent of the electricity was green. This was due to little wind and cloud. **Windmills and solar panels are regularly off** The increase in the amount of green electricity could have been a bit bigger this year if panels and windmills were not so often turned off. This happens when the power grid is too full or there is not enough demand, creating a surplus. In such a situation, energy suppliers decide to temporarily stop wind and solar parks, because they simply cannot lose the electricity generated. The green electricity that has not been generated by this would have been enough to provide 2.5 percent of the total consumption of the Netherlands in the whole year. If there is a surplus of electricity, the price can fall so far that it becomes free or even has a negative price. In the latter case, you will receive money to use electricity. This has been happening more and more often in recent years. For example, electricity was free or negatively priced for 316 hours in the entire previous year. This year it has risen to about 450 hours.!ping BENE&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/8x7oun7p96ae1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=156846a24f6b65093f56d59314bd0fe60c5ab407","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/c57wb94j96ae1.jpeg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0e01fc9f4ef7eee2658efcf8447c94af4d2a3e","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I only care about the basement of the Alamo!","title":"Andy Kim says he worries Jan. 6 has been papered over"},{"text":"Ok and in return, you get ISIS RESURGENCE!","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If you massively increased the number of worms, you would see a very significant decline in wages, yes, probably of more than 90%","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thanks for remaining us that we live in hell","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"New year new me","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"NEVER","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ah, fuck.

I recognize that this is an appeal to authority-type argument. For your central claim, glucose is not bad for you. All animals have globose in all of their cells at all times and it is the major chemical used for energy transmission and metabolism. EXCESS dietary glucose is bad for you, ie diabetes, but this isnt the same thing. Fat isnt bad for you, as you point out, but excess dietary fat can be bad for you and make you gain weight, increase the incidence of cardiovascular issues, etc. iron isnt bad for you, and is necessary for health, but excess iron is bad for you. I think you are making a very black-and-white understanding out of a topic that is full of nuance. Further, red meat has been directly linked to many negative health outcomes like cardiovascular risks and stroke risks. Most doctors will say that people should eat less red meat, definitely not exclusively red meat. I also think the idea of an optimal diet is futile. One of the greatest strengths of human eating patterns is how adaptable we are to a wide range of foods. The idea of an optimal diet, optimal lifestyle, optimal workout, etc ignores the fact that to optimize something you need a set outcome with clearly definable and weighted components, and that health does not match these criteria. There are many,many diets that can yield identical health outcomes, so it isnt really something that can be optimized. Lastly, the fact that Olympian vegans exists also negates your main point. The exact opposite diet of the one you advocate can lead to the highest levels of human performance. Veganism has also been linked to lower likelihood of chronic diseases and longer lifespans.","title":"cmv: a carnivorous diet is optimal for human health"},{"text":"well usually there is that primary thing","title":"The Democrats Have a Woman Problem"},{"text":"This is why we keep losing elections.

Sociopaths may not follow direction or rules. But i've come to realise that male gender expectations come from capitalism and prioritising productivity that generates revenue. Men were encouraged to be the perfect working, unfeeling soldiers, with the promise that one day it'll pay off - women were kept at home, making sure the husband has no unpaid labour to distract him from making money for the system, and make plenty of babies who can also one day grow up and join the system. Think of the richest man in the world, crying about low birth rates. Why would this affect him? Why would it bother him that there might eventually be less people in the world available to buy his products, work in his factories, and create more disparity between the low and high earners by overloading the purposefully underfunded services and forcing people to go private with everything and supplement their low living quality with meaningless products? Why would he care that there are less people available to accumulate limitless wealth for the elite? Why would he care that less people are available to join the military force? They might have wanted men to be sociopathic to a degree, because thats what you have to do to make money. They wanted women to remain in as weak a stature as possible and create their next generation of workers. But gender barely comes into it anymore. They sell what we buy, which has ranged from decades of misogyny to the recent misandrist trend. Whatever makes them money, they will take. Taylor Swift talking about domestic violence? Money. Chappel Roan screaming femininomenon into the void? Money. Barbie movie? Money. 15 years ago we were looking at women being degraded on the constant for laughs. Why? Money. In a world where they are automating labour and raking in revenue from all sorts of new media, it makes sense that gender expectations change. We are gradually seeing that happen. It's just happening a lot slower than it is for women, because men aren't exactly banding together to shed unhealthy gendered expectations - largely due to those traits still being expected and rewarded in many ways, despite the now limited need for gender roles overall. Capitalism demands many of the traits that are expected of men, so while women can now adopt them, there's little incentive for men to work less, do more parenting and unpaid labour, and become more emotionally vulnerable - those things don't earn money, and don't register as a source of reward.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

YIMBYs are just objectively right, the statistical case in their favor is incontrovertible. But in cities across the country, you cant build a duplex on a parking lot, without progressive orgs descending from the rafters to sue to stop it. And progressive politicians are broadly against reform. They cite the typical left-NIMBY arguments, complaining about imaginary empty houses, and proposing a rotating array of convoluted ownership restrictions, that would accomplish nothing even if they got passed.That ties into degrowth and decels. But thats a separate rant. The second is the habit of throwing money at problems, and aversion to reform of those systems. The most prominent example is California high speed rail, but you can find similar instances with the post-pandemic stimulus. Huge amounts of money get allocated to the problem, but NEPA lawsuits and the like means that the projects get massively delayed, and money gets wasted. Progressives have been strongly against gutting NEPA, and instead have been throwing money at these stalled out projects for over a decade in some instances, with no intention of fixing the issue thats stalled them.Third there is Lisa Khan. Shes lost basically every case shes filled, because rather than actually enforce the law, shes waging an anti-business harassment campaign.Fourth, Biden has been way too friendly to unions. From the port union, that is directly hurtling American consumers across the country, to the various unions he funneled money towards, that ended up voting for Trump anyway.

For upsides, you get general economic improvement, particularly because allowing people to move freely creates a more efficient market. You have lower costs, because you no longer have to put as much effort into keeping people out. You actually get more effective at identifying wrongdoers, because anyone entering for legitimate cause will just use the big fancy door that's easy to get through. And, arguably the biggest benefit, it's good for the immigrants. They want to come here in search of a better life, and, all other things being equal, we should give it to them. Along these same lines, it benefits the people who would otherwise still be here, but undocumented. They can interact with civic structures without risk. And they're made more capable of paying taxes, which is nice.As for downsides, the only one that seems marginally credible is that large immigrant populations seem to have temporary and localized negative impacts on poorer populations. I don't think it's a huge impact, and, as stated, the effect seems to go away over longer time spans and is not harmful to employment in a broad sense, but it's definitely a harm. That said, if you want to create a bigger and more effective policy, well, we just got a big boon to the economy from all these immigrants coming here. If we wanted to, we could literally give that surplus capital to those displaced. We could also create something a bit less direct if we wanted.

In fact, my personal opinion is that strength comes from women.Women are more than capable of achieving both the positive and the negative sides of this behavior youre describing: overly competitive, narcissistic, etc. But these negatives are side effects of leadership behavior. Women more often than not are required to set aside their personal concerns or weaknesses and sacrifice their needs for the ones they love or for the greater good. \\nBeing competitive very often is conflated with being maliciously cruel; the reality is that competition comes from scarcity - and to be competitive means securing your resources for the sake of protecting what matters most to you.\\nOf course, for some, that means protecting egos and satiating insecurities. \\nFor others, that means ensuring your children have enough money in their college funds to have a secure future.These traits are neither exclusive to nor unique to masculinity. Women have been competing and protecting their children since the dawn of time  we have just collectively forgotten this role in motherhood &amp; womanhood.If I were to redefine masculinity &amp; femininity, it would be this: Feminine is:\\n- The judge of aesthetics &amp; ethics\\n- An active self-presentation (i.e. one chooses to feminine by performing feminine behaviors)\\n- Prioritizing grace over severityMasculine is:\\n- A catalytic force for change\\n- A passive self-presentation (i.e one chooses to be masculine by *not* performing feminine behaviors)\\n- Prioritizing efficiency over aestheticsNot perfect, though, and men may choose to disagree. Its probably mainly up to men to decide what masculinity means.So TLDR: in addition to agreeing that strength/masculinity is not always (in fact generally not at all) sociopathic, its also not inherently the case that strength and competitiveness is masculine.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

The issue isn't about being against skilled immigration - it's about mega corporations abusing the system to drive down wages.The real conservative position should be against how these visas are being exploited by big tech companies. They're essentially using H1B as a form of corporate welfare, creating a captive workforce that can't easily switch jobs or negotiate better pay. That hurts the free market.Even Trump's admin tried to reform H1B to prioritize higher-paid workers and crack down on body shops gaming the system. The problem isn't the immigrants themselves - it's the crony capitalism letting huge corporations exploit loopholes.And comparing H1B to asylum is comparing apples to oranges.

Crushing the bargaining power of skilled labor through an international labor force makes it hard to keep your union strong, and democrats are pro-union, for one simple example.So, a sanctuary city for people who fled the drug war and are already here might not want to invite a bunch of foreign engineers to further erode the value of a US diploma.Personally, I want to allow more immigration, but for people who want to be naturalized, not people who are going to move back after they make a million.

The H1B issue is what proves it"},{"text":"One thing that's worth considering is that the Democrats are a party that consists of different factions, the progressives are one part of the party but they aren't the whole of the party. In any two party system, any major party will be a coalition of different groups of people with different ideological groups. With the leadership of the party looking to meet them in the middle. Progressives are only around 6% of the American electorate, it would be unrealistic for progressives to expect the remainder of the Democratic Party to unilaterally bend the knee to them and give up their own interests in the broad Democratic coalition. Elections are also won at the margin, and you're competing for the votes for people who may otherwise vote Republican in close elections, suffice it to say those people are not dyed in the wool left-wingers looking for strongly left-wing change.I also want to add that progressive policies are facing many headwinds right now. We recently had a surge in left-wing values and beliefs playing a much larger role in our culture, and there was a backlash accordingly. People did not want to see their police departments defunded and property crime and public disorder tolerated, as many progressives wanted. For example, in San Francisco - one of the most left-wing places in America -  voters recalled their left-wing DA and left-wing school board members largely because the voters viewed their policies as extreme and destructive.Progressive economic policy as well is also facing numerous headwinds. Most progressive economic policies are effectively calls for the massive new government spending programs, be it Medicare for All, tuition-free public college, etc. However, never articulated a way of paying for this without drastically increasing deficits and the national debt. For example, a lot of progressives point to the Nordic model as an example to follow but never talk about how the average person paying an effective tax rate of nearly 50% of their income makes their expansive government possible, and how taxes there largely impact the middle class - notably a Value-Added Tax (VAT) on all goods sold. American progressives, on the other hand, mostly seem to believe that we can build an expansive welfare state without these broad based taxes and seem to think that we can do so by deficits and only heavily taxing the wealthy. \\nEffectively, progressive economic policies like this would be something that would in aggregate balloon deficits, increase aggregate demand, and hence extremely accelerate inflation if implemented. We already experienced massive government stimulus followed by inflation in the wake of COVID, yet progressives haven't adapted their model of deficit-financed demand-driven economic policy proposals in the wake of this.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"No, we wont have good governance until we vote for good governance.  \\n  \\nLess bad is still bad, and categorically never leads to good.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"r/neoliberal is the main sub for Liberal discourse (Liberal, not leftist), and opinions there are predominantly pro-immigration including H1-B visas.","title":"cmv: Liberals are being hypocritical with immigration.

Democrats vary a lot in terms of attitudes on immigration. Kamala Harris was openly running on doing anti-immigration policies more efficiently than Trump. Both Obama and Biden deported tons of people. I see no evidence that full open borders are particularly popular among establishment Democrats, and I doubt it's all that popular in the party as a whole either. Meanwhile, I do support something like open borders, and people on employment visas would be included in that. Except, y'know, they would no longer need the employment visa, cause that limitation wouldn't be all that present.So, basically, I have no idea who you're seeing advocating both of these ideas. We can't assume the existence of such a person, because neither of these ideas is universal on the left. I can definitely find open borders advocates on the left, and I'm sure there exist Democrats who are opposed to H1B visas, but, if no one is suggesting both, then there is no hypocrisy. You're just finding two people and turning them into one hypocrite.","title":"cmv: Liberals are being hypocritical with immigration.

For the US legal system to work, there has to be some degree of goodwill among all participants.  Trumps people are criminals who exist to abuse the system and blow things up.  Democracy doesnt deal with a critical mass of bad actors particularly well. Its not Garland thats the problem.  It is that democracy is often not agile enough to protect itself.

What ever happened to taking the best, most qualified person for the job? **One in six hiring managers in the US has been told explicitly not to hire white men under any circumstances.** (Lawrence v Texas, which this SC has talked about bringing back)Got any proof or is this just slander?

If they don't have their own company, they can buy shares of another company.To give them tax-free cash to spend on whatever they want to buy, they can borrow as much as they can by using the company shares as collateral. Because it's technically a loan rather than income, there is generally not tax on this receiving of money.In the American version when they die, the beneficiaries receive the shares with a \\"new\\" buy-price as of the time the shares were passed to them, so if they sell the shares at the time they receive them, there would essentially not be any capital gains tax, as it would look like the shares were sold at break even. This is called a **step-up in basis price**, because the base price of the asset gets \\"stepped-up\\" to what is usually the higher price of the asset years after the initial purchase.In most non-American versions, the beneficiaries don't get this price reset but usually get a tax discount if they sell the assets as opposed to if they received the money as income.

Before you get to the wondering too hard bit, your leaders fill your head with so much B.S. about those states you start to think, \\"I may be living in a trailer park with no heat in the winter and no A.C. in the summer, but at least I ain't getting stabbed in New York.\\"That's the simple truth.","title":"Why is the media obsessed with painting New York as an insanely dangerous place."},{"text":"Why??

That is the reality.  In so many different ways, it is more conservative than Europe.  If anything, the country has moved even more rightward in the last 4-8 years.  In the future, the country can indeed become more progressive.  It remains a far more progressive country than it was in the late 1700s and 1800s.  Forcing the progressive ideal on the country at large will result in the Democrats getting decimated in the voting booth.  One core reason I think both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, which has not been talked about, is that both were seen by large swaths of the electorate as radical leftists, while Joe Biden was considered a centrist.  Notice how the progressive 2020 Democratic field yielded to Biden, knowing that a centrist was the Democrats' chance to defeat Trump.Notice that while I did admit that the US can become more progressive in the future, I didn't say the near future.  It's going to take decades at best.  There is a reason the US isn't ready for a female president, a reason that we have prudish attitudes toward breastfeeding and other nudity, and a reason that men are still largely expected to pay for dates in some regions of the country.  It's still a rather conservative country, all things considered.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Personally i take the stance that if you are presenting a option between your candidate and literally Hitler, and the common reaction of the electorate is \\"meh\\", thats really on you more than anything.

But Democrats failed to read the room, they tried to make themselves out as the new Establishment party, *When noone likes the establishment*.We can quibble over exactly where Harris went wrong and whether Biden should have dropped out sooner (he should have, imo, stuck to his 2020 pledge of being a one term president so we could have spent 4 years preparing candidates for 2024), but the simple fact is that Democrats simply do not understand the problems of the average American, trying to handwave and ignore the warning signs there were there a year ago where there were frustrations over the economy, but anyone who dared speak about it was criticized and deemed a doomer. And this perception of the Dems being out of touch has only been reinforced since the election when the Dem's have been trying to sideline Progressives and try to blame everything but themselves for running a losing campaign.","title":"Andy Kim says he worries Jan. 6 has been papered over"},{"text":"I think a big problem is money in politics a lot of the time even if the Democrat wants to go for more progressive points, private interests can decimate there career through donating millions to there opponent.

Biden and his experts came out and said \\"hey we don't think we can legally get this done.  but if congress does it, we will sign it\\".  then he waited, and congress made no serious attempts to do it, even when they controlled the house.  So he tried with an EO... and EXACTLY AS HE PREDICTED, it got shut down.  So he tried again, and the courts intervened again...  we're even now seeing the courts work on blocking his latest attempt.  and yet, despite hi being 100% correct about needing congress or the courts would overturn it, the far left is acting smug like its biden's fault it failed.... this despite not a single bill about relieving student debt being brought in the house, the only place such a bill can legally originate..this has been the story of his entire presidency, congress expecting him to do their jobs for them, then blaming him when their jobs didn't get done. Basically anything he didn't personally go out and push for, didn't get done.the build back better failed, but that was because of the dumbass far left wanting even MORE and not supporting it while it could still pass.  that too somehow became bidens fault.So no, we won't see a more progressive presidency for a very long time than the one we just had, and its the progressives fault","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"right now i own the [my first name].cc URLbut i really really hope they make eepy a TLDimagine going to [my first name].eepy for my portfolio and blog. i need it","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Going to defend Biden on this one, but Joe couldn't have stopped the Supreme Court.

Crystal clear. There's no reasoning and there's no pleasing them. So why would any future politician even try?\\nWe are pretty much boned until the millennials and Gen z die off... Because those that are conservative aren't changing their minds and those that are progressive hate progress unless it's 100% all in one go...

A good number of states have raised their minimum wage since the federal isn't.  States have added programs for free school lunches and even breakfasts for students.  They've added mandatory paid sick leave to the law books.  They've strengthened union protections and laborers abilities to collect unemployment.  A lot of states and cities have made major steps in reforming the way police deal with non-violent crime The fact that all of this gets ignored in order to claim the Democrats aren't progressive just because they're not progressive enough for their tastes is so f problematic. I live in a city with minimum wage well over the 15 that most people are pushing for on the federal level (18.81 starting tomorrow. 17.29 now) and some very successful police initiatives for dealing with the mentally ill and the homeless which involve social workers and for other professionals...Things accomplished by Democrats...

The online progressive left (fauxgressives) want radical change, against the wishes of the majority of the people.

The most prominent exanple of this is the DNC rigged the 2016 primaries, but the evidence for this is ridiculously scant, weebly wobbly, and often depends on dated articles.

Also as I learned about Socialist projects, I learned about the inherent authoritarian nature of it and how detrimental it was for the workers of those countries. If you think Henry Ford's union busting was bad then the Soviet Union's union busting put Henry Ford to shame. In short my personal philosophy overtime evolved to value individualism over collectivism. There's an old saying that you can't begin to love others if you don't love yourself and I feel like that applies in a macro sense as well. If as a society we can't value our own individual selves then how can we begin to value our society as a whole (I have no idea if that makes any sense, I came up with that just now lol).
