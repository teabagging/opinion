In a society in which profit maximization for individuals is the primary imperative, its very difficult to get any sort of collective action in which no one profits from the solution except the commons. We all benefit from living on a planet with functioning ecosystems but no one privately benefits from switching away from fossil fuels.  Provide a sense a timing to this trend - how this negative trend is the result of the \\"late-stage\\" part of capitalism. Basically, show that this problem wasn't as bad beforehand, and is getting worse.Feudal societies obviously weren't emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at the rate we are now. they were also significantly poorer had insane childhood mortality, and burned women for being witches. Capitalism solved a lot of problems from feudalism. But feudalism also solved a lot of problems from slave societies. While being a peasant sucked it was better than being a chattel slave, and while being a worker in the modern day economy sucks, its a hell of a lot better than being a medieval peasant.

I can't make the case that support is entirely cynical, because it's too obviously untrue.First, just because one is in an identity group, does not mean their self-interest is necessarily directly affected by affirmative action.  If they are for instance, an elite performer who is going to get hired regardless of affirmative action policies, their only self-interested consideration is politics.  By supporting or opposing affirmative action, they can bring themselves favour with others actually affected by affirmative action.There are also some careers where white men actually are overrepresented, like STEM, and others where they're underrepresented, like Nursing.  [We already have seen affirmative action for men in universities.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/magazine/men-college-enrollment.html)White men are also more likely than the average member of the population to be diagnosed as disabled or identify as LGBT.White men in general are a bit of a weird case because both detractors and proponents of affirmative action seem to act like affirmative action hurts White Men and I don't really see much evidence that this is true.  Affirmative action seems to not significantly hurt or help white men.I feel the much more direct challenge to my view isn't why White Men support affirmative action, it's [why asian men do](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/), and overwhelmingly so, and even more strongly in younger demographics.  I don't really have a better cynical explanation for this than politics.  Essentially, Asians agree with Affirmative Action in spite of them being hamstrung by it, because the left-wing supports it, and they also support other policies which Asians disproportionately benefit from more like more funding for education and more legal immigration.  It may also be partially explained by what I just said, affirmative action is perceived as an anti white male policy when it's actually an anti asian male policy, so people may be acting based on perception rather than reality.I would be interested if there was any rebuttal to these arguments I just made about Asian Men.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"karma is a cat purring in my lap","title":"Aubrey Plaza endorses Kamala Harris with Grumpy Cat photo after Taylor Swift endorsement"},{"text":"Also **Economy Is Strong:**?Lichtman said \\"the economy is not in a recession\\" and the key is true, good for Harris1. **Economic Growth**: Lichtman said economic growth is far ahead of previous terms making the key true, good for HarrisAnybody with half a brain can tell you neither of these are true.","title":"Alan Lichtman predicts Harris win"},{"text":"So... how about three weeks?

In the 1970s corporate lobbying really intensified and became what it is now, corporations now spend billions every year to curry favor of politicians, typically to curb regulation and gain sympathy for their sector. Also in the 70s, Pacs began to be formed altering being allowed to form not only for concerned citizens but corporations, and these fundraising political organizations soon became large drivers of electoral funding. Eventually Super Pacs were legally sanctioned in 2010, effectively putting 0 limits on a corporations power to spend in order to influence an election. If you believe that that later stage capitalism refers to a point at which corporate capitalism makes it no longer true that there is a free market then you could argue these things hurt that free market in favor of established, increasingly monopolized corporations.

Under capitalism, what keeps prices low is that people will no longer demand the thing if prices are too high, so prices go as high as possible, creating losses to consumers that are unnecessary (consider a profit margin M. M/2 would be better for consumers, but doesn't happen).As capitalism progresses and more and more private firms enter markets and market products, they also create \\"artificial demand\\". A century ago there were very few cereals. Now there are a lot. This is a waste of energy, causes more population, etc. again the increase is correlated with firm growth. In the early 20th century, people didn't eat a large breakfasts and had more stable cortisol levels. Now they arbitrarily eat eggs and bacon in the US because of a PR campaign in the middle of the century. There are tons of things like this that firms will do to create demand for something they are good at making.The longer a society remains capitalist, the more of these products there are made in an uncoordinated, chaotic way.If you prevent firms from being private and have them meet social obligations as well as revenue targets, you do not get this outcome. You can introduce policies that prevent these kinds of market failures. You also eliminate the problem of waste in the non-profit space. Non-profits in capitalism are constantly fighting market forces to stay alive. In non-capitalist markets, every corporation is similar to a non-profit in the way it functions. Had this happened in the 1800s, late stage capitalism could have been avoided in favor of a more stable and prosperous trend.","title":"CMV: \\"Late Stage Capitalism\\" Doesn't Exist"},{"text":"Theyll bury their faces in Tim Pool YouTube clips like one of my buddies from childhood.","title":"Aubrey Plaza endorses Kamala Harris with Grumpy Cat photo after Taylor Swift endorsement"},{"text":"Bill Gates is a  madman","title":"Bill Gates says the world is facing two options: A major war or another pandemic in less than 30 years"},{"text":"I don't know, I was enjoying it.

This means we need to ensure that we have a thriving middle class to support the free market. If we allow wealthy corporations and individuals too much consolation of wealth, then we risk the system collapsing, and we see unsustainable government spending increases to attempt to mitigate the situation. In order to keep government spending in check, we must have a government that ensures the working class get their fair share of corporate profits. While wages have gone up recently, the trend has been that we've seen profitability increase without similar increases in wages. Had we ensured wages rose with profits, we would have a stronger economy today. Furthermore, with AI and automation taking jobs of working class, sooner than we realize we will need to figure out how to adapt our economic system so that it, and our middle class can survive. As it relates to wealthy families/individuals, they must pay their fair share of taxes when transferring wealth to their heirs. The American dream has no place for uber wealthy family dynasties. Heirs to wealthy families benefit indirectly from their family wealth in many ways, as well as directly/monetarily, and that is fine, but we must ensure that when money is being transferred generationally, significant taxes are paid. This  would encourage wealthy to spend/donate more of their fortunes at the end of their life which will further the economy and society at large, while also mitigating the growth of a ruling/ownership class that our forefathers fought to be free of.\\"I think there are many people who feel this way, and I also think that Republican and Democrat are labels that no longer serve our country. I was raised a Democrat and still identify as one, but as I've learned more about economics, hiatory, and have experienced life, (and admittedly become more financially comfortable - still working class not middle but I have low cost of living) my views have grown to appreciate the free market when I used to view it as pure evil/greed. At this point I simply see it a a system that developed after the fall of the feudalism. However, when capitalism is not maintained/updated/regulated, it has the potential to become a new form of feudalism, where wealth/powerful family dynasties have the power to rule over and harm the existence of those who made capitalism possible, which in today's terms would be \\"small businesses\\".However, given that the world has been globalized, and our current level of technology some what (arguably) requires the scale of a massive corporation to function, perhaps we will see another system evolve. Until then, if we can prolong the life of the one we have, and prevent it from being warped back into the one it replaced, our country can retain that which is core to its identity, the American dream that anyone, regardless of their background can achieve success through hard work, determination,and opportunity.

It only hinders it to have the market dominated by a few players who can just determine prices on a whim and not have them be a function of supply and demand.

Why would Asian people support themselves losing a job to a Black or Hispanic people??The reason you see the legal pushback is because conservatives don't like affirmative action and, after citizens united, they have tons of money for political and legal strategies to get the wins in the court. It's why the lead plaintiff for the most recent case was Abigail Fisher, a middling white Texan who wanted to go to University of Texas.

This genocide will end in spite of the liberals, not because of them; and when it does, theyll take the credit for it while redirecting the empires violence towards other targets.Within the empires core, this next phase of the war will manifest as a campaign to purge anti-imperialists.

Such online crackdowns will partly have the purpose of keeping the public unaware of what their government is doing; of how their freedoms are being taken away. The imperial state seeks to prevent the bulk of the masses from learning about Uhuru, or about the other targets within this purge, because the broad masses represent a threat towards the states rule. The drivers of this war rely on their enemies being isolated, and lacking connection with the people. That way, the political ideology which wins out will be liberal fascism.?This kind of fascism isnt just about actively supporting the empire, its also about willful apathy; about being passive amid genocide, or the destruction of our liberties, because taking action would mean handing a win to the perceived enemies. The important thing is to crush the Russians, or the third party voters, or the working masses who are seen as backward. This is the petty and small mindset that the Democratic Party seeks to cultivate. It wont make the states counterinsurgency succeed, though, if we put forth a counter to it. If we rally the broad masses towards anti-imperialist activities, injecting our message of hope, optimism, and justice into the discourse.

For example, Miranda rights are also not specifically in the constitution. The constitution specifies your right to an attorney but, reading it unequivocally, theres no right to BE AWARE of that right. The Supreme Court ruled that this was an unenumerated implicit right. Same sex marriage is also not explicitly in the constitution and in fact its rather unlikely the founders intended for the constitution to protect it. The constitution is very hard to amend, but its also not static. When times change, so does our interpretation of certain rights. Abortion is one of those things. To start, I agree that Roe v Wade was a poor decision. So did Ruth Bader Ginsberg believe it or not. I agree with Ginsbergs theory that basing Roe on the right to privacy was flimsy. This reasoning was always shaky, and it was perhaps the best way to ensure religious people would never accept the decision. Basically to them it was like, you dont have to like my abortion but its none of your business or the governments. That was never going to settle the debate. Roe should have instead based the right to abortion where it was actually found, which is gender equality and equal protection. Abortion laws unfairly target women. Laws the restrict womens reproductive freedoms fundamentally discriminate by sex. Of course, reasoning it this way would have been taboo in 1973. But thats my opinion.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"See, Im pretty sure that DeSantis is a lizard person, but you may be right also.

It sounds like you value the advisors' opinions more than the president's. So why have a president make any decisions at all?It's like being a CEO of a very large company. Most of the day to day work is handled by various departments that are good at what they do, but your job is to provide vision and mediation for the entire company as a whole. Advisors are only useful in their functional area.There are plenty of talented and introverted CEOs. They can build strong competent teams of advisors and managers. The really smart ones avoid interacting directly with the public and instead use a spokesman or PR rep that understands both the company and the public.Which would you rather have in charge: a person who is an expert but can't articulate their thoughts, or a person who is an expert that can?Articulating your thoughts well to a team you know well and knows you well is a *very* different problem to articulating them on a hostile debate stage with extreme stakes.

I meant that your example of \\"Blue is my favorite color\\" is an inconsequential opinion on personal preference. I agree that \\"abortions should be banned\\" is a political opinion, and it seems like those fall into your third category. (or if there is some subset of political opinions that don't fall into that category, I'd like to hear what you think the distinction is.)Saying \\"Congress is bad\\" is a valid opinion. Saying that \\"congress is full of murderers\\" is a loaded statement and deserves scrutiny.The context would be critical for that second statement. It *could* fall into the second category of statement you described, a statement of fact. If so, it deserves what I'd say is the highest level of scrutiny. But it could, for example, be someone saying that because a particular congress voted on some measure supporting a war, they are responsible for the deaths caused by that measure. And that statement deserves complete protection as a matter of free speech, even if it might also warrant criticism. You're completely entitled to tone police people if you think the way they phrase their \\"worldview statements\\" or opinions (going by the more common definition of opinion, not your definition here) is inappropriate or misleading. But that's just countering speech with more speech.Basically because objective lies don't require as much time or effort to disprove. Sure they do. It's easy. If someone pointed out that something you said was an objective lie, you ignore them and continue insisting that it's true. That easily can cause as much overall harm or more than any \\"worldview statements\\" can. Brandolini's law still applies there.It's just crazy to put a statement like \\"Society should take care of the poor.\\" and say it deserves more scrutiny than \\"Holgrin is a child molestor.\\" Do you really think that second one is less potentially harmful for people to spread around because \\"objective lies don't require as much time or effort to disprove\\"?","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"?The election fraud bit only worked because COVID and lockdowns had such a massive portion of conservatives in hardcore conspiracy-mode.The central message of the GOP for 40 years has been that Democratic Party members are inherently illegitimate and can only win to cheat.

What was that bipartisan Strum Thurmond quote again?First - what's this obsession with \\"bipartisanship\\" for its own sake? From the New Deal through the Civil Rights era, the Democratic Party had majority control over the federal government and the majority of the state legislatures. They passed a lot of what we take for granted now. Any Republican that wanted to negotiate were derided as a \\"me too\\" Republican and were ousted out of the party - the father of the RINO movement if you will. What should be important is the content of the public policy.Second - read the book \\"Asymmetric Politics\\" by Grossman. The two parties are not co-equals and aren't equally responsible. The GOP through the REDMAP initiative created super red districts. On top of that, you have decades of argument to that same red base that the democratic party are existential threats and inherently illegitimate. Don't you think the only risk to the Eric Cantor's or John Boehners or Mike McCarthy's of the world is that they compromise with the Dems and get voted out in a super red primary. The politicans are giving the people what they want.Third - your entire premise is \\"the country\\" is comprised of the democratic party or the conservative party. That isn't true. You're right in the sense that the conservative party are expressly rejecting the post-enlightenment liberal order, but they aren't even a plurality of the country. More people are apolitical and more people don't vote than vote for the GOP. The Democratic Party can do a lot of work in various communities through their activism and policies and that would \\"unite\\" the country. I think it's as legtimate to unite those disenchanted with the political system with those Dems who are making the world better. The very reason, in 2008, the GOP spent millions of dollars on the REDMAP project so they can choose their voters and choose to give their voters greater weight and have spent millions more to make voting harder, is they know how unpopular they are.One of the architects of makign voting harder said in 1980: \\"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of the country.

Meanwhile, the news of Taylor's endorsement has had, last I checked, 100 articles at the very least written about it in the span of less than 24 hours. If nothing else, her endorsement is unmissable..her fans, the target audience WILL see it and young people are more suggestible anyway- the reasons they vote and why are so very different from the 30 plus crowd. Voting can sometimes feel like a shared community bonding thing and what a large and active community she has, especially stronger in the last 2 years when she has been non stop touring. Her endorsement certainly wasn't pointless - it may or may not make a big difference but all things considered it was good for morale.Musical artists in general are in people's memories forever and constantly. You listen to music on a loop daily.  Actors, by contrast are in the public memory when they do a film and then they are forgotten.

With AB, she purposefully participated in a planned citizens' takeover of our top legislative building with the express purpose of disrupting government operations at best, and physically harming sitting lawmakers at worst. Which is an insurrection, not a cute act of defiance.  She had a gun pointed at her head and then a bullet put in it because she refused lawful orders to not enter an area where government employees and elected officials were being protected. In that case, by well-skilled and vetted interior Capitol police who had clear protocol they never expected to use in an real, actual coup happening in the nation's capital. She's no hero who even deserves her name mentioned because she's a violent traitor who was pumped up by incendiary rhetoric from her preferred political subgroup. George Floyd died because he spent decades going in and out of street life and got really comfortable committing crimes to feed his drug habits. He encountered another old man that day who came to work with his uniform but too few fucks to give and was put on the ground for being humongous,out of order, and failing to comply with questioning about a petit theft. His lifestyle then caught up with him in the struggle that was admittedly unlawful if done in a way that threatened the life of the suspect. They are not the same. Between the two, one criminal got exactly what they deserved that day.ETA: And Trump said she was killed by an out of control police officer and referred to Capitol Police and lawmakers as \\"the other side\\". It was a \\"disgrace\\" that she was killed. And people did die on the \\"other side\\". Some days later from their injuries, some with their own weapon because the oath they swore to take to protect the government of the United States was useless that day as that very government refused to provide them assistance while being beaten by an angry mob.","title":"I Don't Want to Say It's Over for Kamala Harris...

Isn't something that is mathematically equivalent *quantifiably* equivalent? What meaningful distinction exists? I'm a little confused here.i'll respond to this first because my proficency, if there is any, leans way more towards mathematics than political science/philosophy:it's actually a really interesting topic, they are quantifiably equivalent in a way, but it changes the 'architecture' of the kinds of arguments you make and the 'objects' you're dealing with, making it easier or harder to prove things depending on which 'framework' you're working under. [for example, eliptic curves and modular forms being equivalent was instrumental in proving fermat's last theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles's_proof_of_Fermat's_Last_Theorem)Could you clarify your point about separating worldview from facts? Are you saying that all worldview statements, arguments, etc, are somehow intrinsically tied to facts or a rejection of them? That's an interesting point that I might reward a delta for, though I still think the form of the statements as a statement of fact versus the more complex worldview is important and useful. it's more something along the lines of the way we parse facts in general being dependent upon the worldview 'used', the worldview itself doesn't *have* to be built upon or concerned with what we're calling facts here. so if we bring back the homophobe example, they are judging the exact same experience in the brains of two pairs of people differently because of the way they believe the world is 'ordered' and assumptions about what that experience ought be directed at the reason i brought up the diabetes example before is because it's an innocuous example of the same thing, two people, barring any intervention will have their bodies settle upon an average blood sugar level. but because we care about quality of human life etc. we consider this a problem to be fixed instead of just an observation about the processes in their body taking course, so these two facts are 'valued' differently even though all they are in a base sense is a numerical representation of some state of their body.what im saying here is that the Fact is the 'pure information'(if we don't dig far enough to look at how it's gathered, what assumptions we have to make to do it and how these bodies of knowledge are socially organized), the fact would then be that in addition to being subject to some framework and categorization, which doesn't discount how 'true' we should consider them to be, but is something to keep in mind considering that most \\"fact statements\\" will fall in this bucketA legitimate opinion is a preference for something. Many things I would call a \\"worldview statement\\" (e.g. a conspiracy theory like flatearth) are also sometimes colloquially described as \\"opinions.\\" Often when a person says something like \\"all abortion is murder\\" if we disagree we might say \\"well that's your opinion.\\" This is a correct use of the word, but it's a different meaning of \\"opinion\\" than a \\"preference\\" or approval for things like policy or an official. Someone could say \\"I don't believe we should make policy to combat climate change.\\" That's a valid opinion, but I would argue that it is based on a flawed worldview that rejects scientific facts. But it is still, on its own, a valid opinion statement. would you consider the inverse statements of \\"all abortion isn't murder\\" and \\"the earth isn't flat(making no additional claims beyond that)\\" to be worldview statement?i consider them to be informed by some worldview as well, just ones that are explicitly rejecting fixed ideas like \\"life begins at conception\\" or \\"the earth is this shape\\" in these casesas for the second bit, im not sure whether you consider it a worldview statement or not, is it both an opinion statement and a worldview one?","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"!remindme 2 years","title":"The Cuban regime could collapse in the coming weeks"},{"text":" and has actual laws against racial discrimination?Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, ~~Germany,~~ Spain, Portugal,I'm not 100% sure about Germany.

Yes he has his weird defenders, but \\"Nixon did nothing wrong\\" is not very popular.The cult of Reagan has lasted, but it's a pretty superficial one unconnected to the actual guy. Reagan advocated for gun control laws, for undocumented immigrant amnesty, guest worker programs and pathways to citizenship. If Harris got on stage and gave a speech made word for word out of Reagan quotes, modern republicans would boo her as a commie.In the early 2000s they were changing the name of french fries because France didn't participate in their war and defending George W with their last breath.Now suddenly they're the antiwar party, who never mention George W. They've dubbed their last two presidential candidates before Trump RINOs and enemies.The point here is that for the last half century at least, there has been zero consistency or continuity within the American right over time. There is no reason to believe the current convictions, attitudes and alliances within the right will hold, they are certain to disintegrate and be forgotten.It may take a little more time, but Trump as a two time loser has exhausted them almost as much as he's exhausted us.

Those are conclusions you may not have realized if you just tuned in to preferred echo chambers.

My uneducated guess would be that the feature bans list would kill a lot of the NFA stuff, e.g. if your firearm(s) with a threaded barrel or pistol grip is banned, then you basically have a big expensive tube that used to be a suppressor. Suppressor is useless if the method of installation is outright disallowed.And most of the common NFA stuff would get hit under this too, e.g. automatic/burst AR-15 is banned because all variant AR-pattern are banned. From a skim, I think the only thing that would survive off top of my head is an auto/burst mini-14, so long as it doesn't have folding stock, pistol grip, or flash suppressor. Magazines have never fallen under that scope in the first place, so they would have to re-tool what is allowed under that license, and then you'd still have to contend with what firearms are allowed to have that magazine installed.

Basically Chinese people tend to put up a good facade and want to be seen to be doing good things, as this counts very much towards their sense of self-worth and idea of morality. China the country is doing exactly that, to present itself as a restrained and good global actor. But what's on the surface often times hides more self-vested, greedy ambitions.Just look at what's happening with them and the Philippines. Chinese warships frequently skirmish with Filipino fishing vessels in claiming disputed islands and waters. Why? Because it wants to control the resources there. And because China is discovering its newfound might, it feels the Philippines can be bullied (that and also because it's backed by the US).More recently, if reports like [**this**](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/malaysia-bow-chinas-demands-halt-oil-exploration-south-113410309) are to be believed, China has demanded one of the states in Malaysia some 2,000 miles away to stop drilling for oil, because it claims the water as theirs. Imagine demanding that another country stops harvesting resources 200 miles off their own coastline, because those waters \\"belong\\" to you sitting 2,000 miles away.This is blatant bullying and is just the very beginning. Due to its growing economic muscle, China sees itself as some pre-ordained hegemon in the Asia Pacific region. For a country that has historically condemned the US for trying to exert its power globally, China is now doing the exact same thing. Blatant hypocrisy.So however bad you think the US is or was, expect China to do the same (to varying degrees) if and when it gains similar hegemony. If history can show us one thing, it's that there are never truly \\"good\\" global actors. Everybody is in it for their own gain.

These temperatures weakened the steel's structural integrity, reducing its ability to support the building's weight. The critical support column (Column 79), which initially could bear several thousand tons of weight, failed under the stress, initiating a progressive collapse.NIST's lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, explained: \\"WTC 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings.

Trump simply made weak points, repeating over and over the same thing as he somehow traces  everything back to the border issue. Then he talks about pets, then he says a concept of a plan. He kept getting baited, dug himself in a hole and struggled getting out. It was clear. She rehearsed for months for this debate. The acting was too obvious at the beginning but she got better and better as the debate went on. I think there were things that gave her more control and confidence, like having the debate on ABC, no audience, him not making eye contact with her, fact checking trump more often. Now lets talk about Harris. Overall, she was the clear winner in this debate but thats not her natural character. Lts remember her before this debate. You can see with almost all of her interviews/talks, she fumbles and cannot clearly respond to tough questions. Shes a terrible public speaker. Shes notorious for giving us a hideous word salads. She role switches depending on the audience. Behind all this facade, its hard to tell who she is, what she stands for, and who is/isnt on her side. Her stance on international politics is very weak. Clearly, she will blindly follow foreign leaders even if it means putting the Americans people thru WW3. So, I think as far as the debate, she killed it by painting Trump as a chaotic and weak person, but it doesnt mean shes fit for a president. Her everyday performance (which matters more) vs the debate performance are miles apart, which Im sure leaves a lot of people feeling insecure about her leadership as a president. This is not to say trump is the better candidate, I dont think thats the case. But Trump on this matter is more natural with his debates as he always acts and behaves in a consistent manner. Harris just isnt consistent and her leadership is questionable in these tough times.","title":"New right-wing conspiracy theory: Kamala Harris' debate earrings were a high-tech cheating device"},{"text":" Because there are different procedures for every single insurance company, it takes a lot of labor to stay on top of that.

Here's what she said"},{"text":"So obviously, specialty choice is not solely determined by income. Plenty of people love primary care fields and would specialize in them even if the pay was significantly decreased.The reason why relative pay may decrease is two fold. First, the healthcare model bills and codes for different types of visits. A primary care visit versus a surgery will be reimbursed differently. Currently, there has been emphasis on procedures for billing, so a procedure that takes 1 hour would get paid more rather than a primary care visit that takes 1 hour. There has been a push to change this model, but currently that is how the system works. If a universal system implemented a similar model for reimbursement as Medicare does, then procedural specialties (like surgery) will continue to make more than primary care specialties. The second is that if even if the change in reimbursement affected all specialties easily, within the broader scope of the world, those payments will still be different. If an orthopedic surgeon who makes 700k has their reimbursement cut by 50%, for example, they will be at $350k, still comfortable to have a high standard of living and be able to pay back their loans. A pediatrician making $200k with that level of decrease is now at $100k, which compared to the general population is not much higher. So, when choosing between 100k and 350k, people will go for $350k most of the time.While interest in a specialty is definitely important when making the decision, people are often factoring in opportunity cost and lifestyle when making their decision. You can look at the medical student match charting outcomes to see that even  though there are way more primary care spots, they often go unfilled (https://www.nrmp.org/match-data/2024/06/results-and-data-2024-main-residency-match/).","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"Breitbart Disregarded","title":"21 False Claims &amp; Hoaxes by Kamala Harris that ABC's Debate Moderators Did Not Fact Check"},{"text":"Im going to go off on a little tangent before circling back to Change Your View:Ask the question **Why** are US physician salaries so high compared to many other places? Lets assume people are the same everywhere; people who have achieved high skill want to be paid more. Theres supply and demand forces at work all over, and skilled physicians are inherently rare. If this were the only factor, physician salaries would not show a huge variance. So theres something else at work in the US.The commonly cited differentiator is our legal tort system and the expensive malpractice insurance needed to protect against that. Its a legitimate issue, but theres another one: the cost of medical school.In the US, a medical education can run hundreds of thousands of dollars. Few can afford this, so most take student loans. BIG student loans. A US physicians salary must be high enough to cover this cost, *plus interest*. In Germany (for instance) medical school costs a German citizen nothing; they only need living expenses. They leave medical school and enter the physician workforce with little or no debt, and physician salaries therefore do not need to be inflated to deal with the debt burden.Okay, back to universal healthcare. It is not always well understood that single payer universal healthcare stands to *save* the US economy overall upwards of  half a **trillion** dollars annually. What if we were to re-invest some of those savings into making medical education free? (Or very cheap at least.) It would release a tremendous restriction in the physician supply pipeline - more people would be able to be trained, and the affordability pre-filter would be removed. *And*, physician salaries would no longer have to be inflated to cover student debt. Fixing healthcare payment enables fixing education costs, which in turn reduces healthcare costs further.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"Trump's diaper paid the ultimate price last night.","title":"The Guardian joins Reuters in stepping away from both sides type reporting"},{"text":"The maga cope is off the charts lmao","title":"Debate night: Just another night of Kamala Harris dodging substantive questions"},{"text":"She'll be more of the same, nothing will fundamentally change, but with even more neocon-ish hawkish foreign policy than Biden here imo:[https://x.com/PushBidenLeft/status/1833837898203898247?ref\\\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://x.com/PushBidenLeft/status/1833837898203898247?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)","title":"Debate hot takes"},{"text":"No, that's not what he said.

The various states got their legal formation via proprietary charters from the English crown circa the 17th century. Interestingly, they collapse corporate and state/governmental powers - it's similiar to how the East India company had military power at one point.In any event, there were tussles between the Crown and Parliament, with each's powers waxing and waning via various points. Through all that, the colonies were more or less ignored by Parliament (as long as the economic system kept benefting the UK). By the time of the French Indian War, there were huge divisions between King George and Parliament, and by extension the colonies. The Parliament didn't want further costs for further violence, they wanted the colonies to actually be self-sustaining economically, and the King really didn't want the Parliament getting more powerful (in the intervening period, I'm glossing over where Parliament cut off a King's head, put in Cromwell, then played king maker, and unified the parliaments of Scotland and England, I think).So, when the colonists got royal proclamations that said they can't advance west of the Appalachians, can't steal Indian's lands, have to stop settler initiated violence, etc., they were PISSED. Land speculation is how all the rich people got rich. It's why George Washington served in the military in Ohio, to get more land.What the colonists wanted is their own parliament. As I said before, the King REALLY didn't want the colonies to unified amongst themselves and have their own parliament. Parliament wanted to overtly control the colonies - interestingly enough, there were famous cases where the right for colonies to nullify Parliamentary acts that violated the English constitution were en vogue.So, the colonies started a pen pal regime in the Albany Congress in 1754. Then the first continental congress was formed in 1774. The ask was basically to tell Parliament to fuck off. Then the King's response was to issue a proclamation of rebellion. The second continental congress was formed in 1775. The result was two fold, they did issue the olive branch petition (basically like \\"King, we don't want beef with you but parliament can fuck off.\\"). But others like George Washington were like \\"we should raise an army because shit is going down.\\" I am paraphrasing.From June 1776 on, some delegates were like LET'S DO THIS AND FORM OUR OWN PARLIAMENT OR WHATEVER and others weren't so sure. Then Thomas Jefferson unveiled the Declaration. By August of 1776, the various legislatures were in agreement and signed on. Then by 1777, they created their \\"league of friendship\\" and signed onto the Articles of Confederation.By 1787, the states were on the brink of disaster. The central government had no power and states had tons of rights. It was a race to the bottom. That's why the current US Constitution was formed.What people don't realize is that the US Constitution was drafted and circulated but lots of states had reservations. That's why the federalist and anti federalist papers were circulating. They were arguing to the legislatures to sign on. It wasn't until the Bill of Rights were drafted that states signed on.What I'm amounting to is that from the proprietary charters through the constitution, states gave up powers for a better country.  Anyone who thinks that the constitution stands for \\"states can do whatever they want\\" can't account for why the trendline was for the states to realize it's better to be together than racing each other to the bottom.What they also realized is that the british common law - and the unwritten british constitution - were included in the understanding of what they were doing. So, when people say \\"privacy isn't in the constitution\\" are really dumb. It's because terms like \\"liberty\\" had adjudicated meanings and applications from case law.What this means is that there were some things that were so important for considerations of liberty that they should be beyond the reach of political process and are what the Constitution means by \\"liberty.\\"So finally addressing your CMV: At common law, women had unfettered rights to abortion because a fetus isn't a person. Your CMV goes against the fundamental principles that states can now redefine, through political process, what a \\"person\\" is or other basic, definitional aspects the compact between previously sovereign and independent states rests on.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"He wants to shut down ABC.?\\n??

So Republicans took away a right that was already established by Roe v Wade for every single American, is now being voted on. A right that every American was given is now considered controversial because religious groups deem it as murder. Each state will now have their own power to send a woman to jail for being raped and wanting to abort a child they did not want. Or a family that has been trying so hard to have a child has a complicated pregnancy that risks the mothers life cannot have an abortion or else she will go to jail.  You act like states voting for their own laws is small government, but this actually incentivizes doctors to not want to do their jobs and families to suffer unnecessary trauma.

Right now, American workers across manufacturing, shipbuilding, construction, and other sectors are building this new industry. The Administration continues to use every tool available including leveraging historic resources from President Bidens Investing in America agenda  to seize near- and long-term offshore wind opportunities across America that will create new jobs for our communities.  At the beginning of this Administration, there were no approved commercial-scale offshore wind projects in federal waters in the United States. Recognizing the urgency of catalyzing this industry to generate clean energy and combat climate change, President Biden set an ambitious goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind in the United States by 2030, while protecting biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use. **Today [September 5th], the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the 10th approval of a commercial-scale offshore wind project. With this approval, the nation has now approved more than 15 gigawatts of offshore wind projects C enough to power 5.25 million homes, and equivalent to half of the capacity needed to achieve the 30 gigawatt goal.**  US Winds project offshore Maryland C approved today by the Department of the Interiors Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) C will provide up to 2,200 megawatts of clean, reliable renewable energy for the Delmarva Peninsula and power up to 770,000 homes. The development and construction phases of the project are estimated to support up to an estimated 2,679 jobs annually over seven years.Overall, successfully deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind will help power 10 million homes with clean energy, support 77,000 jobs, avoid 78 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, and spur $12 billion per year in private investment in offshore wind projects.Todays [September 5th] announcement builds on significant progress that the Biden-Harris Administration has made to accelerate project reviews while protecting communities and our environment. Recent data demonstrates that the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering more projects, more quickly than the previous Administration.*Advancing Offshore Wind off Every Coast*Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the Department of the Interior has held five offshore wind lease auctions providing more than 1.3 million new acres for development C including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and New Jersey that generated more than $4 billion in winning bids. The Department of the Interior also held first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf Coasts; held the first sale in the Central Atlantic region in a decade; and announced the first-ever sales offshore Oregon and in the Gulf of Maine. Earlier this year, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced a new five-year offshore wind leasing schedule that aims to hold up to 12 potential offshore wind sales through 2028, including potential first-ever sales in HawaiAI and a U.S. Territory. Because of the Administrations progress on permitting the nations first offshore wind projects and leasing new areas, the total U.S. offshore wind project pipeline now exceeds 80 gigawatts, enough to power more than 26 million homes if fully developed.*Investing in Workers and Communities*The Administration is advancing offshore wind development in a way that will maximize benefits for local communities and create good-paying jobs for American workers, including by harnessing a range of clean energy tax credits from President Bidens Investing in America Agenda and federal financing programs across the Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation. The Department of the Interior has also introduced innovative provisions in lease sales supporting workforce training and union-built projects, domestic supply chain development, and community benefit agreements including with Tribes and stakeholder groups. The Energy Department has charted a path to grow and train an American workforce to fill tens of thousands of jobs across the offshore wind industry. The Administrations Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership is working to strengthen regional collaboration on offshore wind supply chain development, to unlock more American job opportunities. With these efforts driving progress, offshore wind investments announced during the Biden-Harris Administration now include more than $6.9 billion across 19 manufacturing facilities and 15 ports, as well as 25 new offshore wind vessels being built in 8 different states, totaling thousands of new jobs.*Accelerating Offshore Wind Permitting*Todays tenth offshore wind project approval, reflecting collaboration across federal agencies, is part of comprehensive Administration efforts to improve the federal permitting process, including: investing over $1 billion through Inflation Reduction Act funds to hire experts and invest in new technologies to expedite reviews; passing the first reforms to modernize the National Environmental Policy Act for the first time in 50 years; and using executive authorities, wherever possible, to improve permitting and environmental review processes. Earlier this year, the Department of the Interior finalized a rule that is expected to save offshore wind developers about $1.9 billion over 20 years by modernizing regulations for offshore renewable energy development. The Department of the Interior is also developing programmatic environmental impact statements for the New York Bight and California offshore wind lease areas to create efficiencies for individual project reviews. Additionally, BOEM and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a joint strategy to protect and promote the recovery of endangered North Atlantic right whales while responsibly developing offshore wind energy. These agencies are also deploying Inflation Reduction Act funding and working with industry and environmental stakeholders to advance whale detection and monitoring technologies.*Strengthening Transmission and Port Infrastructure for Offshore Wind*The Departments of the Interior and Energy released *An Action Plan for Offshore Wind Transmission Development in the U.S. Atlantic Region*, a set of bold actions that will catalyze grid upgrades to boost offshore wind energy, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and create good-paying, union jobs. Similar efforts are underway along the West and Gulf coasts. These efforts are funded from the Inflation Reduction Act for offshore wind and interregional transmission analyses and convenings. This summer, the Department of Energy announced federal transmission investments that will help connect 4,800 megawatts of offshore wind to the New England grid and provide economic development grants to several communities that will host offshore wind transmission infrastructure. To help build out the port capacity needed for offshore wind manufacturing and project construction, the Department of Transportation has awarded more than $675 million in grants for East Coast and West Coast ports to support offshore wind activities.*Advancing Floating Offshore Wind Innovation and Deployment*Deep-water areas that require floating platforms are home to two-thirds of Americas offshore wind energy potential, including along the West Coast and in the Gulf of Maine. To seize these opportunities, the Department of the Interior set a goal to deploy 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035enough to power over five million American homes. And the Administration launched an interagency Floating Offshore Wind Shot, which seeks to reduce the cost of floating offshore wind energy by more than 70 percent by 2035. The Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation have already achieved over 50 milestones and dedicated over $950 million to advance the Floating Offshore Wind Shot and American competitiveness on floating offshore wind turbine design, development, and manufacturing. Last month, the Department of the Interior announced the execution of the nations first floating offshore wind energy research lease offshore Maine.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Hits Offshore Wind Milestone, Continues to Advance Clean Energy Opportunities"},{"text":"https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1fdz97r/debate_hot_takes/lmn3buz/","title":"Debate hot takes"},{"text":"Was there any mention of inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze that actually impacts 50-75% of the electorate?","title":"Analysis of the debate, predictions, etc"},{"text":"And he tried to troll her on sex, failed, and it isn't even remembered the next day. lmao","title":"Kamala Harris Broke Donald Trump | In their first face-to-face meeting, the Democratic nominee humiliated the former president."},{"text":"Or, Trump could have told the truth about reproductive choice.

For some time now I've held the view that we need to come to a new understanding of the First Amendment, not unlike the way we've come to a new understanding of the Second Amendment, except not suicidally batshit crazy. And except for the fact that it would require no real shift in policy at all. We already disallow fraud and perjury. False speech is already illegal under oath and in commercial transactions. We already punish slander and libel, but those cases take lots of time and loads of money to bring to justice. So we can all say whatever we want. But for people whose speech may do harm their utterances may carry penalties but they are woefully ineffective. It took ten years, lots of money and risk to bring Alex Jones to justice. I would like to see the process simplified. I propose that we create slander courts, not unlike bankruptcy courts, with streamlined operations, capped costs and a set procedure. \\\\~ The court would only have jurisdiction over people and institutions who make a living by communication: News organizations, pundits, podcasters etc. Only people making money by reporting the news or molding opinion. \\\\~ The court would respect the forms of speech you've outlined, or something similar. Only expressions of fact, not opinion, would be subject to dispute. Only utterances that cause harm would be considered. Only the harmed individual or institution would have standing to bring suit. The government could not use it to police speech. It stands to reason that if a \\"journalist\\" makes a statement of fact they should be able to back it up with evidence, testimony or some other form of corroboration and that they should have this material at hand. As such they should be able to defend themselves at the drop of a hat and these suits should take a matter of weeks, not years, to clear up. Claim: Hillary Clinton is running a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor in Queens. Show your evidence.Claim: JD Vance wrote that he fucked a couch. Show your evidence.Claim: Sandy Hooke was fabricated and people who claim to have lost children are being paid to discredit gun ownership: Show your evidence. Penalties: from the date of filing: $50 for the first week the record is not corrected. $500 for the second week. $5,000 for the third week. All but $50 to be forgiven if and when the record is corrected in the same venue, media and  amount of time in which it was distorted. This would have saved the Sandy Hook survivors and parents untold grief and would have saved Alex Jones a billion dollar judgement plus court fees. How much wasted time would we recover arguing about the latest report on Fox News?In fact, it would have saved JD Vance nothing at all because the story he fucked a couch was started by some guy, not a Youtube careerist and they admitted it was a gag days later. Everyone understands it's not true, everyone still laughs at it.

The reasons are irrelevant.  If the baby is viable it is viable.  I know a couple that went through that, it was fucking horrible, they were preparing their life to meet their baby daughter until an ultrasound revealed a terrible birth defect that guaranteed that their daughter would never breathe on her own, and would die almost immediately after a very risky delivery.  This is reasonable, but not all late term abortions are due to fetal issues.  So, I know that happens, but Ive never heard of an abortion that happened late term for no reason, and I have certainly never heard of killing infants after they are born as Trump claimed again last night.  That is called murder, and it is already illegal in every state.They are rare, but do happen.  The fact that the Democrats opposed a bill to ban late term abortions for situations other than what you described and the life of the mother is telling.","title":"Fact Check: ABC Moderators Silent As Kamala Harris Repeats Hoaxes About Trump and Race"},{"text":"Source?","title":"Kamala Harris says she is a gun owner in presidential debate with Trump.

EPA has selected 34 applications to fund projects proposed by 33 Tribal recipients and the Municipality of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to implement community-driven solutions to tackle the climate crisis, reduce air pollution, advance environmental justice, and accelerate the clean energy transition. EPA made its Tribes and Territories Competition selections following a review of 110 applications that requested a total of more than $1.3 billion in funding.The grants for the proposed projects, which are funded by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, will support the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction measures that were identified by Tribal and territorial communities. When estimates provided by all selected applicants are combined, the proposed projects would cumulatively reduce greenhouse gas pollution by over 7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050 C equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted from nearly 1.4 million homes' electricity use for one year.Todays selections mark the latest phase of investment under this first-of-its kind, nearly $5 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program. In July, EPA announced selected applications from the CPRG Implementation Grants General Competition to receive $4.3 billion in funding. In 2023, EPA provided $250 million in planning grants to develop climate action plans. Those plans served as the basis for greenhouse gas reduction measures proposed in the CPRG implementation grant applications.The selected applications will target greenhouse gas pollution from six sectors of the economy with a particular focus on the transportation, electric power, and commercial and residential buildings sectors, while spurring workforce development and job creation in Indian Country and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan will announce the selections alongside Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland at an event today in Flagstaff, Arizona, where they will be joined by leadership from the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Utilities Corporation has been selected to receive over $20 million to help provide renewable and reliable electricity to nearly 900 homes.  \\n...  \\nTodays investment and ongoing CPRG technical support for planning grant recipients are consistent with President Bidens Executive Order 14112 on Reforming Federal Funding and Support for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination. The Executive Order demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administrations respect for Tribal sovereignty and its commitment to ushering in the next era of Tribal self-determination by directing agencies to reform federal programs for greater autonomy of Tribal Nations over how Tribes can invest federal funding. The Executive Order also directs agencies to make federal funding less burdensome and more accessible for Tribal Nations.The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program is also advancing President Bidens historic Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure 40% of the overall benefits of certain climate, clean energy, and other federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.A list of a handful of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release, link to full list is towards the bottom. Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris leadership, todays investment marks one of the largest climate investments EPA has ever made in Tribal and territorial communities. The ambitious projects selected will deploy community-driven solutions to fight climate change and protect public health, said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. The Tribal and territory leaders selected today will fund innovative projects that improve air quality, deliver cleaner affordable electricity, and create economic and workforce opportunities that can be scaled up and replicated across Tribal lands and U.S. territories.-Related press releases:* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces More than $13 Million to Two Wisconsin Tribes to Cut Climate Pollution and Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-13-million-two-wisconsin-tribes-cut-climate)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces over $3 Million to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to Cut Climate Pollution, Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-3-million-commonwealth-northern-mariana)* [Rosebud Sioux Tribe selected to receive $7,879,394 for new electric vehicles and charging stations](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/rosebud-sioux-tribe-selected-receive-7879394-new-electric-vehicles-and-charging)* [Spirit Lake Tribe selected to receive $7,279,786 for projects to improve energy efficiency, develop solar and EV infrastructure and cut climate pollution](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/spirit-lake-tribe-selected-receive-7279786-projects-improve-energy-efficiency-develop)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $23 Million to La Jolla Band of Luise?o Indians to Cut Climate Pollution, Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-23-million-la-jolla-band-luiseno-indians)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $30 Million to Tribes within Arizona to Cut Climate Pollution, Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-30-million-tribes-within-arizona-cut)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces More Than $38 Million in Grants to Michigan Tribes to Cut Climate Pollution and Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-38-million-grants-michigan-tribes-cut)* [Biden-Harris Administration announces nearly $7.5 million grant to Passamaquoddy Tribe Indian Township to cut climate pollution and accelerate clean energy transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-75-million-grant-passamaquoddy-tribe)* [Southern Ute Indian Tribe selected to receive $4,908,604 to cut climate pollution from oil and gas production sources](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/southern-ute-indian-tribe-selected-receive-4908604-cut-climate-pollution-oil-and-gas)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $5 Million to Lower Sioux Indian Community in Minnesota to Cut Climate Pollution and Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-5-million-lower-sioux-indian-community)* [EPA announces $78M in grants to Tribes in Alaska, Pacific Northwest to cut climate pollution, accelerate clean energy transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-78m-grants-tribes-alaska-pacific-northwest-cut-climate-pollution)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces over $1.3 Million to Fort Independence Indian Community to Cut Climate Pollution, Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-13-million-fort-independence-indian)* [Biden-Harris Administration announces over $1.5 million grant to Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation to cut climate pollution and accelerate clean energy transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-15-million-grant-mashantucket-pequot-tribal)* [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Over $11 Million to Blue Lake Rancheria to Cut Climate Pollution](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-11-million-blue-lake-rancheria-cut-climate)* [EPA Announces Over $13M in Grants to Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska to Cut Climate Pollution and Accelerate Clean Energy Transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-over-13m-grants-iowa-tribe-kansas-and-nebraska-cut-climate-pollution-and)* [Biden-Harris Administration announces grant over $6.6 million to Narragansett Indian Tribe to cut climate pollution and accelerate clean energy transition](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-grant-over-66-million-narragansett-indian-tribe)","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $300M in Grants to Tribal Nations and a U.S. Territory to Cut Climate Pollution and Accelerate Clean Energy Transition"},{"text":"Yeah, heard it loud and clear.

He is likely an illegal candidate if his trials had gone to court.  The Supreme Court made terrible rulings about his personal conversations with Pence.  But then he publicly violated his oath of office in his speech.  A president cant ask people to  violate the constitution. Not in an America we want to live in!!!As a previous election official, I gave an oath to support the constitution of the United States.

Biden campaigns and wins on it but instead of doing it, privatizes Medicare. Is dropping campaign promises also part of a brilliant political strategy? His successor who mostly adopted his platform as well as formerly cosponsored the bill drops it entirely. They are the recipients of incredible amounts of campaign contributions from private insurance, the pharmaceutical industry, and hospital associations - all on the record as strongly against it.

That said, I think these kinds of facts are sort of the \\"edge cases\\" and most things are either true or they aren't. But the edge cases can and should still be analyzed this way. What are the foundations of the claim? What are we measuring? What language are we using?Life begins before conception. (Certainly the sperm and egg are alive.)Life begins at conception. (Certainly the sperm meeting the egg creates something new.Life begins at birth. (Certainly exiting the womb yields something new than was before.The simplification of what is fact leaves the door wide open to make the claim: Life begins at conception.

If I shed some skin and bacteria on the surface of Mars (ignore any radiation damage for the sake of argument) and a rover found it, we would say that the rover has found \\"life.\\" The sample contains living tissue and even living microscopic organisms. But we wouldn't call that sample \\"a human being\\" even if the life is characteristically \\"human.\\" And this is where the arguments concerning \\"life\\" for a fetus fall back to worldview. It's a matter of worldview that I find meaningful distinctions between a human living detached from their umbilical cord outside the womb and a fetus, and the egg and sperm, while others see that fetus immediately as a little container for a religious soul and therefore no different from a living adult, morally speaking. I see the fetus development process as one that is necessarily complex and gradual and deeply personal to the pregnant person, and this informs my opinion on abortion. I understand this is a different worldview from others, and it does change how I interpret certain \\"facts\\" such as \\"the beginning of life.\\" Tumors are comprised of living cells as well, and hence, biologically, \\"life,\\" but obviously their role and characterization is different from other life.","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"I like how you conveniently skipped out on the first question because it would directly go against your whole argument of red flag laws.But I suppose if your worldview people have to be put in harms way first to justify even the thought of taking a firearm away.

Democrats have labor unions and a few aligned corporate interests, but not at the same scale.So: we make up the gap with legwork. By election day, we will have contacted well over 30,000 people across half a dozen different mechanisms: mail, text, social, digital, video, door-to-door, phone. The biggest unknown, though, is what impact will the Harris/Walz ticket have on turnout (for both Democrats and Republicans).

I can already hear you gearing up a but money made one side louder argument to which I will say well if its all just a matter of who is loudest as opposed to what policies people actually want, then they obviously dont want progressive policies.Or they dont want them as much as me, the guy who votes progressive because its really easy to do so in a primary every election.Bernie didnt face any structural barriers and you wont be able to name any that he did. He dont get enough votes. He got a fuckton of votes nonetheless, which goes to show how easy it is to just hit that little button and vote for a progressive.The fact is, there are enough progressives on the ballot today each election, with all the structural barriers and money factored in, that if people just voted for them we would have a vast-majority progressive government.

Like most affluent areas we also have a decent share of parents that choose to enroll their kids in private or parochial schools, but more often than not there's still a lot of respect for the quality of our schools. And a desire to ensure they stay that way.Johnson County has been fortunate to have something of a \\"flywheel\\" going for the past several decades. Great schools developed kids into great adults, which attracted businesses to the region, which generates the tax revenues that are needed to continue investing in schools and infrastructure.I do think one challenge that's going to get worse before it gets better is property tax assessments, especially for fixed income households. While it's nice on paper to see your home valuation increase by 30%, that also means a 30% increase to the tax assessment. This has an interplay with available housing and affordable housing more generally...there just aren't many neighborhoods where a working class family to afford to live. For example well over 90% of our school bus drivers live outside of the district. So the general issue of \\"what to do about the long tail impact of rapid inflationary increases in property values\\" is a good topic.","title":"I'm Jason Anderson and I'm running for Kansas State Senate - and we're going to break the Republican supermajority!"},{"text":"This is the typical response I get from magats.

Could you clarify your point about separating worldview from facts? Are you saying that all worldview statements, arguments, etc, are somehow intrinsically tied to facts or a rejection of them? That's an interesting point that I might reward a delta for, though I still think the form of the statements as a statement of fact versus the more complex worldview is important and useful. you're talking about the point where a worldview becomes a fetish that imposes itself upon facts/opinions regardless of congruency(think flat earth) with them,I think so, yes. i don't see how you can actually seperate \\"legitimate opinions\\" from the worldviews of people that produced them or to a lesser extent \\"verifiable facts\\".A legitimate opinion is a preference for something. Many things I would call a \\"worldview statement\\" (e.g. a conspiracy theory like flatearth) are also sometimes colloquially described as \\"opinions.\\" Often when a person says something like \\"all abortion is murder\\" if we disagree we might say \\"well that's your opinion.\\" This is a correct use of the word, but it's a different meaning of \\"opinion\\" than a \\"preference\\" or approval for things like policy or an official. Someone could say \\"I don't believe we should make policy to combat climate change.\\" That's a valid opinion, but I would argue that it is based on a flawed worldview that rejects scientific facts. But it is still, on its own, a valid opinion statement. And maybe that connection to facts is what you were conveying above?let's take two mathematically equivalent models explaining the same phenomenon, how would you claim one to be 'more factual' then the other without calling upon one of the models? This is a confusing example. Isn't something that is mathematically equivalent *quantifiably* equivalent? What meaningful distinction exists?

The only little bits I have bothered to see C the Don was gurning away like the MAD cartoon character. Trying to remember some talking point and response. I.e. all by himself, without a voice in his ear.  \\nThinking before talking always looks slower. It's the worst pantomime. No audience. No unscripted questions. Its almost as though the whole thing is for show now. Harris obviously a lame duck. She may well become president lame duck, after the election for the handover C when she will have to carry the can for the ignominious defeat to take Russia by the khazar masters. Biden is obviously being prepped for a dementia defence. I have seen enough evidence that Trump already has final say on most major decisions. Cameron said so when he was hoaxed; The lines of Suckerberk and Musk, the techbros, coming to beg for mercy for their previous deeds, seems to confirm that. It was looking too one sided with his massive support from endless live rallies he has constantly been cutting through the media mirror C that it seems they need some semblance of a fair competition. So the polls can be roughly equal and the result not already acknowledged.\\nIts a drawback for the Yankee pantomime election cycle, it goes on way too long, well after it stops being relevant, entertaining or even funny C only of use for the brain dead.

Yes, really.The bizarre take was shared widely on social media, including by some accounts with large followings. The VP cheated with earring headphones? Not surprising, Antonio Brown, the former NFL player, posted to his 2.1 million followers on X. Some individual posts about the theory racked up millions of views.Several posts about the crackpot theory likened Harris jewelry to audio earrings featured in a Kickstarter campaign based in Germany. NOVA H1 Audio Earrings are the first clip-on earphones on the planet, reads the fundraiser page for the headphones, which raised over $100,000 from backers. These Earrings are fully packed with the latest technology embedded in real pearls to provide you with music, phone calls and digital assistants all day long.The page adds that the technology is so camouflaged that while using them no one around you will perceive them as a headset. The inconspicuous products stated list of stated features, however, does not include its potential to be used to cheat in an American presidential debate.A fundamental flaw with the theory is that the audio earringswhich have a single gold stalk below the pearldont actually look anything like the earrings Harris wore during the debate.Instead, users pushing the theory compared Harris jewelry with a photo of the audio device that was featured in an article by the tech product reviews site Toms Guide. That image showed a woman wearing the NOVA H1 headphones as well as two ordinary hooped earrings which are clearly not part of the device.Even some pointing that out maintained that it was completely possible she had some sort of earpiece.A community note was eventually added to one of the most popular posts on X pushing the bogus theory, claiming instead that Harris earrings were actually from Tiffany &amp; Co. and apparently unable to receive audio. Shocking.","title":"Conspiracy Bozos Think Kamala Harris Debate Earrings Have a Dark Secret"},{"text":"Violins are mode difficult, she played him like a kazoo.","title":"Kamala Harris Just Destroyed Donald Trump in the Debate"},{"text":"Well, in fairness, he was trying to get \\"killed\\" and \\"Mike Pence\\" together in a particular way..../s","title":"Joe Biden on Harris-Trump Debate: Wasnt Even Close"},{"text":"Some of us are collectors of history, some of us do competitive shooting as a hobby, some of us are very well trained, some of us train others, some of us have large collections of firearms, and some of us carried guns as part of a job.

Game over."},{"text":"Those too.I'm struck post-debate by how many people don't have Trump's proposals in perspective.  Now that he has stated them publicly it's time for the media to run a few stories.For example, Trump upped the number on deportations.  He was quoted at 12 million pre-debate, but I think bumped it up to 20 million in the debate. Does anyone have a feel for how many people that is?12 million people is the population in the greater LA metropolitan area.  20 million is the population of the greater NYC metropolitan area.  Trump is talking about a project big enough to evict every single person in those cities and reduce them to ghost towns.For rural folks that have never visited either, 12 million is the combined population of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Hawaii.  To bump that to 20 million he would need to evict everyone in West Virginia, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, and half of Kansas too.  It's apocalyptic in scale.What would be the effect on the economy of losing that many workers?  Where would he put that crowd while their deportation cases were making their way through the legal system?  Would he have to create a dozen medium-sized cities as camps?And how many people would be needed to round up this many folks and put them into the camps?  How many would be needed to build the housing, cook the meals, do the laundry, and so on?  Armies, right?  OK, so if he uses the regular Army, who will do all the defense tasks that need to be done?   Are we going to just abandon our commitments overseas?  Who is going to pay for all this?  The rotary club?In the post-debate spins actual human beings were talking about this Trump proposal - causing the collapse of society as we know it into a post WW II dystopia - as if it was just an ordinary alternative to Harris's preferred approach - passing the bipartisan border bill.   It's surreal.And that's just his immigration proposal.  His tariff ideas are just as bad.  And he wants to completely lobotomize the government too.People can't imagine scales this vast.  They need to be shown.","title":"Kamala Harris Just Destroyed Donald Trump in the Debate"},{"text":"Its hard to express this opinion, because everything is a comparison between the two candidates. But I have an objective opinion about Harris that has nothing to do with the attacks and the back and forth. In 2020, I didnt care for her much. I thought she was a good Senator, based on how she handled committee work. She seemed well versed on law and justice, and was powerful in her arguments. But as soon as she starts campaigning for executive office, she seemed extremely disingenuous. I felt like she was reading Campaigning for Dummies. Just running plays, with no believability or relatability. Of the top 10 candidates I would have accepted, she barely made the list. Watching her through the Biden administration, it seemed she really got a handle on the office. VPs are generally not very visible, so there isnt much to go on, but I saw improvement. Last night sold it for me. I think her experience as VP has given her what she needed in order to be able to do the job. She was believable (most of the time) and relatable. She knew the job was handling Donald Trump, and she rose to that challenge. Not that it changes my vote, which was always going to be for her, but after last night I am more of a Harris supporter. Not just backing the team that is the last line of defense against what is happening on the right. I think shell be able to do a good job.

The deepest point of the depression was in 1931, 2 years after the recession began, and was absolutely an unforced error due to monetary policy and the bank failures it triggered. It turned a regular recession into a depression. The point is that fiscal policy was chosen that did not bail out bad businesses. I think that the bailouts in 2008 were stupid for the same reason (just look at the U.S. auto industry today lmaooooo). For the auto industry, sure, but you're just wrong if you're referring to the bank bailouts (which were loans or share purchases that ended in a slight profit for the US government). There is no credible argument that letting the financial sector melt down was preferable to saving it. The entire depth of the recession was only triggered after the US failed to save Lehman, after all (although that was debatably reasonable). Its unclear why letting the entire asset backed commercial paper market freeze up (as was happening as the banks were blowing up) and making every person who worked for a large corporation be unable to be paid would improve the situation.The banks were only 'insolvent' in a mark-to-market sense because there were huge fire sales of assets to rush to gain liquidity. To let them fail for an *entirely temporary pricing issue* is illogical - these were fundamentally sound businesses.

First, the abridged version of my journey into politics.I've been a strong believer in public education for most of my life, in no small part because it was education that really shaped my life's story (and that of my entire family) and helped us all to find a ladder out of poverty. I've also always been politically \\"active\\" in the sense that I've followed national and world events, but was also pretty focused for a while on building my career.Fast forward a decade or two. Here in Kansas, school board and municipal races are held in odd years. Like  many other parts of the country, the COVID pandemic really stirred up tensions at the local level around mask policies and vaccines; Moms for Liberty capitalized on that and targeted our county to try to take over school boards. And so, I became involved as a founding member of a state PAC called Freedom to Learn, which was focused on providing a countering message. We also raised money to support school board candidates (the M4L folks were receiving significant support from out-of-state PACs).In the end, something like 84% of our candidates won. As part of this whole process, though, I came to know several of our state legislators. They realized that I happen to live in the middle of an open seat that was redrawn after the census, and so the recruitment process began. That's basically it - it wasn't something I was planning to do, or that I'd had on my bucket list. But there was a convergence of opportunity and personal motivation and values that made it possible.(will answer the second question in a separate comment)","title":"I'm Jason Anderson and I'm running for Kansas State Senate - and we're going to break the Republican supermajority!"},{"text":"Anything to deflect from the fact that he got his ass handed to him.","title":"Kamala Harris is clearly wearing Nova H1 earrings during the Trump debate.

The point is that the premise of \\"free speech\\" is that anyone should be able to say what policies they would want, what kind of government we should have, to criticize public figures and institutions, etc. Saying \\"Congress is bad\\" is a valid opinion. Saying that \\"congress is full of murderers\\" is a loaded statement and deserves scrutiny. There's a difference. Doesn't mean you should be arrested for saying it, only that we shouldn't pretend that it's an equivalent valid opinion as \\"Congress is bad\\" or they \\"Don't do a good job.\\" You can go into more details about an opinion and why you have such opinions, but such supporting arguments may or may not be valid \\"opinions.\\" Saying you don't like Trump because he rambles incoherently during his speeches is a valid opinion, and it has reasonable supporting arguments, but those fall into the \\"worldview\\" category. Some people don't think he rambles incoherently - that's just reality - so the reasoning given for such opinion of Trump is based on an analysis of his speeches that some people will disagree with.

Show the evidence that disproves or undermines the lie. That's mostly all that needs to be done. As for worldview requiring more, that's because these claims can be more complex than a direct lie. Frankfurt's *On Bullshit* has popularized the notion that liars care about the truth; they must curate a narrative that carefully misdirects people away from the truth, and keep that lie in their mind. A bullshitter, by contrast, doesn't care about the truth either way. And then there is [Brandolini's Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law), which states:The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.And I would put \\"bullshitting\\" in the \\"worldview\\" category, because these are more complex statements that can contain logical fallacies, loaded language, multiple layers of assumptions, etc. So we need to scrutinize it closer and with more effort.","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"Interesting.

Vanceand it didnt need to. Anyone who follows politics knows that Vance has repeatedly suggested that childless women are miserable, and that people who arent parents do not have a personal and direct stake in the future of America. In a 2021 interview with Fox News, he summed up his views with a memorable phrase: that the country was being run by a bunch of childless cat ladies.Swifts responsewryly applying that label to herself, as a successful pop star with a gazillion fans, a billion-dollar net worth, and a handsome football-player boyfriendsuggests that she might be the last living exponent of the Obama-era ideal of staying classy in the face of provocation. Remember When they go low, we go high? Very 2016. The Democrats convention in August showed that the party has given up on trying to rise above Trumps outrages and has instead embraced being salty in return: The high/lowlight was when Senator Elizabeth Warren, 75, made a couch joke. Even Barack Obama slyly referred to the small size of Trumps  crowds. (The Democrats liked that one so much, they have turned it into an advertisement.)By contrast, Swifts endorsement was incredibly restrained. She made a positive case for the Democrats policy platform on the issues she cares about, with only a glancing reference to Trumps chaos, and ended with a suggestion that fans register to vote, do their own research, and make their own choices. This was not a thunderous denunciation of Trump as an urgent threat to democracy. Nor did it use any of the language popular with left-leaning online sites in the late 2010s and 2020s, where writers agonized over staying friends with Republican voters, or whether to talk to their Trumpy uncle at Thanksgiving. Swifts statement merely outlined her own decision, and acknowledged that other people might make a different one.That is more radical than it might seembecause Swift will take criticism from both sides as a result. Mainstream Democrats, of course, are delighted: When Walz received the news live on MSNBC, he clenched his fist to his heart in appreciation. But some of her most ardent fans will find the endorsement tepid, and her criticisms of Trump and Vance too muted. Plenty of leftists will be angry that she didnt mention Gaza. The very online right, meanwhile, is likely to lose its mind that the endorsement exists at all....What is so striking about her statement, though, is not that a 34-year-old childless woman would support the Democratsin demographic terms, that makes perfect sense. What is most interesting is her tone. Harris has largely ditched Bidens strategy of warning about Trumps threat to democracy, in favor of running an old-school campaign about values and competence. In a similar vein, Swift has provided an understated condemnation of the Republican platform and a measured endorsement of the Democrats. Plus, of course, that one precision-targeted jab on behalf of childless cat ladies everywhere.In the parlance of the summer of 2024, this was a very demure, very mindful endorsement of Harris and a takedown of Vance.","title":"Taylor Swifts Three-Word Burn of J.

I fully expect Blue MAGA winged monkeys to swoop in and shriek about my sources.

Speaking on Radio Sputnik on Wednesday, she said she did not consider it a high-profile event. It mattered as much as the outcome of a hypothetical wrestling match on board the ill-fated Titanic during its trip across the Atlantic Ocean, she claimed. Who do you think won? Why would that matter? The iceberg is 15 minutes away, she said. Extending the metaphor, she said neither Trump nor Harris intended to get to the wheel to change the course of the ship. America is on its way to a total, global disaster and the rest of the world is trying to prepare for it, she suggested. The debate itself, according to Zakharova, was a mixture of fantasizing about the future and citing some facts about the past, with the candidates failing to agree on what those facts were. We were given the latest show by people who apparently never ever take any responsibility for what they say, the Russian official said.

We were born to be free. Zuckerberg, musk, Gates, these people are too powerful. It is not fair what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. When will previous US presidents be held accountable for their actions? They violated the Constitution openly and steered this nation out of control on a highway to hell ignoring every warning sign. Now Trump who I actually like although am pretty convinced is the either the antichrist or man of lawlessness is going to bring this nation back to a stable economy. But revelation 13:13 says it will perform great signs from heaven to earth in front of people. So I believe this verse is talking about nukes. So we will have a counterfeit god on the thrown in Washington with every tool necessary to make America great again. Hey I like Trump okay but I am human and am just making a observation.

It is just important for the next generation of kids to be aware of what is going on because these are very sad and dangerous times. Thank you for reading this and may God be with us all.

Now I feel I need to reiterate my concern that you are equivocating a bit, especially on the \\"opinion\\" word. Saying that you have a preference for a particular idea, concept, or policy *is different from* a **medical opinion** or an opinion which is a statement of general belief, such as \\"Abortion is murder.\\" Once again, these are correct uses of the word \\"opinion,\\" but they all depend on some slightly different definitions of the word \\"opinion.\\" I am calling the \\"opinion category\\" such because \\"opinion\\" is the best word to describe the concept I would like to convey, but there *are* other valid meanings of the word \\"opinion\\" which won't always fit into the \\"opinion category.\\" The *opinion category* is speech which conveys *a preference* for something. \\"I want abortions to be banned\\" is an opinion statement. It demonstrates a preference for a policy, or a general approval or disapproval of some activity. \\"I don't like homosexuals\\" is a bigoted thing to say, but it's also just an opinion statement as well. Saying \\"I don't want gay people to get married\\" is also an opinion statement, and it also clearly signals bigotry; but it is a valid opinion and states a preference for a policy. if I understand correctly, you're saying if I were to say \\"I believe we should ban the murdering of babies\\", that's opinion, with \\"I believe\\" being the operative phrase. Whereas if I said \\"we should ban the murdering of babies\\" that starts to cross into worldview. It's no longer precisely a stated belief system, but something I unwittingly feel on a gut level.No, not really. \\"I believe\\" isn't really the operative statement there. It's the expression of the preference for something, or the dislike of something. \\"Murder of babies\\" is the thing that is disliked, and the call for a policy - banning the murder of babies - is an expression for a preference. That's a valid opinion, and fits into the \\"opinion category.\\" Saying \\"we should\\" is not meaningfully different from \\"I believe.\\" They both are basically expressing the same *preference* or opinion. My concern is a statement like \\"abortion is murder\\" is being treated as though it's universally and perpetually a matter of worldview, whereas implicitly \\"abortion is not murder\\" is being treated as though it's universally and perpetually a matter of fact.Well now I would still say that if we're being intellectually honest \\"abortion is not murder\\" is still a worldview argument. It can only be considered \\"fact\\" if we delve into legal meanings, such as the reality that abortions are not recognized (in at least most states) or classified as \\"murder\\" by the legal system. If that's the claim, then it is fact, but usually that's not what we mean. In which case, that's still a worldview. A worldview doesn't always mean that it is baseless, stupid, or irrational. It just means that it is a more complex statement or argument than a straightforward claim of fact or a simple expression of an opinion (or *preference*). It usually is undermined by personal beliefs, or someone's world experiences, or maybe deep and complex technical information and analysis (i.e. the categorization of animals with their evolutionary ancestors can be hotly debated among evolutionary biologists). both sets of numbers would be true. Both would be fact.True, and in some contexts it may be important to distinguish between the different ones, and in other contexts not so much.

Those already occur on small scales but would likely expand to larger one. Another compounding issue here is the lack of compensation for the 3-10 years of post medical school training compared to how hard one works. Residents are regularly making near to less than minimum wage when you calculate over hours worked. And their salaries are paid by Medicaid so the only way to increase them would be changed in funding.The largest problem, however, is the litigious nature of US malpractice. None of these other countries that have universal healthcare allows medical malpractice to have so much scope. US doctors salaries often tie in the amount theyre paying for malpractice insurance, which for surgeons can be five to six figures a year. The combined cost of insurance and the defensive medicine we are forced to practice as a result (over-ordering tests and procedures to make sure nothing is missed) is estimated to be about 10% of the overall health care costs in the country. The other way foreign countries are able to cut costs are by limiting end of life care. Theyre not death panels per se but doctors are given a lot more power to refuse treatment options that wont extend life at a reasonable cost than they are here. But no one wants to discuss those parts.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"I told my wife she should have gone for the kill at the end and said something like Trump tried to tell you that world leaders respect him and he cant manipulated but I was able to bait him into acting stupid over and over again tonight with no effort at all, what do you Putin and Xi have been doing to him?

Whereas if I said \\"we should ban the murdering of babies\\" that starts to cross into worldview. It's no longer precisely a stated belief system, but something I unwittingly feel on a gut level. I think I understand your distinction and I'm happy to move on.---as to the question of fact: Yes I can see the difference between **opinion** and **fact** without any kind of mental gymnastics required. My concern is a statement like \\"abortion is murder\\" is being treated as though it's universally and perpetually a matter of worldview, whereas implicitly \\"abortion is not murder\\" is being treated as though it's universally and perpetually a matter of fact.I worry your definition is appealing to the god of fact, as though fact is some universal consistent truth that is unyielding and unchanging. This leaves much to be desired.Let me get more specific using your example:\\"Every year, x number of abortions take place after x number of months of pregnancy.\\"It is a fact that by medical definition **a miscarriage is an abortion**, just as a medical intervention would be an abortion. It is also a fact that pregnancy is medically measured from the time of your LMP (last normal menstrual period.) this means that by definition women are 1-2 weeks pregnant **before conception begins.**This means that we can use the medical definitions, or the perhaps intended definitions (most people are not aware of the above distinctions) and both sets of numbers would be true. Both would be fact. But the omission of contexts brings in the emotional intention. If the number chosen includes miscarriages, the data could demonstrate a larger amount of abortions, both to the detriment or the benefit of either premise (pro life or pro choice.) We see this already with 6 week abortion bans, where the pro life movement fails to clarify (intentionally or not) that there were only actually 4 weeks for a pregnant woman to even discover she was pregnant.**We can scrutinize the definition of fact further still.**Right now, the position of pro choice advocates is that the decision of medical abortions should be left between the mother and the doctor. Why? One reason is it is really, really, really, really hard to factually define when a woman's life is in danger. Pro life advocates who insist on exceptions for the life of the mother fail to recognize that there is rarely certainty on whether or not the mother will survive.Doctors will give something like a \\"50/50 chance\\" or a \\"60/40\\" chance. What is this number? Is this opinion or fact? During an ultrasound, the doctor may find an abnormality. One doctor may determine the abnormality will correct itself. Another doctor may determine intervention is necessary. We refer to these disagreements as opinion. If the doctors conclude that, while they can't be sure, there's a high likelihood the child won't survive, how do we treat this speech?It's not opinion in the same way someone says \\"I believe abortion is murder.\\"But nor is it fact in the same way \\"x abortions occur after x number of months of pregnancy.\\"All this to say you've consolidated a lot of potential abuse into one cozy bucket of \\"fact\\", when two uniquely distinct set of facts can still be true.

Do you notice that? A lot of shark I watched some guys justifying it today. Well, they werent really that angry. They bit off the young ladys leg because of the fact that they were not hungry, but they misunderstood who she was. These people are crazy.\\nHe said, Theres no problem with sharks. They just didnt really understand a young woman swimming now who really got decimated and other people too, a lot of shark attacks.\\nSo I said, So theres a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards or here. Do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking, and water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking. Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted? Because I will tell you he didnt know the answer.\\nHe said, Nobodys ever asked me that question.\\nI said, I think its a good question. I think theres a lot of electric current coming through that water. But you know what Id do if there was a shark or you get electrocuted, Ill take electrocution every single time. Im not getting near the shark.\\nSo we going to end that. Were going to end it for boats. Were going to end it for trucks. The trucks, on a tank of diesel fuel a truck goes from New York, a big, beautiful Peterbilt or any one of these great companies, they go from New York to Los Angeles without a stop. With electric much of the truck is used, the capacity for batteries, the batteries are very heavy and very big, very, very big. Many times the size of a tank that carries lots of gallons of diesel.

For Trump supporters, it was not just a defeat but a public humiliation, the crushing comeuppance they probably secretly feared might one day arrive but, until now, never quite had.\\n \\n What Harris appeared to understand, better than anyone else who has debated Trump, is that the key to defeating him is to trigger him psychologically. She did it by repeatedly calling him weak, mocking him, acting bemused by him, and literally laughing at him. As he lost control of events, Trump became enraged, his voice bellowing into an empty room, his face not just orange but nearly fluorescent. Trump realized that his opponentand not just any opponent, but a woman of colorwas dominating him. And so even as Trump exploded, he was, like a dying supernova, shrinking before our eyes.\\n \\n Even so devoted a bootlicker as Senator Lindsey Graham declared the debate a disaster for the ex-president.We are going to have the first Madam President in American history and Kamala Harris earned it in every way.Bravo.","title":"Kamala Harris Broke Donald Trump | In their first face-to-face meeting, the Democratic nominee humiliated the former president."},{"text":"Firearms are not the leading cause of death of children, that claim has been debunked.

Physicians are paid a lot less relative to other jobs then they once were which is one of the reason the investment in time/money to become one is less attractive than it once was.  Physician pay relative to cost of living has been declining for a couple of decades now in most areas other than elective (think derm, plastic surgery, etc.).  The reason here is that insurance companies and the large conglomerate hospitals care about _margin_ more than coverage of care.  It's a lot easier to manage to high margins if you don't have to have the resourcing to handle the spikes in demand but instead just use delay and denial of care to match to your avaialble resources.  It's better for these businesess to be busy 100% of the time and leave patients out then it is to be busy 85% and have capacity to see everyone with seasonal changes, population changes and so on.Universal healthcare comes with the advantage of being able to decide what compensation is needed to deliver care, rather than to achieve margin.  The lever of \\"supply\\" can be impacted with pay in a way that isn't available if you staff for margin. (or rather that is available, but isn't a rational business choice for shareholders or owners).  Further, you'd arguably have the money to do that buy taking the margin currently being stolen by the insurance companies and allocating to costs associated with care delivery rather than what amounts to transaction fees.  In 2022 these margins for insurance (not even getting to the hospitals themselves, which are increasingly administrative heavy as they've consolidated) amounted to about 30 billion dollars siphoned away from care and into insurance company shareholders.I think it's far better to trade in for at least optionality on matching resources to demand from a system that necessistates restricting supply of resources to ensure 100% utilization.  It favors expenses on claims management, billing management, insurance company interactions and a bunch of stuff oriented around margin and not around care.  This results in the industry ration being 2.7 billing specialists _per physician_.  That's just a demand places on what should be a care system that is fundamentally oriented around insurer margins and not around patients.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"Anyone on the site in 2015 knew it.

He said that in a situation like that, he and the mother would have a difficult conversation about what to do. Trump calls this killing babies post-birth.  Does it meet that definition? I guess it does technically, but it erases all context and acts like this is common thing. Acts like this is something pregnant women actively choose and that doctors promote. Like I could say firefighters are starting fires in the forest and be telling the truth, but omit that that its done as part of a controlled burn to prevent worse fires, if I wanted to convince you that firefighters were dangerous for our forests. Thats what hes doing with this quote.

Whether that be seeking pre-approvals, coding procedures using medical coding software that allows them to Bill the insurance companies or fighting over denied coverage. The bureaucracy is not just on the end of the insurance companies, some of it has to be funded out of the pocket of every doctor's office in America as an additional expense.With that position no longer needed, all of that is money right back into doctor's pockets. At the end of the day, it's just like anything else. If there's a shortage of doctors because you're not paying enough, then you can simply raise wages once you reach that point.  But I think you'll find that the shortage of doctors is somewhat universal and is more a function of simply not enough humans with the dedication and intelligence necessary to become a doctor relative to the number of people. It's in every country regardless of what their healthcare system looks like including ours I think this is an issue that exists entirely independent of salary.  We can however, always shift this problem to somewhere else by simply setting up a Visa program for doctors to bring in foreign doctors from countries that pay less the same way we do tech workers. It's a far more solvable problem than the current morass.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"To her MASSIVE credit, she stated her beliefs, and encouraged people to vote for theirs.

Who made them the arbiters of fact? For that matter, who made them the neutral arbiters of fact? Suppose I say something like, \\"Fraud and corruption are more prevalent among journalists and government officials than in any other profession,\\" while someone else says, \\"Generosity and charity are more prevalent among journalists and government officials than in any other profession.\\" Would we expect the fact arbiters to treat those two factual claims equally?  Finally, there's the \\"worldview\\" or \\"argument\\" category of speech. This should generally face the highest levels of scrutiny for standards, truth, and potential for harm. Back in the 1990s there was a movie called The People Vs. Larry Flynt about Larry Flynt's case against Jerry Fallwell at the Supreme Court. Flynt was a pornographer and Fallwell was a televangelist, and Flynt published a parody ad portraying Fallwell talking about losing his virginity, and Fallwell sued him for libel. The Court came down 9-0 on Flynt's side on free-speech grounds, among other reasons, because they recognized that parody and satire and bawdy jokes *are how some people communicate*. Not everyone is interested in calm, factual, rigorous debate. Some people like to hear emotional language and others like to say it. That is their right. Free speech is not a right accorded to people to benefit society. It is a right the people have to act in their own interests even when those clash with society. If you can see that, then you should understand why regulating speech is dangerous and wrong.","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"what stupid nonsense? wanna know what's worse than saying words you claim is \\"nonsense\\" ? how about the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants that rape and pillage our woman per day, meanwhile smuggling in children, drugs and the guns you oh so want to control badly?","title":"Kamala Harris was wearing earphone earrings.

Obviously, it's immoral to say that some people shouldn't get healthcare because we don't have enough doctors. HHS is [currently raising Medicare reimbursement rates](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-15087.pdf), and there's no reason to think the federal government wouldn't do everything it can to ensure the country has enough doctors.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"Your ordering of categories seems odd to me. The third category you listed is just a more complex version of the first category. Why should it be subject to *more* scrutiny than objective (potentially objectively false) statements of fact?\\"Liberals murder babies\\" is a worldview, an argument that has a more complex form and is not really verifiable nor even, in this case, disprovable without clearly defining certain words and agreeing on the analysis.No, it's really not. I'm completely pro-choice, but if I hear someone saying \\"Liberals murder babies\\" I *understand* what they mean. They mean that they consider fetuses to be living human beings and consider their termination morally equivalent to killing infants. I consider that a terrible opinion to have, but I can easily understand it's a subjective opinion and not a statement of fact. In this case, it could easily be considered a \\"thought-terminating clich\\" and dismissed, as someone with such a worldview is not signaling an openness to a fair discussion; they are only interested in a moral battle they are figurately ready to die for.It's a *slogan.* Slogans aren't supposed to be arguments, and no one reasonably understands them to be. The context in which a slogan is appropriate to use and the context in which a detailed and well-supported argument should be used are different. Sometimes a slogan slips into a place where the latter is expected, and then I agree that it should be disregarded, and someone who makes use of *only* slogans in that context should not be taken seriously.But sayings like that have been a part of rhetorical tradition for longer than rhetorical tradition has been a concept, and we've always dealt with their existence.To say that they should be subject to greater scrutiny than objectively false statements of fact is something I can't understand at all. They should be subject to rigorous criticism, but your second category should and often is subject to actual legal penalties.

Firstly, that abortion is murder. That is a worldview, or a *highly debatable* fact statement. Because of the disagreement on it being a fact, it falls more into worldview. Secondly, \\"it should be banned\\" is an opinion. The opinion is that it should be banned, and the *reasoning* for their opinion is that they believe it is murder. In such context as this, a person making such a statement as a whole is speaking freely, but the discussion or context of where they are saying it can inform us of how we respond to the statement. Is it a TV interview? Well, journalists can articulate what I just did: that \\"murder\\" is an emptionally charged word that not everyone agrees on, and so such a reasoning depends on a personal worldview, and so we may be unlikely to be able to have a productive conversation. I believe we should ban the murdering of babies.\\"Taken in a vacuum, that's an opinion. It's a preference for a policy: banning the murder of babies.\\" Of course it is a redundant law, as murdering anyone is already illegal. The implication, I understand, is that the person making the statement likely believes that fetuses are indistinguishable from babies. That underlying implication would be a worldview and needs to be deconstructed and identified in the context it is given. I believe liberals want to abort babies.\\"So the phrase \\"I believe\\" kind of implies a worldview statement, though it's kind of a claim of fact:  \\"liberals want to abort babies.\\" Saying what people want can often be somewhat quantified with surveys and such, which is why I argue this is a claim of fact, generally. Language can be loaded and complex, so sometimes there is room for debate, and some statements may fall into multiple categories, as I hopefully demonstrated. things like persuasive or manipulative speech for example.A claim of fact can be persuasive on its own, but most \\"manipulative\\" or persuasive speech would fall into a \\"worldview\\" category, the category of complex arguments, ideas, and \\"worldviews.\\" again, I don't really see a distinction between opinion and worldview other than perhaps a degree of conviction on the matter, but I'm trying.)So we have to be careful here. There is a risk of equivocation with the word *opinion.* The word *opinion* does have some different uses. My category of *opinion* is referring to a narrower meaning of the word, not each and every possible meaning of the word \\"opinion.\\" The narrower meaning being a *preference* for something, or a dislike of something. \\"Abortion is murder\\" is colloquially referred to in common speech as \\"someone's opinion\\" and that is a valid meaning of the word \\"opinion\\" but it is a *different* meaning than the one I am conveying with the *opinion category of speech.* Surely you can see a distinction between an opinion that abortion is bad and the heavily loaded claim of fact that an abortion is factually a murder? Fact. \\"Abortion is murder.\\" There is an implicit \\"should be.\\"Yea that's also an interesting point about normative claims, but this is due to the complexity of language. Again, some statements *could* fall into different categories.

So yes, this is significant. However if Taylor wants to truly affect the campaign, she needs to make some stadium appearances, a few additional posts. Even better if she gets televised time on stage speaking about voting for Harris. If those hypothetical 750k are split evenly between  all 50 states, currently that is 15,000 per state. Between those six swing states, that is an additional 90,000 votes in key districts (hypothetically). So its not nothing, but without following it with further action probably wont shift the entire race by itself, but will definitely add to Harris post-debate media blitz. Winning the debate isnt as important as winning the post-debate media cycle. Swifts endorsement will help Kamala do that, which is a far bigger factor.

While theoretically, the decreased demand of medical students (because of lower pay) would decrease prices of school, that would likely be a change that would occur over several years. If universal healthcare was implemented tomorrow, for example, I doubt the tuition costs would also decrease tomorrow. Within that time before correction, there would be worsening disparities. In addition, there may not be a large decrease in medical school demand across the board, as high-paying specialties would likely still be relatively high-paying and have high demand. There still could be lots of students trying to go into medical school and competing for those high-paying specialties; what would worsen is the amount of students who want to go into lower-paying specialties. So, medical schools may still see high demand for their services and continue to charge large tuition fees.While I also agree that a lower medical school tuition would open barriers and allow more people to become doctors, the decreased pay would be unattractive to very high-achieving students who may decide to pursue other career fields rather than medicine. This may overall worsen the quality of students accepted into medical school and worsen the quality of physicians.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"\\"My parent doesn't want to sleep with any of her daughters\\".","title":"Eric Trumps Hot Take On Kamala Harris In Debate Goes Spectacularly Awry"},{"text":"Progressives aren't the problem here... many progressives own guns.

As the Supreme Court said, while protecting people's right to lie: The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The response to the unreasoned is the rational; to the uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth....

This is signifying that people don't want to train in these specialties. If you ask the average medical student why they don't want to go into primary care, one of the main concerns they have is the low comparative pay. Family doctors and pediatricians make way less than most other specialties and have to deal with high patient volumes and lots of paperwork just to make their practice sustainable. Couple the low pay with living in less than desirable cities, you can understand why medical students who are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt are not pursuing these specialties.I feel like you're missing a large piece of the puzzle. The incredibly high cost of medical school.Because medical school forces you to leave with $200k+ in student debt, low-paying fields are not an option for most people. Medical schools can only charge such a ridiculous amount because of the existence of these extremely high-paying fields, which in turn is caused by the lack of single-payer healthcare. If the cost of medical school significantly decreased, I'm sure many doctors would be happy to accept the salary that family doctors or pediatricians have.If universal healthcare were implemented, it would lower costs across the board. Medical schools would be **forced** to lower tuition simply because of supply and demand. Once tuition costs decrease, I think it would open the doors for MORE people to become doctors, not less because it would be more accessible and less risky to attend. There would also be the added benefit of not having crushing debt for graduates who are then required to only pursue high-paying fields.","title":"CMV: Universal Healthcare will worsen the physician shortage and lead to more health disparities"},{"text":"imo, she wasnt rambling as she normally does its odd and im not sure what they gave her to make her present herself in such a calm way LOL. its crazy people are still saying she won, even though she lied however many times. either way, a lot of people are fact checking her now, and i truly believe the ball will land in trumps court. hopefully there will be a second debate, and it would be awesome to see fox news holding it this time. ??","title":"Contrarian opinion to the media I think Trump overall won."},{"text":"My project manager is in her late 30s and at a recent lunch was talking about some raffle or lottery or something to be able to buy tickets to her concert in not-our-country.

It seems like it hinges on the strength of the statement, rather than the substance.For example:Opinion: \\"I believe abortion is bad and should be banned.\\"Worldview: \\"Liberals murder babies\\"?It might help me if you could categorize the following:* \\"I believe abortion is murder and should be banned.\\"\\n* \\"I believe we should ban the murdering of babies.\\"\\n* \\"I believe liberals want to abort babies.\\"Additionally I don't think your 3 categories account much at all for things like persuasive or manipulative speech for example. There's a lot of assumptions being made about the intention behind the speech.I'm just engaging with the thought experiment here, **I don't personally believe abortion is murder.** But we ought to be generous in order to be rigorous.**Opinion.** \\"Abortion is murder.\\" If I am asked about my position on abortion, and I calmly, quietly, respectfully relay to you that \\"Abortion is murder.\\" There is an implicit \\"I believe.\\" There is also an implicit \\"you may not agree with me.\\"**Worldview.** \\"Abortion is murder.\\" Perhaps I'm saying this because of a moral judgement, a visceral reaction, a general view that the thing inside a woman is no different than a baby. I would use a word like \\"life\\" instead of \\"thing\\", and \\"unborn\\" instead of \\"fetus.\\" I would think of \\"fetus\\" as a word no different than \\"toddler\\" or \\"teenager,\\" one that more accurately describes a specific timing in life. (again, I don't really see a distinction between opinion and worldview other than perhaps a degree of conviction on the matter, but I'm trying.)**Fact.** \\"Abortion is murder.\\" There is an implicit \\"should be.\\" If, for example, Project 2025 comes to pass, abortion will be illegal nationwide, no exception. Therefore by definition it will be unlawful. And anyone actively aborting their fetus or baby or thing (call it what you will) will be acting with premeditation. Therefore by strict legal definition, it will be a matter of actual fact that abortion is murder.If project 2025 comes to pass, what is fact and opinion (by your descriptions) will effectively flip on its head. Now if someone says \\"abortion is murder\\", they can be speaking strictly as a matter of fact, while holding the opinion that abortion is not murder.And if it becomes common practice for liberals to abort early stage pregnancies, \\"liberals murder babies\\" will slide into this grey territory of generalization, albeit one that must now be scrutinized as fact.Please remember I'm not attempting to demonstrate my own opinions or worldviews of abortion, nor the difficult questions of \\"what is factually life\\" and \\"what is factually human.\\"Instead I'm presenting challenges to the way you're categorizing speech and levels of scrutiny by way of example.","title":"CMV: \\"Speech\\" can fit into 3 categories, and different categories should face different scrutiny."},{"text":"And the questions she was asked were far more difficult to answer with nuance and defend her policy positions and decisions.Dude couldn't even show an ounce of humility when asked about January 6.","title":"Trump Demands ABC Be Shut Down for Daring to Fact Check Debate"},{"text":"He stood next to fully functioning adult person for the first time im years?","title":"Kamala Harris Made Donald Trump Look Silly and Small at the 2024 Debate"},{"text":"I mean, you could easily use this to make the opposite point - that private for-profit healthcare has lead to a severe physician shortage, and therefore government intervention is necessary to fund more primary care physicians (by leveling salaries, reducing admin and practice burdens, improving med school access like has been successfully tried in Brazil (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31650601/) etc.  And government intervention at a scale necessary to solve a national physician shortage is only possible under a universal health care model.
