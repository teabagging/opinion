Why do you think his foreign policy was bad?6. Why do you think you got a tax increase? I got a tax cut.7. Universal Health care just isn't an american thing. This is a much larger debate, but the long and short of this is whoever you vote for president doesn't matter for this issue. You'd have to get a commanding majority of both house and senate to get this done. Harris would not do this either.8. Gay rights? They have all the same rights as everyone else right now.

If a progressive leaning candidate could appeal to X voters, a moderate candidate could appeal to X + (some number above 0) votersIn theory, but it's not that simple. There is a ton of evidence that demonstrates that many other things beyond the ideology of a candidate impact how they perform in a race, including their demographic fit to the electorate, the quality of their opponent, underlying political environment, and so on. You can't look at any one race (say, Barnes-Johnson) and say that the Democratic candidate being too liberal was definitively the reason they lost, especially given that in that cycle there were similarly liberal candidates in demographically similar states (e.g. Fetterman in Pennsylvania) who won and that there were more moderate candidates who lost.But for data based approaches,?[you can also look at 2020 house elections](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-strongest-house-candidates-in-2020-were-mostly-moderate/)?where moderates statistically did better. Makes sense that the same dynamic would apply to senate races tooHouse races and Senate races are apples and oranges. The election cycles are shorter, turnover is generally higher, and candidates can more finely calibrate their campaigns to particular demographics or interest groups since their districts tend to be more uniform in those regards than entire states are.","title":"Democrats haven't given up on long-shot Montana Senate race"},{"text":"Draft dodging and being anti-war is pretty in-character I would say.","title":"Kamala/Media edited Trump 1 minute Analogy about Warhawk Liz Cheney and turned it into 10 seconds."},{"text":"![gif](giphy|R4rKiWwtoR7n49pLIo|downsized)","title":"Been solo protesting my local Trump rally every Saturday all month.

Just comparing some of the counties from the 2016 presidential to the 2018 senate on wikipedia, it looks like Cruz outright did better in margins than Trump did in some of the reddest rural counties like Roberts, Borden, Wheeler, and Sterling, and in others like King, Glasscock, Motley, Shackelford, and Armstrong, Cruz did just about a percent or less (sometimes basically the same) as Trump did in margin, while also doing better in terms of percent. Whereas in the biggest counties like Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and Travis where Beto saw pretty sizable swings in his favor (four points in Travis, 8 points in Dallas, 9 points in Tarrant, 7 points in Bexar, and 11 points in Travis) as well as high turnout. And juicing liberal turnout was enough to get Beto *close*, in a deep blue wave year. In 2016, Hillary did 11 points worse in Texas than the national average (won the popular vote by 2, lost in Texas by 9). In 2018, Dems won nationally by 8.5, and Beto lost by 2.5, so he did 11 points worse in Texas than the national Democratic average... in other words, his performance was basically comparable to Hillary in 2016, and if one wanted to be particularly uncharitable to Beto, one might attribute the closeness of his race simply to the shifting national conditions Or Hegar who's more conservative and from a military background getting BTFO by 10 points in 2020 when Biden lost Texas by 6. On paper, she should have been far more appealing to Texas conservatives or moderates, but the world doesn't exist on paper and voters don't behave in predictable ways.Where's this idea coming from that Hegar was conservative? Having a military background doesn't make someone conservative at all. And her actual platform was pretty liberal, comparable to the Biden platformAlso she had EXTREMELY low name recognition, she came in first place in the first round of the Democratic primary with just like 20% of the vote and then won the top-two runoff with just like 52% of the vote with turnout basically half of what it was the first time around. I'd guess that her underperformance is easily explainable by her being a \\"literally who?\\" Democrats don't have issues with running moderates and will even back a former Republican if they think it gives them the best chance of toppling a Republican (see Evan McMullin.)They should do that more Beto didn't even bother with it, and ran an aggressive, unapologetic campaign, and still holds our best result in Texas since the 90's.But as above, not actually better than Hillary's performance if you take national conditions into account A Democrat trying to hedge in a conservative state just appears to voters to be a coward and a sneak, and the ones who do win usually are pretty open about who they are instead of trying to be Manchin-lite.See this is part of the thing, I didn't say try to be Manchin-lite, I'm literally suggesting running people like Manchin, actual loud and proud moderates","title":"Democrats haven't given up on long-shot Montana Senate race"},{"text":"How I categorize different members of the party would take a while for me to get through, so I wont break it down too much. However, I would say the Democrats generally have four more-or-less reliable factions: Centrists, Moderates, Liberals, and Progressives. These labels mostly refer to how peoples relationships with the party and how they operate within it. Manchin and Sinema are centrists. MJ Hegar is a moderate. Nancy Pelosi is a liberal. Warren is a progressive. https://youtu.be/Zi6v4CYNSIQ?si=QrMtg4aJ_vJ1J62JThis was Hegars introductory ad when she ran in my district in 2018. The points of emphasis were very much about moderate credentials- veteran, wanting to get things done, being a family mom, things that code to voters as moderate. If theres anything that Texans remember of her, its that she was a veteran mom. She blasted that in just about every ad.https://youtu.be/bIYHz6fPAgo?si=cd5efTmIuI31vq0WHer launch ad for the 2020 senate race had her emphasize strength, courage, and independence which are again things that will code as moderate. These two ads were the biggest exposure anyone in Texas had to her, and while her actual policy positions were pretty standard for the Democratic Party, the image that people on the ground got was that she was a moderate politician. How a candidate presents themselves is just as, if not more, important than their actual policies in shaping voters opinions of them. Facing a strong incumbent like Cornyn, Hegar and her team made the decision to emphasize her moderate credentials. The result was pretty decent, and while she underran Biden, only losing by 9 isnt a bad performance in that context. Most voters arent reading and breaking down policy platforms, especially if your campaign ads are sparse on the details. The most exposure that voters had of Hegar showed her to be things that are associated with being a moderate. The most prominent Republican attack ad against her, which obviously called her far-left, didnt bring up her platform. It showed a picture of her tattoos.Coding as a moderate can go both ways. Nikki Haley is, for all intents and purposes, very right-wing, but if you look at how voters perceive her, they think that shes a moderate because of how she chose to position herself against Trump. No one thinks that she isnt right-wing, no one is mistaking her for a centrist, but they see her brand of conservatism grounded in sensibility and decency, which are staples of the moderate brand. Hegar couldve been the second coming of Marx, but if you look at how her campaign presented her, and the feedback they got from voters, everyone in Texas thought of her as being a moderate.","title":"Democrats haven't given up on long-shot Montana Senate race"},{"text":"When I was in 2nd grade we were all being taught about the wars the US were in.

Here is a synopsis of his actual platform and achievements as President:The first President in decades to not participate in a new war. We can all agree that war is terrible right?  Peace through strength makes a lot of sense in this circumstance. Our enemies watched Trump rebuild our military, and his rhetoric scared the hell out of them. Trump held members or NATO accountable in paying their fair share which led to one of the most peaceful 4 years in WORLD history. Trump started the process of reducing the price of insulin. Trump implemented the right to try for people with life threatening conditions. He also expanded VA benefits and along with congressmen mast greatly improved the VA. \\nHe was the first President ELECTED as a supporter of same sex marriage. (Obama was opposed until his second term)Secure the border. This shouldnt even be political. Its a matter of public health, national security, the safety of American citizens AND foreign children. (there are 325,000 children that came through our southern border that are missing) under Trump, we had the most secure border in modern history with record low encounters of illegal crossing. Partially due to policy, but also due to rhetoric. Trump is the first and only president in the 21st century that while in office, Russia did not invade another country. The media has led people to believe he is a Russian asset, but they ignore Obama saying tell Putin Ill have more flexibility after the election.Under the Trump administration we all but eradicated Isis. Obama dealt with them for years, but after Trump, we never hear much about isis anymore do we?Under the Trump administration we saw wages going up.Under Trump we had manufacturing jobs coming back, (which is beneficial in reducing climate change by the way, id rather not ship so many goods all over the globe from china who couldnt care less.)Under Trump an average home was attainable for an average income family. Now you need to be in the top 10% of income earners to afford an average home. This is incredibly unsustainable and arguably the death of the American dream. Under Trump, inflation was at one of its lowest levels in modern history which made the cost of living more affordable, especially as wages rose.Under Trump we had the lowest level of unemployment across all demographics in American history. Trump dedicated the highest amount of support to black Americans since Lincoln. Look at his track record prior to even entering politics in supporting black politicians, funding black owned businesses ect; and then look at his funding for HBCUS and the black communities in our country when he was in office. I could go on and on and on here. The only true sensible criticisms for Trump would be his rhetoric, which most of us really dont care about considering all of the above, and his handling of Covid-19 which is really a matter of perspective. The forecasts were over 5 millions deaths, we didnt hit anywhere near that. Its also important to know that he couldnt exactly force everyone to stay inside, this was all primarily handled at local and state levels. I am personally not a fan of the vaccines, but the left likes to push them on people yet gives Trump zero credit for operation warp speed which cut the time to release a Covid 19 vaccine by a decade.","title":"Why should I vote for trump?"},{"text":"She will win PA .

Your take is honestly naive as hell.Many of us btw will be voting for acceleration going forward we are not going to allow them to run the controlled opposition scam. And I will make it my personal mission to ensure that every person who voted for Kamala gets what they voted for and they get it good and hard.It won't be like the people who voted for dems in California and got to leave after they ran it into the ground - this time there will be nowhere left for them to defect to and honestly that will be very comforting to know they will be forced to face the consequences of their decisions. As so many others did throughout history when the bill finally came due.So if Trump loses I agree with you on one thing - don't despair. Enjoy the surprised pickachu faces from democrats when they in short order find out the hard way what they voted for. Remind them of it every day and never let them live it down.It will really be glorious as either way our opponents lose, even when they get what they want by the time they get it they don't want it anymore but then it's too late. Anyone who knows their history knows this is the future for Americans if Kamala somehow wins (which btw nobody is going to believe is legit if it happens with these metrics).And Trump's legacy will remain no matter what because the disaster that follows him will prove he was 100% right once again. Striking him down will just make him even more of an icon than democrats could possibly imagine. Would be a lot of parallels to the persecution and rejection of a certain other figure in history.","title":"No matter what happens"},{"text":"Kamala for President 2024!!!","title":"Kamala Harris is mixed.

Being a woke leftist is advertised as \\"the norm\\", so it's what most young people aspire to be... especially the ones who are chronically online, which let's be honest, describes all of us here.I was never super into politics as a youngster, but was ideologically left-wing, atheist, the whole nine yards. That lasted until my big wake-up moment, which was the 2016 election cycle, and it seems almost shameful to admit this now but I had never really questioned any of my core convictions before that event. Initially, I supported Trump; it was glorious and I truly felt like my eyes had been opened for the very first time after a lifetime of blindness. As time went on, though, I came to realize how fabricated the whole \\"movement\\" was, so by the time of the election itself, I had disavowed him and divorced myself from the political process. Regardless, the redpills that were being dropped all over the Internet around that time, on a wide variety of topics which were not limited to the election or politics, were enough to change my entire worldview irrevocably. Just the realization that we were all being lied to on a systematic basis by the institutions placed in charge of our lives was enough to shake me to my core. I now understand that the entire political process is, *at best*, heavily manipulated theater in which the general public is only allowed to participate under very limited and controlled conditions.Full disclosure: I did have a few \\"warning shot\\" moments prior to the 2016 election which opened my eyes *partly* on certain things, but not *completely*, including a very sobering relationship with a girl who claimed she was a Monarch sex kitten and had quite a lot to say about the elite. So I came into 2016 with quite a bit more information than most people, which is important because it gave me a leg up on my friends, but nothing was ever big enough to \\"shock\\" me out of my delusions or make me ask any *real* questions until the events of that year.2016 was the most important year of my life. I didn't even accomplish anything of particular note or change all that much about myself as a person, but it was the year that shifted my entire perspective and worldview for good.

This time he has, amongst others,  JD Vance, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, two former Democrat presidential candidates, including a Kennedy for cryin' out loud. in RFK, Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, all working to repair the mess, across a broad spectrum, of the last couple of decades of Democrat ruin especially the last four years.The generals he pissed off were part of the same sort of warhawk neocon convention that Bush/Cheney brought to get us into the Iraq war.  Milley, frankly DJT's biggest target, literally admitted to treason by saying he would alert the enemy (China) if Trump took some action that never happened in that the Trump administration got the US involved in no war during his administration. That's something no president in decades can say. The rest of the higher up military officials were some form of old school neocon warhawk interventionist, DEI destruction of the military progressive, or military industrial complex shill simply interested in money, destructive progressive weakening of our military, or nation building.His foreign diplomacy was good if not autistically straight forward and to the point. You may not like the package his diplomacy came in, but it was effective. Allies that refuse to honor their NATO obligations were told straight up, 'Kick in like you promised or the US is out. The US has been carrying the ball by itself for too long.\\" He rattled the saber with North Korea, Russia, China and various terroristic Islamic fundamentalists unconventionally with both the diplomatic nice guy approach (visiting N Korea and a respectful approach to Putin) and the threatening approach of the US military might and economic sanctions that left aggressive world leaders unsure and off balance in the US response. Every nation stood down.  Unprecedented Middle East cooperation, agreements and declarations were made in moving the US embassy to Jerusalem (long promised by previous administrations but never fulfilled) and the Abraham Peace Accords.Taxes increased because of Biden erasing, through executive action, Trump policies on day one. Universal health care may be impossible and unfeasible in the US for many economic, cultural and legislative barriers that are really more protective of American liberties and  freedom of choice not guaranteed in other nations around the world. There is a trade off for that.  He did however, despite Biden's claim, cap prescription prices and eliminate pre-existing conditions.I'm not sure what you are looking for in true gay rights (not trans rights) but marriage and economic protections in terms of discrimination are all already in place legislatively and left to the states where not federally protected as the Constitution has provided and federally limited.As for working class relief, the four years of Trump's administration pre-Covid were some of the strongest years in history in terms of the economy, opportunities and overall benefit to the working class to all classifications of demographics. The country was a net energy exporter for the first time. Trump reworked trade deals to benefit the US and US workers in an unprecedented manner. The last four years have just shown a spotlight on the contrast of Republican vs Democrat policies on the every day lives of every day people.Harris is not a new way forward.

No politician is going to stand up against the senseless killing caused from war when there is so much money behind it. From 2016-2020 Trump kept us out of any new conflicts. Let's hope for that again. We've seen what will happen if the Democratic party stays in office.\\\\-the health of the American people. We are absolutely killing ourselves right now with prescription drugs and pesticides on our food. Why? Money. How do I know the democratic party is chasing the money? because they won't even have a conversation with people like RFK jr. It goes against their financial interests. And, all the big pharma companies back Harris and have provided massive campaign donations. This absolutely disgusts me. Poisoning our children all for $$$\\\\-obvious one, open border. There is absolutely NO FAIR RESON we should be letting anyone across the border. I am very cynical about the motives of the Biden admin on this.

You have RFK (read his thing on what MAGA means) who wants to fix the health crisis, you have Tulsi who I hope becomes SoS and helps with stopping proxy wars and prevents others, you have Elon who wants to audit the Federal Government and reduce spending on dumb shit, and the list goes on. I remind you that most of the people on that ticket are former Ds (including DJT) who found themselves in your position. Remove Harris, you have the state run legacy media and Walz who set up snitch lines so neighbors could turn in neighbors and various other items like a proven liar, ties with China, fraud investigation for the state while he was governor, etc.  so either the same stuff as the last four years or something more progressive with worse consequences. Im not saying that Trump is going to come in and fix everything or even deliver on everything he ran on. People who think that dont really understand politics. But Im voting for fixing the health crisis and no new wars and ending the proxy wars. If prices come down, budget balanced, etc occurs then bonus.","title":"Why should I vote for trump?"},{"text":"*Why* is it weird?What about going \\"NOM NOM NOM\\" to a cute child is weird specifically?

Basically, if you're objectively wrong, you can't use might to subdue reality itself. I think a good example of this is mao's sparrow problem that happened in china in the mid 20th century. When the communists were trying to collectivize farming and improve agricultural production, they noted that sparrows were eating some of the crops and thus harming crop yields. So the government incentivized killing sparrows in order to protect the crops. The sparrows, however, were the primary predators for various types of pest insects. With the numbers of the sparrows diminished, these pests multiplied and ate the crops much more voraciously than the sparrows ever did, causing mass famine and deaths to millions of chinese. The communists in this case perfectively applied their might to overcome the sparrows, but their course of action was objectively in error, which caused brutal reality itself to kill several million of them.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"We know were on the right side of history.

Now, they just get to get away with saying it out loud for a few days. ?? Of course, they'll jump on it because they dont just hate Democrats, guys. They only care about your vote so that they get to make money from lobbyists and interest groups.  \\nMake no mistake, there are Dem leaders who do it too... but at least they give more of a shit about people at the same time.  Leftists know and agree that the whole thing needs to be changed, but it honestly needs to start with long-time Republicans not purposely stagnataing and holding things back because they need to know they'll benefit first before they consider trying to do anything for the citizens.  \\nThats why they haven't come up with much of anything to help people for decades. Anything that does seem to help people is buried under a lot of self-interest and policies that really just put money back in their pockets, and we let them. Thus, both sides do it.  \\nWe should be demanding change together, instead of from each other. It just ends up that Dems are far more bi-partisan, sometimes frustratingly so. Aside from the last couple of years, because we sure as hell aren't gonna let this hate machine just roll over the country unchallenged in its division and discrimination.  Right-wing media was widely under-represented for good reason: it is the later-stage capitalist controls just trying to hold on to keeping money and power, and the majority of people obviously dont care about that.  \\nNot until the leaders clued in and led people (moreso Republicans) to feel afraid, powerless, and believe like they're the victims, and that its all due to politicians (overwhelmingly, the Democrats), whether any of it was true or not. Like the way they use the Bible.  \\nIts almost too easy, just like with evangelicals promising wealth by asking people to surrender it to them.  \\nSame disgusting playbook, and those people have no one to blame but themselves, but instead, they're told to point that despair towards political rivals rather than all who abuse the system for themselves.

It's absolutely one of the functions to give professors the flexibility to explore new ideas without being excessively penalized for the failure of a particular idea to take off. For instance, if a professor writes a grant to the CDC to investigate the use of some Monoclonal Antibody to fight Covid-19 in a new Mouse Model, but doesn't get the grant approved....then they shouldn't be fired on such grounds. Once you get tenure that is a part of the job security that they address (also in the wikipedia link).Over and above this, yes it's there to protect their academic/intellectual freedom and to not allow them to be bullied out of holding certain views, ideas, etc.","title":"Ahoy neolibs, what is y'all's take on the concept of tenure in academia ?"},{"text":"Yeah dude, the British empire is directly linked to many of the modern day's international issues.

This applies to tariffs which are an import tax as well.If I was to rank taxes based upon how bad they are it would go.1. Payroll Tax - This is just income tax with deception\\n2. FICA - Which is an income tax diverted in to a Ponzi scheme sold as a pension\\n3. Income Tax - Which is a tax on labor\\n4. Property Tax - Not to be confused with land tax, is a tax on what someone else believes you property is worth\\n5. Value Add Tax - Which is a sales tax on every consensual transaction at every step in the supply chain including wholesalers.\\n6. Sales Tax - Which is a tax on the use of fiat currency for consensual transactions\\n7. Capital Gains Tax - Which is an income tax derived from the sale of an appreciating asset. (Only ranked lower than income because of implementation rules)\\n8. Corporate tax - Which is an income tax on business owners' profit. Most similar to a capital gains tax but applied to a group of people legally defined as a corporation.\\n9. Export Tax - Tax collected for selling items out of a defined boundary\\n10. Import Tax - Tax collected for selling items into a defined boundary\\n11. Excise Tax (General) - Tax on specific goods or services. (Think Alcohol tax)\\n12. Excise Tax (Targeted) - Tax on specific goods or services that are held in trust to promote more of that good or to support related infrastructure. (Think gas tax to promote road maintenance or fees on utilities to expand utilities into rural communities that would be otherwise unprofitable)\\n13. Land Tax - Tax collected on value of unimproved land. Meaning the value of an acre of land is based on location or the natural resources derived not what's built upon it.On my scale, tariffs are bad as they increase the cost of goods imported. However, they are less bad than many others. Tariffs (and subsidies, but subsidies need to created through unrelated taxes) can be used as a tool to increase domestic production. Domestic production in some cases is essential for national sovereignty especially when your suppliers are potential adversaries. Think arms production, food and medicine.It's also important to note prior to 1913, the US was wholly funded by tarrifs and excise taxes.  \\nAgain it depends on how and where they are applied. While I philosophically oppose tariffs, they aren't always bad. The devil is in the details.","title":"How do I explain to people that tariffs are bad"},{"text":"I have a 20 minute commute in the seacoast.  I counted 21 Harris signs to 4 Trump signs.

Let me see if I can explain this.For your example, there were other contracts that may have been a better product at say $30 million per plane, so the $20 million plane wins the contract. During production someone decides this one critical part needs to be manufactured by one company and because they are a small business with minimal employees this part will take up all of their production so they charge 10x what they originally charged, then a screw fails during testing now all screws must come from one manufacturer that has contracts for 10,000 screws at x price even though you can buy at 0.5x price. So cheaper plane ends up being almost as expensive as the next best option with less features, worse design, and behind schedule.I would say Oshkosh is one of the few government contractors that actually gives a decent product, but Motorola cant even make a decent radio for the military and thats pretty much their entire business (shitty batteries, worse range, same hardening, and way more expensive than the enterprise radios they make with the same functionality)","title":"Kentucky voting machines are Refusing to let voters select Donald Trumps name, automatically selecting Kamala Harris instead."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/58uky0yqz9yd1.jpeg?width=1079&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4708123dff94f8e2ebb0b5e755932e417e887532But same fr","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"\\\\No matter what happens Tuesday-maybe Saturday, the country will survive.I could not disagree more, we can't take 4 more years of the biden harris policies.

Short version: a state is made of two parts: the Repressive apparatus and the Ideological apparatus. The first part (Repressive) solely exists to maintain the greater whole, and is sanctioned to use violence to preserve the society. What youre missing, first, is that just because they have a mandate to use necessary violence doesnt mean they do use it, or must, or usually can without repercussions if they cross over the line of acceptable action for their position. Police can detain lawbreakers, but laws prohibiting excessive force or the like still exist to protect the populace. This means they gain the authority to do so from the State, not vice versa, because other parts of the State (FBI investigating a local sheriff whose actions rob citizens of civil or constitutional rights, for instance) may counteract them. Thus, a state may have (as you said) a monopoly on violence (or at least. Legitimized violence)  but that monopoly itself is not absolute, nor is it monolithic. Plus, in many States, social and legal factors are constructed to decentralize and limit that power and return more autonomy to the members of that social structure. Of note, the other half (the Ideological apparatuses: family, news media, education, entertainment, the legal system, religion, unions/clubs/parties, etc) all are still influential (and perhaps more so than the RSAs) but by definition they are not sanctioned to use violence. The more societies progress over time, the more they seek non-violent means of creating stability. Violence is still required as a tool or a threat due to how people work, but it ceases to be the most effective tool after a certain point.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"The real end point of the MAGA movement is to take away womens and minorities rights to vote.

Inflation will grow and so on.By and large, with dems winning I expect them trying to deal with electoral college somehow too - we already hear from them more often than not that the current constitution should be changed. And that's the constitution - add more liberal judges and oh boy.People should vote vote vote.  \\nP.S I can bring NL as an example - no matter how right wing coalition is, nothing can be done as you can't really stop immigration or add policies when you have left leaning people in various positions who are against execution of them. And aggressive methods won't work due to outcry of \\"peace forces\\". And you can't really push special foreign policies due to the pressure from the EU. Then we have immigrants coming from less developed states - and they are used to failed infrastructure so they don't vote for improvements of railway systems (because they are used to bad ones), but for more benefits for themselves that lead to price increases and inflation later.","title":"No matter what happens"},{"text":"STOP THE COUNT","title":"Democrat sweep incoming?"},{"text":"Do NOT get comeplacent.

You have big headwinds from women celebrities siding with Kamala because of the overturning of Roe v wadeHigh quality poles like the highest quality lean more towards Kamala, though in general we have less polling but allegedly higher quality polling. The recent Puerto Rican comment at that big rally and the language used there is a turn off to minorities and probably a lot of other people. Betting markets are being fueled by an overconfidence from Trump who Cherry picks poles and pointed out poly Market which has gone viral on Acts which was manipulated by a French Bitcoin billionare with a 120 million dollar orderA lot hardcore trump people think the election is rigged anyway so why even vote, though the effect on this may be tinyVoter enthusiasm if we're looking at Social statistics is way stronger with Kamala Harris and she has much more Grassroots support if we're talking about independent donations from US citizens. Because of her funding Advantage she has a huge ground game, calls, text, and is able to run more ads. You have former Republicans endorsing her at her rallies not to mention all the celebrities, you have more younger people voting which are more liberal and are more politically involved especially women due to social media. Alan explained the reasoning with this keys with the economic part and showed that even with Obama's term which is very similar to this term with the economy he still won. It seems historically that you have to call a recession for it to actually matter as an influence. Honestly the keys things is very subjective I mean if you're a liberal you're going to get more keys to Kamala, if you're conservative you're going to give more keys to TrumpThe only person that can award Keys is Alan himself because he fully understands the nuances of it as it's much more than the simple phrase descriptions. He's the one that has designed the system which is highly theoretical and based on tons of data that we simply don't understand and he's the only one that can use the model accurately and he wasn't wrong. He wasn't even wrong in 2000 technically because black voters were denied for bubbling in and writing the name since they did not trust the state and that somehow was thrown out which swung the election, hanging ballots would have not mattered. Talk about rigged, seriously The only thing that Trump has going for him is the idea that inflation was Biden's fault when in fact we handled inflation a lot better than European countries and most of that inflation was from supply chain disruptions and the only way to really counter this inflation is by ensuring wages are raised up and groceries don't add extra to prices Beyond inflation kind of like what gas stations may have done. It seems like split ticket voting is going to be a lot more common either due to women that are Republican that really don't like Trump but are fine with the Republican representative or senator from their state. Trump also seems to be getting older and while he's not Biden level old, it's very clear that the pressure on him with lawsuits and age is getting to him and you can see it in his look.  He also had weak debate performance against Kamala and which Kamala Rose in the polls afterward and they decided not to have another debate obviously she won that, polls reflected that. People saw that he was flip-flopping on abortion and apparently implied that he was not on the same page as JD Vance, and he also said he didn't have a plan even though he he really should. He also got fact checked rightfully so which they really should be because well it's just right to do it. Trump who has scammed people in his university who is clearly a businessman type who is ruthless and only cares about results it does not care about what he says or keeping politics clean and it certainly wearing on him as he slowly going down from lawsuits and investigations it just a matter of who gets into office.","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"My Max Chandler-Mather automod response ~~which I hate~~ was the October surprise.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The American Bonaparte","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thats team politics for you.

When the conflict ends, they say, the nation should not rebuild its massive Soviet-era infrastructure and instead continue the rewilding by letting nature keep restoring itself. It was a monumental disaster. The dynamiting of the Kakhovka dam on Ukraines Dnieper River just before dawn on June 6 last year rapidly emptied Europes largest hydroelectric reservoir. Some 14 million acre-feet of water hurtled downstream for more than 100 miles to the sea. Around 80 villages were flooded, more than 100 people died, and more than 40 nature reserves were engulfed. In the Black Sea, the flood delivered a flush of industrial toxins, land mines, agricultural chemicals, sediment, and freshwater that killed fish and unleashed swarms of algae along the coast. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, called it the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades  since the meltdown at the countrys Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. Within days, his government pledged to rebuild the dam. But now the ecological consequences of this war crime  widely presumed to be perpetrated by the dams Russian occupiers  are being seen in a different light. The bed of the former reservoir is rapidly rewilding, with extensive thickets of native willow trees growing. The countrys ecologists are calling for plans for a new dam to be dropped, in favor of nurturing the ecological renewal. And they argue that some of Ukraines short-term wartime environmental catastrophes  on rivers, in forests, and across the countrys precious steppe grasslands  can be turned into long-term ecological gains.There is a lot more to this article besides the beginning blurb and I highly recommend you read as it does give a good view into the current state of Ukrainian ecology and the impact of Russia's imperialist war against it!ping UKRAINE&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"SS: The American Dream promise?

It's about the people making money off those companies. Companies are big things, with a large and layered structure. There's no individual person in charge of the whole. So every individual is looking to make as much money as they can, today.While the CEO and most of the rest of the managerial class are rotating in and out of other companies every few years.The most stable companies in this whole mess are actually those run by family members because they are the only ones with an incentive to think somewhat long term. Like Phizer. But all they do is promote more schemes to make more money, because that's all they know. Their grandfather might have been a business genius in founding the company, but these kids grew up as billionaires and never had to do a hard thing in their lives, utterly isolated from consequence and most of reality.So all they do is hire consultants to figure out the next scheme, if they can put numbers into a bank account they feel accomplished.And when it comes to warnings of bad patterns that might spell doom for the system, they just assume someone will figure out a smart way around it, and that's actually not totally wrong.Capitalism is very adept at offsetting problems.","title":"Mike Johnson pledges to scrap Obamacare if Trump wins, saying it will be \\"a big part of the agenda\\""},{"text":"This is legitimate, as opposed to bullshit conspiracy theories pulled out of MAGA's in attempts to throw out thousands of legal votes.","title":"Pa.

But Indian Americans, if they play sports at all, play football.Also Kamala is mixed race-if she identifies more with her Black side-I see nothing wrong in it personally. I don't like people force pretending to know a culture to make voting points. It's dumb. She did make dosas with fellow Tam Bram Mindy Kaling if you are looking for that kind of thing. Both have admitted to being bad cooks-whose own mothers rarely cooked at home-so it was a nice bit of culture-ing in that video.I voted for Kamala because even though I have some criticisms of her, Donald Trump is not a worthy candidate to lead the country at all.And, I don't blame Kamala for identifying more with her Black side considering she went to a historically Black college, dated Black men, has prominent Black friends, and her own mother was involved in civil rights movements before and AFTER her parents got married. Considering how few Indian Americans were in the country during that time, it is understandable for Kamala to have formed more of an affinity with Black people and the Black community.

Havent read it but it is incredibly unlikely that Indian Americans wil vote for Trump.Indian Americans have always voted democrat throughout the history of their time in America. 86 percent Indian Americans voted for Obama both terms FYI (voted for a Black guy)  (the largest demographic after Black people to vote for Obama incidentally), a fewer percentage voted for Biden according to Pew research- that doesn't mean they voted for Trump though and there might be some further reduction this time..But considering how many prominent Indian Americans have spoken out in support for Kamala, I highly, highly doubt they will suddenly become Republicans or there is a massive change in their voting patterns. They contributed to a blue wave in Texas for Joe Biden..They are heavily supporting and donating to Kamala Harris' campaign this time in swing states. They are not voting for Trump, believe me.I am Indian American, have already voted for Kamala. A lot of people outside communities don't quite understand us- especially because it all turns into simplified they will vote for Trump cuz trump loves Modi stupidity which umm is not happening. And Indian americans, even Indians are far too diverse for people to peg down. Like the part of India where I come from  has a completely different language from the part of India where Kamala comes from. Like a different script and alphabet alltogether. So not like English and French which share the same alphabets but like English and Mandarin. So that's the level of difference in the country. There are 27 languages spoken in India, every region has its own film industry with the language of the state spoken in the films, different wedding customs, clothing and food. All of this is reflected also in the Indian Americans' demographic makeup and voting choices..and then there is also religion. You mentioned fundamentalism. Incidentally, all Indian Americans don't all even share the same religion. And then there are tech bros like Vivek who I dislike immensely who disavow religion altogether. So believe me, Indian Americans, the very small minority who are not voting for Kamala are not doing so because of caste or gender reasons.

But even still, the Comey letter dropped less than 2 weeks before the election. That dominated the news cycle while Trump was on his best behavior after the access Hollywood tape dropped. 12 days is not enough time to do a proper poll. We have no idea whether the polls wouldve been more accurate to the result if they could account for such a sudden shift. In 2020 they dropped the ball. The main thing was COVID non response. Pollsters even acknowledged democrats responded more. Even republicans did answer they just said TRUMP and hung up and they failed to count those. The polling industry was devastated. In 2022 pollsters did underestimate democrats in AZ, WI, MI, and PA. Because of media losing revenue and the reputational damage pollsters had after 2020, we have fewer polls. But its worth nothing the industry did not take any more hits from underestimating democrats. Polls are a drug for neurotic liberals. When they underestimate democrats their customers are relieved!

Regardless of the founders intentions, \\"Faithless Electors\\" are an important backstop for preventing a constitutional crisis. Despite what many in the media said about Chiafalo and Baca when they lost at the Supreme Court, it is absolutely vital to the electoral college that electors aren't forced to vote for the vote winner. There are several situations when elector discretion is desireable:1. If  a candidate wins the popular vote of a state, but then dies before the electors vote. This happened in 1872 when Horace Greely died. When this happens, a party can get together and agree on a new nominee, and direct the electors (who are all party loyalists) to vote for the replacement candidate instead of the deceased one. As was established in 1872, votes for dead candidates need to be rejected by congress because dead people aren't valid candidates. According to the Chiafalo v. Washington ruling in 2020, the Supreme Court presumes that states will voluntarily violate their own election laws when this occurs, freeing electors from binding pledges. They don't seem to realize that politics doesn't work like that.2. If a candidate is incapacitated or disqualified by any means that does not kill them before the electoral college convenes. It may seem like this would be resolved the same as the above scenario, but the singular sentence regarding dead candidates potentially freeing electors makes no other exception, so presumably if a week after the election the president-elect goes on a mass shooting spree and sentenced to life in jail, the electors according to the SCOTUS still have to vote for that candidate if the state feels like \\"enforcing their pledge\\", even though there is no reason that the party shouldn't be allowed to choose a replacement for them.3. If a candidate dies before the popular vote is cast but after ballots are printed. This happened in 1912, when Republican VP nominee James Sherman died a few days before the election. In this election, the republicans immediately chose a new candidate but it was too late to reprint the ballots, so Sherman remained the Vice Presidential candidate on the ballots. Despite this, people knew they were voting for a stand-in candidate, and nobody was enraged when the Republican electors were \\"faithless\\", as they knew it was going to happen. The SCOTUS doesn't even mention this possibility in their decision, although some might claim it falls under the statement on candidate death.4. If a party changes their nominee for a reason other than their death. Sometimes parties (especially third parties) submit stand in names for paperwork purposes before they have decided on their nominations, and although they often replace the nominees when they are chosen, sometimes state law stands in their way. In Michigan just this year Jill Stein is being listed with the wrong VP candidate, to name just one example. This does not presumably fall under the SCOTUS' death exemption argument, and the electors would be forced to vote for a candidate their party and their voters no longer supported. Another case would be if a nominee resigned after a scandal or other similar event. If Trump had resigned from the ticket after the access Hollywood tape came out in October 2016, it might have been too late to change some state ballots, but Republican electors would have been forced to vote for him even though he had withdrawn (that would be real \\"faithful\\", wouldn't it).5. If a third-party candidate attempts to amass electors to prevent an electoral majority, such as Strom Thurmond in 1948. Third Party candidates can never win an actual majority, but some have planned to win enough states where no party gets a majority, and then order those electors to vote for whichever main party candidate promises to carry out their agenda. His voters knew what they were voting for, and knew that the Thurmond's name on the ballot was a stand-in for whatever candidate he might bargain with. There is no reason to force the electors to vote for their \\"pledged\\" candidate in this circumstance. The SCOTUS disagrees for some unknowable reason.6. Discretion is necessary to prevent violations of the Presidential Qualifications clause. If a state can declare that electors cannot vote for certain candidates, they would presumably be able to ban electors from voting for candidates that don't meet certain criteria, such as one who doesn't release his tax returns. This has the effect of creating additional requirements for the presidency, which is unconstitutional. The SCOTUS agrees with this in a footnote, but their decision itself gives no indication of how this would be prevented from occurring.7. To preserve the integrity of Congress. The SCOTUS decision claims that the constitutional provision that the ability of legislatures to choose \\"the manner\\" of selecting electors means that they can put conditions on the selection, and recall electors that violate those conditions. The issue here is the Constitution also says states can choose \\"the manner\\" for choosing their congresspeople (although Congress can override these rules). Thus, if the SCOTUS is saying a state government can recall electors that don't vote a certain way, they are inviting states to do the same thing with their congressional representatives, and I am sure you can see what a bad idea that is.8. To raise awareness of certain issues when a candidate has already lost the vote. in 2000 for example, a elector in DC abstained from voting to protest their lack of statehood, but said they would have voted if Al Gore hadn't already been guaranteed to lose. A similar event occurred in 2016, when a Washington Elector voted for chief Faith Spotted Eagle to bring attention to Native American issues. These votes are actually more meaningful than their pledged votes, because their vote would be for the loser even if they did vote as pledged. There is no real reason to take away their ability to vote in most situations because it will rarely ever matter, and faithless votes are an effective way of sending a national message.9. The actual controversy in 2016, that led to the SCOTUS hearings, where a handful of electors from various democratic states voted for moderate republicans instead of Hillary Clinton. What people love to ignore today, however, is that this was a move highly supported at the time, as they hoped to convince enough republicans to vote against Trump that a compromise candidate could be agreed on in the house of representatives. contrary to what people claim, this wasn't a bunch of people voting against the interests of their state it was a bunch of people who saw there might be an opportunity to get a candidate elected who despite not being Clinton was nevertheless still far more popular and acceptable to their constituents that Trump was. The Change.org petition for electors to vote against Trump was one of the most supported petitions in the website's history, so it is hard to claim that Chiafalo and Baca were ignoring the interests of their constituents. The Court's decision likely prevents this from ever happening again, regardless of popular support.So yeah, those 14 states you mentioned above are actually the good ones, although the number of those is dwindling by the day.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"Malarkey level of going to a karaoke bar to sing tmrw","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"?As Republicans took control of the House on Tuesday, they wasted no time in erasing a symbol of the previous era.

But under a PR system, that same vote share would grant these Constitutionalists 20 percent of the seats in the House, a strong showing for a third party.There are other systems that would also allow for more than two parties to be influential. Even a majoritarian system, which requires a winning candidate to get more than 50 percent of the vote in order to avoid a run-off, allows for more parties, since getting second place in the initial vote isnt an automatic loss.AOC, who identifies as a Democratic Socialist but holds her seat in Congress as a Democrat, [once said](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-joe-biden-not-same-party-094642)?that **In any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party.**In a United States with a different voting system, she instead of Sanders could run as a Social Democrat, as the equivalent party is known in a number of countries.Similarly, fiscally conservative but secular libertarians and socially conservative Evangelicals would be able to maintain separate parties instead of sitting under the umbrella of the GOP.Environmentalists, pro-labour voters, and other interest and advocacy groups could carve out their own parties.Such a system, of course, is not without its drawbacks. When no single party gains a majority in a multi-party system, the need to form governing coalitions leads to gridlock or frequent political turmoil.But with 10 government shutdowns?occurring in the US since 1981 and several more narrowly avoided, the threat of government grinding to a halt already exists, and even when our government is working, many people feel like they arent being represented by the output.Reforming voting systems is not an easy task. First and foremost, the people currently in office are the people who benefitted from the current system.Reform is still possible, either as a result of public demand or if the implementation of reforms is delayedpoliticians have fewer worries about changing the rules for their successors than they do for themselves.Second, few people pay attention to voting systems, and when they do, its usually focused on cases when their preferred candidate or party didnt win, not the hypotheticals of what candidates or parties would have run under a different set of rules. And voters generally like the procedure to be simple, and the candidate with the most votes wins is a straightforward rule, consequences notwithstanding.Nevertheless, many other countries do just fine with their more complicated systems, and several constituencies in the US have successfully adopted major changes to the rules of elections.Alaska and Maine currently use [ranked choice voting](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1214199019/ranked-choice-voting-explainer) or RCV for federal and state elections, in which voters assign an ordered ranking to candidates rather than simply vote for their one top choice; New York is the largest of dozens of urban areas that also use the system in some of their local elections.Furthermore, the?[Pew Research Centre](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/06/29/more-u-s-locations-experimenting-with-alternative-voting-systems/)?notes that a number of constituencies across the US have used alternative voting methods at some point in history.For example, in the first half of the 20th century, a number of cities used single transferable vote (STV), a version of ranked choice voting with multi-member districts that is specifically aimed at ensuring proportional representation.The method was discontinued largely because of hostility to racial and ethnic minorities benefiting from the system, a concern that has hopefully lessened across the US since then. In recent decades, Pew notes, dozens of state and local constituencies have adopted alternative voting systems of some kind, often due to public demand.Thus, making this happen is possible not through throwing support behind third party candidates in the existing system, but by convincing or compelling those politicians already in powergenerally representing the two established partiesto change the rules of how we elect candidates.","title":"Would you be for reforming the two party system to allow third parties to gain more power?"},{"text":"Trump is throwing all kind of Hail Marys in the final days of the campaign, and it honestly makes it seem like he doesn't confidently think he will get the votes he needs.","title":"Trump campaign demands Colorado secretary of state temporarily halt processing of mail ballots after password leak"},{"text":"And that is good news.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Delivers Nearly $474 Million in New Grid Resilience Funding to States and Tribes as Part of Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"This is all well and good, but I want to know, do you have a concept of a plan?","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Delivers Nearly $474 Million in New Grid Resilience Funding to States and Tribes as Part of Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"this is the moment the election became real to me?https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1790747680173363660","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"what if I'm gross but not in a trans-specific way","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"His handlers don't want him anywhere near the swing states, out of fear he'll say something stupid.","title":"Trump urged a New Mexico rally on Thursday to not make him waste a whole damn half a day here, by voting for his Democratic opponent."},{"text":"For pollster gymnastics, you forgot: \\nWell my poll did not include any black republicans, but vibes tell me itll change my numbers by this much.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"For tv?

Supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and administered by DOEs Grid Deployment Office, the Grid Resilience Formula Grant program is designed to strengthen Americas power grid against wildfires, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters that are exacerbated by the climate crisis. This funding will deliver on the Biden-Harris Administrations goals to support communities in accessing affordable, reliable, and clean electricity.  \\n...  \\nWith todays announcement, DOE has awarded nearly $1.3 billion in Grid Resilience State and Tribal formula grant funds since FY 2022. Over five years, Grid Resilience State and Tribal Formula Grants?anticipates distributing a total of $2.3 billion to states, territories and tribes, including Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Alaska Native Village Corporations, based on a formula that includes factors such as population size, land area, probability and severity of disruptive events, and a localitys historical expenditures on mitigation efforts. The states and tribes will then award these funds to eligible entities to complete a diverse set of projects, with priority given to efforts that generate the greatest community benefit while providing clean, affordable, and reliable energy.A total of $815 million in formula grants were provided to states, tribes, and territories in FY 2022 and FY 2023 and they are now identifying and sub-awarding specific projects. FY 2022 and FY 2023 project highlights include: * Citizen Potawatomi Nation C Citizen Potawatomi Nation Electric Company will leverage $1.7 million in tribal and federal funding to underground electrical service connections near tribal headquarters in Shawnee, Oklahoma, including the installation of approximately 1.7 miles of new underground electrical lines. The upgrades will strengthen electrical service for nine tribal facilities in the area by reducing the risk of outages and other disruptions caused by severe weatherincluding increasingly common instances of tornadoes, dangerous straight-line winds, and ice storms. The project will also reduce the communitys reliance on backup generation during outages and extreme weather events.  \\n* Colorado C With $700,000 in federal funding through the Colorado Energy Office/Colorado Resiliency Office and local match from the Platte River Power Authority, this public power provider will install a 5 MW/20 MWh lithium-ion battery storage system in Estes Park. As the towns first battery system, the project will provide an initial step toward a microgrid. The battery system will be on a feeder that serves critical facilities such as an emergency response command center and hospital. The system will help address transmission line outages and help facilitate future renewables onto the system. The project will also avoid costs associated with replacing or expanding the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) operated, 1940s-era, 25 MW transmission line through the Adams Tunnel. This project is also the first project to be featured in a new series of impact videos on DOE-funded grid improvement projects, now available online. \\n* Kansas C The Kansas Corporation Commission will provide almost $5 million in federal and state funding to Pioneer Electric Company (PEC) to replace approximately 20 miles of aging power lines, many of which date back to original construction in the 1950s. It will also conduct proactive pole testing and replace up to 1,280 poles to reduce outages from wind damage, a growing challenge associated with increased dry rot in poles brought on by drought conditions exacerbated by climate change (the most common type of environmental hazard to cause failures on PEC's system). Finally, PEC will encourage faster dispatch and response times by deploying a drone for monitoring the distribution system, reducing the need for vehicles to reach difficult to access areas to assess damage. Using a drone will also allow PEC to investigate lines without disturbing the habitat of the native Lesser Prairie Chicken, a threatened species in Kansas. \\n* Michigan C With almost $500,000 in state and federal funding, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy is working with Alger Delta on the Kiva Line Rebuild Project. This project will rebuild more than two miles of distribution line and remove trees as part of a vegetation management strategy. The project is located between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, an area that experiences frequent storms that cause outages. This work will harden the electrical system and mitigate risks from severe weather, including decreasing the likelihood of outages....  \\nTodays announcement also advances the Biden-Harris Administrations?Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  DOE expects to issue the FY 2025 Grid Resilience State and Tribal Formula Grants ALRD in FY 2025 Q2.Link to the full list of recipients with the scope of projects is towards the end of the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:From remote and rural communities to urban centers, every pocket of America deserves a strong and reliable energy grid that can deploy clean, affordable power to homes and businesses, said?U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

It would be as likely as any that could be devised to produce an Executive Magistrate of distinguished Character. The people generally could only know &amp; vote for some Citizen whose merits had rendered him an object of general attention &amp; esteem. There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.The nation no longer has this difficulty. I say go for it.?And considering the power of the presidency, it just makes sense that the office that can enter into (or withdraw) from treaties, veto federal legislation, appoint federal judges, authorize military strikes, etc. should have the support of the American electorate. I don't see how the nation benefits from handing the keys of the Whitehouse to someone who doesn't have popular support.?What doesn't make sense is the current system. It doesn't function at all as originally intended. It gives certain competitive states disproportionate influence on the election while effectively nullifying minority (political minority) votes in others. And not only that, most states award their electoral votes on a first past the post basis, which means a candidate can receive 100% of a state's electoral votes *without* a majority. And not only that, the electoral votes awarded is based on a malapportioned legislature.Hell, technically, States can opt out of holding elections entirely if they wanted to.

I personally have only been following elections since 2020 and in that case I predicted Biden would win which he did win, does that mean I have a better predictive odds compared to Lichtman? No, but my point isn't that I'm objectively a better forecaster the Lichtman, only that based on his own keys that he made the incumbent party would lose.3. I already awarded a delta for this regarding the inaccuracy of certain data points such as consumer sentiment, so not sure If i'd reward it again for someone who made the same point, but that doesn't account for the fact that objective views of the economy are no longer being considered, the fact of the matter is that the majority of americans say were in a recession even though we aren't and this is a historically unique situation that has never happened before nor could have potentially been accounted for by lichtmans 13 keys.4.

As I argued before, a country can't be simultaneously large, consolidated, and democratic; only two of the three. The chief principle behind Democracy is that people need to be able to effectively control the direction of the government. Simply voting is insufficient, and while other forms of politicking exist, they have very little effect on the national stage unless you are exorbitantly wealthy, because that national stage has over 300,000,000 other people on it. If your instead trying to make your way in a government of 1/12th the population, your voice goes 12 times as far.Secondly, states are no less arbitrary than the US is. The US was formed when 13 governments of distinct territories joined together against a common enemy. If the members that constitute the federation are a sham, then what of the federation?And besides, there is still a ton of geopolitics at play. Some of the first states admitted to the Union after the original 13 broke away from their eastern neighbors principally because they were in the Mississippi drainage basin and not the Atlantic one, which actually caused the first notable secession efforts when western settlers wanted the freedom to negotiate with Spain trading rights over New Orleans at a time when the Federal Government in the East didn't want to. That's not arbitrary.Finally, what is preventing the Federal Government from doing racist and stupid things as well? Japanese Internment? That was a federal policy. Chinese Exclusion? That was a federal policy (and one specifically designed to placate California, who was in a racist frenzy). A ruling that slaves were property and thus couldn't be freed by taking them into a state that had banned slavery? That was the SCOTUS' infamous Dred Scott decision, which once again was *federal* and in fact explicitly chipped away at the autonomy of free states. When you give states power, some are going to make bad decision, but it won't be an all or nothing effect like it is now.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"The sad thing is that a lot of the women in these types of relationships/marriages tend to lose their confidence and self-respect, which then tends to diminish their ability to keep a poker face.

There's a term in mathematics called significant figures, where you never increase the amount of non-zero digits in an equation because it causes you to forget that the initial information wasn't that accurate. If you have 62,000 people in a state and 18.7% of them voted then a \\"smart\\" person would say you have 11,594 votes. That would be wrong. Your initial data was only accurate to the nearest thousandth, so why would we say to the nearest person. In statistics, 18.7% of 62,000 is 12,000 NOT 11,594. Not even 11,500. So you've got a ton of conclusions being drawn from inaccurate data.1. Polls literally means nothing, they are just good talking points. They've correctly predicted the winner like 60% of the time, which given a 50% starting rate isn't much. You make a point about winning by X% and the distrivution, but let's be honest with each other here, the only actual important piece of information is who won period. You don't have \\"data that supports X trend\\" you have \\"no data at all\\" literally any conclusion and supporting data from the polls is irrelevant outside of placing a bet.2.

Your entire point on this one should be disregarded because there is no CMV on \\"because I feel like it\\".3. You speak about people disliking the economy, but that functionally has nothing to do with the candidacy. Both parties are proposing fixes, and even their success rate is irrelevant. People hatred of the economy doesn't sway in either candidates camp. It also is a subpart of the polls and other factors, so if you include it, it doubles it's effect and sway factors. Making your data less accurate. This goes with military point. I'm not saying your wrong, I'm saying it doesn't affect any of your points for either candidates winning. You should be talking about how the public believes in one candidates favor over the other, not that it's an issue period 4. The trends of age and rebulocan early leaning and stuff don't matter. If those had any merit to it, every candidate ever would be from the same party since this is a constant factor that doesn't change.

Obviously a 1:1 match is extremely unlikely, but consider the methodology of polling skews the demographics that participate. For example, if the polling is done via cold calling, you are fingers going to exclude people who won't pick up the phone for a number they don't know. If you do on the street polling in certain parts of a city you will internally capture that demographic and exclude others. Then you should consider whether those who participate in the poll will actually vote, because some of them won't. There's been a lot of buzz for example about Gen z men leaning conservative but that's also not a demographic that votes compared to others.

I also understand that celebrity endorsements and a lot of upper level GOP officials have endorsed harris.However heres the thing1. These upper GOP officials had already been ostracized from the party meaning they lost pretty much all influence they had within the republican Party, Dick Cheney for example is historically one of the most unpopular VP's in history and his endorsement could potentially be a net negative for Harris.2. This level of enthusiasm is simply not reflected in the early vote which suggests a high level of turnout for republicans compared to democrats. With both being about equal in terms of early/mail in vote which is clearly a benefit to republicans.Also for your advantages with groups points, although Harris does seem to be doing better with suburban white women and generally women as a whole lets not forget that she also lost support among many groups. Black men are far more likely to vote for trump then they used to be aswell as latino voters, likewise young men are also going in favor of Trump to the point that Gen Z leans more republican then Millenials.Although I will admit theres far more scandals for Trump in 2024 compared to what was present in election day 2020, I personally am unsure if this will truely have any significant impact on the outcome but I understand that this could be a possibility!delta","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Thats leadership.

It breaks down as a third party becomes competitive and you get weird situations where a candidate can lose by attracting supporters from one of their opposition, or voters can get better outcomes for themselves by simply not voting at all.The better reforms are either proportionality with multiple winners (though not really suitable for the Presidency) or something like approval voting. For congress, either one of these would be a significant improvement. Proportional voting is more likely to result in multiple parties, especially if the threshold for election is low.I think this is where the debate between approval voting for single winner districts vs proportionality gets a bit philosophical and depends on what you think a parliament *should do.* Needing, say, 2% of the vote to get elected means a *lot* of voice get heard and represented in congress, from neo-nazis to Marxist-Leninist, to vegan activists, to whatever. It can result in a lot of wheeling and dealing and horse trading between niche special interest groups. Single winner districts with approval voting would produce far more *consensus*, and would result in a parliament with a much more moderate and broad viewpoint. There are pros and cons to both these models I think, and I personally think you could get some milage by having one in the house and one in the senate. There are also some approval voting proportional methods that might offer the best of both worlds.In terms of straight forward reform though, proportionality is much bigger and completely changes how congress would work, while approval voting can just take the role of FPTP the way RCV is in some areas (and can obviously play a role in the presidency with much less change than proportionality would). A simple swap to RCV though I think is a red herring that people shouldn't be chasing.","title":"Would you be for reforming the two party system to allow third parties to gain more power?"},{"text":"Its less about his voters and more about making it shenanigan proof, and winning the senate and the house so she can actually get shit done.","title":"Democrat sweep incoming?"},{"text":"The self owns of the MAGA crew are epic.

While we can argue about what the ideal system would be until the end of the world, a very concrete consequence of the current electoral system is the perception that individual votes don't actually change anything. This leads people to not vote, and citizen participation is absolutely crucial to democracy running smoothly. While I don't necessarily think that Popular Voting will be the end point for a perfectly ideal system, what it would very likely do is restore some of that sense that voting actually matters and bring back citizen participation in government. That said, I do think your concept of reaching an ideal voting system is solid, I just don't think we can get there when so many people feel so heavily disenfranchised by the current system. Regardless of whether their vote actually has power or actually lacks power, if the people don't feel they have power and that their will isn't being enforced you won't see the types of changes that this country really needs.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"I think in terms of decentralizing power while also keeping it in elite circles, the electoral college is about as good as it gets.

First, states are arbitrary. Their lines represent, often, where cartographers decided to draw straight lines in dirt. Sometimes they follow natural features, like rivers, but they have no bearing on the types of people who live on either sides of them. So, states don't have inherently different \\"interests\\" than each other. Any demographic divide that we have found to be relevant in today's politics can be found in most states... urban/rural, rich and poor, racial and ethnic diversity, etc. So a state having a distinct voice or interest I think is illusory. It's an arbitrary collection of random people, and those people should have their voice, their interest.Second, state governments usually do stupid shit. I mean, there's a reason why we have a Voting Rights Act at the federal level in the first place. Or ObamaCare. States are usually too stupid or racist to do it themselves. And most state legislatures are part-time and their legislative staff resources have largely stagnated since the 2000s, which means most of what most state governments do is either the result of someone's side gig or copied from what a lobbyist has given them: Copy, Paste, Legislate: https://publicintegrity.org/topics/politics/state-politics/copy-paste-legislate/So if you think the EC bolsters state governments, that only bolsters my opposition to it.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"Still is!  \\nTry googling \\"can my wife\\" and look at the autocomplete suggestions.

National polls averaged a 3-4 point Clinton win, and she won by just over 2 points in the end. In that case, a lot of late deciders went for trump, which is obviously hard for pollsters to capture. Now 2020, despite the polls correctly predicting a Biden win, was arguably much, much worse for polling. This was especially true in the rust belt  swing states. Many people in their post-election analysis blamed either higher democratic response rates or the pandemic (or a combination of both) for the polling error.Does this mean that the polls may be underestimating trump again? Sure. But 2 elections is simply not a large enough sample to draw a conclusion that the polls systematically underestimate trump. Many pollsters are now going to significant lengths to try and capture the trump vote. Nate Cohn at the New York Times has an [excellent piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/upshot/poll-changes-2024-trump.html)on this. Moreover, this is the first presidential election after Roe, as well as after Jan 6th. Weve seen abortion rights are a winning issue for dems consistently. Most Americans do not like Trumps handling of Jan 6th. These are deep, fundamental issues which may push people to vote, even if they havent done so in the past. While 2016 and 2020 were important, I think that issues like abortion bans, which have the potential to touch so many voters on a really personal level, could drive up turnout against Trump in a way that wasnt possible in other years where he was on the ballot.Finally, unlike 2016 and 2020, no one is doubting that this election will be close. In 2016, Dems were way too confident that Clinton would win, even though she wasnt actually polling that much better than Trump. And in 2020, Dems were more worried, but the big polling leads that Biden commanded may have assuaged that anxiety to an extent. People are not going to feel as anxious if they hear their candidate is up by 8 to 10 points, as polls were showing for Biden. People understand that there is a very real chance for Trump to win, and I think that understanding in-and-of-itself is crucial to getting out the anti-Trump vote.I could easily be wrong, and again, you may very well be right that Trump could win. But I think these factors are worth considering before jumping to the conclusion that Trump will certainly win.","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"I bet that sounded better in his head.","title":"Joe Biden talked them into making \\"We're garbage\\" as their slogan ??"},{"text":"Hello twin with the awesome breadwinning wife ??.

Just as importantly a Stalin type.  The college is what it sounds like, a college with members who have shown dedication for years towards this process by participating in the election process, attanding caucuses and other things.  They devote themselves to the country and have proven it.  At least the party in some ways lol but all partys claim to serve the country do they not?Not only have these members of the college served on the election process, but generally, they seem to know what they are talking about, a heck of a lot better than me, some history fan.  They educate themselves, hopefully, so they can see how best to elect and serve the people from their parties who elected them to the college.One of the greatest threats to a country is having its culture turned upside down in a way that the stability of the country can not handle it.  One way that could happen is Communist or Facist Ideas infecting the people of your country, OF COURSE, it will begin to effect the less educated parts of your country first.  Today we have things going on in the USA where Communist forces have infected the right, and extreme groups still occupy the right.What is wrong with letting the currenty system party members elect smart people who have proven on a consistant basis they show up for you and from what we are supposed to see, do the best for you.  There ARE 14 STATES, that currently allow the elector to vote his or her conscience against their party right now.

There's hopeful signs in Harris' favor.Let's give Trump some points for his ability to outperform polls, and let's imagine we don't get much in the way of republicans defecting to vote for Kamala. And we know the polls are locked up, not really favoring him or her necessarily because they're within the margin of error, so we'll give him the initial advantage.Let's talk about advantages I see on the other end, now.Obviously one people enjoy pointing to is the rally sizes. That's not meaningless, but it's not something with too much weight on its own. Still, her rallies are huge, noticeably bigger than his and that's not a bad sign, it doesn't necessarily mean she's brought in the moderates and apathetic voters she needs, but it's a good sign of enthusiasm from the democrat voting base. A few points to Kamala.You mentioned the chance that people flip to voting for her, and there's definitely been an unusual amount of Republicans coming out to endorse her, also an insane amount of big celebrity endorsements. Again, this would be foolish to take as a really good sign for voter turnout, but it's certainly not a bad one.Then, you've got her advantages with groups. Basically, when you get out of the white voters, and especially the white men who are the core of Trump's voter base, she has the advantages everywhere. We are already seeing election statistics suggesting women are turning out more than men by a fair bit, and she has an advantage with women. Gotta give her some points for that.Then you have the things that usually effect elections, but seem to not effect them that much with Trump, the scandals, the wild statements and hostile attacks. We haven't actually seen how Jan 6 and the election denial, plus all the craziness since will influence people in a federal election. Then there's the overturning of Roe v. Wade. We can be certain at the very least, none of that will be working in Trump's favor.So who knows? It's wild that the polls have it so close, and if he wins it wouldn't be the greatest shock in the world, but the more I think about it, the only statistic where Trump looks really competitive is the polls. It's weird, at this point either the polls are right and there's so many more Trump supporters than it seems there are, who are all going to turn up and make him win, or the polls are wrong and all the other stats are correct. I can't assume either is more likely, because I really don't know.","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Vote as if itll send Elon to prison.","title":"Georgia Official Demands Elon Musk Takes Down Fake Migrant Voting Video"},{"text":"Discovery should be great.","title":"Trump sues CBS for $10 billion over the 60 Minutes interview with VP Kamala Harris"},{"text":"literally no proof or citations just an image you made??","title":"Welcome to the Democrat Mindset..."},{"text":"In addition to the DLCC (where your dollars go a longer way) state and county parties could always used the funds.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 31, 2024 - 5 days until election day!"},{"text":"I said months ago that we need to click on every article that praises Harris.

He did in the past, but do you know what polls are more recent? The 2022 midterm and special elections since then, in which nearly every explicitly Trump-backed candidate lost and Democrats were underestimated in the polls. Also, this is the first time since the convictions of Donald Trump, January 6, and the Dobbs decision, that Americans will be voting with him directly in an election again.While early voting for national popular vote has Harris only up 1, that's not how it works. Whoever wins the electoral college wins, not who wins the national popular vote. Pennsylvania, perhaps the most important swing state, currently has Harris winning +16 in its early voting. Michigan has Harris winning in early voting +5. Wisconsin has Harris winning +9. Adding all the safe blue states with those three, that's exactly 270 electoral votes, precisely the minimum she needs to win, so the national early voting rate doesn't matter here since the national popular vote doesn't. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/early-vote","title":"CMV: With how things are right now Donald Trump is going to win the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Yes, although implying Kasich who's fairly conservative is kinda cringe.

Just because people are _willing_ to pay twice as much for eggs andwhatever other staples (milk, a little? Meat?) because theyre part of our daily diet doesnt mean its good. I mean, sure, the food companies make more money, buy back stock or give out a dividend, but surely its better both for the economy and working class people for _them_ to have that money, so they can spend it on something else or put it in their 401(k) or kids college fund, or saving for a down payment for a house?\\nEdit: read the second half of the comment. Obviously there should be exceptions for natural disasters or impending natural disasters, or for when supply and demand mean that the price _should_ go up (eg millions of chickens get bird flu and have to be destroyed, so until theyre replaced there is significantly smaller supply of eggs). To me, anti-price gouging isnt comparable to, say, rent control (for as poor as my opinion generally is of landlords, they havent doubled rents in the 4 years since 2020 just because their tenants are still willing to pay for it, even though, in this weird analogy, at this point in 2024 both supply and demand for housing are stable and have reached equilibriumthe prices are elevated out of greed, essentially). \\nI say this because, instead of being a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound, and utterly not addressing the underlying problemnot enough housingits preventing prices from being elevated (in my limited understanding) _in defiance_ of supply and demand, where, even though they have reached equilibrium, _prices continue to rise._ Call me crazy, but if egg producers (Im focusing on that because thats what the news has and because it was most dramatic. I think.) and grocery stores are reporting record profits to their shareholders, but arent _selling_ that much more, nor have they somehow found a way to save a bunch in expenses, call me crazy, but that seems like private corporations squeezing the public for their own benefit, and its far from unreasonable for the government to bap them with a rolled-up newspaper and say Bad!
