And police reform? We got neither meaningful reform nor improved public safety post-2020.??\\nThe problem isn't just that change is hard to sell; it's that people don't trust the ones selling it.

They'll promise that they will fix all our problems just like *that*, and if you just put whichever bad guy (immigrants, LGBT people, billionaires to use an example on our side) in their place, everything will be perfect. (And I'll clarify that I'm eager to tax billionaires and regulate their companies so we have money to help people, but let's not pretend that's going to be a quick and easy process).But nothing works like that.  The system is slow as fuck.  I wish it was faster quite often, but that's not going to change anytime soon. And nobody can ride in and fix everything right away.So people abandon Joe Biden-style politicians who work within the system, take their time, and get big-time results (most notably, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act).  They go for the guy promising to snap his fingers and make everything perfect right away.  And then they decide that politics is useless and default to complaining on the Internet (which I'm fine with the Trumpers doing, but we need every good person out there and voting to get the kind of majorities where you can do big-time change).Use populism wisely.  It gives a good vision to work towards, and it gives a nice jolt to the base.

Large companies are buying up houses and jacking up rents or changing from models where people used to be able to own a home to one where they will be renters and the companies will own all equity.

In every major democratic country to have held an election in 2024, the incumbent party was punished by voters, either losing power altogether or seeing its parliamentary representation fall. Even the United States, with its comparatively healthy economy, still joined the anti-incumbent wave when the Democrats lost the November election. What hope is there for democratic countries with economies that are struggling?This anti-incumbent wave reveals the common underlying problem that will probably continue making it difficult for governments to ensure their longevity, no matter how strong their initial electoral mandates: Voters want more than governments can deliver.

Now the final article was quite interesting, covering vineyards permits to piledrive on the ocean floor and the extent to which the NOAA anticipates harm to come to the local fauna, specifically the endemic marine cetaceans. Their findings and decision making were disturbing, if you care for the lives of the animals on this planet, but it wasnt the windmills that cause the harm, but the human activity of using heavy machinery in deep water and how it could temporarily, if not permanently harm the whales hearing. This is a substantial issue that could be mitigated by using more expensive equipment that kept the power generation of the pile drivers out of the water, but as we in the United States wouldnt dare use a more expensive manufacturing equipment if it could hurt the companys bottom line; we treat the potential to harm these creatures like an acceptable risk.

And people should have every right to believe what they like, so long at they do not force others to believe the same against their will. For those that can look at the most magical landscape, bursting with life, and say that this is the work of a Creator, then let them believe this if that is their choice.

Dividing by zero can be used to prove lots of untrue things, such as 1 = 2. Using infinity in math breaks the math, so it's not proving anything. The best we can do is project a limit approaching infinity.Right but we have directly observed event horizons, which are the result of projecting a limit to infinity. Like we took a picture of something that only makes sense if your projecting a limit all the way to infinity. I suppose I will use the same answer to your last question. There's a proof for 1 = 2 which is debunked because it uses an illegal math procedure (dividing by zero). If we debunk 1 = 2 for that reason, why do we base the origin of the universe on it?I mean it would be hard to say why without seeing the specific proof your talking about. We see a finite amount of matter behaving in a certain way (expanding).But it's not the matter we see expanding, it's the space itself. Like as far as we can tell atoms aren't getting bigger, it's just the distances between them that's getting bigger.Also I think I thought of a better way of explaining why expansion doesn't require a finite amount of stuff:Let's say you have a steel bar that's 1 meter long. If you heat it from 0C to 83.3C you would observe that it's now 1.001 meters long. Now take a 1 kilometer long steel bar and make two marks on it that are 1 meter at an arbitrary point somewhere along the bar. Now if you were to heat this 1 kilometer long bar from 0C to 83.3C those too marks would now be 1.001 meters apart. And it wouldn't matter if the bar was 100,000,000 kilometers long, as long as your heating the bar from 0C to 83.3C that 1 meter long stretch is going to become a 1.001 meter long stretch.So now what would happen if that bar was infinitely long and we heated it from 0C to 83.3C?

Let me clarify a few points:When someone claims, \\"God exists,\\" they are making a positive and thus have the burden of proof. If someone responds with, \\"I don't believe that,\\" they are not making a counterclaim but simply withholding belief due to lack of evidence. This is not the same as asserting, \\"God does not exist,\\" which COULD indeed be a positive claim requiring justification if it weren't for the fact this claim wouldn't exist without the claim \\"God exists.\\"The distinction you make between rejecting a claim and offering an alternative explanation is valid, but its important to note that rejecting a claim does not automatically shift the burden of proof to the skeptic unless the skeptic asserts a counterclaim. For example, if someone says, \\"These scorch marks prove a dragon exists,\\" and the skeptic responds, \\"I dont think so; these scorch marks could be from a flamethrower,\\" the skeptic is offering an alternative hypothesisnot necessarily a counterclaim. The original claimant still has the burden to demonstrate why their dragon hypothesis is superior.The same applies to God: Atheists who simply say, \\"I lack belief in God,\\" are not making a counterclaim but are expressing a position of epistemic neutrality. If, however, they say, \\"Heres why your evidence for God is flawed, and heres why naturalistic explanations are more plausible,\\" they are engaging in a critical analysis, which still doesnt automatically make it a positive claim about God's non-existenceits often an evaluation of the theist's argument.Your point about conversations where \\"I am right because I said so\\" is spot onsuch exchanges are fruitless. Constructive dialogue requires both parties to engage with reasoning and evidence, rather than simply asserting positions. However, skeptics are not obligated to replace theistic claims with alternative explanations to reject them. The rejection of insufficient evidence doesnt necessitate counter-claimsit is simply a refusal to accept unsupported assertions.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"AOC is a shallow, opportunistic climber.

While its true that the existence of God cannot be definitively proven or disproven in the same way we might prove a mathematical theorem or a scientific law, these discussions touch on profound questions about existence, purpose, and meaning that shape human culture, morality, and personal identity. Engaging in these debates isnt about winning but about exploring perspectives, refining ideas, and challenging assumptionsyours and others'.By the principle of Occam's Razor, one could argue that nature exists as it is requires fewer assumptions than nature exists, and also God exists. However, this doesnt inherently disprove theistic claims; it simply highlights that theism introduces additional complexity. Theists might counter that this complexity offers explanatory power for phenomena like the existence of moral laws, the universe's fine-tuning, or consciousness, which they view as insufficiently explained by naturalism alone.The idea that belief stems solely from irrationality or personal experience also oversimplifies the matter. Many theists base their beliefs on philosophical reasoning (e.g., cosmological, teleological, or moral arguments) or interpret religious doctrines as frameworks for understanding life, even if these arguments dont meet the standards of empirical proof. Furthermore, people find value in religion not just for its claims about reality but for its ability to foster community, provide comfort, and give life meaning.Engaging in theological debates is valuable because it encourages intellectual exploration, self-reflection, and understanding of others.

While its fair to expect theists to support their claims, personal growth and understanding do require more than just waiting for evidencewe have to actively engage with these questions ourselves.That said, not believing in God (due to lack of evidence) doesnt mean avoiding introspection or neglecting questions of purpose, morality, or meaning. These are human concerns we can explore through philosophy, science, and personal reflection, regardless of theistic claims. Youre right that rejecting a theistic framework doesnt automatically result in a coherent life philosophy, and its up to each of us to find or create that coherence.However, Id argue that non-belief doesnt necessarily reflect intellectual passivity. It can represent a reasoned position based on critical evaluation of theistic arguments. From there, the journey toward understanding our place in the universe continuesthrough curiosity, reflection, and exploration of the human experience, as you mentioned. In short, burden of proof is a tool for debate, but living a meaningful life involves much more, and I think we can agree on that.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"\\"What do you mean boris isnt still pm?\\"","title":"November r/Neoliberal 2024 Demographics Survey Results (Part One)"},{"text":"\\"Moderate\\" means conservatives pretending to be democrats.

I personally understand that it can be pretty challenging to always be generous, indefinitely. I'm no where as qualified to claim to be an authority,  but I'll stand on the toes of giants.You're asking for evidence.   Palezebra provided a whole lot, I'm not sure if you missed it but Palezebra really did.  I'm going to guess at what I think your quibble is.If  BBT includes that the BB is a singularity in the sense that fundamental to the theory, we can't observe \\"before\\" the BB, and the closer you get to the BB, the more confusing it gets, how can it be a good theory?  (Just to be clear, my understanding is that @ the BB, that's when our universe \\"started\\".  There is no observable before.  Handwave, science this relativity that, the BB is the origin of spacetime.  No observable space before, no observable time before.)Why is there evidence of this being a good theory?  Relativity has been tested!  It's the best model we've got for macro stuff. How has it been tested?  They put a very fancy clock on the ISS and after years of zing zing zing around the earth,  it's got a different time than the twin clock on earth.   (Checkmark relativity).  When there's a lunar eclipse, with fancy pants telescopes, when you're looking at stars (visible cuz eclipse) the light bends a little around the sun!  Away from sun, star 1 and star 2 are 15 pixels from each other, but when star 1 is almost behind the sun, it's got a slightly different distance from star 2.Pale zebra mentioned GPS.  Which is a real thing that works.  And for GPS calls to work, you need *really* accurate clocks.  The GPS satellites are basically spamming pings, and the GPS calculation checks the ping deltas from a few different satellites and figures out your location.   But these calcs are very very fussy.  If relativity calcs weren't done,  GPS would be off,  because the satellites are moving really fast, (different time) and the ping waves are getting bent by the earth,  light is bent by gravity.  (Dear physics pros, don't @ me, I'm KISSing, light is bent by gravity!)Pale zebra mentioned other ones too. Anyways,  relativity is the best explanation for stuff that happens IRL. And given the universe is expanding,  (red shoft), relativity plus \\"universe was very small\\", you get the relativity spacetime stuff going on at the BBI dunno if I'm just repeating things,  but GPS working *is* evidence of BBT.What you want to take away from the \\"but, how, spacetime didn't exist before BB\\" head scratcher, that's for you.   Also consider there's plenty of people who would be happy to debunk BBT, some grifters, some agents with an anti science agenda, and some real physics types.   But imo it's pretty easy to tell the real physics questions (dark matter, quantum stuff) from the \\"b-b-b-b-but\\" stuff, which is just trying to FUD, often for an agenda. BBT *is* science.   In the \\"this is what the really really smart people think\\".  It's the best bet,  even with the existent concerns.  If you can convincingly dispute BBT, with rigour, with specifics, and it's compelling, congrats, you get a Nobel prize!

Despite this second reality, I still would've voted for a more liberal candidate if it were Bernie in 2016 or literally anyone else than Harris in 2024. I've voted for Trump three times because the alternative party has failed three times to field any remarkable candidates on par with a Sanders or Obama. I know that there was a case to be made for Biden because the POTUS can only do so much and appointments are just as critical as the person making executive decisions, but that argument also can work in favor of Trump, so the whole thing is gray morally in my opinion. We can talk about all the deranged ways people support Trump, but part of the equation is to ask the question: Who else is there to represent your interests if you are fiscally conservative? You're really damned if you do and damned if you don't when it comes to who you vote for.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Alabamas prisoner leasing is a demo of what theyll do to Hispanics.legal or not, theyll be sent to prison and rented to corporations as full-on slaves under the 13th amendment.

Someone immigrating illegally to the US from somewhere like Venezuela or El Salvador must be pretty desperate and have it so bad that they'd be willing to risk dying in cow shit.And that desperation is exactly why dairy farms employ them and why no amount of border bills will do a damn thing unless the dairy farms are fined or shut down for hiring illegal immigrants. And they won't be. Because no administration is going to be remembered as the one where a gallon of milk cost $25. This was the same thing during W's administration.

The left has ceded the symbols of patriotism to the right. Any normal person donning something with an American flag is immediately right coded. It's fairly common to hear those on the left say \\"I hate this country\\" When making some critism of it. And some I'm sure do literally hate the country, while most are expressing a strongly felt frustration but would like to see it become a better place. And it's kinda unfashionable to talk about the good things about the country in left circles (part of why Democratic politicians have a difficult time touting their wins, some activist group or even normal voters immediately retort with how someone else needs more help.)I have a half baked theory that most people today vote against the voters on the other side, not a politician or for someone. Their vote is motivated by a rejection of the cultural values of the other side. The unfortunate conclusion (and what makes me skeptical of the theory) of that is the Democrats have a big hole to climb out of that starts with their own voters.

So the numbers of people crossing would obviously drop.

Allegedly the CEO was working with feds to expose criminal practices.  Whos to say.  All I can say is that from experience working in pharmacy and insurance, he went for the middle man.  Insurance rates are set by government and cant be too high or too low.  If too low then in catastrophic events companies can go insolvent screwing thousands of people.  Government wont let premiums be too high either.  Most insurance is only ~3% profit margin, united isnt much better.   And thats only because they invest the premiums in order to make money before it pays into claims.   On the other note, there is no such regulation to my knowledge on price gauging from hospital administrations and big pharma.  My pharmacy experience also has taught me that many doctors dont think of the cost, nor care and often prescribe brand when generics are acceptable.  Many people claim they can only do brand and this is really the case with less then 5% of the population.  Seeing as brand costs usually 500%+ more than generic (honestly the difference varies with each med, some higher some lower)  so most health insurance denies until there is a prior authorization that says yes brand is mandatory and generic wont suffice.  This sends to the doctors for approval.  This issue itself with denials stems back to doctors abusing the insurance companies who really have bare minimum autonomy in prices and the only way they can have their 3% profit margins is by controlled denial of typically absurd prices( set far too high by big pharma) and investments.   In my insurance industry which is property and casualty, we lose money on every line of business when looking at just claims to premium paid.  The only thing keeping insurance floating is investing large sums of money until it needs moved into loss reserves.  Tldr; like the idea but hospitals and big pharma are real villains, insurance is really just shooting the messenger.","title":"Flag of a country that has killed thousands of their own civilians in false flag attacks in order to carry out offensive wars, that has created and funded terrorist and criminal organizations with the mere purpose of destabilizing countries and where where the ruling elite can commit crimes freely"},{"text":"The problem with that as a tactic is that Democrats can just call their bluff.

Now, the number who care about it as a secondary issue is definitely much higher, but the truth is that what happens in Ukraine or Gaza doesn't really affect most Americans much. That's not to say that people don't care at all, people can and do care deeply about things that don't affect them personally, it's called empathy. And there is some effect on global supply chains from the war in Ukraine specifically, as Ukraine is a major grain exporter and Russia a major petroleum exporter, but let's be honest, most people don't know that. But the average voter cares more about the well-being of themselves, their family, and their community than they do about people living on the other side of the world. This is also why messaging about social issues, democratic backsliding, etc often falls flat, someone struggling to feed their family and pay rent might have strong opinions about those things but many of them will vote for someone who doesn't share those opinions if they think that politician will bring down the cost of living or make it easier to find a high-paying job.

They come here because there are jobs here that will hire them and look the other way. Period. There are plenty of companies and industries that will give them jobs, underpay them, put them in unsafe conditions, and will continue to do it because they know an illegal immigrant won't complain to the Department of Labor lest they be deported. Over twenty years ago, immigrants were coming here illegally under W, so this issue was all over the news. I worked for a chain restaurant and the kitchen manager literally said he hired Mexicans because they were good workers. He didn't bother to check if they were here legally. He just knew they'd do the work and not complain. They come here because they will find work. Trust and believe, even if a 5,000 foot border wall went up and 10,000 guards were there day and night, the industries that depend on them will find a way to get them here. They'll pay off guards and hire American citizens to transport them if they aren't already.

And the problem isnt just Kamala Harris or Joe Biden.In a trio of focus groups, even voters who previously backed Democrats cast the party as weak and overly focused on diversity and elites, according to research by the progressive group Navigator Research.**When asked to compare the Democratic Party to an animal, one participant compared the party to an ostrich because theyve got their heads in the sand and are absolutely committed to their own ideas, even when theyre failing.*Another likened them to koalas, who are complacent and lazy about getting policy wins that we really need. Democrats, another said, are not a friend of the working class anymore.**The focus group research, shared first with POLITICO, represents the latest troubling pulse check for a party still sorting through the wreckage of its November losses and looking for a path to rebuild. Without a clear party leader and with losses across nearly every demographic in November, Democrats are walking into a second Trump presidency without a unified strategy to improve their electoral prospects. And while some Democrats blame Biden, others blame inflation and still others blame losing hold of culture, the feedback from the focus groups found Democrats problems are even more widespread and potentially long-lasting than a single election cycle.**The focus groups offer a pretty scathing rebuke of the Democratic Party brand, said Rachael Russell, director of polling and analytics at Navigator Research, a project within the Hub Project, which is a Democratic nonprofit group.*This weakness they see, [Democrats] not getting things done, not being able to actually fight for people  is something that needs to be figured out, Russell said. It might not be the message, it might be the policy. It might be something a little bit deeper that has to be addressed by the party.**The focus groups  held immediately after the 2024 election and conducted by GBAO, a Democratic polling firm  featured three kinds of voters: young men in battleground states who voted for Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024; voters in battleground states who voted for Biden in 2020 but didnt vote at all in 2024; and voters in blue states who had previously voted for Democrats, a third party candidate or didnt vote in 2020 but voted for Trump in 2024.**I think what the Democratic elites and their politicians believe is often very different from what the average Democratic voter is, said a Georgia man who voted for Biden in 2020 but Trump in 2024.*The elites that run the Democratic Party  I think theyre way too obsessed with appealing to these very far-left social progressivism thats very popular on college campuses.**These voters voiced cautious optimism about Trumps second term, both in the focus groups and a post-election poll that found Trumps highest approval rating since 2020 in a GBAO survey. The national poll, which surveyed 1,000 people, found 47 percent viewed Trump favorably, while 50 percent disapproved of him  the highest marks hes received since he left office.Russell argued that Trumps high marks reflect a honeymoon period, which she predicted will fade once he takes office: Once things start happening, its going to take a turn, and so its going to rely really heavily on the actions in the first 100 days to see how we go from here.She also noted that the polling suggests openings for Democrats on issues like abortion, health care and taxing the rich, as well as a fear that Trump may go too far on tariffs. Their survey also showed that two-thirds of voters said inflation should be the incoming presidents top issue, but only a third of voters believed it was Trumps or Republicans top issue.When the focus group participants were asked about inflation and tariffs, many of them said they didnt fully understand the policy, while others acknowledged they expected prices to go up.Obviously I wouldnt want stuff to go up, but at the same time, in the long run, would it be better off for America and maybe having more stuff made here? said one man from Wisconsin**Even though the focus group voters did not solely blame Harris for their distaste of the Democratic Party, they also werent happy about her candidacy. Participants described her as inauthentic, very dishonest and did not seem competent.*An Arizona man, citing the time Harris said, you better thank a union member, during a speech in Detroit, said that was very disingenuous to me because I didnt see an honest person that could be president.*It seemed like a lot of what she came out and said wasnt really off-the-cuff, wasnt coming from her, said another man who voted for Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024. Seemed like every interview, every time she came out and talked about something, it was planned out and never her thoughts, didnt seem genuine to her thoughts, whereas, Trump, even though you never really knew what he was going to say, when he was going to say it, it was always him and genuine to what he thought, so thats what swayed me.**The feedback on Harris comes as the vice president mulls her own future, weighing a third presidential run against a bid for California governor in 2026. Some party loyalists have said theyd back another presidential run, arguing that Bidens late exit from the race burdened the vice presidents three-month sprint. But others are not ready to get on board for it.Several participants also raised the transgender attack ad that the Trump campaign deployed against Harris, which showed a 2019 clip of her expressing support for gender affirming surgery for state prison inmates. The ads tagline included: Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.**Democrats disagree on the potency of the attack ad, but several participants raised it unprompted in the focus groups.*Lagging turnout was a major problem for Democrats in November. One woman from Georgia who didnt vote in 2024 said that she didnt agree with Harris thinking that its okay for children to change their body parts.**I think that there needs to be some parameters on whats accepted in society and what isnt. Some of the societal norms, and I think that the Democrats have tried to open that up a little too much, said a woman from Wisconsin who also didnt vote in 2024.When asked by the moderator if she was referring to the trans issue, the woman said, primarily that.","title":"New research shows the massive hole Dems are in - Even voters who previously backed Democrats cast the party as weak and overly focused on diversity and elites."},{"text":"Why is Iran seeking to improve relations with US?[Iranian President Pezeshkian Checks the Boxes in New York ?

Where did the money go?"},{"text":"G?del's ontological proof ultimately fails as evidence for several reasons. First, it relies on assumptions about the nature of God, such as the idea that God is \\"a being that possesses all positive properties.\\" These assumptions are highly debatable and not universally accepted. For example, how do we define \\"positive properties,\\" and who decides if God possesses them all? If the assumptions are questionable, the entire proof rests on unstable ground. Additionally, the proof uses modal logic, which deals with necessity and possibility. G?del's argument defines \\"necessary existence\\" as a property God possesses, claiming that a necessary being must exist in all possible worlds. However, this notion of necessary existence is abstract and not grounded in empirical evidence. Just because something is logically possible in a hypothetical system doesn't mean it exists in reality. Furthermore, the proof is criticized for circular reasoning: it assumes the concept of a perfect being, and from this assumption, concludes that such a being must exist. This is an example of begging the question, where the conclusion is embedded in the premise. Most importantly, the proof provides no empirical evidence, which is crucial for establishing the existence of anything in the real world. Empirical evidence is based on observation, measurement, and experience, while G?del's proof is purely abstract and theoretical, offering no concrete evidence for the existence of God. Lastly, ontological arguments like G?del's can be adapted to \\"prove\\" the existence of any perfect being, not necessarily the Christian God. The logic can be applied to any concept of a \\"perfect\\" entity, showing that the argument's structure doesnt point exclusively to the existence of God but could be used to argue for the existence of any idealized being. In conclusion, while G?dels ontological proof is an interesting exercise in logic and philosophy, it does not serve as valid evidence for the existence of God, as it relies on questionable assumptions, abstract reasoning, and provides no empirical support.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"18.2% support for eliminating corporate taxes  \\n61.5% support for open borders  \\nonly 78% support for LVTsucc invasion has gone too far","title":"November r/Neoliberal 2024 Demographics Survey Results (Part One)"},{"text":"Uh yeah","title":"DNC fundraiser says Democrats have 'stench of loser' hanging over party following defeat to Trump"},{"text":"There is no law of conservation of mass, I assume you mean conservation of energy.

As I said, there could have been an entire universe before the Big Bang, we dont know. All that the BBT postulates is that all of the matter that makes up our universe was created from the energy released in the Big Bang.Where the energy for the BBT theory came from is a bloody good question, and we dont know.

They were indoctrinated with the idea that academia, the arts, and political involvement were uncool. The only thing that has value is that which generates capital. They were told education was pointless and creates more problems than it solves. They were told healthcare was a privilege that anyone who works hard enough can afford.So when they are tired working 12 hour shifts and their bad knee is aching and they can't afford to take it day off in the last 16 months, they are angry. Blaming the Republicans is hard, because that would mean admitting they were duped. More importantly, the current administration of the GOP has already considered this.The GOP has created an elusive bogeyman. It is the Devil; if something is bad, they did it. They are also the masters of lying, so you can't trust anything they tell you, even if you agree, even if there is evidence. There is no nuance, you are either with them or against them.Then Trump comes along and tells you he will take you back to the dream you had. It doesn't matter if it exists, because you felt like it did back then. He tells you it isn't your fault. The devil? They are backed by an army of others. All you have to do is give a little power and a bit of humanity and he'll set it right. You don't have to get an education, or get politically involved. You don't need to feel bad that other people seem smarter than you, because you've got folksy wisdom and street smarts and academia is a lie, anyway, they just think they are better than you. All you need to do is sit on your couch, watch your TV, and await further instructions.Then it is just a game of degrees. Sure, you think every human has rights, but you can't let radicals take away the dream. Oh, you have no problem with the LGBTQ folks, but you gotta watch out that they don't use their freedoms to spread the devil's message. Maybe we need to sacrifice a few groups freedoms just until things are set right. Well maybe you can't be loyal to this country if you weren't born here. Maybe social cohesion is more important than bodily autonomy. Ok, we need workers and LGBTQ folks and abortions limit that, so maybe we should curb that a bit. It doesn't take long when everyone is focused on the fantastical utopian dream.And really, the ones running this scam who aren't ideologues just line their pockets and centralize power so they are more entrenched.So, yeah, another possibility is that he coddled the disenfranchised, frustrated, poor, antisocial masses grown by his own party by offering them an imaginary paradise in exchange for just a little bit of inhumanity.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"I'm just demonstrating that that's not the case, expansion doesn't  mathematically require boundaries, just distances.

Infinity = 2x infinity so it's not expanding it's just remaining infinite.However decades later people finally discovered these objects, and believe it or not they actually did see infinite time dilation around them. They're called black holes. So not only does math work with infinity, there are real physical objects that we know about that are the results of an equation going to infinity. We can't observe infinity though. They estimate black holes being infinite dilations, but it is absolutely not observed. (Also for what it's worth you're advocating for a universe with infinity time based off it's post so at least that part of the universe would have to be infinite)Well my personal belief is that the universe is infinitely large and small, but I do not claim it's anything but logic based.

Our current understanding of spacetime tells us that as the density of matter increases it exerts influence on spacetime to cause effects like gravity as well as influence how time passes. Greater density warps spacetime such that time slows down, or there is \\"less time\\".For the singularity the density of the universe is thought to have been infinite. Our calculations of how time would be influenced as we look back towards this point of infinite density basically form an asymptote.I assume you are familiar with asymptotes from geometry, where a curve tends towards infinity and the asymptote is the line where the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as the curve approaches infinity. It can't actually *reach* infinity of course so it can't actually reach the asymptote, but that is where it is heading.Now think about that for time looking earlier and earlier into the universe. It gets more dense and there is less time. More dense, even less time. Even more dense, etc. The curve of time tends towards an asymptote on zero.I think it is reasonable for some people to interpret that as the start of time, and others to say that perhaps it was something else transitioning into being time.

Math doesn't work with infinity.When Einstein first presented his theory of relativity, people thought that there was a huge flaw in it because if you had an extremely dense object the value for time dilation would shoot up to infinity. However decades later people finally discovered these objects, and believe it or not they actually did see infinite time dilation around them. They're called black holes. So not only does math work with infinity, there are real physical objects that we know about that are the results of an equation going to infinity.

What they really want is a return to the 1950s when women and people of color knew their damned places and gay people were invisible.Trump is the current chapter in a story that begins (arbitrarily, yes) in the 1960s and 70s. Great social progress was made then. Black people could go anywhere white people went, including your kids schools. Women could get their own credit cards, have jobs, and control their own fertility with the pill. A lot of people were upset about this. They felt the government had betrayed them and their preferred social order.That is when American conservatives turned against government and every policy that might benefit average Americans, because now it included *them*. I refer you to Heather McGhee's book The Sum Of Us and the story about how integrating public pools led to them being drained and permanently filled in.It was around this same time that the NRA went from a gun safety outfit to a gun rights lobbying group. It's around this same time that evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion that they had never had before.The modern Republican Party has been one big backlash against the progress made back then. And it still is.Meanwhile, the rest of us become a little more progressive with each passing decade. Next thing you know there's a black family in the white house for eight years. Democrats were certain to put a woman in next. Plus gay people can get married now and you have to treat them like regular people! It was too much.Along comes Trump. His open racism and misogyny indicate for many that finally we have a leader who is willing to stand up to these changes. Finally! Someone who can defend our preferred social order (white supremacy and patriarchy).98% of the vote is baked in and purely tribal.

Overall, the US has weathered the storm better than most countries, but its citizens have also seen inflation rise which has impacted real purchasing power.  \\n   - While this could be dismissed as, the US is doing better than other countries, it doesn't change that the country is suffering and people blame the party in charge.  This is true around the world which is why incumbent parties are getting thrashed worldwide.  \\n   - Canada's Trudeau will be voted out when he holds an election as he's one of the least popular world leaders at this time and his ministers are abandoning him.  Germany's Scholz just suffered a vote of no confidence kicking off a new election.  France's government collapsed after Macron's decline has seen his ruling coalition fall apart.  The UK's Tory collapsed in it's worst election in decades as Labour have finally gotten a majority.  Basically, if you were the party in power, you likely saw your support plummet with the public.  \\n  \\n- Concern for a greater war  \\n   - Ukraine had massive support from most Americans after Russia invaded.  However, over the course of 3 years, the support has slowly waned as Americans feel they are spending billions on a war with Russia that is slowly becoming a losing war.  In addition, there is concern that it will lead to greater conflict with Russia.  While I personally don't feel this, the polling data doesn't lie and Americans are tired of supporting the war.  \\n  \\n- Migration  \\n   - The migration crisis hit an all time high after Venezuelan government cracked down hard on its people.  At this point, given the lack of opportunity there, migrants reached a record pace and illegal immigrants began pouring into the US at higher numbers than before.  This was met with deep criticism by Republicans but was not objected by Democrats.  However, Greg Abbott began bussing migrants to Democratic cities to bring the migrant problem to the cities.  This was a morally dubious thing to do and was pure politics.  However, it worked.  As migrants began being moved from Texas to Democratic cities, support for illegal immigrants began dropping in those cities and it became a key issue in the election.  Democrats pivoted and brought about a bill to address this but it was killed by Trump who bet that people would still blame Democrats given their level of support over the past 3 years.  This proved to be true.  \\n   - It's worth noting that migrant crisis' have also had a major impact in European politics as well and seems to push people rightward.","title":"CMV: There's only 3 actual reasons people voted for, and continue to support, Donald Trump"},{"text":"Yep.

Important in the sense that what happens to us as biological beings may depend on the manifestations of collective ideas yet futile in the possibility of preordained destiny.

Trump is NOT president, he is not ACTING president, and he has no powers as president. Trump has the political powers of ONLY the office he CURRENTLY holds. Which is nothing.

But dont let the left make a fool of you because you vocalize your misunderstandings of how the turnover of power works in the executive branch. a few good things, like international negotiations, have happened since Trump was reelected. Trump had nothing to do with any of that, because he cant negotiate or mediate on behalf of our country. That is because he does not legally represent our country, because he is not our president. He will be, but not until next month. Some things that are good might sometimes happen because of a president, before that president actually takes office. This is things like house prices rising, or rent decreasing, or more businesses opening. These things might happen because people have just so much faith in the incoming president. But dont be confused: these things happen because of the incoming president. That is not the same as saying that the incoming president did these things.

If we want to change that long, almost universally held view, we have to provide an alternative.The thing is, we do have some REALLY good, elegant explanations, backed by loads and loads of evidence, to demonstrate why at least a creationist view of God is not needed to explain what we see.Explaining this to people who do believe in God in a respectful and none-patronising way is more likely to shift views over the long term than just refusing to engage beyond its not my job to prove a negative.Of course, there will always be some people for whom it is too ingrained in their view of how the world works to change now, and evidence to the contrary is just seen as a test of their faith.

You cant say something was created without knowing what was there before You can, though. Our current understanding is that universe as we know it came into existence at the Big Bang.

Evangelical conservative Christianity needs to get out of politics due to its bigoted and controlling nature that it often exhibits, but we must keep in mind that not every religion or church that exerts influence on American politics is as regressive and conservative as groups like the Southern Baptists or the LDS/Mormon Church.For example, many southern African American communities are deeply religious and they use their religious beliefs as their basis for political activism like ending racial discrimination or fighting poverty. Are they more socially conservative than your average secular liberal? Usually by a decent amount, but nowhere near the open vitriol spewed by conservative Christians.There are also more progressive churches like the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), which Tim Walz is a member of, and the United Methodist Church (post-schism anyway now that the homophobes are gone). These churches are in free fall membership wise because mainline Protestant Christianity has been declining for years in favor of unaffiliated stances or evangelical Christianity, but they have historically advocated for social justice and been at the forefront of the social causes of their time. I actually think that if these churches had more influence on politics the country might be in a better place.The main takeaway here is that American Christian traditions are diverse and shouldnt be lumped in with conservative evangelicals.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 22, 2024"},{"text":"It was a close election in a post-inflation climate that saw all sorts of incumbents around the world thrown out of office.

I appreciate you going through and explaining why you think they prove it. I do not agree I moved the goalposts. I asked for equations that provide evidence of the creation of time or space.

Your equations are on topic, though.Now you're not going to like this, but I don't think any of those equations prove a beginning of time. Have you ever seen the cute videos of proving 1 = 2 and so forth? They all do it by manipulating infinity to mess up math. Infinity is a concept and not a number. We can't use it in equations.Correct me if I'm wrong, but they are running calculations that result in projections that approach limits of infinity. They are then extrapolating that if density or heat or whatever is infinite, then all their other equations break and the laws of physics collapse in the singularity. Even if this were true, it still provides no proof that time or space didn't exist. It's literally just \\"we don't know.\\"I don't think this proves anything about the start of space or time.

It is, however, our best guess at explaining what happened.  For a consensus to be something with zero proof is scandalous. The proof for the theory is that the proposed behaviour lines up with the predictions via general relativity. In 1927, Georges Lema?tre proposed the Big Bang Theory as an explanation for the notion of an expanding universe derived via general relativity equations in 1992, all of which was then formalised in 1929 by Hubble. What more do you want from proof? The behaviour proposed in the theory matches precisely what the mathematics says should happen.  Physicists themselves admit they cannot measure or prove what came before the singularity. How then can they have any proof of something being created from it?Because what came before and what came after are two different events. What scientists are looking for is a contradiction. They start by saying lets assume that the Big Bang theory did create everything. They then look at everything that would come next, and see how that lines up with what they have observed, and they look to see if it all aligns. If enough observations align with the assumption, then you start to think that the assumption might be correct. What we have started to do more recently, with the help of the Large Hadron Collider, is recreate the conditions at the Big Bang so that we can start to understand exactly what happened in the first few moments. Why do we need to know what came before to discuss what came after?","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"The second item, lobbying, is constitutionally guaranteed as part of the constitutional right to petition the government for a redress of grievances; why anyone would want to get rid of that is beyond me.For your first and third, funding and gifts respectively, what exactly is your plan?","title":"Elon Musks Threat to Primary Democrats Spurs New Urgency to Ban Super PACs"},{"text":"Weird how every single thing they do or say makes sense if they want to help Putin ^(purely coincidence surely)","title":"Donald Trumps transition team wants to pull the US out of the World Health Organization, which would lead to catastrophic worldwide health emergencies and an increase in pandemics"},{"text":"So all we do is label those candidates as musk puppets and make sure they never get elected, got it.","title":"Elon Musk says he'll fund 'moderate candidates' to challenge Democrats in safer seats"},{"text":"Go to hell you shit fucker","title":"Manchin roasts toxic Democratic Party: This country is not going left"},{"text":"We use those terminals in some of our bigger machines, they are fairly new and would be more detrimental than helpful in wiring charges.","title":"A month before 9/11, this pictures were taken"},{"text":"And drives a foreign car.

Space is infinite. It wasn't created when the matter we can see exploded outward. The matter just exploded into the existing space. We literally cannot observe space without reference objects. It's just emptiness. We cannot prove anything beyond the furthest things we can observe.Instead the prediction is that when you get to a dense and hot enough singularity that space and time start to lose their meaning as we currently understand them.

These changes happen over long periods of time, and they dont always lead to the same results for every species in every environment.For example, the loss of fur and bipedalism in humans wasnt a \\"necessity\\" for survival in the way you're framing it. It was a combination of factors, including climate changes, the need for better tool use, and social dynamics, that led to these traits. The evolutionary pressure on apes isn't the same as it was for early humans, and they're adapting to their environment in different ways. Theres no reason to expect that chimpanzees would evolve to walk upright or make tools simply because humans do. Each species adapts to its own specific needs and challenges. (I am not an evolutionary biologist, rather an environmental engineer so would defer the facts to someone more well versed in the field).Also, the idea that evolution should happen quickly in response to environmental changes is a misunderstanding of how long evolutionary processes take. Changes like losing fur or developing complex tools would require significant genetic shifts that take many generations to manifest. Evolution doesnt happen because a species \\"needs\\" it to survive in the momentits a gradual process that occurs over much longer periods of time.This is ignoring the fact your comment is irrelevant.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Just because Republicans hate Trump does not mean they are not Aholes, they still are and are only there to support the party or racists and bigots while their real platform is tax cuts for the 1%.","title":"Chris Christie Predicts What Will Cause Demise of Musk-Trump Bromance"},{"text":"Probably homeschooled, explains a lot","title":"Elon Musk says he'll fund 'moderate candidates' to challenge Democrats in safer seats"},{"text":"Trans generational trauma\\nHave you ever repeated some stupid idiom your parents say like... \\"kids are starving in Africa\\" to yourself or others? we unconsciously pick up patterns from our parents and adults around us.

Faith, by definition, doesnt require proof or logic, and for many, thats what makes it so meaningful. Its a deeply personal conviction that doesnt rely on empirical evidence, and thats valid for those who hold it.However, from a philosophical standpoint, while faith can exist without evidence, when engaging in debates or discussions about the existence of God, the burden of proof typically falls on the one making the claim. Its not about trying to prove or disprove Gods existence in a way that negates faith, but more about understanding how beliefs are formed and shared in a larger societal context. Thats where discussions often divergefaith is personal, but when someone makes a claim about the external world, others might ask for evidence to support it.It sounds like you're focused on internal conviction, which makes sense to me, and I think this is where the two sides can sometimes clash: one side looks for external validation, while the other finds peace in personal belief without needing to justify it to others.

This means that the state of the universe, after the Big Bang, will not depend on anything that may have happened before, because the deterministic laws that govern the universe will break down in the Big Bang. The universe will evolve from the Big Bang, completely independently of what it was like before. Even the amount of matter in the universe, can be different to what it was before the Big Bang, as the Law of Conservation of Matter, will break down at the Big Bang.How can the density be infinite, by the way?

God of the gaps is a good argument, so is the problem of evil (I actually don't think it's a good argument against a god existing per se, but it's a good argument against religions that claim to have the moral truth). You can say that we cannot say that God exists because there is no real definition of a God in the first place. We have no meaningful way of defining spirits, so even ascribing such a quality in god does nothing.

Because our churches have little to no influence in our politics, our Conservative Party is far from being Trump-like (and even the right-wingers in our western provinces don't like religion in politics to a high degree).Churches in the US have too much influence over Republicans, with their pastors that lecture about abortion, LGBT, etc. having a lot of influence, which pushes the party further to the right over time and forces Republicans to adopt more harder conservative stances due to how these churches have a lot of influence over Republican voters.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 22, 2024"},{"text":"People seem to justify their abuse to avoid facing what it really is.","title":"CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones."},{"text":"How did they notice ?","title":"Retiring Rep.

Atheists don't exactly hold a position that is far stronger. They don't believe because there is not enough evidence for them. This is fine and there's a lack of faith but basically all of us would contradict that stance.There is similarly no evidence of aliens existing but anecdotally a lot of atheists I know believe aliens exist and there are studies showing a high proportion do believe in aliens. How is this any different? They have faith that extraterrestrial beings exist with zero evidence to suggest they do.\\nhttps://physicsworld.com/a/aliens-and-atheists/\\nMore than half (55%) of the atheists in the poll professed a belief in extraterrestrials, compared with 44% of Muslims, 37% of Jews, 36% of Hindus and just 32% of Christians.Ultimately I think this is the issue with hardline atheists that tend to be the most knowledgeable on the topic, they obsess in trapping religious people in some corner that they cannot get out of.

He makes it clear that the *singularity* was the beginning of what we know as space when he says, \\"This spot is known as the singularity, and it[the singularity] marks the beginning of what we now know as space, time, and matter.\\" The Big Bang theory makes no claim as to how that singularity formed, so your actual view is not supported by this article.Honestly, it seems like your entire view is based on a misconception of what the actual Big Bang theory says. Which is weird, as this very misconception is mentioned in the \\"Misconception\\" section of the [Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang&amp;_welcomesurveytoken=ohr4k691p7i1losur2jscqfa34c4pm19&amp;source=welcomesurvey-originalcontext#Misconceptions).","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":" As millions of Americans tuned in over their breakfast and coffee, Californias Democratic governor said he was fed up with Congress inability to pass gun safety laws and was taking matters into his own hands, calling for a new constitutional amendment to restrict firearms. The proposal was more of a swashbuckling play for attention than a plan with any rational chance of success. The last  and only  time the states gathered for a constitutional convention was in 1787, when George Washington had yet to be elected as the United States first president. Still, Californias Democratic lawmakers overwhelmingly approved Newsoms proposal, and formally called for a convention to amend the Constitution to ban the sale of assault weapons, require universal background checks on gun purchases and raise the minimum age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21. But a handful of Democrats did not go along with the plan. A progressive senator from San Francisco was the most vocal critic, arguing that a constitutional convention could wind up empowering a conservative agenda. And now, with the country in flux and a former president known for defying the laws of political gravity and pulverizing long-standing norms soon to be sworn back into office, hes launched a new push to blunt Newsoms flashy maneuver and rescind Californias call to amend the Constitution.","title":"Potential risk of a constitutional convention sets stage for a fight between Newsom and a fellow Democrat"},{"text":"I am asian i get what you are  trying to interpreting .

And Europe after the child is almost 2 or 3 yr old they have their own room but here we live together and maybe share room and after turning 18 we still together rather than moving out even when we have the opportunity.

While others don't take it seriously and then have consequences and then learn .

You are now moving the goalposts again. But here goes:The equations and theorems I listed dont individually prove spacetime was created during the Big Bang in the way a single experiment might confirm a hypothesis. Instead, they collectively form the foundation of our understanding of spacetime and the origins of the universe, as modeled by general relativity and modern cosmology.General relativity, described by Einsteins Field Equations, connects the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. When we apply these equations to a homogeneous, isotropic universe (the basis for the Friedmann-Lema?tre-Robertson-Walker metric), we get the Friedmann Equations, which describe how the scale factor of the universe evolves over time. Tracing this back, the equations predict a point of infinite density and curvaturea singularitywhere spacetime as we know it breaks down. This singularity is the mathematical indication that spacetime itself had a beginning, because the concept of time becomes undefined as we approach this point.The Raychaudhuri Equation plays into this by showing that under certain energy conditions, geodesics (paths in spacetime) converge, leading inevitably to a singularity. The Hawking-Penrose Singularity Theorems formalize this result, demonstrating that if general relativity holds and matter behaves reasonably (e.g., energy conditions are met), spacetime must have originated from a singularity.Now, the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem adds a broader perspective, extending beyond general relativity. It shows that any universe undergoing continuous expansion (like ours) cannot have an infinite pastit must have a finite beginning. This applies even to many speculative cosmological models, reinforcing the idea that spacetime as we experience it likely had an origin.As for the Second Law of Thermodynamics, its more of an indirect piece of evidence. The second law states that entropy (disorder) always increases over time. If time had been infinite in the past, the universe would have reached maximum entropy (a state of thermodynamic equilibrium) long ago. The fact that we observe a low-entropy universe with ordered structures suggests a finite beginning to time.Ill admit the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation is a bit more abstractits a quantum cosmology equation that describes the wavefunction of the universe. In some interpretations, it suggests that spacetime itself emerges from a more fundamental quantum state, aligning with the idea that spacetime didnt pre-exist the Big Bang.So, while none of these individually prove spacetimes origin, they collectively support the conclusion that spacetime began with the Big Bang. Scientific theories do not generally acquire proof. There is no end state, just an ongoing collection of evidence which either supports or disconfirms the theory. BBT is no exception, but it does indeed boast a great deal of supporting evidence. At minimum, this makes it distinct from religious faith, which is the claim you are asking to be refuted. I believe I have thoroughly accomplished that objective at this point. If this all feels unintuitive or difficult to understand to you, fair enough. It *is* unintuitive and difficult to understand. But reality is under no obligation to conform to what you happen to feel makes intuitive sense. Thats why science follows the evidence wherever it leads, which is precisely what BBT has done.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"''I'm *mostly* against hitting children''\\nWhat a guy","title":"CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones."},{"text":"Your analogy to the conspiracy theorists is heavily flawed. First of all, saying \\"9/11 was an inside job\\" is not the default position of rejection, so the conspiracy theorists must also give as much evidence as those claiming it was done by terrorists. After all the evidence has been laid out, both sides must then disprove each other's evidence to prove their point correct.Your analogy is a debate between two contrasting posited claims (9/11 was done by terrorists and 9/11 was an inside job). My argument hinges on a debate between a posited claim (God exists) and a position of rejection (God doesn't exist.) Your analogy would be better if one side was arguing \\"9/11 was done by terrorists\\" and the other contended that \\"9/11 was not done by terrorists.\\" In this circumstance, the position arguing that it was done by terrorists has the burden of proof laid onto them. They must then provide their evidence, and then the one claiming it was not done by terrorists must either counter the evidence or bring up their own evidence in response.When we extrapolate this to the debate of whether God exists or not, the one positing an assertion (God exists) must first bring evidence to the table and then the one aligning with the default of rejection (God doesn't exist) must then counter the evidence or provide counter-evidence.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Beats me.

Simply glossing over the loaded implications of your claims doesnt make them as simple as your wording.

What you are actually saying by laying this out as the atheist position in contrast to the theist, is that nature exists in its current state *purely by naturalistic processes, with no supernatural involvement of a deity whatsoever*, which is a substantially more involved position. Drilling down a bit deeper, that almost certainly means you believe in evolution (specifically, the grand macroevolutionary narrative that all live exists as the product of an unbroken chain of mutation/selection proceeding from a single universal common ancestor). In effect, we observe the existence of a million species, to which the theist responds God made a million species, and to which the atheist responds, life spontaneously generated from non-living material through some materialistic process, then evolved through a tree of life containing some eight billion species, the extant nodes of which are the million species we observe. Which of those statements is more complex and makes more assumptions?  Does Occams Razor not mean you should reject evolution and embrace the theistic explanation?  Or will you reject evolution, here and now, the same way you reject theism?  Of course you wont.

When Asian-Americans make TikToks about getting hit with slippers, they're usually calling out how messed up it was, not endorsing it.Child protective services actually investigate minority families at higher rates than white ones for the same behaviors. Studies show Black children are removed from homes more frequently than white children in similar situations. The data simply doesn't support the idea that society is more tolerant of nonwhite abuse.Your view might be skewed by white people being more comfortable publicly discussing family trauma online. In many minority communities, airing family issues publicly is seen as taboo - but that doesn't mean they're accepting abuse. They're just dealing with it differently, often through community support systems and therapy.","title":"CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones."},{"text":"Let me create a response.1. Youre correct that in informal settings, people arent obligated to substantiate their beliefs. However, when claims are made about objective truths (e.g., \\"God exists\\"), the burden of proof still applies as a principle of rational discourse, even in casual conversation. If someone claims, \\"There is a God,\\" and I respond, \\"I don't believe you,\\" Im not making a counterclaim but rather withholding belief until evidence is provided. This aligns with how burden of proof operates in philosophical discussions.2. Youre right that negatives can sometimes be proven, especially in formal logic or mathematics (e.g., proofs by contradiction). However, in practical contexts, proving a universal negative (\\"X does not exist anywhere\\") is often impossible without exhaustive knowledge of all circumstances. For instance, proving there are no unicorns anywhere in the universe would require omniscience. However, as it pertains to my argument, I did not really talk about proving a negative. I'm saying that a position that challenges the default position of rejection has the burden of proof fall onto them.3. I understand your concern about the \\"lack of belief\\" framing seeming evasive. However, many atheists use this definition to emphasize the difference between rejecting a claim due to insufficient evidence and asserting the opposite. Saying, \\"I do not believe in God,\\" is not the same as asserting, \\"I believe God does not exist.\\" Both positions can exist within atheism, but the lack-of-belief stance avoids making a claim that requires its own justification. In this way, atheism can be seen as an assertion (I think assertion and rejection are semi-flawed terms) however they still are in alignment with the default position of rejection and therefore the burden of proof does not fall onto you or I.4. Sure, I can concede that.I do not think you have a firm grasp on what I am trying to say are are rather thinking whatever I'm saying is the same flawed argument you've seen being used by atheists in the past. My post is stating 4 basic things:1. The default position in logic is rejection.2. In the context of theism vs atheism, atheism is the default position of rejection while theism is a position that challenges this default.3. The burden of proof falls onto to those who challenge the default.4. Theists have so far failed to provide substantial evidence that challenges the default.Please try to remove the condescending tone from future posts.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Well, yeah, killing your kids isn't really a good survival strategy, so it makes sense there would have been laws placing a limit on how hard can you do it.","title":"CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones."},{"text":"Yes because wanting things every other wealthy Western democracy has is \\"radical progressive\\".Hard to see that from the extreme right.","title":"AOC may have shifted to the center, but the Democrats arent ready for change"},{"text":"Both are pushing back.

In Nigeria slapping your kid is laughable because kids are usually whipped and burned with spicy peppers as punishment and thats still not considered abuse. So a country like Nigeria would be more likely to report low child abuse rates, simply because the bar is pretty low and child abuse is so normalized. However its still true that physically agressive parenting/corporal punishment is more widely accepted in non white households, regardless of whether or not its called abuse.?","title":"CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones."},{"text":"Okay, let me rephrase myself: this probably wouldn't even make it to top five of the reasons.Still, wrong.

If you give a \\"gift\\" in response to someone doing work for you then it isn't a gift, but an income.  If it is purely a gift, like a toy for your child, then nothing of value was created (except the smiles and joy).  Smiles and joy are not counted in the GDP.If the gift is not in exchange for services and is truly a gift then there should be no tax.Imagine the extreme case where you and I gift each other $20 back and forth every week.

The theory explains how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. It doesn't talk about how that initial state was created. If the universe is expanding, then whatever is beyond the universe is just space waiting to be filled in.This is a misunderstanding of the Big Bang. There is no \\"space beyond the universe\\", the universe encompasses all space and the matter within it. The universe is thought to be infinite in size, so the expansion is not how we conventionally understand something expanding which implies occupying a previously existing volume.Instead the universe is infinite and the expansion is that infinite expanse getting larger. And does it even make logical sense it wouldn't exist? That there would be some edge of matter and beyond is something less than empty space, incapable of being filled with matter?Again, that is a misunderstanding of the Big Bang and the universe itself. There is no \\"edge of matter\\" or \\"edge of the universe\\". It is generally understood that the universe is infinite in size and matter is distributed in a broadly uniform manner across it. Expansion occurs uniformly across the entire universe with any given point becoming more distant from all other points. It is *not* the expansion of an object of finite size like we have intuitive experience with. Time is a very similar argument. Time (as I believe it) is just a single dimensional measurement stretching forward and backwards to infinity.Ok, the Big Bang theory doesn't really contradict that thought. Instead the prediction is that when you get to a dense and hot enough singularity that space and time start to lose their meaning as we currently understand them. They are not saying that it was \\"created\\" at the singularity but rather that prior to that point they don't think it was acting like time as we know it.Time might have still existed but instead perhaps as a **spatial** dimension. Time might have been a direction you could point that doesn't exist anymore. In that sense it may not make sense to talk about time \\"existing infinitely in the past\\" because that is inherently referring to itself; time might have started at the singularity but not from nothing, just transitioning from something that was not time. So why are scientists teaching this like it's science, but not faith?Well they aren't, because they aren't teaching those things you think is the Big Bang theory.

That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal.

At that point, SCOTUS will determine if the state of Texas has the power to try and convict Harris of insurrection (not if she did or did not engage in insurrection, thats besides the point at this point), and the outcome will probably be similar to this one, the state does not have the power to define what does or doesnt constitute insurrection. Your argument here is essential the first part of the ruling of the Supreme Court: states do not have the authority to determine what constitutes insurrection and therefore can not enforce section 3 of the 14th.  also, part of the issue is that the amendment is meant to self enforceable.

Its questionable whether you fully understand what burden of proof is and how it is used in argumentation. Burden of proof falls on whoever has the most investment in persuading the other. It doesn't belong solely to one or the other.This is fundamentally wrong and shows a lack of understanding about argumentation and reasoning, specifically the way we come to conclusions about our given beliefs/positions (reasoning) and our ability to present the information and proof needed to defend or challenge a position (argument). While it may feel personally fulfilling to persuade another to your way of thinking, it is simply unimportant to the way we structure the our arguments. Its more important to be correct (factual) than to be right (the \\"winner\\"). It is always the one making the positive assertion who needs to provide proof of said assertion.Plus, there's nothing really stopping the atheist from offering evidence that they shouldn't believe in the existence of GodThis is Hitchens's Razor, which states that which may be asserted without evidence, may be dismissed without evidence. Saying that an atheist isn't restricted from providing their evidence for not believing in a God is accurate as they are not impeded from doing so by a Christians refusal to provide evidence. However, that does not shift the burden of proof away from the claimant, the one who says there is a God.

I'm not asserting anything just by being something. An \\"assertion\\" requires opening your mouth and actually speaking.An assertion requires holding a position on a given topic that is being argued. The same argument you use could be made for an atheist, what are they asserting just by being something? Also when arguing a position from a logical/reasoning standpoint, its best to avoid anecdotes. Personal experiences can blur the objective of arriving to a conclusion with evidence to support that conclusion so that it may be able to be applied to the collective people as opposed to just one person.The default position is actually?*unawareness*. You cannot \\"reject\\" something you've never heard about.Without the Christians positive assertion of a God, this would be everyone's default starting and remaining position. It is only with that assertion that the atheists position comes to be; asking for proof or evidence of such a claim. It can't start the other way, with the atheist asking for proof of something that no one else is aware of. Awareness is not a term that I would use here either, as that implies that there is infallible truth behind one side of the argument that the other does not have access to. Additionally, the default position in an argument is the belief or stance that is assumed to be true without evidence or justification (sound familiar?), evidence is then brought by the person making the claim to substantiate said claim. Without evidence, there is no need for observers to take the claim as being made with any seriousness or reasoning.So let me add a wrinkle: Suppose everything the Christian said was actually?*true*. The apocalypse is at hand and the world is in peril, and only by trusting the Savior do you have any hope of survival. Do you?*really*?want to thrust the entire burden of proof on the person trying to convince you? If they struggle to persuade you, you're just gonna shrug and go, \\"Welp, you flubbed your argument, so tough luck, buddy\\"?Is rejection?*truly*?the default position you should be taking here?You truly don't understand how an argument works do you? In your scenario, the burden of proof would be met, so it would be illogical and absurd to suggest that the other side \\"flubbed their argument\\". The only argument made in that scenario against the Christian would be made by a fool or in bad faith. However, what you are doing here is another logical fallacy called begging the question or circular reasoning. You are using the conclusion as evidence for your position, rather than having evidence of your position to support your conclusion. So unless that very situation were to literally happen, you fall short of providing evidence that would satisfy the burden of proof for your position.Burden of proof is not so simple.It is, you just have a fundamentally flawed conception of what it means and how its used.edit: grammar and formatting","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"How are restrictions on political speech \\"liberal\\"?","title":"Musk's Threat to Primary Democrats Sparks Fresh Call for Ban on Super PACs"},{"text":"There is also the chance that she over performs and thus judged a good leader so she gets to stay as leader of the opposition to fight the next elections .

It  is fundamentally impervious to evidence, because any evidence would be empirical. There is literally no physical evidence that could sufficiently prove or disprove God. Instead, it is a question of faith, philosophy, and argumentation. I can provide you with arguments that I believe are extremely compelling. I can give you those arguments now, if you would like.

A better way is to look at two competing propositions and choose the most likely to be true. Who does and does not have a burden of proof is not always clear and muddled the real conversation about what position has the most evidence or is the most logical. It also is based more on how a statement is phrase or what part of a belief is focused on more than what those beliefs are, which is what we actually want to talk about. Let me give you an example: a theist may say \\"I reject atheism because I disagree with the statement that there is not enough evidence to believe in God.\\" An atheist obviously thinks there is not enough evidence to believe in God. This would make it seem that the atheist has the claim and the burden of proof and not the theist who is simply rejecting the atheist's claim. Instead, we look at two competing claims: God exists and it's negation God does not exist. We weigh the evidence behind these claims and believe the one with the higher probability given the evidence.

The proliferation of controversial political advertisements in the past decade isn't a coincidence. It's a direct result of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v.

Courts being able to enforce the Amendment isn't as a big as a deal as the other branches of state government doing so. Also, part of the issue is that the amendment was clearly meant to be self enforcing. Congress never passed any additional legislation to enforce it before, yet they mentioned Davis was unable to become president because of it. And later, Congress acted to grant the power to be elected back to confederates. If the fourteenth really requires an additional act of Congress to apply, then they would have been granting people who were already eligible their eligibility back. That doesn't make sense.

Altman also donated $1 million to Trumps inaugural fund, with Zuckerberg announcing similar plans to strengthen his ties with the president-elect.Im speaking as a Democrat myself, this brings me no joy to say it.

The decision angered some liberal staffers and reporters who were eager to throw the papers official position behind Vice President Kamala Harris.When asked about the reaction of the tech industry as a whole to Trumps victory, Li said that they are excited about his incoming administrationI think the tech world is loving the fact that Donald Trump is going to be the next president, Li said. Hes really embraced crypto. Hes saying that he wants the United States to be the crypto capital of the world.?Li also spoke on the rising unpopularity of key Democratic Party policies, including addressing illegal immigration, saying that voters are fed up with Democrats.?Im speaking as an immigrant, Li said.

We make predictions based on mathematical models and test their implications. The Big Bang theory isn't just some random guess - it's the model that best explains multiple independent lines of evidence.Think about black holes. We can't directly observe them, but we know they exist because of their effects on surrounding matter, gravitational waves, and their match with Einstein's equations. Similarly, we know space itself was created in the Big Bang because of:1. The cosmic microwave background radiation\\n2. The precise ratio of elements in the universe\\n3. Einstein's equations of general relativity, which show space and time are fundamentally linked\\n4. The observed acceleration of galaxy clustersYour argument about infinite pre-existing space doesn't work mathematically. If space existed before the Big Bang, we'd see very different patterns in cosmic radiation and galaxy distribution than what we actually observe. Time is a very similar argument. Time (as I believe it) is just a single dimensional measurement stretching forward and backwards to infinity.This directly contradicts relativity, which has been proven correct countless times. Time isn't absolute - it warps and bends with gravity and velocity. We literally have to account for this in GPS satellites to maintain accuracy.The balloon analogy you mentioned actually disproves your point.

In science, a theory isnt a guess or belief; its a framework built on rigorous evidence and testing. The BBT is one of the most well-supported theories in modern science, grounded in extensive evidencenot faith.To understand the BBT, its crucial to grasp the concept of spacetime. Spacetime isnt just an inert backdrop where events occurits a dynamic fabric shaped by the presence of matter and energy. This concept, derived from Einsteins general relativity, has been confirmed through multiple observations. Gravitational waves, for instance, directly demonstrate spacetimes dynamic nature, rippling as massive objects accelerate. The accuracy of GPS systems relies on accounting for time dilation, where time runs differently depending on the strength of gravitational fields. Observations of gravitational lensing, where light bends around massive objects, further confirm that spacetime curves in response to gravity. Finally, the observed expansion of the universe, revealed by redshifting galaxies, provides clear evidence that spacetime itself is stretching, not that galaxies are simply moving through pre-existing empty space.This understanding of spacetime fundamentally alters how we think about space and time. The BBT doesnt claim the universe expanded into empty space or that space existed before the Big Bang. Instead, space itself is expanding. The concept of beyond the singularity doesnt apply because space exists only within the universe. Similarly, time is not a standalone, infinite line; it is a dimension within spacetime. When scientists say time began with the Big Bang, they mean spacetime itself originated at that moment. Asking what happened before the Big Bang assumes time existed independently, which contradicts the evidence-based models derived from general relativity.The BBT is not faith-based; its supported by extensive evidence. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the faint afterglow of the early universe, discovered in the 1960s, which directly supports the idea of a hot, dense origin. The redshift of galaxies shows how light from distant galaxies stretches as spacetime expands. The observed abundance of light elements like hydrogen, helium, and lithium matches precise predictions based on the physics of the early universe. These lines of evidence align perfectly with the BBT, making it the best explanation for the observable universe.The BBT doesnt claim to answer every metaphysical question, and scientists are transparent about its limits. It doesnt describe what came before the Big Bang or what might exist outside the universe because our models dont extend that far. Thats not a failureits an acknowledgment of where the evidence ends. Calling the BBT faith-based misunderstands what faith and science are. Faith involves belief without evidence; the BBT is built on decades of testing, observation, and refinement. Its not dogmaits a living framework, open to change if new evidence arises. Dismissing it because it doesnt address speculative metaphysical questions ignores the overwhelming evidence supporting it and misunderstands the nature of scientific inquiry. If you want to challenge the BBT, start by addressing the robust evidence for spacetime and the expansion of the universenot by mischaracterizing the science behind it.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"They also deny J13 so","title":"When will these idiot liberals stop this rot?"},{"text":"Say, Idiot in a French accent, with a touch of disdain!","title":"Trump says he might demand Panama hand over canal"},{"text":"No, it's a level of naivety that one can only achieve by never having anything bad happen to you.

Im not an astrophysicist so I cant speak as to why certain aspects of your argument are incorrect, but I do know that based upon the inflation of the universe, there is evidence that there was once a singularity and there is a strong scientific consensus around that. Importantly, if you want to engage in scientific debate, the responsibility is on *you* to provide a more parsimonious hypothesis that fits the data. In science, you dont say X is wrong, you say Y fits the observed evidence better than X and Ive developed a hypothesis to test Y.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"Science is based on evidence.

Also in general, most atheists arent as rigid in their beliefs when not arguing with a dogmatic person (from experience).

The definition seems to be a bit obscure, so I will give it the most charitable interpretation. All observable matter, or all that are part of the current system we are in would make up the universe. The BBT seems to present compelling, science based evidence, that this system we call the universe was created from a singularity billions of years ago. This is not where I take issue.It's not what it says, though. It's simply the earliest point we can trace back to. What happens 'before' (which doesn't exist because spacetime as we know it started with the BB, so there's no logical 'before') is unknown. I take issue with the claim that time and space were created. Let's start with space. Essentially space is just everything, including empty vacuums. If the universe is expanding, then whatever is beyond the universe is just space waiting to be filled in. Space is infinite. When there was a singularity, empty space was still there beyond the singularity. That's my belief anyway.Space isn't really 'everything'. It's an abstract thing to think about, since every single reference point you have exists within space. To think about 'outside space', you always circle back to something that exists within space, like the balloon analogy. In that analogy, there is whatever exists outside the balloon.Space isn't expanding 'into' something, it's simply expanding. The balloon analogy doesn't exactly portray that well.They haven't, and they can't.Respectively 'exactly' and 'not yet'. We don't know yet. The only ones really claiming some sort of 'creation' are the religious folks.Scientists seem to have a general agreement (though not all do) and it gets taught to students like it's science. Where is the evidence? Without evidence, it's just faith or philosophy.You're mixing up 2 things here: the fact that the BB happened, and what you think it means. The BB happened, because that's simply what the evidence leads to. You think it means a point of creation, which is simply not what the BBT currently says.Time is a very similar argument. Time (as I believe it) is just a single dimensional measurement stretching forward and backwards to infinity. If the singularity existed, then it just have existed at a point in time. That's how they can even estimate how?*long ago*?it existed.It's a very simplistic, human way of thinking about time. For us, time just moves forward. Time however is intrinsically linked to space. You can think of time as a 4th dimension. There are plenty of animations explaining what the 3D-world looks like to a 2D creature. It looks like some shape is changing. If you were to move along time, you would also see changes.So why are scientists teaching this like it's science, but not faith? I understand they don't say the BBT is the definitive truth, that there are other theories and it's not fully proven, but they still claim it as the overwhelming consensus among scientists.Have you considered the fact that your interpretation might simply be incorrect? If it really were just faith-based, other scientists would just tear the BBT apart. Science is a very competitive field. There's not some 'conspiracy' where the majority of scientists just happen to be involved in. If the dots don't connect, people will disagree.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"Unless you are sitting on top of a mountain of bread while watching others starve, nobody will be upset about your toast.","title":"Anyone Else Tired of What I Like to Call,  Government Shutdown Theatre?"},{"text":"Not to mention almost certainly used Star Link to spike the election for Trump.?Oh wait!

I believe that a majority of atheists specifically believe No gods exist. And while- as I mentioned- that doesnt necessarily mean theyre out there commonly trying to assert this (outside of niche situations like the Chinese Communist Party trying to largely disincentivize religious beliefs in general and literally genociding one in particular atm), I think most atheists have indeed asserted that a god or gods dont exist at some point in their livesThe majority of atheists *do* make this claim at some point in their lives, I think, and when they do- when theyre trying to convince others of this- the burden of proof does fall on them.

The way I can use to describe the different categories is through logical progressions in the form of questions. So here we go: 1. Does God exist? If: yes/i believe yes: provide your proofs and arguments, causality, etc (I.e. a positive claim) - If don't/cannot provide proof it's just a belief or opinion.If: no/I believe no/i dont think so: 2. What is a phenomenon that replaces God or the evidence that supports the claim there is a God. If: I don't know: end of discussion. If: i know: provide your proofs and arguments (i.e. a negative claim that becomes a positive claim because you offer causal or other forms of relationships that replaces the function of God). Remember, this argument does not happen in a vacuum like your dragon scenario. In the dragon scenario, you are asking people to believe solely on your word. You are not providing evidence. Let's say you said I have a dragon in my garage, here look at these scorch marks, the temperature in the garage, the dragon-sized shit in the corner etc. Then if someone just says yea i don't know, that person is just doubting your evidence but is not making a claim therefore there is no burden of proof on them. However, if someone were to come and say no I don't think there is a dragon in your garage (a claim)  I think the scorch marks is because of a flamethrower accident, the temperature is rising because your heater is busted, and the dragon size shit in the corner is you mixing your own shit and keeping it in a pile to make it look like a dragon did it, then that person is making a counter claim and needs to provide his proofs to disprove your initial claim. Same way if a person says, I believe there is a God just because I do, no conversation. However, they WILL provide proof or some rationale behind that belief otherwise they will usually frame it as a personal belief and not want to talk about it.If then you say, yeah I dunno chief, then that is not a counter claim, it's just expressing disbelief in the initial claim. If this is your stance, your post becomes applicable. However, if you say no you are definitely wrong, here are the reasons why the things you claim as evidence are wrong and what the actual thing happening is, now that IS a counter claim. If this is your stance, your post becomes null where you have to provide some reasons that the belief is false. If at the end of the day the conversation is i am right just because I said so and you are wrong just because, then there's really no actual claims being made instead it's just people denying each other.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"I was glued to every controversy his first term, I'm sitting this one out don't have the emotional energy for it need that energy elsewhere","title":"Trump demands Panama lower maritime fees or return the Panama Canal"},{"text":"Good questions, there's a lot there and I'm not able to focus and answer all of them currently, but a few general things.Government shouldn't require you to have ID to use social media, but if we had a social media site where everyone used their real names and one (like Reddit) where basically everyone was anonymous, I think that would be better. Reddit keeps the flames on the internet and not people going after each other in real life, which is important.Generally libertarians are highly in favor of the 2nd Amendment because we don't trust the government. But you need to be aware of how and when you use that right since it's the LAST option. Health care costs in America are blown up mainly by government policies like licensing laws and malpractice insurance (imagine if the government required you to only eat at gourmet restaurants with 10-year trained chefs?) as well as IIRC the government paying for the medical bills instead of the consumer which distorts the dynamics that keep prices under control. It's not \\"Greedy CEO's\\" and cheering that is foolish.Vigilantism doesn't violate the NAP because you can use force against people who are initiating force on others. But as said, force is the last resort, as opposed to discussion and debate, protesting, voting, boycotting, moving to other areas, and many other ways to counter bad government. But if you are reasonably certain that someone is posing an imminent threat to yourself and others or using force on others, you can use a reasonable amount of force to stop them. Note that using a bomb will kill the person as well as other innocent people so guns and targeted items are proper for self-defense and not explosives.Also, the right is generally considered more of the \\"anti-government\\" party, though they traditionally have favored government intervention overseas, likely so that the government buys weapons from the companies that pay those politicians.A few more things, a baby doesn't ask to be born, the parents action causes that, so it's reasonable to expect the parents to be required to take care of the baby, otherwise their own actions caused someone to come to harm. And you can't plant flags on places and charge rent, you own the product of your own labor (as well as yourself and things given to you by their owner), so you'd have to get some land that no one was laboring on and do work to make it useful, then you could sell the product and charge rent to other people using it. As long as you are laboring on it to maintain it.In regards to intellectual property, it's fair I think to have requirements to share an idea with someone, and you can have requirements with platforms to not platform things that rip off your own product or idea if they want to sell or use your own, that's a fair way to do that.That's a bunch of info, answers, and general points about my point of view as a libertarian and perhaps other's points of view too.","title":"I have some questions."},{"text":"This is a spiritual argument so the rules are different.The burden of proof falls upon whoever cares the most, at an exactly proportional rate to which they care.You can make all the other logics in the world to try to figure out who is the most logically \\"responsible\\" but it'll never actually matter.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"To be fair, in his state of mental decline, he misinterpreted what those murderers meant when they said \\"fuck the kids\\"","title":"Bidens Last Evil Act: President Reportedly Considering Clemency for Child Murderers on Death Row"},{"text":"Maybe President Musk , anti apartheid Musk can find his replacement","title":"Gifts accepted by Clarence Thomas have no comparison in modern American history, Senate Democrats say"},{"text":"If you target the right, you get a right wing Dem party.

Your friend also can't prove that God does exist. Statements about God are statements that fundamentally claim something supernatural, so by definitions observations of nature - i.e. any observation you can possibly make - can easily be dismissed by a believer in any philosophy whatsoever.On the other hand, powerful inductive principles are on your side. For example: Fundamentally, which statement of these is simpler? (Simpler = requires the fewest unsupported assumptions)\\n- Nature exists in its current stateOr:- Nature exists in its current state, and also there is a supernatural being called God who came up with itBoth statements are compatible with all observable (natural) phenomena. The second statement is indisputably more complicated. Thus, Occam's Razor (also called the principle of parsimony) tells you that you should reject it. Since the second part of it - the existence of God - is fundamentally unsupportable with natural observations, there is no condition under which we should arbitrarily choose to believe it, on a rational basis.Thus, we can conclude that the only way believers in God have become believers is through irrationality, or through a powerful inherently personal experience they accept as proof (and that they can never convey to you by the sharing of natural evidence).Or the third way: By acceptance and embrace of irrationality in pursuit of community and connection (or to avoid persecution) - natural desires.

Relying too heavily on the burden of proof to justify non-belief risks intellectual passivity, which leaves important personal questions unexamined. Even if no conclusive theistic argument emerges, we still have the responsibility to construct meaning and values for ourselves.\\nThe question of Gods existence ties directly into how we approach morality, purpose, and meaning. These arent abstract exercises; they shape how we live. If we dismiss the entire inquiry as 'unproven until further notice,' we neglect the opportunity to reflect deeply on the human experience. Agnosticism isnt just about withholding belief, its about acknowledging uncertainty, and uncertainty invites exploration, not avoidance.\\nSure, the theist has the burden to prove their claim, but that doesnt mean our work stops there. We still face the task of defining our own understanding of morality, the universe, and our place in it. Thats not something we can fully outsource to debates or external arguments. Its a process of discovery that requires introspection, engagement with philosophy, and a willingness to grapple with the unknown.\\nAt the end of the day, the absence of a compelling theistic argument doesnt automatically lead to a coherent life philosophy. We have to actively participate in shaping that for ourselves. Whether we conclude that meaning is self-derived, emergent from human connection, or rooted in something ineffable, the journey itself is valuable. Refusing to engage because the other side hasnt proven their point limits personal growth and understanding.\\nBurden of proof is useful in debate, but life isnt just debate: its a lived experience that benefits from curiosity and reflection.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"If there is a closed box and you say there is something inside and I say there isn't, who has to prove it.

If my claim is: Julius Caesar never conquered all of Britain, I think I could prove the claim to a degree accepted by others. We have his writing, which claimed to invade but not conquer Britain. We have the complete lack of other sources who ever said he conquered Britain. Finally, we have the claims of historians that Claudius started the conquest of Britain. But its theoretically possible the Herculaneum scroll project will discover some lost historian who does make the claim. But, as it stands now, thats pretty unlikely and we can be confident Julius Caesar never conquered Britain.ETA: It occurs to me that a claim that its impossible to prove a negative can be asserted without foundation, but because its also a negative, it can avoid having to prove itself.

But problem is that there isn't such country anymore. There isn't a country whose environment circumstances and past memories formed an enduring cohesive and shared vision. Like it's all chaos. Like there isn't a Germany of the people who want a sober government, manufacturing policy with people that want and will want to persistently go through a direction of further and further integration, bearing the rough patches of the transition process towards a better future. They can easily likely be as pro integration as pro conservation of current state as pro leaving as pro dissolution, often from the same people, flip flop flip flop. Probably AfD won't really ever become the main party in Germany. Probably not, but very very possibly yes. The uncertainty is so big you know it's basically worth considering as a certainty in risk assessment. If you tried further integration the chances of in 3 years by random noise the AfD gets to power and stall the process in a shitty middle of the way that makes everyone more miserable and poorer and uncertain and messes international relations in an incomprehensible way is big. Then there's the chance that a minor tidbit of the further integrated changes causes so much so much anger and irritation in\\nLike Italy was chaotic as hell in the 90s, literally close to all of the former political class got arrested or kicked out and literally everything got replaced with new characters. We're talking the same 3-4 parties were mainstream from 1946 to 1990ish, no one had the experience of forming new parties that have to organise the personnel to do 10% of the work of the parliament let alone winning elections and ruling the country. No one experience in creating a new party from the ground up to rule a country a year or two after. Berlusconi was a corrupt populist buffoon, the left had some figures caricatures of the leftie that stands for so little they probably don't even believe in themselves. We're talking people so anonymous who don't believe in themselves and are so pansy ass that the most analogue comparison with US politics is Jeb Bush - who's right wing. The electoral system of Italy was garbage that only created unreliable parliaments and coalitions. People had the lowest ever trust in politics and new hot thing to love or hate was at its potential highest since everything old that lasted close to 50 years fell at the same time.?\\nWell, Berlusconi also wanted to join the EU with all of its military economic monetary border political legal unities. The Jeb bushes of the left wanted that. The law professors in politics wanted that. And the manner and style to proceed changed from Berlusconi to any of these figures but the way they found common ground or just how much was shared more than separated made it possibly for Italy to fully join the European Union. That Italy was more coherent than a well educated civilised Netherlands, or Nordic country. The Dutch or German political climate is changing at significant place and there are so many cracks that could just open and make sharp u-turns for any one small thing that no one of them would dare to start a Super European Union (a more integrated one made of only some core countries) today even the ones that really want it. Not enough political coherence.

Donald did better in 2024 than Barack Obama in 2008. Media outlets told us incessantly how bad or unpopular Donald was, but that is obviously untrue. It may be hard to believe but we have to face it: Donald successfully brought in huge numbers of people who were not engaged in recent years. With this information, we can brainstorm over how to reduce his popularity and the popularity of his party which is literally at its all time record.We can see that Kamala Harris was also extremely popular, doing better than Barack Obama in 2012 and almost as well as Barack in 2008. With this information, we can recognize that the campaign did not fail. It just happened that Donald Trump was even more popular. With this information, we can look at what did not seem effective and brainstorm over improving weak areas rather than lamenting and arguing over how bad Kamala did.We can also see that Democratic generally drops in the next election after a Democrat first wins the White House. Turnout of the population runs parallel to eligible voter turnout, so for such comparisons, results are proportional and valid. Population turnout is easier to calculate than eligible voter turnout and avoids controversy over the numbers.","title":"AOC may have shifted to the center, but the Democrats arent ready for change"},{"text":"Xenophobia, language barriers, strong nationalistic relatively close past, and my personal warm take is the lack of a worldwide view of the American Dream and Americans value that anyone can adopt to become American.

Or if they lack a belief that humans are causing large-scale climate change?  Or that they lack a belief that millions of Jews were killed in the Holocaust?  That non-belief is the default, right?Not the person you're responding to, but I'm pretty sure they'd call them conspiracy theorists. There's evidence for the claims being disputed here. Now, technically, the answer to your question \\"is the default position disbelief?\\" Sure! To avoid confirmation bias, it's important to work from how can i prove this wrong as opposed to the starting point that you're correct or trying to prove yourself right. If we can assume the person expressing disbelief is not a conspiracy theorist but someone who is ignorant of the facts being stated we can provide proof of the events surrounding the claims 9/11 was a terrorist attack, climate change has tangible effects that have been researched, and the holocaust had a devastating impact on the Jewish population based on census records and copies of Nazis documents. Those who disagree with the examples you provided are flying in the face of that evidence. Similarly if someone claims god exists and there's no tangible evidence then I'm okay to dismiss the claim. If you tell me you lack a belief in God, that doesn't mean you don't have beliefs.  It just means you are concealing them, or that you aren't even aware of your own beliefs.  It sounds like you're conflating atheism with something else. If you ask me if I believe in a god and I say \\"no, I'm an atheist,\\" I'm not concealing my beliefs.

In which case, this all knowing deity DOESN'T know how to convince you, because there ISN'T a way to convince you. He might have specifically created you to be incapable of it.Or, alternately, have you considered the possibility that this omnipotent being may not *want* to persuade you in the \\"Exactly Optimal\\" way? Even the Bible itself shows that God is fully capable of it yet chooses not to.Because \\"The Optimal Way To Convince You\\" is literally just for God to show up. He is SO glorious, SO powerful, that even the most hardened of unbelievers would fall on their faces in worship. But God isn't terribly interested in belief earned through such a method. He does use it from time to time, like he did with Paul, but it isn't his usual M.O. He prefers that belief be found by hearing, and hearing by the Word.The optimal way simply isn't his preference.Just because God *can* force belief on you doesn't mean he *should*, or that he *wants* to.

This reasoning frustrated me because, in my view, it's not my job to prove that something doesn't existits the job of the person making the claim to provide evidence for their assertion. Now, I want to clarify: I'm not claiming that \\"God does not exist.\\" I'm simply rejecting the claim that God does exist because, in my experience, there hasn't been any compelling evidence provided. This is a subtle but important distinction, and it shifts the burden of proof.Clarifying question: has your Christian friend studied philosophy, theology etc.?One of the problems in this area of debate is the \\"intrusion\\" of academic terminology (from philosophy of religion) in ordinary language. Traditionally, atheism used to only refer to people who assert the non-existence of God or gods. In this sense, theists would be expected to give evidence for, and atheists would be expected to give evidence against the existence of God or gods. Atheism didn't allow merely saying that you're not convinced of either position. If you look at any formal sources, they typically still use this more restrictive definition. It's only in more recent decades (primarily in non-academic discourse) that atheism has taken on the additional meaning of \\"non-theism\\" (everyone who isn't a theist), which is now *very slowly* also finding its way into academic use.The [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#DefiAthe) has an entry that describes the problem of the term's use. I have found some academic sources that now include the newer definition.Personally I think that the new terminology makes a lot more sense (for practical reasons): atheism just means non-theism. It includes both groups who are not theists: those who merely don't actively believe in gods, *and* those who assert their non-existence. This only creates a burden of proof for the subset of atheists who actually assert non-existence.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Pinged EUROPE ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20EUROPE&amp;message=subscribe%20EUROPE) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20EUROPE&amp;message=unsubscribe%20EUROPE) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=EUROPE&amp;count=5))Pinged ECO ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20ECO&amp;message=subscribe%20ECO) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20ECO&amp;message=unsubscribe%20ECO) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=ECO&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[EU solar installations hit 65.5 GW in 2024, says SolarPower Europe](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/12/18/eu-solar-installations-hit-65-5-gw-in-2024-says-solarpower-europe/) Solar installations grew 4% year on year in the European Union in 2024, down sharply from 53% growth in 2023. The slowdown coincides with a decline in solar investment, marking the first such drop this decade. SolarPower Europe now forecasts annual growth of 3% to 7% in solar installations from 2025 to 2028. Developers deployed 65.5 GW of solar across the European Union in 2024, according to SolarPower Europes EU Market Outlook for Solar Power 2024-2028. The figure reflects 4% annual growth compared to 2023s 62.8 GW of installations, a sharp drop from the 53% growth recorded between 2022 and 2023. The EU solar fleet now totals 338 GW, a fourfold increase from 82 GW a decade ago. SolarPower Europe attributed the slowdown to factors beyond declining solar component prices and lower upfront costs for installations. Ground-mounted utility-scale solar projects saw an average cost reduction of 28% in 2024. Despite reduced costs of capital, EU solar investment dropped for the first time this decade, falling from 63 billion ($66.2 billion) in 2023 to 55 billion in 2024. Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, called the report a warning for European policymakers and system operators. Slowing solar deployment means slowing the continents goals on energy security, competitiveness, and climate, Hemetsberger said. Europe needs to install around 70 GW annually to meet its 2030 targets. Corrective action is needed now, before its too late. SolarPower Europes forecast for 2025 to 2028 suggests growth will stabilize between 3% and 7% in the coming years. The market is expected to add 70 GW in 2025, reflecting a 7% growth rate fueled by utility-scale projects initiated during the past two years, which benefited from record-low module prices. Growth rates are projected to drop to 3% in 2026, with 72.3 GW of new solar capacity, as developers respond to grid constraints and market uncertainties. SolarPower Europes medium scenario forecasts a 6% improvement to 76.5 GW in 2027 and a 7% increase to 81.5 GW in 2028. This slower growth reflects severe structural challenges, in particular in those Member States where adaptations of policy frameworks and infrastructure have been lagging behind the solar sectors rapid evolution into a notable pillar of power supply, the report said. It also remains to be seen what the changing political landscape to the right means for solar in the EU. Sluggish electrification rates continue to suppress demand in the solar market, with the continents electrification rate stuck at 23% over the past five years, leaving much of the energy system reliant on fossil fuels. SolarPower Europe noted that the Electrification Alliance is pushing for a 35% electrification rate by 2030. The report also highlights a lack of energy system flexibility, which has led to solar curtailment and negative pricing, undermining European energy security and competitiveness as additional factors contributing to the slowdown. Residential solar installations fell sharply in 2024, with 5 GW of new home solar added compared to 12.8 GW last year. SolarPower Europe attributed this decline to the fading impact of the energy crisis and forecasts this trend will persist in the coming years. Larger solar installations are likely to grow faster than rooftop projects in the EU during the latter half of the decade, according to the report. However, rooftop installations, starting from a larger base, are expected to retain a greater share of the EUs total solar capacity through the decade compared to utility-scale projects. At the national level, SolarPower Europe found five of the top ten EU solar markets CSpain, Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, and Hungary C installed less solar in 2024 than in 2023. Meanwhile, Germany, Italy, France, Greece, and Poland saw modest gains, with most adding about 1 GW more than last year. Between 2025 and 2028, Germany, Spain, and Italy are projected to lead the EUs solar market growth.!ping ECO&amp;EUROPE","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Do you have any screenshots or anything?

The problem you have is there is no reason why your statement and null hypothesis is the only valid one.

Positive and negative claims can equally be switched in many cases through rewording. \\"No one in that room is female\\" is a negative claim, surely that can't be proven? \\"Everyone in that room is male\\" is a positive claim, is that suddenly easier? The absence of god can absolutely be argued through reasoning, and may even be convincing to a very small subset of people willing to enter into the discussion. Realistically though, anyone who debates about the existence of god will usually be very unwilling to change their viewpoint, regardless of any positive vs negative claims.

Even if *multiple* people told the atheist they talked with God and he talked with them back, he'd *still* brush them all off as loony kooks.Getting multiple eyewitnesses to confirm something is pretty much the bog-standard definition of meeting one's burden of proof.The issue is not that these religions haven't satisfied their burden of proof.

For many believers, their entire faith is transactional - they believe because they get something in return; sense of purpose, security of afterlife, membership in a community etc. this core of transactionality becomes clear when you speak with a Christian and they believe things like Pascal's wager is somehow a convincing argument.Many people of faith are distrustful of atheists as they assume the reasons for being an atheist are also transactional, and because the transaction at play isn't clear to them, they distrust atheists motives.The idea of burden of proof is completely alien to them as entertaining any kind of disbelief puts their transaction at risk.The best way to discuss this is to point out the transactional nature of their faith - they did not come to faith because they weighed up all the religions and found this one the most convincing but rather believe it because of the benefits of the faith transaction.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"You're acting as though all of that is on the same level as God.
