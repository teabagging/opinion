There have always been a lot of great examples of masculinity, some of them very popular.  But how often do they show up in mens' behavior?  Will men eagerly share the movie as being not only a good movie, but as a personal inspiration?  And will it translate to less obvious sexism?  I don't expect one movie to reverse the place we're in, to be clear, but the popularity of a character doesn't necessarily translate to how people will act.Some media figures get seen as 'good examples', while others get seen as 'role models'.  The good examples are very aspirational; people look at them as how the world should be, but don't actually work to make them happen.  The role models are the one people actually try to emulate.  I really hope Superman ends up being the latter, because we need guys to start using some of those examples to change the way they think and act.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 10, 2025"},{"text":"Be fair, the Supreme Court literally said Trump can have the Democrats assassinated and face no consequences.","title":"Democrats Are Already Rolling Over for Trump.

They dont even know what they are fighting against.\\nBiden-Harris Administration Approves Additional $4.28 Billion in Student Debt Relief for Nearly 55,000 Public Service Workers\\nLatest action brings approved relief to almost $180 billion for 4.9 million borrowersThe Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $4.28 billion in additional student loan relief for 54,900 borrowers across the country who work in public service. This reliefwhich is the result of significant fixes that the Administration has made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Programbrings the total loan forgiveness by the Administration to approximately $180 billion for nearly five million Americans, including $78 billion for 1,062,870 borrowers through PSLF. \\n Four years ago, the Biden-Harris Administration made a pledge to Americas teachers, service members, nurses, first responders, and other public servants that we would fix the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and Im proud to say that we delivered, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. With the approval of another $4.28 billion in loan forgiveness for nearly 55,000 public servants, the Administration has secured nearly $180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers. The U.S. Department of Educations successful transformation of the PSLF Program is a testament to whats possible when you have leaders, like President Biden and Vice President Harris, who are relentlessly and unapologetically focused on making government deliver for everyday working people. \\nThe PSLF Program provides an incentive for Americans to pursue and remain in careers in education, public health, law enforcement, emergency response, and other critical public service fields by forgiving borrowers remaining student loan balance after they have made the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. The relief announced today includes both borrowers who have benefitted from the Administrations limited PSLF waiver, a temporary opportunity that ended in October 2022, as well as from regulatory improvements made to the program during this Administration. \\nIn addition to these fixes to PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration also implemented further improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department via StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single loan servicer, making it easier for borrowers to track their progress toward forgiveness. An Unparalleled Record of Support for Federal Student Loan Borrowers \\nSince day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to helping borrowers who have struggled with the burden of student loan debt. Over the past four years, the Administration has approved nearly $180 billion in student debt relief for 4.9 million borrowers through various actions, taking historic steps to aid hardworking Americans across the country who have worked to repay their student loans but remained in debt. \\nIn total, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved:\\n$56.5 billion for more than 1.4 million borrowers through Income-Driven Repayment, including the Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE plan. This includes administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment that brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding problems due to past inaccuracies and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. \\n$16.2 billion for almost 572,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.\\nIn addition to ensuring that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families, the Administration also secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grantthe largest increase in a decadeand finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts and insufficient earnings.[source. this is debt forgiveness for people who are in shit paying jobs teaching kids, police, firefighters, nurses, doctors working for government ](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/biden-harris-administration-approves-additional-428-billion-student-debt-relief-nearly-55000-public-service-workers-0)\\nOr other public works people, road crew guy at DoT, and so on....","title":"GOP Pushes Bill to Stop Student Loan Forgiveness Ever Happening Again"},{"text":"My Mom suspects something fishy too","title":"Weve Never Been Here Before: The Zero-Accountability Presidency - The only institutions that will try to hold Trump accountable are powerless, while the only ones with the power to punish him will never do it."},{"text":"I think we can all agree that they both screwed the pooch in their own way.","title":"Biden extends legal status of nearly 1 million immigrants covered by program in Trump's crosshairs"},{"text":"How would you compare it with godless?","title":"Can you guys recommend some TV shows (not comedy) that are more for republicans and avoid woke culture?"},{"text":"Plus he is the only one to have dropped the MOAB (mother of all bombs), largest non nuclear yield.?\\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-drops-the-mother-of-all-bombs-on-afghanistan","title":"Trump becomes first U.S. president sentenced as a felon"},{"text":"Oh this can very well happen, seeing where are country is headed","title":"Trump becomes first U.S. president sentenced as a felon"},{"text":"It was probably the same blonde troglodyte terrorist who planted those pipe bombs on Jan 6.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Says Devastating LA Wildfires Likely 'Started By Terrorists'"},{"text":"Used to use a dead rat as an alarm clock.

Despite inveighing against endless wars, Trump massively escalated the countrys existing wars in multiple theaters, leading to skyrocketing casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially upped the amount of airstrikes, leading to a 330% increase in civilian deaths. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis. According to the United Kingdoms Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were 2,243 drone strikes in just the first two years of Trumps presidency, compared with 1,878 in the entire eight years of the Obama administration.Trump also came very close to tweeting the country into a nuclear war with North Korea in late 2017 and early 2018, a completely self-inflicted incident that seems to have been bizarrely memory-holed.In 2018, Trump bowed to Washingtons neoconservative hawks and withdrew from a working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in Iran scaling up both its provocative activities in the region and its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks, should it decide to do so. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year. The list goes on...A \\"330% increase in civilian deaths\\"? Tsk-tsk.

Remember, the EU parliament has a representative system and most member states aswell.

Continuing the war like this benefits russia and the MIC. Not europe, ukraine, or the US.What you have written above is UTTERLY delusional thinking, and I implore you to actually consider the facts, the numbers, and not just what you feel would be good. I don't know why you do this, maybe because of a sense of political belonging or duty to defend the completely indefensible decisions of the Biden adminstration, or just falling for MIC propaganda, or I don't even know. Since you brought up Hitler: Continuing with this \\"yeah they'll give up any minute now\\" one would end up like hitler in The Downfall \\"Yeah Steiner's attack will surely fix everything....\\" when he was in the last besieged city hiding in a bunker.  \\n  \\nYou CAN NOT BASE STRATEGY ON WISHFUL THINKING!Your hitler examples are wrong, because none of those things were *invasions* those were appeasements that were made before hitler did anything militarily. This is an actual invasion. This is a *war*. Wars can end with a negotiated peace. Seven Years war for example. \\"after he takes ukraine\\" \\"everything they wanted from it\\"  \\nNO ONE is suggesting letting him take ukraine. There needs to be peace while there is stuff left to bargain with. It has been estimated that Russia could continue the war with its reserves for about 10 years, or 7 more years without collapsing, which is not something Ukraine could keep up.  \\nSeriously, just THINK! Time favors the side with the bigger reserves, and russia has bigger reserves in *every* **single** aspect. Turning things into an endless slog would not in any way have deescalated things, because it would have favored russia. This isn't rocket science.Your views are not supported by any sort of evidence, so please reconsider them.And lastly **even if all of this wasn't the case,** even in an alternate universe where you have evidence and I don't, it would **STILL be in our best interest to end the war**.  \\nWhy? Because NATO can not under any circumstances get involved.  \\nYes, it would be very sad to see a historical injustice done to ukraine. (It's not like the US and every other country, including ukraine, didn't perpetuate historical injustices all the time though.)  \\nBut even the entire existence of Ukraine is *utterly* worthless compared to the risk of NATO becoming an active participant and thus a world war breaking out.This isn't a calculable risk. It can under **no circumstances** be allowed to come to pass, and we were headed for NATO being involved more and more, and that was a very very bad slope to be on.

I know you WANT it to be true but that does not make it so.1) Food price inflation in russia was about 15% over the whole of 2024. Which was the average food price inflation in europe in 2023. In some places it was 20%. Their current food prices according to numbeo are still way, WAY below the european average.  \\nTheir economy grew by 4% in 2024, even larger than the 3.6% in 2023. The european economy grew only 0.9% in 2024 and 0.4 in 2023.  \\nWhy? Because they are  \\na) selling MASSIVELY to allies like china, where because of the \\"unlimited friendship\\" chinese people see it as both good to support russia and because of the awful quality of chinese food products as a better choice.  \\nb) are selling to third parties like india and the rest of the world without any issues at all.  \\nc) are selling stuff to Europe and the US through tricks with relabeling oil and gas for example.  \\nd) because they can afford to go into debt, because they have basically no debt unlike almost all western countries.  \\nThe oil policy thing worked for a few months, until they figured out workarounds, and in 2024 their oil has been selling at basically the pre sanction price. It sold at over 70$/barrel in the last quarter up from 62$ a year ago, which is way above the 60$ european price cap, meaning it is ineffective. Additionally the 100$ price cap is way above the average price in the past decade, so that limit is meaningless and might as well not be there.2) As for the territory you are literally just outright lying. You can follow the development of the front lines for example on wikipedia. Ukraine was at its greatest territorial extent since the start of the war in November 2022. There were brief reconquests of territories and bridgeheads by the ukrainians, but overall they only managed to slow the steady onward march of the russian forces. The reason for this is very simple: russia has absolutely no issues sacrificing thousands of their soldiers for even miniscule gains. A luxury ukraine can not afford. Ukraine gained a tiny foothold in a non militarily significant part of russia. The election also affected nothing, as in October they gained \\\\~600sqkm and in november they gained \\\\~700sqkm, while only gaining \\\\~400sqkm in december. In 2023 with the big ukrainian counteroffensive russia still gained territory.3) Russia also does not have a hard time getting troops. There were rumors of a new wave of mobilization being needed in 2023, but they managed without. And that's not even CLOSE to a full mobilization. Russia has 1.5 mio active and 2 mio reserve personnel. Ukraine has 0.9 mio and 1.2 mio respectively. The pool to draw from is 69 mio men fit for service in russia, and 22mio men fit for service in Ukraine. Yes, 300000 people fled russia since the invasion began, in a large part to avoid conscription, but that's nothing compared to the 6 MILLION who fled ukraine. 15% of the country up and left.4) Even IF it was true that the russians would eventually tire of the war before ukraine does (Which is impossible since ukrainians have access to free press and russians don't.) What would be left of the Ukrainian infrastructure? Long range attacks continue to be made against critical infrastructure, and that's not even counting the non critical infrastructure like roads, swaths of land turned into minefields, regular factories. And homes. 8 million people are internally displaced and 6 million have fled. That's a third of the country who can't live in their homes and do their jobs. Mariupol was a metropolis and it had been reduced to an uninhabitable smouldering husk like the bombed out cities of germany in ww2.CONT","title":"CMV: There's nothing to look forward to in the near future apart from \\"survive to better times\\""},{"text":"Are you asking if Republicans are being honest about their policies?","title":"House Republican's Draft 5.2 Trillion Spending Cut Plan"},{"text":"Surprised they didn't cut SSI","title":"House Republican's Draft 5.2 Trillion Spending Cut Plan"},{"text":"Do they have net metering?","title":"Even Trump Cant Stop Americas Green Transition, Says Bidens Top Climate Adviser"},{"text":"The meme contains 2 Epstein John Does, #36 and #174 to be specific.

In many if not most places, DV applies to parties that live together. That does not mean that there are more fitting charges; it simply means that domestic violence is not limited to violence between intimate partners. Here's an example, which is also my anecdote:I worked in GA for several years, and my job involved working with youth who had records. I saw one quite often, which was labeled as \\"family violence,\\" or \\"violence against a family member.\\" Here's how it worked: Teenage son (say, 14) pushes mom and storms out of the house. Mom calls the cops, and kids gets arrested and charged with DV. Bear in mind, DV is a Lautenburg offense, which means that upon conviction, you lose your 2nd amendment rights (can be restored, but that's beside the point). Anyway, DA meets with the kid and offers a diversion program: plead out to \\"family violence,\\" complete anger management classes, ETC. Once you successfully finish the program, you will have \\"family violence\\" on your record, but you will not have DV, which is a violent misdemeanor (in this example). The diversion charge is next to meaningless in the long term.EDIT TO ADD: I'm not sure on the cut-off pertaining to DV versus child abuse, but child abuse in general offers a lot more built-in protections for the child. In other words, I don't know if a parent could be charged with DV, but minors, can, roommates can, etc","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"It's crazy watching all of these countries that were kissing USA's ass for decades and made them basically an empire all go full panic mode now.

And the Twitter files were a mess...They, first of all, did not prove what they set out to prove. But that never mattered to all of the conservatives who didn't bother to read the files, and instead got all of their information about it from secondary sources. The files were selectively released, and riddled with inaccuracies. The author of the Twitter Files, Matt Taibbi, Even acknowledges some of these inaccuracies himself and he was criticized for making a bunch of factual errors in his reporting.Much of the data was misinterpreted or overstated, and the documents were selectively reported on to support a particular narrative. That narrative, \\"conservative conspiracists were right the entire time!\\"The files were released without full context, and contained a lack of groundbreaking so called \\"revelations\\" that Musk and his far right glorifiers on Twitter claim the files showed.The files basically showed that there was an internal fight over content moderation, which was not any thing surprising to begin with.Overall, the files provided no conclusive evidence that the FBI was paying Twitter to censor content.But none of this stopped right-wing fanatics from doxxing and issuing death threats to employees and former staff at Twitter.And again, the facts don't matter to conservatives who continue to play the victim while conveniently dismissing criticisms that Elon Musk is responsible for doing the very things that they accuse their \\"deep state\\" enemies of doing.Since Musk's takeover, he has altered the algorithms to direct traffic specifically to him, as well as any far-right mouthpieces and political agitators willing to pay for the privilege..Musk has also fired thousands of employees, many of them dissenters, which mind you, has caused a number of different problems for the platform.He awards Musk bucks to conservatives who spend most of their time and energy \\"owning the libs\\" and trolling users across the platform. Posting and sharing  clickbait and MAGA propaganda.He's also been heavily criticized for censoring voices who publicly disagree with him. Not to mention, he's basically a walking conflict of interest considering the fact that, in exchange for a made up position within Trump's new administration, Musk contributed hundreds of millions of dollars towards Trump's campaign and presidency, and essentially ran election interference and influence for Trump during the election after turning Twitter into a bastion of right wing, MAGA propaganda and misinformation.Trump continues to meet behind closed doors at Mar A Lago with billionaires, tech and finance \\"Bros,\\" and media moguls in order to make sure they're on the same page and plan to be in lockstep with the next Trump administration. Some of these people have already promised to contribute millions of dollars towards his presidency.And keep in mind, it's Trump supporters who continue to whine about Democrats being in \\"cahoots\\" with \\"big tech\\" and the media.This was never about \\"free speech,\\" it has always been about conservatives wanting a controlled mass media for *themselves.* It's about them interpreting \\"free speech\\" as being entitled to say whatever they want, wherever they want, and however they'd like without any consequences what so ever. It's about their *feelings*.It's about being free from criticism and accountability, and about them being able to control the narrative at all times.And it all stems from the fundamental notion that they are *owed* these things, that they are the dominant and supreme authority, and as a result, only *they* are entitled to the god-given rights and freedoms afforded to them in the Constitution, only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities, and ownership and control.","title":"Mark Zuckerberg Says Jim Jordan's Investigation of Conservative Censorship Was Like 'What Elon Did on The Twitter Files'"},{"text":"It's not hard to notice the culture shifting these last couple years.

I had woken up politically towards the end of the Bush presidency and then Obama and what I learned about media was like the first sip of coffee after waking up.... except it sucked haha.Anyway, I had always been pretty conservative and I was never a fan of Hilary. Even before I woke up, something always irked me about her. She seemed like a conniving, dishonest, shrew. And when she ran for Senator and then for president after Obama, I just hated how entitled she seemed to be about it all and I always had that thought, \\"What makes you qualified, you're just the spouse of a president.\\"I had problems with Trump in that election, but what he was speaking to was so dead on, and how he cut to the heart of what I knew was wrong with the media and had known for something like a decade... well all of that spoke to me. I couldn't really imagine him as president, but I just so hated the idea of Hilary and I knew she would just keep driving us down that slow road to hell that Obama turned us onto prior.So when Trump won, I was elated... I'm not an eatable person. I remember a silly giddiness that I hadn't felt since I was like a 8 or 9 at Christmas. And while his administration legitimately got off to a rocky start, and while some of the things he'd say made me cringe, what he was doing in policy and how he was trouncing the media I had known was corrupt for quite some time, that was well worth the occasional cringe-fest.Trump brought a lot of hope into the country with him that Obama had sapped away. I remember feeling that... it was almost spiritual. And then when Covid hit and all the BLM bullshit hit along with it, I felt a darkness. It felt like when a cloud's shadow suddenly darkens the sky above you and you feel cold. I'm not kidding when I started noticing more and more flies around and kept getting whiffs of something fetid and decayed, like death. It felt to me that the enemy of God was moving and attempting to take back the darkness that Trump had lightened.I know that sounds metaphorical or overly dramatic, but I swear the thing about the flies, and the feeling of the darkness, and the smell... it was all real.

I was sitting in my bed watching the results as they came in while FaceTiming my then girlfriend who was Mexican-American and whose parents are undocumented.  As the results kept coming in he kept flipping more and more states and it was becoming more clear that it was going to be closer than anyone expected. We were both in shock, although she was surprisingly more not surprised than I was. I actually remember being surprised that she didnt have a more visceral reaction. The kicker was Florida, which nobody expected to go red. Once he flipped Florida it was pretty much over. The next day was like a total paradigm shift. It felt like we landed in an alternate timeline. Nobody could believe it. I dont even think Trump could believe it, although I think he definitely knew he could win. People were eerily silent all day. Going back to school was very weird and the aura was just different. It wasnt just that he won, its that he pretty much won in a sweeping fashion in terms of swing states, although he did lose the popular vote. Overall things went back to normal after a week or so and people moved on. Still one of the weirder times in history. Potentially the most significant historical event in modern politics.

They care about short term profit and would only take investments with a short payback. Manufacturing takes decades to build and there aren't high profit margins.The US is not subsidizing Canada in a sense that it is handing money, but Canada does benefit from trade and is economically dependent on trade with the US. In theory, the US offers \\"military protection\\" to Canada as well, but the US makes that argument (who is going to attack Canada?) anyways.The most reasonable outcome is hard to predict because Trump is a very volatile person.

That is the logical progression of \\"why can't they vote\\" if you start from the reality that children do not have full rights as citizens until they reach the age of the majority. It seems like your real root question is \\"why do people think it's fair that we don't give children full rights?\\" and the answer is that adults don't trust kids (as a group) to make good decisions. That's mostly because adults hold at least a vague recollection of their own adolescence and realize that they did not have the experience to make solid long term decisions at that age. I remember being young and the way I looked at the world, and now years on I can look back and say \\"shit I had no idea how complex things were\\". I imagine basically every adult looks at themselves and thinks the same thing. I'm not saying adults are smart and kids are dumb, I'm just pointing out that there's a lot of things you can't fully understand until you've experienced them, and the majority of kids have only seen a tiny slice of reality. Now there will always be those who are kids who _do_ understand. There are also a ton of adults who are dumb as hell, and really shouldn't be voting either because their ability to make long term decisions never developed. But...there's not a way to fairly test for \\"is this person mature enough to make good decisions?\\" If there was, and we could apply it to voting, I imagine a lot of adults would be disenfranchised, and a relatively small number of teenagers would be given the vote. In lieu of a real test for maturity, we pick a line and say \\"this is our best guess\\". A lot of laws are like that. There are a lot of 18 and 19 year-old who are no more mature and thoughtful than they were at 17 but they hit the criteria so they get to go. Making a rule that is a best approximation isn't wholly fair but it is a _reasonable_ thing to do. Not all people who qualify for a lot of things wholly deserve it, but we have to make a best approximation and make due with that.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"man, it's a crazy unpredictable world we live in.

The various colonies paying taxes towards the empires that protected and supplied them and who built them in the first place isn't any more unreasonable than anything else really.  The early settlers in America were from the same countries they protested paying taxes back to support.On top of that, the taxes that were paid were mainly in the form of import duties, a cost directly linked to the trade costs and the supporting military vessels that were required back then to combat piracy or protect them from other coxuntries.  Today America ironically plays that role for hte most part and you can bet your ass that countries that are broadly speaking under their protection pay something back in exchange for that.Taxes everywhere back then were tiny compared to today and far smaller in America than in Britain, those taxes also skyrocketted after America gained independance as funnily enough that came with a whole range of additional costs that they previously didn't have to cover because that was done for them.  So while I entirely understand their desire for independence and perhaps even support their military action and diplomacy to achieve it, doing so on the basis of taxes being \\"too high\\" is just silly.  And expecting the citizens of every British colony to get to vote on everything Britain did when they vastly outnumbered the home population is just silly.  Realistically no country would ever accept that.","title":"CMV: It's not reasonable to vote on and pass laws that pertain to and restrict the freedoms of a group of people who have no right to vote on them."},{"text":"Remember this the next time a tornado hits a red state.","title":"Cruel and Craven"},{"text":"Exactly","title":"As term nears its end, Biden Presidency viewed less favorably by Americans than Trump or Obama"},{"text":"Which is exactly why Trump's supporters support him in the first place.

At first glance, these verses would seem to provide a clear and explicit answer to the question. No, no one can know when Jesus is coming back. However, those verses do not say that no one will ever be able to know when Jesus will return. Most Bible scholars would say that Jesus, now glorified in heaven, knows the timing of His return, indicating that the phrase nor the Son does not mean Jesus will never know when He will return. Similarly, it is possible that, while Matthew 24:36-44 indicates that no one at that time could know the timing of Jesus return, God could reveal the timing of Jesus return to someone in the future.[snip]The key points are (1) the Bible nowhere encourages us to attempt to discover the timing of Jesus return and (2) the Bible gives no explicit data by which the timing of Jesus return can be determined. Rather than developing wild and speculative calculations to determine when Jesus is coming back, the Bible encourages us to keep watch and be ready (Matthew 24:42-44). The fact that the day of Jesus return is unknown should motivate us to live every day in light of the imminence of Christs return.Christians have a hard enough time living according to Christian principles which is what \\"be ready\\" means. They don't need to worry about when the second coming will be.","title":"Trump's Life in End Times Bible Prophecy and Future Forecast."},{"text":"Thanks, I needed a good scoff today.","title":"Trump says he and Obama 'probably do' like each other"},{"text":"If Biden said this about Texas, or NC, or Florida he would be crucified by both sides.

Trump would have been/will be worse of course. But Biden fucked up hard on inflation, which ended up being the biggest issue of the election by farBidenists like to say that inflation was a global affair and act like little could have been done about it, or that little could have been done without big risks. But Biden could have axed the Trump tariffs with executive orders, lowering inflation by around 1 point, and despite all the often repeated comments about how Dems just NEED to be protectionist to win, there's little evidence that being pro free trade actually hurts. And Biden's stimulus [likely contributed around 2 to 4 points to inflation at its peak](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/20/jane-timken/bidens-american-rescue-plan-fueled-inflation-so-di/). And the economy was already rapidly recovering at that point so it's not clear any stimulus was needed - and if one was, the GOP was offering a compromise stimulus for $600 billion, which would have fully patched the estimated output gap, rather than massively overspending with the Biden bill that did a whopping $1.9 trillion when the 1 year output gap was just $400 billion and the 2 year was just $600 billionSo with that there, that's 3 to 5 points of inflation at its peak that Biden could have avoided. Not the entire inflation surge of course, but that amount still could have genuinely made a differencePlus Biden fucked the pullout from Afghanistan hard - even if you assume we really did need to pull out, surely it could have been done more competently at least. That was what first led Biden to seeing horrid approval ratings that never recovered. Didn't help that Biden put his foot in his mouth in the debate and forgot (being charitable here assuming he was just too senile to remember, rather than actively lying) about how US troops died in the pullout (he said none did) which helped the right bring the issue back into public focusDude also helped fuck up BBB negotiations with Manchin, refusing to take his $1.5t redline seriously, leading to Manchin rage quitting and cutting his own topline in half. Hate Manchin all you want for that but Biden still made it worse by making choices that led to even less being done than Manchin allowed. And the social spending stuff was going to be paid for, rather than deficit spending, so that would have been the stuff that wouldn't have been inflationary too. Biden overspent on inflationary spending and then fucked it up on non inflationary spendingHis buy American/union made crap and tariffs on EVs just slow infrastructure and electric vehicle growth. You can argue for certain protectionist policy for national security with CHIPS, but we shouldn't put tariffs on our allies or stop China from subsidizing our transition to electric vehicles, at the very leastImmigration is good, but the general public doesn't agree, and Biden pivoted to the center there far too little too late after *years* of having taken more liberal stances and undoing Trump executive orders and then being super unpopular from it Biden's choice to remain in the election was a disaster of hubris that screwed the party immensely, and him pulling out only after we could have a primary left Harris the nominee by default but someone critically unable to separate herself from the hated Biden admin by nature of being literally his VP, which made the election even harder to winAnd then this fucking guy went and nepotistically pardoned his own son, and then followed it up by pardoning (\\"erm ackshually it was a commutation\\" I don't care!) the Kids for Cash guyHis presidency has been a disaster.

His SAT scores if he ever even took those, have never been made public. There is no way to legitimately extrapolate an IQ from any SAT score (altho rough estimates stating that a 1600 probably is close to a 160 is probably not too far off). He didnt get a 1600 though.

Granted, Mexico is ahead of the game compared to Afghanistan in terms of development, institutions, and is no stranger to the idea and practice of democracy.As we hunted them down, the Taliban took refuge in the mountains bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan which made it difficult to pursue and eliminate. It introduced military difficulties (mountains, caves) and political ones (sovereignty of Pakistan). As the Taliban licked their wounds and organized over time, we underwent the plan of nation building. What struck me was how fucking fast the country collapsed once we left and the Taliban returned. Along with that, the politicians of Afghanistan were corrupt even with the absence of the Taliban. To bring it back to the cartels and Mexico. Lets say they were designated as terrorists. I assume then the US would cut off access to all their known accounts to freeze them from their funds. I hope theyd go full stop and raid any known or possible fronts for their laundering or drug trafficking operations. Alerts would be sent to airports for any known cartel members to not let them fly (whether the flight attendant actually stops them is another case). They wont have Pakistani mountains to hide in but they have the rest of central and South American to wait out the storm. I hope that once the special military operation shows the western hemisphere that the cartels are on the ropes, itll boost the morale of the military and governments to aid in the fight and prevent the cartels from catching their breaths.","title":"Trump team resurfaces plans to designate Mexican cartels as terror organizations"},{"text":"Even here youre giving him way too much credit.

The $130,000 in wire payments exceeded the federal campaign contribution cap but he did not report these contributions to the FEC.2. The false statements in AMIs books violated New York tax law.3. The entire scheme violated New York election law, which makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means. In this case, were the purported crimes significant enough to bring charges? **Would they have been brought against an individual not named Trump?**Michael Cohen was charged and convicted of five counts of tax evasion and two separate counts of violating federal election law in connection with the hush money case.

But he leaves office amid deepening global disorder, and without having even tried to negotiate an end to a war that Ukraine cannot win.Main reason of this \\"global disorder\\" - Biden's attempts to stop spread of authoritarian and imperialism only when such fight is not upset USA voters (and Trump supporters) by too big inflation.Ukraine cannot win? How it can win when all these 3 years, for the sake of Biden's re-election, USA allowed Russia to continue trade with USA allies and trade partners? When even now USA's Schlumberger still help Russia to extract and sell oil.Next, the same author who recently said that Trump is not builder list why this so.Main argument - because Trump knows how to negotiate.Without even thinking for a second about the possibility that many people with who Trump will negotiate  perceive any form of negotiation as weakness or possibility for deception and betrayal. Possibility to receive more legitimization and time to use them against USA allies, and thereafter - against the USA itself.Not figuratively, but for real. As their predecessors already many times successfully used USA help against the USA itself.Russia will almost certainly retain the 20 percent of Ukraine it now occupies. But Washington must ensure that the other 80 percent is sovereign and secure.How exactly such analog of Munich Agreement could guarantee anything, including security of Ukraine, when, from perspective of Russian elites, this will be just another (after Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, Donbass, Syrian chemical weapon) confirmation that by \\"WMD-Might?make Right/True\\"?logic they could AND SHOULD continue to exchange free bioresources (including from occupied territories) for more liquid ones?More important question, this 3rd sell out of territories of country which was because of the USA lost nukes, how exactly USA, more so isolationist USA, will be able to convince someone that anything short WMD could guarantee national sovereignty and security?No, really, how? By isolationistic treats? By restriction of high-tech during time when similar tech have many others? By appeals to completely discredited International Law? By war against parts of increasingly more globalized (despite autocratization) 8 billion entity?Or by attempts to divide countries onto those who should have access to modern knowledge and those who shouldn't AFTER discredit of liberal and democratic values - the most suitable measures for this?The task facing Americans, allies, and even foreign adversaries is to ensure that the promise of Trumps second term prevails over its peril. America and the world need Trump to be a disrupter and reformer, not merely a destroyer. Americans and foreigners can and should work with Trump the disrupter and reformer.Agree. And there are no better reform than just rise of human capital by better understanding of human nature and related to it shortcomings.Or voters, and by them democracy, will become more competent in Logic (rationality) and Cognitive Distortions, Logical Fallacies, Defense Mechanisms.Or soon there wasn't any democracy, and thereafter humanity, at all.But if he becomes the destroyer, then checks and balances at home and abroad must shut Trump down.If Trump will become just destroyer, there wasn't be any second chance. No one will give to already too thin USA, EU, West. USA will become just Turkey with nukes until original Turkey will get nukes, only to become few time bigger Turkey with nukes, but no more.Just 350/8000 million people. A little richer, with still a slightly better economy, but with essentially the same technologies and, which much more important, sociocultural norms/values, and therefore with the same future.","title":"Trump Is Right That Pax Americana Is Over"},{"text":"The irony is the same people complaining about this are the same people who tell us not to shame sex work (prostitution) which is against the law...","title":"Convicted felon?

Facebook will make most of its user data available to anyone whose check clears. That being said the underlying concern of tiktok over others is the Chinese ownership. Specifically because of the very common assertion which is backed by some information that seems legitimate that a policy exists in the current Chinese government which states that any company based in China must turn over any requested data to the government without question and if that company is then asked by a third party whether or not they provided that data to the government they are legally obligated to say no they did not. There's no direct evidence that this is definitely a policy nor is there direct evidence that this is not a policy. However rumors have circulated for years that such a policy exists. In the event that there is an actual policy in China that a chinese-owned company must comply with intelligence requests from the Chinese government and also deny that such a request was made or fulfilled, some serious concerns exist. Specifically tiktok repeatedly saying that they are not turning over data, becomes a point of contention if they are legally required to say that despite having done so. The problem is the Chinese government will never acknowledge whether or not this is a thing and as a result it creates a very serious concern. Theoretically Facebook sells all of its user data to China somewhere a record of that exists and could be accessed by the US government the US government would then be able to say oh China now has everyone's phone number and their GPS data. But if byte dance were to provide the full transcripts of every single US citizens text messages as provided by a phone having Tick Tock installed, then there would be no evidence that that transfer had been made.Generally speaking The easiest actual solution to most of these problems would be to Simply make a ban For any U.S government employee or anyone who possesses a security clearance or works on government contracts.

By Mitch McConnell"},{"text":"Some key parts of this analysis:A judge in New York sentenced the US president-elect to an unconditional discharge for 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment to an adult film performer during the 2016 election.This court has determined that the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching upon the highest office in the land is an unconditional discharge, Judge Juan Merchan explained.Legal experts hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law. It cemented the fact that Trump will enter office 10 days from now as the first US president convicted of a crime. The 78-year-old must carry that stigma for the rest of his life.But in the eyes of the average voter, Trump got off scot-free. No fine. No jail time. In soccer terms, Fridays sentencing was like a consolation goal in the final minutes when most fans have left the stadium and Trumps name is already being inscribed on the trophy.While prison would have been rare for a first-time offender in such a case, so too is an unconditional discharge. Most people in Trumps shoes would, if not pay a fine, at least be expected to regularly check in with a probation officer and submit to drug and alcohol testing.But Trump received special treatment throughout. He had been a badly behaved defendant who hurled insults at the judge and judicial system throughout the process but went unpunished....A portion of the blame lies with the man he will replace, Joe Biden. The current presidents decision to appoint Merrick Garland as attorney general proved a fatal mistake. Garland was far too cautious in prosecuting Trump over his role in the January 6 2021 insurrection and mishandling of classified documents.Charlie Sykes, an author and broadcaster, wrote on the Atlantics website that Biden misread the trajectory of Trumpism. Like so many others, he thought that the problem of Trump had taken care of itself and that his election meant a return to normalcy. So he chose as his attorney general Merrick Garland, who seems to have seen his role as restoring the Department of Justice rather than pursuing accountability for the man whod tried to overturn the election.After Hamlet-like procrastination, Garland appointed the special counsel, Jack Smith, to oversee the cases in November 2022 C almost the midway point of the Biden presidency. Smith duly brought indictments but it was too little too late and two federal cases have been dropped.Imagine if the roles had been reversed. Trump would have appointed a firebrand special counsel to aggressively pursue the cases from day one. Not for the first time, Democrats played by a quaint set of rules even as Republicans were tearing up the rulebook.It's been pretty clear for a long time that conservative politicians have not been playing by any kind of rulebook for quite a while. Rather, they're following a power-at-any-cost route, which has in this case succeeded.

In fact,\\nfrom 2012 to 2017, soybeans accounted for almost 50 percent of bulk\\nagricultural exports from the United States, up from around 25 percent\\nin the early 2000sIn theory, Chinese tariffs should lower the countrys demand for\\nU.S. soybeans. Tariffs essentially create an artificial increase in the cost\\nof U.S. soybeans to Chinese importers. Given this higher cost, Chinese importers should purchase fewer soybeans from the United States,\\nthereby depressing prices for U.S. soybeans while raising prices for Chinese consumers. As a result, the quantity of soybeans traded between\\nthe two countries should decline.\\n \\nHowever, several intermediate steps follow the implementation of\\na tariff and could influence the magnitude of outcomes in U.S. markets.* For example, the tariff is not directly applied to U.S. farmers, agribusinesses, or exporters but is instead applied to soybeans as they are purchased at the port of entry by Chinese importers. \\n * The Chinese importer who pays the tariff has the option of passing the costs on to the Chinese consumer or\\n * submitting a plea for tariff relief or exemptions to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Moreover, soybean markets and commerce are structured differently in China than in the United States.* For example, a large portion of soybeans are purchased by state-owned\\nenterprises as opposed to publicly traded companies. As a result, the\\neconomic effects of the recent tariffs on soybean markets are challenging to estimate in practice.","title":"CMV: Trump will likely achieve his goals.

For those who don't remember, one of the tricks they tried is changing the withholding tables so that the tax cuts would show up in our paychecks immediately. Neat idea, but the problem is a lot of folks don't actually see a ~2% change in their paycheck (roughly what I found after comparing my paychecks and doing the math back then). Or at least, they don't understand the mechanism at play there.Better yet. When it came time to do taxes.... the refunds were **way** lower. [Source 2](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/693976808/anger-confusion-over-dwindling-refunds-is-trumps-tax-plan-to-blame).

Sending carriers to scare off Israels enemies, shooting down missiles aimed at them, providing military aid without question or delay.Then on the topic of Ukraine, Biden rallied a massive international coalition to aid Ukraine and turn Russia into a pariah state. He was always a bit slow to approve new escalations against Russia, but most of the delays had to do with Republican opposition, not any lack of will from Biden. Ukraine would likely not exist anymore if not for Biden coordinating intelligence with Ukraine and providing massive military and economic aid.It seems like much of Bidens \\"weakness\\" in foreign policy has been based on perception and not fact. Obviously it's not totally cut and dry like that, but still. Ukraine still stands today because of Western aid. Israel has emerged victorious in large part due to Bidens policies.

Rather, it's present by implication, in some sense a negative pregnant, arising by logical necessity out of the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy and the fundamental realities of a jury system, the purpose of both of which is to shield defendants from government officials abusing otherwise valid laws and systems. That is to say, there is no more a \\"concept\\" of jury nullification than there is a \\"concept\\" of judicial nullification, as one might call it; in theory there's nothing preventing a trial judge from ordering and enforcement an entirely unjust, unjustified, and illicit judgment in a civil case purely out of hatred of the defendant, and appellate courts from upholding that judgment because of the same motivation, much as there's nothing preventing a jury from just saying someone's not guilty in direct violation of the facts and the law.","title":"Trump sentencing live updates: Judge sentences Trump to unconditional discharge in hush money case"},{"text":"Isnt this the supreme court just asking divest by Jan 19 or be banned?

The vast amount of ~~science~~ religion is using evidence to support their belief in a most likely conclusion.  A most likely conclusion is not science.  Science = knowledge.  We know stars exist.  That's scientific knowledge.  We don't know how far away they are.  We can make some assumptions and use other pieces of scientific knowledge to understand what would happen if our assumptions were true.  But that doesn't make it true, known, or science.. even if a scientist is doing the theorizing.  All we can do is believe how far away the stars are.  For example, everything we know about outer space we primarily cant directly prove. That doesnt mean we dont know anything about outer spaceThat's exactly what it means.  We *know* very little about outer space.  We *believe* a lot about outer space.  You have been brainwashed into thinking that the things some people believe are actually things we know, and that it's science.  It's not.  It's religion.that means we are able to use math and the laws of physics as well as collective evidence to deduce the highest likelihood of what something is. That is science.\\n \\nYou're talking about the highest likelihood of what we *believe* something is.  That is **not** science.  That is theory.  If you believe the theory, it is now your religion.  I can use our scientific knowledge that matter cannot be created within the confines of time and space, and theorize that it was created by a being who exists outside of time and space.  I can use evidence of marvelous designs in the function of ecosystems and food and similar features between creatures as evidence of intelligent design.  I can use our knowledge of the law of entropy that everything tends toward chaos and destruction to concluded that in the beginning everything was created perfectly, and we are now living in a more chaotic version of it (that actually might be a hard scientific conclusion as opposed to theory).  but understanding how modern religion is all essentially based upon astrology and seeing the exact references really made me certain.Yes.  The story of Jesus is a personification of the Sun's transit across the zodiac (I've seen Zeitgeist).  But if that makes you disbelieve in God, you missed the point of the story, and you don't understand what God is.The book of John opens with: *In the beginning was the Word.  And the Word was with God.  And the Word was God.* The term *word* is translated from the Greek word [Logos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos).  Logos is essentially a sacred teaching that guides you toward spiritual enlightenment.  It is the exact same concept as [Dharma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), which is the unifying ideology behind the Dharmic religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism , and Sikhism).  Whether or not Jesus was a real person or not doesn't matter.  What matters is the Dharma/Logos from the story (love your neighbors, love your enemies, love yourself, treat others the way you would want to be treated, turn the other cheek, etc.).  That is the Holy Spirit (God).. the force that allows you to master and control reality.  Gandhi executed this perfectly and ended the British Empire with simple truth and changing the hearts of his enemy.  The opposite of Dharma is called [Adharma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adharma).  If Dharma is God, Adharma is Atheism.Adharma[1] is the Sanskrit antonym of dharma. It means \\"that which is not in accord with the dharma\\". Connotations include betrayal, discord, disharmony, unnaturalness, wrongness, evil, immorality, unrighteousness, wickedness, and vice.Adharma describes the leftist movement.  I content that it means you cannot be an Atheist and a Republican.","title":"Do Atheist Republicans exist?"},{"text":"Biden never had enough conviction on anything for anyone to consider him great.

But instead of updating their data centers to comply, Facebook sues the EPA on 1st amendment grounds by pointing out that enforcement would mean shutting down the data centers and prevent them from hosting content. I would not want the courts to rule in Facebook's favor in such a case.Between the way this ban singles out TikTok, and the way ownership is more closely related to content/speech I am concerned that a ruling against TikTok may set a bad precedent for 1st amendment cases in general, but I hope any ruling in TikTok's favor is narrow.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"I can't help but think that we're seeing problems like appeasement, anti-Semitism, lackadaisical responses to coups, etc. because the Greatest Generation is now almost entirely gone.

Unless, of course, theyre admitting that were just slaves of the system, and now they want to control what we do and what we say. They even want to implant electronics in our bodies to the point where they could turn us off if they feel the need. This is no longer governance; this is overreach and terrorism against the people.","title":"Discussion Thread: Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in Case on TikTok Ban"},{"text":"Y'know, I legit think that if the judge *did* sentence Trump to 100 hours of community service or somesuch, that would provide material that Trump could turn into a serious political win. (Well, not that he has any more elections to win, but still.)Like, you say it's just funny to imagine Trump being sent to clean up a public park. And, certainly, it is funny from a certain perspective. But that would be a fucking fantastic opportunity to do a photo op--plaster social media with Trump, in a suit, with the Secret Service and maybe members of his cabinet or Republican members of Congress to help out, going around cleaning a park. Certainly, I'm skeptical that Trump would actually be physically or emotionally capable of actually doing that, but if he actually in good faith did 100 genuine hours of community service, his base would lap that right the fuck up and oh god it would just be raw fucking bait for some democratic operative or liberal commentator to try to make fun of, mock, or otherwise criticize him for, something that would so immediately backfire.","title":"Trump sentencing live updates: Judge sentences Trump to unconditional discharge in hush money case"},{"text":"Well they're burning all the old books anyway.

Before 2016, most people knew him as a gaudy caricaturea failed businessman who desperately tried to sell the illusion of success. He wasnt the self-made billionaire he claimed to be; he was the millionaire who squandered his inherited fortune and bankrupted multiple casinos, which is no small feat given that casinos are practically designed to print money. Even his TV persona as the \\"boss\\" on The Apprentice was built on smoke and mirrors, a carefully crafted fa?ade to mask his ineptitude.He ran for president on a platform steeped in white nationalism, fearmongering, and empty slogans, surrounding himself with bottom-feeders like Steve Bannon and Roger Stonepeople whose only talents lie in stoking division and chaos. Trumps appeal wasnt built on competence or vision; it was based on feeding resentment to the disenchanted. He didnt have the ability to articulate complex ideas or demonstrate a grasp of policy; his speeches were rambling streams of nonsense that pandered to the lowest common denominator.Physically, he embodied excess and artifice: an elderly, overweight man slathered in orange makeup, with a carefully constructed comb-over or wig to hide his insecurities. His personal life read like a tabloid train wreckmultiple divorces, a wife with a questionable past, and children who seemed to orbit him only to bolster their own egos or financial interests.And yet, he became the perfect mascot for those who felt left behind or irrelevant. Trump wasnt a leader; he was a mirror, reflecting back the desperation and inadequacy of his most fervent supporters. He gave them permission to revel in ignorance and resentment. To these people, his incoherent rants werent a bugthey were a feature. He didnt challenge them to think critically or aspire to something greater; he validated their grievances and told them it was someone elses fault.Trumps base has often been characterized as those lacking in education, ambition, or achievementpeople who see themselves as victims of a system they dont understand and are unwilling to engage with meaningfully. They idolize Trump not because hes an example of success but because he redefines success in terms that excuse their own shortcomings. For many, being white, evangelical, or proudly ignorant becomes their entire identity, and Trump becomes their champion simply because he amplifies their bitterness.They wave their Trump flags not out of pride but out of desperation, clinging to a man whose failures they can relate to because hes somehow turned those failures into a twisted form of celebrity. They see in him a grotesque version of themselvesa reminder that, in a society that often rewards substance and competence, even mediocrity can claw its way to the top if its loud and shameless enough.In the end, Trump isnt the leader of a movement; hes a reflection of a segment of America that sees its relevance slipping away and cant bear to confront why. Hes their beacon of hope, not because hes great, but because hes proof that even a loser can demand attention in a nation increasingly fractured by its own contradictions.","title":"Trumps hush money sentence ensures a convicted felon is going to the White House"},{"text":"Do Americans have any concept of how insane this looks to the rest of the Anglosphere??\\nA lot of non-Americans are only discovering the concept of presidential immunity now.","title":"Trump sentencing live updates: Judge sentences Trump to unconditional discharge in hush money case"},{"text":"This is the 'stick' in the equation.If Trump wants to act like a bully go 100% in with signing new policies and treaties and formalize new deals with China + tariffs on the U.SPeople cannot keep capitulating.","title":"Beijing says its willing to deepen economic ties with Canada as Trump brings trade chaos"},{"text":"I'm not at all surprised by this, and the Senate GOP is probably chomping at the bit to follow through.","title":"House GOP puts Medicaid, ACA, climate measures on chopping block"},{"text":"Yeah, they're a part of the same class.

Given those circumstances, the judge made a choice to punish him in an oddly unique way. I know most won't see it this way, but those I've talked with in the legal industry are pointing out that this is not quite the \\"nothing\\" that people think it is.Trump is forever a felon. The fact that America would elect a felon as President is part of a much deeper problem that we now know goes beyond him, and that is ultimately what it will be our goal to help solve. His specific hold over people is very unique and will be hard (if not next to impossible) for the GOP to replicate, but this was not the case of a stolen election. It's a case of us talking a hard look at our country and realizing the work we'll need to do to change the culture and fight the disinfo that fuels all this, all while figuring out how we survive.Again, this was never the fight I wanted. I wanted us to be done with this, and I wanted us to learn that the American people were smarter about the new world than they actually are, but the reality of things are what they are, and we can either sit in despair or doom, or recognize the problem for what it is and do our best to get through it. Trump's path to absolute power is far, far from absolute, and he's already running into numerous issues before he even took office.

An ugly outcome.Zelenskyy offered to take Russia to court over lost territory if Ukraine were granted membership in NATO. That was a smart move and Ukraines best hope. Of course, it was rejected by both the president-elect and Putin.The U.S. right has been laying the groundwork for the president-elects appeasement of Russia. Lately, on social media, for instance, they have been parroting Putins propaganda: Why shouldnt Russia be our [the USAs] friend? Putins words, almost verbatim. They also emphasize that Ukraine does not have enough manpower to win against Russia.Putins Russia is the self-declared enemy of the West, and that isnt changing anytime soon. The U.S. military, for instance, has less manpower than China but still expects to win even a two hemisphere conflict. Ukraine is smaller than Russia, but with appropriate weapons and the permission to use them, they have been effective. Russias economy was struggling, at least, until the recent U.S. election.
