Don't get me started on the guys for Kamala advertisement. Instead of saying Democratic party is a party for all US citizen, whether men or women or anything in-between; the Democratic party instead divided the American people and said, the Democratic party is a party for women and you men must support it.In 2016, I still remember talking point such as \\"It's the women's turn now.\\" \\"It's her turn now.\\" were used.

The bill's passage would apply the amendments made in it to taxable years after its enactment, including those of the incoming Trump administration. The current version of the bill, which Representative Claudia Tenney introduced, is paired with a provision that offers tax relief to Americans who are \\"unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad, or held hostage abroad.\\"No need to read between the lines, this is pretty typical for Republicans. They use vague wording or broad language and then get to dictate for themselves what falls under the purview of that language.\\"Terrorist supporting\\" could easily applyaccording to Republicansto any non-profit that's advocated for innocent civilians in Gaza for instance.Even any non-profit that's advocated for LGBTQ, abortion rights, or BLM.And therein lies the disingenuousness of the Republican agenda. They try to pass legislation like this, knowing full well how they'll abuse it, and when it fails to pass, the GOP exploits the opportunity to accuse democrats of being \\"terrorist sympathizers.\\" It's kind of a lose-lose situation (or a win-win depending on your perspective). However, this nuance isn't important to those pushing their narratives.Think about how they do this with \\"election integrity\\" laws that use election denying language to suppress and subvert the vote, or laws targeting public school curricula, or even laws that use language like \\"pornography\\" and \\"sexual orientation.\\" Also, think about how Republicans will apply this tactic to laws that target immigrants, children of immigrants, asylum seekers, those on a pathway to citizenship, etc...Imagine if Democrats tried to pass a bill like this, with less extreme language of course, that targeted the tax exempt status of churches. Conservatives would be in an uproar.And what's to stop another incarnation of the bill being passed next year? In a blog post urging members of Congress to kill the bill, Kia Hamadanchy, ACLU's senior policy counsel, said, \\"The freedom to dissent without fear of government retribution is a vital part of any well-functioning democracy, which is why Congress must block H.R. 9495 before it's too late.I appreciate the sentiment, especially considering the ACLU is a nonprofit that some Republicans might label \\"terrorist supporting,\\" but let's see how well \\"dissent\\" fares after January 20th of next year... You know, considering Trump and those in his closest orbit have threatened to wreak vengeance on the opposition. Freedom of dissent? Laughable.

I know lots of idiots with a degree framed on the wall. I dropped out of college after 2 years but I was smart enough not to take out student loans. I have educated myself. I learned to weed through the media and find the original source of info so I can make a logical decision for myself. When I want to learn something I check out a book or search for reliable info on the internet. My husband opted to obtain an Associates degree (the smallest of the college degrees) in his trade of choice.  Hes one of the smartest people I know. We dont make tons of money but we live a zero debt lifestyle and we own 3 houses (free and clear) and we only live off of one income which I think is pretty impressive. My net worth is significantly higher than that of the average middle class. Only one income was fine before 2020 but now its a struggle because the cost of everything quadrupled while his income did not. The whining liberals act like theyre dying but we were in their shoes 4 years ago when Biden won in a miraculous turn of events. I dont remember and conservatives recording their crying to post on social media. Not to mention they already lived thru 4 years of trump as president.

Labeling this potential administration as the most far-right extreme in history is an overstatement. Political and cultural landscapes shift, and whats considered conservative today may simply reflect the evolving views of many Americans, not extremism.Take the choice of a conservative news anchor as Defense Secretary or a hardline immigration advisor, for example. Just as progressives have advocated for figures aligned with their values in such roles, conservatives may see these picks as a way to implement their own approach to national security and immigration policy. Different views on these issues dont necessarily equate to extremism.Furthermore, public health policies regarding vaccines are complex and include a range of opinions. While I don't support vaccine denial, its also true that various public health policies should withstand scrutiny, including those related to emergency powers during pandemics. Healthy debate on such matters isnt the same as dismantling public health.The fear of authoritarianism or a military purge might resonate with some, but we should be cautious about presuming intent. The Constitution is still the guiding document, and many believe it will remain the ultimate check on power. Even with loyalists in positions of influence, Americas system has withstood numerous challenges over time, relying on the checks and balances that have protected democracy so far.Instead of seeing these potential appointments as threats, it may be worth engaging with the issues and policies themselves. Considering law or public service as a career is a great way to advocate for your beliefs and help shape the future of the Democratic Party in a constructive way.","title":"Trump assembles Cabinet with the same disregard for ethics that marked his first term | \\nIf you had any hope normal people would come into his administration to do normal things, that wishful thinking hasnt survived one week after the election."},{"text":"Didnt she help create Trump?","title":"Cheney: Guardrails of democracy must keep Trump in check"},{"text":"How do you get someone so wrong you think theyre Hitler a few years before you aim to be working with them?

A currently high stock market isn't directly correlated to more money because you need the context of how much they lost as well to calculate that. \\nFor example, let's say you have 100k invested and an annual return of 10%, if the market crashes and your investments drop 30% in value (30k) leaving you with 70k, it would take approximately 4 years to get back to break even. If it dropped 50%, it would take roughly 8 years to recover your funds, etc.\\nIf you lost 50%, you need to double your account (100%) to get back to break even with compounding returnd, and that's with a 10% annualized compounded return, which is very, very good in terms of long term investing.

For example, the FDA works under FD&amp;C, EPA works under CWA, CAA, TSCA, FIFRA etc, Dept of Fish &amp; Wildlife works under ESA. To fuck with the authority of a federal agency, an act of Congress is needed. Even if Congress is controlled by one party, it is actually very difficult to get stuff added to regulations or removed and it can take a long time. Agencies also cant just *not* do what the law says they have to do, or the government gets sued and it does not look good. White House can make it difficult for federal agencies though. They can advise them to change their implementing regulations (like CEQ does with NEPA), they can make it difficult to hire people, they can pressure Congress to pass back to the office initiatives, they can pressure Congress to cut budgets. And a lot more. Government workers also have very strong unions and you cant just fire them.

The falsified records were intended to conceal these payments, constituting a violation of state law. ?In New York, falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor. However, when such falsifications are made with the intent to commit or conceal another crime, they are elevated to felony charges.

The big one is about the whole wargame thing with China, the creators of those wargames only conducted the wargame for a simulated 1-2 weeks and China didn't \\"win them all\\", most of them the US did win or China just didn't completely lose.  The big issue was the number of available airframes by the end of those 2 weeks, however, at the end, China's ability to fight beyond those two weeks was pretty much eliminated for being able to project force.'China's DF27 is not battle-tested and true hypersonic missiles (not just ballistic missiles moving at \\"hypersonic\\" speeds) are quite difficult to have operational as the CEP for hitting a moving ship (despite being large) at those speeds is hard.  The US has the SM3 capable of destroying the DF27 in exoatmospheric conditions.In the wargame yes, sometimes the US lost parts of its US CSG but that is why we have multiple.  China's advantage is being able to fight near its supplies - but most of its industrial capability is on the coast.  If China attacks a CSG you can be sure that China's facilities on the coast will also be taken out.China will try to strike in the fall of 2026 or spring of 2027 all the US has to do to be successful is keep 2-3 CSG in the area to prevent the conflict.  There are only so many times a year with favorable weather conditions for a Taiwan invasion and their troop buildups are not secret (like Russia's) and finally based on those old war games the US has changed things around.  We have moved more launchers to the area (Philippines) and built the whole Marines 2030 plan of digging in on the islands (which they have now done on smaller Taiwan island chains).There are certainly issues with the US military but they are almost always less than our near-peer adversaries.

Here are the key points supporting this assessment:1. Election outcome: Trump defeated Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the Electoral College and the popular vote[7][8].2. Economic issues: The economy was consistently ranked as the most important issue for voters, and Trump was seen as better able to handle the economy compared to Harris (54% vs 45%)[4].3. Key swing states: Final polls showed Trump leading or in very close races with Harris in crucial battleground states like Arizona, while Harris had slim leads in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada[2].4. Demographic shifts: Trump made gains among some key demographic groups compared to 2020, including Hispanic men, of whom over half supported Trump in 2024[8].5. Incumbent party disadvantage: There was a global trend of incumbent parties/candidates losing elections, which worked against Harris as the nominee of the incumbent Democratic party[7].6. Voter turnout: Fewer people voted in 2024 compared to 2020, with Harris receiving far fewer votes than Biden did in 2020, while Trump's vote total remained relatively stable[8].7. Party shifts: The Republican base has shifted to include more working class voters, which benefited Trump[7].While Harris had some advantages, including stronger support among younger voters, college graduates, and on issues like climate change and abortion[4], Trump's victory in the election and strengths on key issues like the economy ultimately made him the more viable candidate in 2024. However, it's important to note that the election was still relatively close in many aspects.Citations:\\n[1] 2024 Presidential Election Polls: Harris vs. Trump - 270toWin https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-polls/\\n[2] Final Data for Progress Swing State Polls Show Harris and Trump in ... https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/11/1/final-data-for-progress-swing-state-polls\\n[3] National : President: general election : 2024 Polls | FiveThirtyEight https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\\n[4] Economy Most Important Issue to 2024 Presidential Vote https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\\n[5] US election 2024 results and exit poll in maps and charts https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lp48ldgyeo\\n[6] Tracking the 2024 presidential candidates - NBC News https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/presidential-candidates-tracker\\n[7] Seven key takeaways from Trump's presidential election victory | Hub https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/11/11/insights-and-impacts-election-2024/\\n[8] Analysis of the vote for Harris/Trump https://www.investigativepost.org/2024/11/10/the-numbers-behind-the-vote-for-president/\\n[9] What did we learn from the 2024 Presidential election? - JHU Hub https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/11/07/presidential-election-lessons-experts/","title":"The media owes Trump an apology  and an about-face in his second term"},{"text":"Has the tattoos to prove it, too.","title":"Trump taps Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary"},{"text":"As much as Id love Pete, America is not ready for him.\\n100% agree, the dems need to quit the moderate passive bs.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Please be right","title":"Trump announces Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to lead new Department of Government Efficiency"},{"text":"If he had any brains, hed be dangerous.","title":"Don't worry everyone.

The Book's Specific Details:\\\\- The name \\"Baron Trump\\" is highly specific and unusual\\\\- The character's personality traits matching real Barron Trump\\\\- The setting in Trump Tower area (Fifth Avenue)\\\\- The political upheaval described in \\"The Last President\\"\\\\- The timing of these books (1890s) being far enough in the past to seem innocuous3. Author Background:\\\\- Ingersoll Lockwood was a relatively obscure author\\\\- Limited information exists about how he developed these specific story ideas\\\\- The books weren't particularly successful at the time, yet contained such specific future detailsLogical questions this raises:1. If time travel was involved, was Lockwood:   \\\\- A time traveler himself?   \\\\- Getting information from a time traveler?   \\\\- Somehow accessing future visions/information?2. Why these specific details:   \\\\- Why reveal this information in children's books?   \\\\- Why focus on these particular future events?   \\\\- Were there other predictions in his other works?While I have to maintain scientific skepticism, your theory does provide an interesting potential explanation for the numerous specific coincidences.

Political suicide. Nobody would say they dont want to help the poor. But base that help on race? Now we are divided, and nobody gets help.

A lot of the talk was focused on two things: first, how the left can more effectively populate the new media ecosystem especially podcasts, YouTube and TikTok with shows that have a more progressive lean. The idea is to provide a counter to the right-wing oversaturation of those platforms. Then the primary method proposed was to create content thats not explicitly political but introduces progressive ideas in little normalizing moments, like TV shows have done for generations. So these arent inherently bad ideas. The problem is, I think theyre too late. If were only just now talking about how to take advantage of new media, were not going to catch up to the right wing and loosen its hold on it. If were trying to catch up weve already lost. We need to be looking at whats on the horizon  what comes *after* podcasts, and YouTube, and TikTok, and how do we plan to get on the ground floor of those arenas? Im also skeptical that we can accomplish that goal via entertainment-focused content that subtly nudges people towards not being total shitheads. The right-wing manosphere was partly created as a backlash to the so-called woke media.

Identity politics is easy, in my opinion. We're currently watching people play identity politics with young men, usually young white men, and it's not exactly pretty. Overall, while targeted demographic outreach is needed, I think more inclusive and broad messaging is better for our society. As far as \\"wokeness\\" goes, from my experience with right wing colleagues, I think that a lot of it is just fear of the unknown and changes to the status quo. They're also afraid of indoctrinating children to think purely in terms of privilege hierarchies.   \\n  \\nThere is an aspect that I kind of agree with them on though, and that's the potential for a slippery slope into greater cancel culture (which frankly exists in all directions, not just left). Look at what's happening to Rep. Seth Moulton right now. I don't think that I agree with him, but he's not a crazed anti-trans bigot. Instead of turning on him and alienating potential voters in the coalition, it might help to focus on actual anti-trans right wingers, of which there are many. They're way more numerous and loud and are actively pushing harmful policies and trying to stir up violence. Communities suffering from racism can still have their own prejudices (a lot of anti-Black prejudice in non-white groups). They also tend to be culturally conservative and thus align more with the right (as we're quickly finding out). They might not think much about their demographics hampering them and view mention of it as divisive. As far as I can tell, a lot of Latinos view themselves as white or close to it. Men in these potentially disadvantaged communities might have the same grievances that white men have. Speaking personally as a non-white person, there's definitely a brand of \\"wokeness\\" that annoys me as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoys a lot of people here as well. It's \\"corporate woke-ism.\\" This kind has been pretty hilariously and incisively parodied on South Park (Pander Stone) and The Boys (Brave Maeve's Inclusive Kingdom, I'm laughing just typing that out and proofreading what I wrote). It's essentially bare minimum signs of \\"support\\" while doing nothing to actually help disadvantage communities. Disney tends to do this a lot. I've heard complaints from LGBT that Disney will have one word of dialogue or background shot that's LGBT and then call it a day and pat themselves on the back (can confirm in both Onward and Star Wars IX).

And what a shock those countries are incredibly non-competitive. It is a culture of lying about your credentials and not appointing roles based on merit.

The whole point of removing the Gaza settlements was to make Israel safer while not expending as much defending them. Now that 10/7 happened Israel is regretful at removing them. Remember, for Israelis, the settlements serve as a buffer and screen for those living in Israel proper, even if they do not agree with the purpose of them at times. The Cabinet which removed the Settlements was right wing, but it was far different from the current one. It was still trying to pursue a peace settlement and the goals of the Oslo Accords. The predecessor parties to the settler parties were actually banned for racial encitment at the time, and Fatah too cracked down on Hamas at the time. Now those settler parties who follow Kahanism are in power. They have been unashamed over their policies towards settlers. So not only is the reason for ending the Gaza settlements discredited, but the current government is much more open to the idea and completely opposed to the idea of a Palestinian state. With Trump in the White House, who previously was very pro-settler and has shown 0 indication he will stop them re-settling Gaza. This may be why the Saudi's have recently soured on Israel.
