Is that right?Because just to give you a super short summary:1. Trump didn't return a bunch of presidential documents. NARA asked for them back and negotiated for about a year until he turned some of them over.2. NARA found a pile of classified documents in the boxes. This freaked them out and they contacted the DOJ.3. The DOJ requested Trump to turn over all classified documents in his posession. He refused.4. The DOJ obtained a court order *requiring* him to turn over documents. He had his aide move some of the boxes into another location, then had his lawyer conduct a search and hand over what she found, stating that this was everything. He askes his aid to delete footage of them moving the boxes.5. The DOJ, knowing he had not complied due to statements of other witnesses was forced to seize the documents and charge trump.You think that is **outrageous on the DOJ?**Some quick rebuttals to your possible complaints:1. Whatabout Joe! Joe Biden immediately informed the DOJ when documents were found at his former office. He complied with all searches voluntarily and the only additional material located was his personal journals which contained material that was classified. Due to a precedent dating back to Ronald Reagan, Joe believed that he was within his rights to keep these and the Republican special prosecutor agreed.2. He psychically declassified them! That isn't how this works. Even if it was, Trump was ordered to hand over documents bearing 'classification markings' meaning that he still obstructed justice. And even if he did psychically declassify them he isn't legally allowed to do so with nuclear secrets. Those are classified under statute from congress and Trump had them in his possession when they were taken.The fact that you honestly try to argue that it is outrageous for trump to be charged for such a blatant crime is profoundly sad.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Showing the Donald for the cuckold he is","title":"Russian State TV Airs Melania Trump's Nudes on Prime Time"},{"text":"Isnt the average tenure of trumps cabinet like 10 days?","title":"Tucker Carlson angrily accuses Senate Republicans of plotting coup against Trump"},{"text":"I'd say it's a relief that the blackmail is out and Trump isn't under Putin's foot anymore... but I know there's no way he would be blackmailed for his wife's benefit.","title":"Russian State TV Airs Melania Trump's Nudes on Prime Time"},{"text":"If a R vacancy opens up in a solid blue state with a D governor, we need to slowwalk it as much as possible","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 9, 2024"},{"text":"White women are 100% more racist than white men.

Trump being elected is worse, we will survive it, but it will be hard and will set us back a decade.  History will judge us in the future by how we treated the old, the poor and the working class.  They are never going to say we treated the rich badly.  In every instant the Republicans steal from the poor to fund the rich it never fails and is their matra.

I never questioned it until this years totals came out.  But one person brought up a point that I didn't realize that made so much sense to me.  Last election during the brunt of Covid, the government sent out a mail in ballot to every single authorized voter regardless if it was requested or not.  It was made easy to fill it out quick and mail back.  So many more Democrat voters than otherwise would take the time to actually go and vote in person (which I think those people should be excluded because they don't seem serious)... There seems to be a majority popular vote for Democrats but they can't get these missing people to go in and vote. Now when it comes to inflation.  The reason why most people don't realize the annual inflation rate has regressed back to 2.3% is because the overall cost is still high from the previous years of high inflation.  Now if you are investing in the stock market, then you realise what rate inflation is.  Inflation rates are cumulative on costs to regular goods. Grocery prices are still high even though inflation have cooled.

That's when the employees of what's known as the \\"Internet Research Agency\\" first came to the U.S. to gather the material that they would later use in their elaborate interference campaign.\\n- By the end of 2016, the Russians had set up fake social media accounts that reached millions of voters aimed at promoting Trump or dividing Americans.\\n- The Mueller report lays out how the Russian interference campaign ensnared real American political operatives, including the Trump campaign and its allies.\\n- For more than 100 pages, Robert Mueller lays out scores of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign or the Trump presidency.\\n- According to the report, Russian agents also posed as American citizens and tried to communicate with the Trump campaign to ask them for assistance. \\n- Despite the reports conclusion, Mueller writes that, \\"there were numerous links between the campaign and the Russians, that several people connected to the campaign lied to his team and tried to obstruct their investigation into their contacts with the Russians.\\"\\n- WikiLeaks contacted the Russians privately on Twitter, saying: \\"If you have anything Hillary-related, we want it in the next two days preferable.\\" And then, on July 22, three days before the Democratic National Convention began, WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 emails and other stolen documents. It was a clear attempt to embarrass Clinton and weaken her candidacy.\\n- In 2013, Donald Trump takes his Miss Universe Pageant to Moscow. The Mueller report points out, this is how the Trumps got to know Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire and ally of Vladimir Putin. He owned the event hall where the pageant was held.\\n- Things start moving pretty quickly. Within a few months, Donald Trump Jr. signs a preliminary agreement with Agalarov's company to build a big Trump Tower property in Moscow. Trump announces his run for presidency in 2015.\\n- Mueller points out that, three months later, a new effort to build the Trump Tower in Moscow begins, this time led by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, and developer Felix Sater.\\n- Meanwhile, Felix Sater tells Michael Cohen he's working with high-level Russian officials. He emails Cohen, saying, \\"Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this.\\"\\n- The Moscow Trump Tower project is just one source of Russian contacts. Mueller outlines about a dozen of them in total. They vary widely.\\n- Campaign aide Carter Page meets with Russians and gives a speech in Russia. \\n- Michael Flynn gives speeches in Russia and has numerous contacts with the Russian ambassador, including a discussion of softening sanctions.\\n- Foreign policy and national security adviser, Jeff Sessions, also meets with the Russian ambassador.    \\n- Campaign chairman Paul Manafort regularly shares internal polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.\\n- Fellow Trump aide George Papadopoulos repeatedly meets with a different man connected to Russian intelligence, who tells Papadopoulos the Russians have dirt on Hillary Clinton.\\n- Another contact point was the infamous New York Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. That morning, Donald Trump Jr. tells colleagues he has a lead on negative information about Hillary Clinton. Russians pitched the meeting to Trump Jr., claiming they had dirt on Clinton. Trump Jr. responds, \\"If it's what you say, I love it.\\"\\n- On Page 77, Mueller writes: \\"The acting attorney general appointed a special counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting the president to state that it was the end of his presidency.\\"\\n- The Washington Post revealed that the president is under investigation for obstruction of justice. According to Mueller, three days later, President Trump tells White House counsel Don McGahn to call acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to say Mueller has conflicts and can't serve anymore. The president says Mueller has to go. McGahn doesn't comply.\\n- Mueller outlines in the report that Trump was found to have obstructed justice at least ten times\\n- Mueller chose not to indict due to the DOJ and Bill Barr's insistence that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\\n- Another serious charge about the president is that he tried to block Mueller from investigating him or his campaign.\\n- On page 89, Mueller writes: \\"Substantial evidence indicates the attempts to remove the special counsel were linked to investigations of the president's conduct.\\"\\n- On Page 97, \\"Substantial evidence indicates that the president's effort to limit the special counsel's investigation was intended to prevent further scrutiny of the president's and his campaign's conduct.\\"\\n- the investigation led to the indictments of 34 individuals\\n- Trump's campaign staff presented themselves as \\"attractive counterintelligence vulnerabilities\\"\\n- The steel dossier had nothing to do with Mueller's findings. In fact, the first probe began prior to the steele dossier being released and the investigation began in response to Russian cyber attacks on the DNC (find her emails!), and intel describing a Russian plot to reach out to the Trump campaign and provide information on Clinton.\\n- Trump encouraged Russia on national TV to engage in cyber attacks against Democrats. \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\\"\\n- within five hours of candidate Trump saying those words, Russians largest foreign intelligence service targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time\\n- Both Rick Gates and Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI \\n- Roger Stone was charged with obstructing and lying to Congress about his contacts and the release of documents stolen by the Russians.","title":"Russian State TV Airs Melania Trump's Nudes on Prime Time"},{"text":"It doesn't say that.

And that was while Biden was in charge. It isn't going to go away so long as the left continue to feel morally superior. They need shoving back in their place. They're getting way too big for the boot as we say over here. I remember one of my partners friends coming out as non-binary a few years back, then completely blowing up on me when I refused to call her a he and pointed out that every selfie she took included at least a third of her DD cleavage in it. She believed that she 'felt' like a man, but couldn't relate to anything I could as a real, biological man. She said some of the most vile things ever to me, simply for trying to ground her back to reality, such as telling me she hoped I became infertile so that I wouldn't 'create anymore hateful idiots'.One of my other friends messaged me shortly after the election saying how he was annoyed at Trump voters being so hateful. I asked him what he meant, to which he said he was annoyed with 'sweaty men' deciding abortion rights. When I pointed out that generalizing every pro-lifer as a 'sweaty man' was hateful in and of itself, he had nothing to say. Not even an apology.So nah, these people can be ridiculed for all I care...

I personally like French TV news the best - theres a general lack of hysteria thats so refreshing to an American. You really cant see the games until you read all the media (like you said), and even then, if you have personal sources, you can see that its just plain made up babbling half the time. There might be a tiny grain of truth hidden in the puzzle, sometimes. They really prey on emotion and bank on people having no clue, especially about finance. Thats where I see either journalists making unbelievable mistakes or deliberate lies the most. They misrepresent business practices a lot, too, trying to frame certain things as unethical while excusing other things as standard or acceptable. It never makes sense until you step back and consider who might be influencing them or what their agenda might be. Sometimes I think some journalists are genuinely just dumb with math, though. What blows my mind is the inflammatory headlines versus the information in the actual article. I read one that said Trump was a human trafficker in the headline, and the two quotes about him in the article were that *he drank Diet Coke and was always a gentleman.* That was the only mention of him at all! ??It happens on every topic, not trying to be partisan, but that was the most egregious example Ive ever seen. Another thing is to *never, ever* read a media summarization of a press conference, hearing, trial, interview, etc. Watch the whole thing or assume what youve been told is a lie. I got duped by the RFK, Jr. eating a dog thing, too, so even pictures lie! You can find the truth in whats *not* reported, and by having your own sources on the ground. I knew the Aurora thing was true because I am the one taking tenant calls and emails about how scared they are. Just talking to a lot of people will give you a greater picture of the truth, in general. Using your own powers of observation tells the story, too. For example, you can know to take crime statistics with a grain of salt when youve been robbed a couple times and dont bother to call the cops because they dont respond, or you see crimes happen all the time. I see drug deals constantly and no one is narcing on them, but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Everyone is capable of breaking from the mind control, but I think a lot of people are way too comfortable taking direction from authority figures. They dont trust themselves to do independent thinking. And it is frustrating to live with awareness, but it cant be worse than being in a cult of red or blue.","title":"This is what happens when you are propagandized by the lies of legacy media nonstop day and night, year after year, and you believe every word of it."},{"text":"Honestly the super rich have done great in the last four years.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe.Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?

And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot them down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several.occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump is severely ignorant of how NATO works.in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Still not understanding that the funding benchmark has to do with each individual country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\"NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump and Vance campaigned on the idea of caving into Putin's demands. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, la-dee-frickin-da. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war would have never happened. Not only is that an egregiously false and delusional hypothetical, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place.Trump sees his relationship with Putin as mutually beneficial. The reality is, Trump is Putin's favorite useful idiot. Any of Trump's future \\"negotiations\\" with Putin will be so only in name, instead, it will be more accurate to call it capitulation.With this kind of record, there's no telling what Trump will do to empower Putin and his autocratic, warmongering agenda in the future.Putin couldn't be happier that he has a compliant ally back in the White House, which is unnerving for a lot of reasons, but what gets me most of all, is the simple fact that Putin is an enemy to the United States. He's made a career out of demonizing the West and trying to cripple our alliances and geopolitical positions. And Donald Trump is the perfect tool to help him see his goals and ambitions come to fruition.","title":"Russian State TV Airs Melania Trump's Nudes on Prime Time"},{"text":"Erm, the quote does not say the part where you claimed there's nothing unjust in employer/employee relationship, so it's not exactly what you said.  Anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists. Employer/employee relationships are predicated upon who has access to capital. Unless capital availability is truly egalitarian, those relationships will always trend toward an unjust hierarchy. Those capitalists will bequeath their riches to their children, who have no business being at the top of said hierarchy if it were 'just'. You've got the right idea, you just haven't played it all the way out. The only way anarcho-capitalism can justify itself as anarchist is by post-hoc justifying the uneven distribution of capital among people entering the workforce. It's like you're starting with the assumption 'capital hoarding is good', and you're using anarchism to retroactively justify it.","title":"CMV: the political compass should be a diamond (rotated 45 degrees)"},{"text":"The President cannot dump the VP.

Nobody has ultimate power in the United States government. The President is definitely the most powerful individual in the US government but he doesn't have infinite power to do anything, and in fact in some ways is quite constrained. The president isn't a legislator in any way, for example, and anything he does needs to be authorized by some law or other.In practice this means that Trump has pretty low ability to fuck with the core elements of American democracy. He can make terrible policy, of course, but only terrible policy within the ordinary space of policy. He can't abolish elections or anything like that. He has rid his administration of anyone who would stand against him and stacked it with loyalistsEvery administration replaces opposing political appointees with their own. Last time around proved that Trump is bad enough at this (or just a repugnant enough person to be around) that even people he appoints specifically to be loyal to him are often not. So I wouldn't even count on this for political appointees.As for non-political appointees, Jerome Powell (head of the Fed) has openly said that he doesn't think the President has the legal authority to fire him and if Trump tries he'll just refuse. So like, if he tries shenanigans there's gonna be way more of a fight than you think.  he has the house, he has the senate,He has the house by at most a few votes, and it's still possible at this point that he doesn't have it at all. Right now it's looking like maybe 2-3 moderate Republicans could stop legislation if they wanted. (For context, there's [two Republicans that voted to impeach Trump in the incoming House](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4980866-newhouse-valadao-pro-trump-impeachment-republicans-survive-reelection/).) Is that gonna stop bad policy, no, cuz we're still talking about Republicans here. But it would stop anything majorly anti-democratic.And he also only has the Senate by a filibuster-able amount. Not that that necessarily means anything, but they didn't blow up the filibuster last time even when they had the chance. he has the courtsThe Supreme Court and many of the lower courts are mostly Republican, yes, and this has worrying implications but it's not quite as bad as you think. Last time Trump tried to push election denialism through the courts, he got smacked down consistently. Trump actually fails in court all the time, both as a private citizen and last time he was president. They will spend the next four years fortifying the country, its laws and policies in such a way so as to assure that the Democrats are as backfooted as possible in an electionElection laws are mostly set state-by-state. It's in theory possible for Congress to make laws about elections, but it would be very unprecedented for Congress to do this explicitly to give one party an advantage. And see above: they'd have to get it past an extremely narrow House majority if they even have one at all, and then past a fairly narrow Senate and filibusterable Senate majority. And then when someone inevitably sues over it, it'd also have to get through the courts, which again are not necessarily as loyal to Trump as an individual as you might think.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Ill be honest, the only place I see consistent propaganda is this sub recently.

The left are economic libertarians, because we want to remove the authority of the bosses. The economic right wants to maintain the authority of the bosses, and are therefore economic authoritarians. You wouldn't say that someone in the 1860s who was for \\"states' rights (to keep slaves)\\" was a libertarian, right? Even though they're framing their argument in terms of property rights, in practice they're arguing to maintain their own unjust authority.

They can't bring their phones or personal computers in. They can't bring any classified documents out. The computers that hold these documents are not connected to the internet. Even the janitors might hold clearances, or have FBI background checks, or have to be monitored at all times by security staff.The reason it's illegal to remove classified documents from these facilities, even if you don't try to sell them to a foreign state, is that they're totally insecure outside of these facilities.

Depending on what they find they might reach out to other states and have them investigate the same issues.   If it is found to be a recurring problem in multiple states, especially swing states; then the results of the election will likely be overturned.After that happens, there will be a recount, and depending on how badly the ballots were messed up there may even be runoff elections in certain states.  This recount and runoff election will be overseen by the DOJ most likely, and more shenanigans will probably result in instant jail time for those committing shenanigans.There will also likely be an investigation into who was involved in the entire scheme, and depending on how far this whole thing reaches and how involved certain parties are, and whether or not it also involves foreign parties; the end result will differ.  If foreign parties were not involved then there may be various charges of fraud, electoral interference, vote manipulation, and a variety of other charges that will be decided on a case by case basis.  if those involved in the scheme financially or politically benefited from the situation, then they could have their assets and seized and be charged with various crimes related to that.\\nIf foreign parties were involved in what happened and were aided and abetted by parties from within the United States, that is when the charges escalate to full-blown treason amongst other things.  Fun fact, if you are actually charged with treason, even if you are not convicted, you can never run for office or hold a political office in the United States ever.

It is very well known that MAGAts are bigots at their very core. Bigotry is literally the only platform GQP/MAGAts have been ran on since 2015, when tRump made it OK for all of them to go full white-hoods off and have been extremely vocal about it. At least in the 2016 election the GQP at least came up with some lies about having political plans. But these last two elections were only about tRump trying to find a way to avoid prison, where he should be right fucking now for his treasonous actions after the 2020 election, for trying to intimidate the Georgia's Secretary of State to call their electorals for him, and also for when he sent his cultists to attack our Capitol and tried to overturn the election. The second is to attack and steal Rights away from anyone who isn't a straight white christian man. But I digress, it's clear as day that MAGAts are racist PoS, but this man truly thought he'd get a free pass if he sided with the leopards. But only now, that the leopards have begun to eat his face, he's starting to regret it. I'd tell him to find someone that will give a fuck, but he's not going to find anyone, from either side, who will have any sympathy for him or his family. My advice, he should tell his kids to come up with some imagery friends to play with, all because daddy thought it would be a great idea to side with the racists. And if anyone thinks my opinion is too harsh on his kids,  then maybe someone should tell them to view this experience as a life lesson that fascists don't make good friends/allies. ??","title":"Latino MAGA regrets voting Donald Trump; \\"They (Trump supporters) don't want to play with my kids in my neighborhood\\""},{"text":"The U.S. should not back student loans and the colleges should be forced to reimburse the U.S. for all delinquent and defaulted loans that exist.

I am not saying that Biden could have won, as he was quite behind in the polls, but he had won once against Trump and might have made a comeback, who knows ? It was still months before the election, after all. But if the Democratic Party thought the situation was dire enough to justify backstabbing their own candidate and president and force him to drop out, they should have put instead a candidate that was good enough to be guaranteed to win against Trump, and Kamala Harris was not that candidate. If they were ruthless enough to tell Joe Biden to get lost, they should have been ruthless enough to tell Kamala Harris to get lost too.

And a whole lot of finger pointing at virtually every demographic. Taking a step back from everything, is it really that difficult to notice? We are the leopards eating faces as well. So far ive seen the following demographics get blamed for this election loss:? Muslims in Michigan? Latinos? GenX men? GenZ as a whole? GenZ men? White men? Progressive voters? Establishment politicians? Progressive politiciansI get that people are trying to understand what exactly went wrong here. But imagine you are any of these demographics, have felt wronged by the Democratic Party, and then see these threads where everyone is pointing fingers right at you for not understanding the impact of what they've done. I think the very simple reality here is a lot of voters and the average IQ of the US isn't as high as we like to think it is. Not everyone is living thinking about how their actions can impact others that have no representation in their life. They care about very little things in the grand picture, but to them they aren't little.In the 2016, 2020 and 2024, Dems lauded their campaign about unity. I was a very strong Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016, and when they did him dirty and then turned around and expected his votes by declaring this is about uniting, it turned off a lot of people. It is no surprise at all that this happened, frankly. It is like if you spam unity enough, people think it's real? I can guarantee you the Arab-Americans in Michigan people are saying cost the election aren't seeing this stuff and thinking \\"Ah nuts i really messed up this time.\\" They're thinking that they have been swept under the rug and given the virtue signalling treatment. Because they have been. There's a lot of necessary introspection here and getting to the bottom of what went wrong, but I don't think nearly enough of the people on here are really understanding that doing what they're doing validates the hollow words of the Democratic Party, that as soon as they lose they go knives out for these populations? The ones that Dems pandered and told to trust them, they are the unity party? It is poor taste, and I would not be surprised if it permanently turns some of these demographics away. A simple fact is you could be an Arab-American living in Michigan who voted for Harris.

Charismatic Authority: Trumps appeal is heavily based on his strong, confident persona, which resonates deeply with his followers. Much like a cult leader, he often presents himself as a figure who alone has the solutions, inspiring intense personal loyalty that often goes beyond policy.2.) Us vs. Them Mentality: Cults frequently foster a strong divide between insiders (the enlightened followers) and outsiders (those who are seen as threats or unenlightened). Trump has often created a similar dynamic, labeling his critics as enemies and encouraging followers to see the media, Democrats, and other groups as hostile forces.3.) Distrust of Outside Sources: Cult leaders frequently discourage followers from listening to outsiders or the mainstream media, reinforcing that only the leader can provide truth. Trump has often claimed that mainstream media is fake news, encouraging his base to rely on him and select news sources he endorses.4.) Demand for Absolute Loyalty: Like many cult leaders, Trump has often displayed a tendency to reward unwavering loyalty and criticize or marginalize those who question or disagree with him. His public clashes with former aides, staff, and Republican leaders who dissented reflect this focus on loyalty.5.)Persecution Complex: Cults often cultivate a sense of persecution, emphasizing that they are misunderstood or targeted unfairly. Trump has consistently portrayed himself and his supporters as victims of a witch hunt, which strengthens group solidarity by creating a shared sense of grievance.6.) Simple, Repeated Messaging: Cult leaders frequently use repetitive, simple slogans or phrases to reinforce loyalty and create a sense of unity. Trumps slogans like Make America Great Again and his frequent use of direct, memorable catchphrases help maintain focus and coherence among his base.7.) Cult of Personality: Many of Trumps followers admire him on a personal level, sometimes valuing his identity more than specific policies. This personality-centered loyalty is similar to cult dynamics, where the leaders personality becomes the central focus of the groups beliefs and values.","title":"What made MAGA so much like a cult compared to supporters of past republican candidates?"},{"text":"And meet his good friends, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.","title":"Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump"},{"text":"Hopefully he'll whisper something in Trump's ear then hand him a one way ticket to Russia.","title":"President-elect Trump has accepted President Biden's invitation to an Oval Office meeting next week"},{"text":"According to the fight manifest Trump rode on the plane from West Palm Beach Florida to his property in NJ.

Somebody on either blue sky or Twitter I can't remember which one mentioned something about it was weird because the discrepancy between the North Carolina governor's race in the President's races is so wide and why is that That's it's strange. Spoiler alert it's not strange it's within the two to 4% difference that they're usually is in North Carolina. But when I added the total of all the votes counted for the presidential race All the minor parties Democrat and Republican and then I tabulated all the votes for the House of Representatives there is a huge discrepancy of 566,000 votes. Now I thought that was odd so I decided to go back and look it up and do some research. In North Carolina the prior 7 elections from 1996 to 2020 the difference between House of Representative vote totals and the president vote totals was around 2.5%. This election it's 10.08%. And the only reason I stopped at 96 is because I couldn't find the information for the House of Representatives in a digestible way prior to 1996. I had to start going through PDFs from North Carolina's website and hand tabulating data and I wasn't going to do all that.I then decided to look at other states and I found that Pennsylvania is the same thing as well.  Pennsylvania has 556,000 more presidential votes then they do votes for the House of Representatives or 8.02%. and in the last four elections the House of Representative vote totals was an average of 3.5% difference. So still double what it would normally be. Now I don't know what this means, But it was really odd. Because I checked all the other swings states and and it's not the case in any of the other swing states and then I just checked some random states and it's not in those states either.

In his short term in office so far this is just a very basic break down of the good and bad...The Good:* Fiscal Surplus: Turned a primary deficit of 2.9% of GDP into a surplus of 1.5% through austerity measures.\\n* Market Confidence: S&amp;P Merval stock index hit record highs; sovereign bonds gained value.\\n* Inflation Reduction: Monthly inflation dropped from 25% in December 2023 to 3.5% by September 2024.The Bad* Increased Poverty: Poverty rose from 42% to 53%; extreme poverty climbed from 11.9% to 18.1%.\\n* Recession: GDP projected to shrink by 3.8% in 2024.\\n* Social Unrest: Austerity measures led to strikes and protests.And he is following Trump's plans to the T, so this is a pretty good indicator of what is ahead.  Trump and Elon will drastically slash Government spending while simultaneously cutting taxes for the rich who don't need it, plus the wild card of mass deportations will cause massive ripples in the economy.  Remember when Elon told us to prepare for hardships ahead, this is what he is talking about, its happening in Argentina.  And the sad thing is we could have all the good and none of the bad if we simply raised taxes on the ultra wealthy, gone after price gougers, shored up the IRS more to go after rich tax cheats, and used government regulation to make temporary price controls on essentials goods and services like food, energy, medicine, etc.  But of course if you even suggest that your a socialist commie Marxist.

Like many manipulation schemes. Epstein &amp; others; like the person in the news currently arrested, have complex schemes for maximum impact. Yes the Epstein flights with all the alleged sexual activity present. The parties with the sexual activity &amp; worse. Videoed &amp; banked for future blackmail &amp; nudge purposes. But it is very naive thinking only that all the social get-togethers &amp; flights were about illegal sexual activity taking place &amp; being recorded. Such operations have to also establish themselves as a desirable ordinary social event, attended by the most important people. Where nothing untoward occurs. So to fit the marks social standing or wish for social standing. From these ordinary social events it is possible to entice from the targeted person their trust or secret sexual desires or weaknesses. Then in due course they get invited to the  real special parties or air flights.  Then capture your targets illicit activities on video. You have power over them to do your will or fund any organisation you name. Or make speeches about any topic the blackmailer directs. So, not all names/persons associated with Epstein or the current person arrested will have taken flights where illicit or illegal activities took place. Not all names/persons will have known of or participated in illicit or illegal activity. If every single flight or social event was just an orgy. It would soon become known. No doubt would find plenty of attendees. But not the wise or cautious people keen to protect their reputations. Nor the innocent. So would not capture their target person for blackmail or nudge purposes. Nor would it capture the innocent person, who has no interest in participating in the corrupt activities. The ones who have to be drugged then set up to look like participating in illegal activity.  The difficult job for law enforcement &amp; prosecutors is going to be sorting the everyday attendee/passenger of a ordinary party/flight from those targeted &amp; attending the events/flights where sexual crimes or worse were committed.","title":"\\"Trump is on the Epstein List\\" Meanwhile Trump and his staff.

Sure, he says some batshit crazy things, but he's not afraid to do it.  Harris (and Hilary Clinton) would not.  Everything was a careful orchestration of soft questions.Look at the immense popularity of Obama and Bill Clinton.  They interviewed and came across as real people, and not as party puppets.I had this insight when watching Bush 2.0 vs Kerry in 2004.  Bush was doing a quick interview at Camp David.  He was wearing jeans that were broken in.  His dogs ran up to him to greet him.  Same news clip, Kerry appears in public as the \\"common man\\" wearing jeans that look like they came right off the shelf.  The jeans were riding like you might fit trousers for a suit.  One guy looked out of touch, and the other looked real.Personally, this shouldn't matter, but a whole lot of people aren't voting based on policies, but merely on trust.  People trust based on appearances, for right or wrong.  It worked very well for Obama, Clinton, Reagan.  It worked poorly for Hilary, Harris, Kerry, Mondale, Bush senior (who did have other things going for him though).Remember the \\"get out and vote\\" drives, \\"it doesn't matter who you vote for, just vote\\".  This is what you get.Trump may be out of touch from the daily lives of the common man, but he admits it.  When he says the system is rigged he admits it benefits him.  Not so for the Democratic Party elite -- like Nancy Pelosi for instance.Overall, I think what's going on is that the Dems are acting like they have a mandate from the people, but they forgot to bring the people along.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"And yet they cant stop promoting alumnus Cardi B","title":"J.D.

E.g. a trans womans gender is woman. I dont view intersex as an actual sex or gender, but rather a term to express that the sex of a person cannot be properly defined. Similarly, I dont view e.g. non-binary, gender-fluid, etc., as genders. It doesnt mean I dont acknowledge the underlying meaning of these terms, but I just think they should be encapsulated under a third category rather than the gender category.","title":"After Trump wins on a campaign rife with anti-trans ads, LGBTQ people flood crisis hotlines"},{"text":"Cringing over we the people.","title":"Why is Trump offering to pay off the Democrat's debt?"},{"text":"Open white supremacist and mixed race dudebro beefing?

The idea that hell push austerity is far fetched to me because he gauges success by how the stock market does. His mandate is to fix the economy; deporting millions of non-documented immigrants will hamper agriculture and the service industry significantly.

The more ambitious the idea is, the more likely it will be enjoined by the courts.

I think being a far right conservative is an ideology border-lining on being a religion. We had our prophets in Bill OReilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Anne Coulter and Glen Beck, but wed always talk about how we needed a voice for our movement, what I now realize is by voice we meant messiah. Thank god I came to my senses before that messiah came down the escalator. Previous Republican candidates were conservative, sometimes extremely conservative, but they all still subscribed to the idea of post-WW2 neo-liberalism, they all still believed it was Americas responsibility to lead the free world through economics and trade instead of fear and brutality like the empires of old.

Jobs paying almost nothing more? The complete lack of ability to train up to a new job without a massive monetary investment? That is ALL democrats should have been talking about, but they had to glaze over them because Biden was in power at the time and as far as your average American is concerned, he wasn't doing shit about it. Blame Joe Manchin, but at the end of the day republicans played that one perfectly. Everything else was completely stupid to focus on. As sad as it is, the vast majority of americans don't care about LGBTQ issues. Most people don't care about the Gaza Vs Israeli war. Ukraine was a fun one to rally around at first, but after a few months? Not a care in the world. Not when rent is 1600 and you keep shoveling billions over to Israel and Ukraine instead of finding some way to take that earmarked military budget and improve American lives instead. Then there was the golden child of the abortion issue. Everyone thought FOR SURE this was the nail to the trump coffin. Turns out, most people don't give a shit about this either. At least not enough to pick it over economy. Ask them what they think and of course they will outrage about people dying trying to find an ER that will abort and they absolutely think women should have a right to choose. They will rant all day about it. Behind the scenes though? only around 25% of women get an abortion in their lifetimes, and a lot of them live in a blue state or a red state that passed protections. Combine those abortion rates with the women not living in abortion banned states, and you have over 75% of people who \\"*won't happen to me!*\\" and have far more pressing things to worry about, like having a kid of their own when it's near impossible to pay for raising one. Meanwhile Trump is pulling the \\"I'm kinda pro abortion so don't worry about it\\" for those freaking out that it might get banned federally. Trump won because most of his chaotic ramblings were about the economy. About how bad things are. And despite record numbers across the board, most people still see the economy as a clusterfuck and will of course blame the current admin even though this is all leftover from the pandemic and trump giving his buddies a massive tax cut. **In the end, this doesn't matter at all.** All he did was talk about ways of fixing this. The one thing our greedy little lizard brains want. *\\"Get rid of immigrants! Remember when 1 million people died during the pandemic and wages spiked because companies couldn't find anyone to hire?

Im not even a scientist, but as someone whos apart of this community, i made the choice to understand all of it better. Gender is a social construct. It's no different than respecting a person's name or title. Sure, we have sexual organs that we've classified into two sexes, male and female, but we made those terms and used them to describe stuff. But there are surgeries and hormones that can be taken to at least change the outside of a person's gender identity. Obsessing over the biological sex of someone is fucking dumb and pointless. No one is magically changing their sex nor do they have to, to be a guy or a woman. Mention that intersex people exist to a conservative and watch their mind implode as they try to justify their blatant transphobia.As far as everyone else goes, diverse sexuality is common in many species outside of humans, penguins, lions, giraffes, etc. And there's a ton of science and theories and different factors that explain why it's like that. In penguins same sex couples will often adopt the babies of other penguins that have rejected them. Ultimately contributing to the preservation of their species. Sounds familiar with what some gay human couples do no? At least in spaces where they can adopt that is.There's also the fact that some children, while in the womb, can be exposed to different chemicals that affect sexuality. There's a higher chance of having a Queer kid with every child a mother has. That's just the biological part of it. Our unique experiences, upbringing, and exposure to new and different things can also contribute to forming our identity, which in turn forms our sexuality. At the end of the day, it's natural, and it's a part of nature to be the way we are. Conservatives and fascists could eradicate every LGBTQ person on Earth, and yet it still wouldn't erase us because more and more LGBTQ people would be born every day regardless of what they do. It's impossible to stop it without a mass extinction of the human race. You can take away our rights, our knowledge, and science, but they can never take away our constant existence.","title":"After Trump wins on a campaign rife with anti-trans ads, LGBTQ people flood crisis hotlines"},{"text":"Good work!Im just hoping the mail in ballots skew left leaning as they did in the past Lets hope!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 9, 2024"},{"text":"And he said \\"I have concepts of a plan\\" during the first debate.
