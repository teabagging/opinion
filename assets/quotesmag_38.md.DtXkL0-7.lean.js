Charges that racism propelled voters to Donald Trump are at odds with the rightward swing among Black and Hispanic voters, and with a raft of data showing that racial prejudice is in steady decline among Americans of all political stripes.\\nInstead, the data shows Democrats taking a sharp turn leftward on social issues over the past decade. This has distanced them from the median voter, just as Wrights cartoon depicted. We see this not only in Democratic voters self-reported ideology, but in their views on issues including immigration and whether or not minorities need extra help to succeed in society. Notably, the shift began in 2016. This suggests that Trumps election radicalised the left, not the right.","title":"Trump broke the Democrats thermostat"},{"text":"This is why Trump won.

One of my favorite sayings that I have heard in sociology about humans are that, rarely are people good or evil typically, we are all just grey and do good and evil things.You mention that Dumbledore makes a disparaging comment about Voldemort, understanding nothing, while pointing out that it is not possible for that to actually be the case this is a prime depiction of human nature because humans quite often overgeneralize, rationalize, and exaggerate when it comes to defending their own positions, logic, thoughts, feelings, and/or emotions because its what we as humans do. We see others do it, we do it ourselves (often times being too late to stop ourselves until we do some self reflection), etc.You can see Dumbledore is wrong as a reader, but *he cant* and makes decisions that are flawed and imperfect, same with Snape. The characters all have their own motivations, excuses, goals, and preferences and they all try to accomplish these in ways that all have varying levels of effectiveness.To wrap up, your comment seems like you are frustrated because characters are illogical and make decisions that may not 100% favor them for motivations that, to you, dont seem worth it or dont seem to make sense however; that, in my opinion, *perfectly* emulates human nature to a T.","title":"CMV: Harry Potter depicts human nature poorly"},{"text":"I think mostly because the Me Too and Black Lives Matters protests are heterogeneous movements, whereas in Europe raising the retirement age is homogeneous in that it affects all.

I was browsing reddit on my phone to kill time. I posted on this subreddit a few days ago and was reading the replies. Now the woman must have been looking at my screen because she got really angry when she saw what subreddit I was using. She called me a loser and a weirdo for using this incel subreddit. I told her to mind her own business but of course she didnt listen. She literally demanded that I stop scrolling through the subreddit otherwise shell report me for harassing her and being a misogynist. Of course I hadnt harrased her in any way but we all know whose word would be believed. This time I tried ignoring her as I thought talking to her was a waste of time but I guess my silence angered her a lot and she tried snatching my phone. When that failed, she tried punching and hitting me. The train was pretty full but people were just casually watching as this woman assaulted me. And when I gently pushed the woman away in self defense, some white knights stepped in to help her and beat me. I had to get out at the next station as being in that train was unbearable with all the stares I was getting and the people acting as if I was some sort of a criminal. You see these type of femcels on reddit and think these clowns are only present on social media but the reality is that they exist all around us and act just as crazy in real life.

I have been watching this insanity unfold in the US for 8 years and I've been proven right about Trump every step of the way. If elected, he would ultimately destroy America. First up was Covid and the havoc it wreaked on America was not by chance. He lied, obfuscated and completely abdicated his duties as president, before, during and after the virus spread. As a result, Americans died at the highest rate in a century. That was the first shoe to drop and the first major event that vindicated my fears for the fate of this country under a Trump presidency. .Then the unthinkable happened. American's reelected this sick and deranged animal to a 2nd term. They chose the man that botched Covid over the party that actually engineered our recovery from it. By all metrics we had the strongest economic recovery in the world from Covid 19. I'm not going to sit here and hash out Democrat vs. Republican either because you have to be an insane person to think that's an appropriate conversation when option B is Donald F'ing Trump. Without hyperbole, American's from all generation's (Gen Z will save us? LMFAO), elected a Hitler clone pedaling the same fake populist message about the enemy within, but this time without the benefit of an actual depression to point to. What's your excuse America? It turns out we are just a shockingly ignorant, greedy, hateful and misinformed society. We had one chance as a country to choose the better path forward and we refused.  Instead we made the devastating decision to embrace a known felon, rapist, cheater, liar, abuser, turncoat, fascist, the list goes on and on and on...So this is what we are now. It wasn't an aberration or a fluke. Donald Trump represents 21st century America and we're going wherever he decides to take us.  And as someone who was desperate for Americans to wake up before it was too late, only to see them make a conscious decision to reelect Donald and effectively make him a king , I am praying that the chaos and destruction that is on the horizon does not spare a single Trump supporter. I truly hope they get to experience firsthand the effect of the choice they made on 11/5. That's what I'll be rooting for moving forward.

And thus they have the ability to shape the general perception of reality for a lot of people. Even if those people aren't actively tuning in to CNN every night or something, when they Google a topic and see several results from mainstream sources they will assume that must be true, or they may watch an online clip from a show on one of these networks and assume it's just saying what is true.Thus, the fact that the most popular podcasts are more right-leaning or that Twitter is right-leaning by default doesn't invalidate the influence of the Mainstream Media. These sources are the alternative media, and are popular in part because they offer interesting and satisfying alternative perspectives and narratives to the official one. But many people don't listen to or watch these podcasts and still generally believe the mainstream narratives. And so in that sense it is still \\"Mainstream\\" even if it is less so than it used to be.Now, u could reasonably ask whether, as u mentioned, these Mainstream Media outlets are actually just reporting the truth in a minimally biased way, but since \\"facts have liberal bias\\" it is perceived as Left leaning. Frankly, this is ridiculous though. Idk that the proper term is truly liberal/ left-leaning, but rather the Mainstream Media is clearly and often pushing narratives on behalf of the D.C. establishment, and often for the Democratic Party specifically. For example, it was clear to pretty much everyone that Biden was mentally declining over the past few years and was not fit to be president for another 4 years (nothing to be ashamed of really). But the Mainstream Media covered it up and insisted he was \\"sharp as a tack\\" and was very coherent behind closed doors and so forth. Then immediately upon seeing his poor debate performance the narrative shifted to him being unfit. A true unbiased media would have been reporting on his mental decline throughout in an honest manner. Also, do you not think it's a bit ridiculous to stake a general claim on the prideful presumption that the Mainstream Liberal worldview is just factually correct? There's a 0% chance that all of the facts would always support the liberal point of view- political issues are far too complex for that. The fact that Trump gets something like 95% + negative coverage on these media outlets while Biden/Kamala got like 90% positive coverage really can't logically be explained by just objective factual reporting. Sure Trump is plausibly wrong on some things and if it was more like a 60/40 split for Biden/Kamala then I think u could argue that it was unbiased, but a 90/10 split is ridiculous. Additionally, there are many instances where the truth is actually hard to discern. In these cases, there often emerges a mainstream narrative that may or may not be true but is assumed to be true by those who trust the Mainstream Media. For example, for many months the Mainstream Media (and Fauci) vehemently denied the possibility of Covid-19 coming from the lab in Wuhan, and even called people racist for suggesting it. However, they were clearly in the wrong to ignore the possibility, and now it is accepted as truth. Many podcasts discussed this topic and said that the lab leak theory was plausible, but if those trusting the Mainstream Media were shown that at the time they would have (and have) said things like \\"There's no evidence for that\\" or \\"That's ridiculous\\". If u pointed out that the media was biased for dismissing it they would have likely said that the \\"facts have a liberal bias\\" or something like that. And yet the media was wrong and was clearly biased. So I think it is clear that the Mainstream Media still has influence on many people and often takes positions that are biased.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"They cant close it down.

But in general theres the corporate or mainstream media and it is liberal in the general sense of the term of the liberal ideal of free-press.Then there is partisan media which the cable and TV news and therefore press had become increasingly dominant. This is economic and structural and political - media deregulation creating news not just as a mandated thing for the networks but as a source of profit and investment. Structural - profit seeking means finding your market for news that means you can market yourself as confirmation bias or rage-bait and use political outrage and partisanship as ways to keep a market share. It also means that cheap profitable news stays when budgets are reduced but long non-profitable investigation for prestige is less economically valuable. Political - obviously money interests and political factions have an interest in influencing specific demographics and voting blocks. The media and the political establishment become intwined to the point that you have rich people Trump who just gets to move in media and political circles as if they are all one party, you have politicians at news org or married to people at new orgs etc. Its a big pile of inbreeding and they are all out of touch! (Which is how Trumps rhetoric resonates despite him being one of the ugliest toads in the swamp.)So imo the legacy right wing media is more just an offshoot than anything else. But the radio and internet stuff is more interesting to me. All the cheaper unregulated spaces like radio and internet have brought us back to a yellow-journalism era where everything is partisan and backed by one or another robber Barron to push their views and interests.","title":"CMV: The extent to which the Liberal Media is biased is over exaggerated, and liberal Media is no Longer Mainstream"},{"text":"Its funny the way you say remove fluoride.

But I think its hard to argue that its totally absolutely necessary that the government puts a chemical in public drinking water, despite its benefits for oral health (which is actually better acquired topically via toothpaste than it is to simply ingest fluoridated water and get benefits as it flows by).There are all sorts of its totally, scientifically safe, blah blah blah) but straight up: dont put chemicals in public drinking water other than what is necessary to disinfect and make it safe.

To solve a problem, you must first know and understand its source. MAGA and even the majority of typical Republicans before them went for the easy (but incorrect) answer by scapegoating immigrants and policies put in place to actually help them. So while we might all want the same thing, they refuse to deal with the reality that in such a large country with so many people, resolving these issues isnt simple. They dont have easy to remember, glib, one liner descriptions, because the problems true nature defies such a thing.Too many people want to believe that we can fix everything by going back. The genie of globalism cant be put back in the bottle. You might as well try to take the wetness out water than try to remove globalism from modern life. Were simply too integrated now. In the same way, ideals about small community existence cant handle the reality of large multicultural population centers. I get why people think this way. But its despicable that any leadership in this country has told all these people that they can essentially have their cake and eat it too. Our modern world comes with very real problems that cant be hand waved away. But as long as people are willing to be complicit in their own deception because they dont like the actual answer, were going to be stuck in this ridiculous and dangerous place.My comment is already too long but I feel I should conclude with a concrete example.Something like the EPA. The Industrial Revolution made an agency like the EPA absolutely critical to modern life as well as a few other such agencies. You need dedicated experts to catalog that you shouldnt store chemical x within so many feet of chemical y in your warehouse. Its boring, tedious work, but it helps prevent tragedies like the Beirut explosion from a few years ago. Understanding this isnt all that complicated but it does require a bit of nuance and thought. Something that weve apparently decided as a nation is just too much to ask. Were about to reap the consequences of dumbing everything down to catchy phrases. God help us all.","title":"Here me out..

And perhaps that misperception comes from online politicos talking about scenarios they read, listen to, and debate about so much they assume everyone around them understands what threat is being discussed.There are absolutely real existential threats to our very democracy with trump coming into power surrounded by the worst people you know that have spent years plotting how to maximize one more crack at the WH.  The chance of them succeeding on the most damaging, threatening parts of the schemes is objectively low.  But how cavalier would you be with your life on the line?  Is 5% of death a risk not worth taking steps to avoid? 2%? 1%?  For many that viewed threats to our democracy as THE primary choice in this election, even small chances of huge damage were something worth fighting against.But there's much more to it than democracy dies in the next four years, or nothing ever happens and everyone lied to you.   Hungary is a model for trump and the GOP at large these days.  Hungary still has free elections.  But they are no longer truly fair elections.  Orban has used power to dismantle institutions, neuter the press, stifle dissent, and a host of actions that give him and his allies the ability to use the power of the government to put their finger on the scale.  Could Hungarian voters push through and defeat him? Yes.  But the odds are now stacked in his favor.  And as time goes along, he continues to press on that scale more and more.  You rarely kill mature democracies overnight.  And US is the oldest democracy there is. But you can damage it.  Weaken it.  And you can build into advantages that slowly rot the democracy away.  That part of the threat people were warning you about is not just possible.  I'd argue it's almost certain we're going to see institutional weakening as well as attempts to build systemic advantages into the system everywhere they can.  I'd bet a lot of money we will have an election in 2028.

In his latest book, published this summer ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Hegseth called on Americas next commander in chief to shift the militarys focus  beginning by reverting the Department of Defense to its pre-1947 name, the Department of War.\\n Some of Hegseths writing also appears to echo the virulent rhetoric of white nationalists and Great Replacement theorists, taking particular aim at Islam. During Trumps campaign to return to office, his team courted Muslim voters, many of whom were angry with the Biden administration over its handling of the war in Gaza. In his 2020 book American Crusade, Hegseth fulminates against Muslim birth rates and what he characterizes as the infiltration of American communities by refugees and migrants whom he accuses of leeching off government support. He writes that Islam is not a religion of peace, and it never has been and claims that all modern Muslim countries are either formal or de facto no-go zones for practicing Christians and Jews.\\nIslam, he writes, has been almost entirely captured and leveraged by Islamists.","title":"Trumps Pentagon pick dismissed military diversity, demonized Islam"},{"text":"You put words in my mouth constantly and addressed me throughout with the tenor that Im defending Biden and Obama and theyre the reason the country went to shit lol.

Polling has showed this for years and you can't make them care by losing honorably. You can't believe America is a sexist, racist country (it is) and also think it's a good idea to run a candidate that's a black woman. You either face facts or lose.B) You can't legislate culture. Dems choose identity politics because it means they don't actually have to do anything other then give empty speeches. There's no new law on the books that can stop people from discriminating against blacks or trans people. And even if there was, good luck proving bigotry in court of law. You want to help marginalized groups? Give them material advancement because money means power in the capitalist world. The way a black college professor experiences racism from the cops is different from the way a poor teen does because they have more power to fight back against it. Hate going to be there, it's not going away, but giving marginalized people economic power means it lessens the effect. Tolerance is already winning over the culture among younger generations that's something government can't do.Plus if you are dealing with a bigoted electorate, economic policies helping the lower classes is a way to do good while decreasing divisiveness.

However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VAs direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://web.archive.org/web/20240709101712/https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization. Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap significant cost savings.The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nations administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.","title":"Jasmine Crockett Lays Bare The Stunning Hypocrisy Of Trump's Unqualified Picks"},{"text":"Pushed Biden, KKKamala and any/all Dem politicians to cut off funding and arms to Israel.

In part this is due to a failure to think politically about the issues involved, and to recognize that the ask involved in trans acceptance differs radically from the older LGB demands. While the leave us alone demands enjoy considerable public support, a large number of trans activists have been making the much more intrusive demand that the entire population reconceptualize their gender identity C such that men and women who are accustomed to thinking of themselves as simply men and women must now begin to think of themselves, and in some cases introduce themselves, as cisgendered men and women. Similarly, the new politics of pronouns attempts gives a small segment of the population the power to unilaterally turn every conversation into a Stroop task, in a way that again affects the entire population.This does a good job of articulating why I am of the belief that trans activism = good, trans activists (of the online variety) = idiots (for the most part). Of course, the latter group insists that the former cannot be true because being in agreement with them is the only way one can *truly* be pro-trans.","title":"The Democrats Are Committing Partycide"},{"text":"they're dismantling that. interim boss? eh, elon can be the new kushner and do everything.","title":"RFK Jr condemned as clear and present danger after Trump nomination"},{"text":"Dem politicians have been accepting of the resultsDems on Reddit haven't been","title":"centrist are doing their best to gaslight their users into thinking the democrats are currently accepting the results of the 2024 election."},{"text":"I think its good to think about it and hope Bidens admin can put some mechanisms to help slow down the damage in the next 4 years","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 14, 2024"},{"text":"Pete Buttigieg is masterful at messaging and communicating.

Some doctors will pull that stunt, sure, but you will in all likelihood be able to find a doctor who can prescribe hormones or surgery piecemeal for comorbidities, and they're not trying to deal with the occult rituals required to get insurance to pay for something anymore.  Also, this would now be a country where people aren't being robbed of a great chunk of their paycheck just to have 'insurance' with a deductible running into the thousands of dollars every year.  On average, people would be healthier, wealthier and better catered to, diminishing the risk of certain things being inaccessible to them.

Just look at how unified the Republican Party has been, especially when it comes to loyalty. Around 80-90% of Republican voters consistently support their party, and a significant portion of them will follow Trump almost blindly. It's estimated that around 30-40% of Republicans are loyal to Trump no matter what. That kind of loyalty gives them an edge. And then when Republicans convince a small fractionsay, just 10%of Democrats to switch sides, they win in a landslide. That's what happened.When you start off with a solid base, it makes winning easier.On the flip side, Democrats struggle to get even get close to that much loyalty. If its not Palestine, its something else that divides us, and its making it harder to stay united. I remember when Obama won in 2008, the Democrats controlled everything, but even then, they couldnt pass major legislation like healthcare because the party couldnt agree and Democrats from red states were afraid to vote on it. Compare that to when Trump took officethe Republican Party was almost entirely behind him, which gave him a major advantage in pushing his agenda.Imagine how much easier it would be to win if the Democratic Party had that kind of unwavering loyalty behind them. Im not saying we need a cult around a leader, but the Democrats do need that kind of focus and unity if they want to succeed again. I do think there was more unity in the party during Obama's first election. Even though there were some within the establishment who preferred Hillary, Democrat voters blindly got behind Obama in a way that I didn't see happening Kamala. There simple werent as many issues causing division with Obama or we didn't let issues come forward that would divide us.If Democrats want to win, theyre going to have to build that same kind of loyalty imho or at least something close to it. Without it, I just dont see how they can compete. If we constantly focus on what divides us more than our common ground, I don't see how we can regain control.","title":"Palestine supporters thinking they are about to stick to the Democrats"},{"text":"President Trump is literally putting the Dream Team together!!

Political analysts and junkies have been warning us that a second Trump presidency is likely to bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level of government.Now, if you haven't already, tune into *Behind the Bastards* recent four-part series that examines RFK Jr.'s life and career(s).It really highlights the pathology of the guy, his life long privilege, and his many perversions.One thing id like to call attention to is his involvement in the Samoa measles outbreak. For a taste, here's some information about it:In 2019, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of 83 people, mostly children. What did Kennedy have to do with this? Well, of course he denies any involvement, but he visited the island a few months prior to the outbreak, and at the time, he led the Children's Health Defense organization, basically an anti-vax non profit.His non profit helped spread misinformation pertaining to vaccines that contributed to a decline in measles vaccinations. During his trip to Samoa, he publicly supported prominent anti-vax voices there and by exploiting the power of his last name, lent legitimacy to those voices who were very effective at stoking vaccine hesitancy.Now, prior to 2019, measles wasn't a problem in Samoa, however, in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country temporarily placed its vaccination program on hold, and Kennedy's Children's Health Defense took advantage of the tragedy to raise questions about the safety of the measles vaccine. Consequently the vaccination rate plummeted.As it turns out however, the deaths of the infants had nothing to do with the measles vaccine, and everything to do with tragic human error. Nurses administering the vaccine accidentally mixed it with a muscle relaxant, which is what killed the infants.Kennedy and his non profit did not walk back their statements afterwards, particularly as vaccination rates were dropping rapidly in the region.When he visited the island in 2019before the outbreakhe promoted anti-vaxxers and anti-vax rhetoric. He especially lent credibility to voices there that were still using the deaths of the infants to push a narrative. He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa. She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedys visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.Kennedy claimed that his meeting with Winterstein was just a coincidence, not \\"divinely timed.\\" He eventually admitted however, that his trip to Samoa had been arranged with a popular anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese. The trip was paid for by the CHD. The point of the trip, he insisted, was to discuss with government officials the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoas health officials to assess, in real time, the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health. This would include questioning the value of vaccinations.After the measles outbreak in 2019, the government quickly implemented an emergency vaccination program that was compulsory for the population. Kennedy's anti-vax connections on the island vehemently opposed this measure. The operation was compared to Nazi Germany. Tamasese called it a killing spree. He declared the vaccination operation the greatest crime against our people and suggested the vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak. Tamasese advocated against the use of conventional medicine and antibiotics and urged people to rely on papaya leaf extract and vitamins instead of the vaccine and antibiotics.During this time, Kennedy wrote to the prime Minister, *and he encouraged Samoa officials to examine the measles vaccine to 'determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine.'*Kennedy and these anti-vax voices were pushing the idea that the vaccine itself was responsible for the deaths during the outbreak.The Samoan government declared a state of emergency, and pushed back against prominent anti-vaxxers. Soon after that, Kennedy wrote a blog post for the CHD site that called Tamasese a medical freedom hero. He referred to the 2019 blast of measles in Samoa as merely a mild measles outbreak and praised Tamasese for having infuriated the Global Medical Cartel. He suggested that the vaccine, along with lousy hospital protocols, had caused the deaths. So yah, he's a piece of shit. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. While to this day, he continues to deny his involvement and his responsibility in the Samoa tragedy, and he still spreads this same kind of anti-vax rhetoric around on social media and whenever he gets the opportunity to voice his dangerous, misinformed opinions during right wing broadcast appearances.Again, this is the guy Trump is appointing as secretary of health. Let that sink in. Imagine this scenario I've laid out for you, but on a national scale.Trump and his allies have already outlined a plan to first eliminate the independence of most government agencies, cleanse these agencies of anyone who is not on board, then put them under the direct control of the president and an executive with newly granted unilateral powers and broad immunities.By doing this, they can install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan and educated experts in their respective fields. They'll target the FDA, the CDC, the EPA, all public health related agencies, and may even try to eliminate them altogether. This is how said \\"crisis of incompetence\\" emerges, and with the end goal being the crippling of the separation of powers and checks and balances that hold our democracy together.The worst part is, right wing lunatics are cheering this on because the MAGA movement has adopted an anti-intellectual, contrarian, cynical and conspiratorial worldview. They don't understand that what they're supporting goes against their best interests and the interests of most Americans. And they'll never be willing to concede to this fact, even when they start reaping the consequences.","title":"Democratic Governor excited by RFK Jr. pick for HHS"},{"text":"Kamala simply wasnt believable with her signature word salads that said absolutely nothing.","title":"Why did American voters seem to believe Donald Trump more than Kamala Harris? \\"He validates their angers and their fears.\\""},{"text":"Excuse me... 80+ hours per week?!? 11.5 hours per day (including weekends)?

Both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for DC ruled against the President saying that he exceeded his authority and the appointments were invalid. Saying nothing happened as a result of the action is just ignorant. There were four positions that were the center of this issue in 2012: three for the National Labor Relations Board and one for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both the Court of Appeals for the DC circuit (in 2013) and the Supreme Court voted (in 2014) rendered UNANIMOUS decisions against the President. As far as the appointees, the CFPB individual, Richard Cordray, was confirmed by the Senate in 2013. For the NLRB, Terrance Flynn (a Republican) resigned in 2012 after some OIG reports severely criticized his conduct as a staff attorney during his time prior at the NLRB. Another, Richard Griffin was later confirmed by the Senate in 2013, and the third, Sharon Block, left the board in 2013 after the DC Court of Appeals decision, but before the Supreme Court's decision. Yes I would agree it wasn't the greatest move, but it was brought on by the Republicans unwillingness to give the nominees any sort of confirmation hearings after being nominated prior, especially since the CFPB was still new at the time. From the President's perspective, it was definitely stretching what is considered a recess, however, despite your \\"argument\\", was stopped by the checks and balances provided by the Judiciary side. The system did its part and stopped an unlawful action.As you fail to recognize the seriousness of what is potentially going to happen, Trump has **actively** called for the next Senate Majority Leader to permit him to use recess appointments to appoint his various slapstick idiots for Cabinet positions. NO President has called for this before, much less before they even take office. He wants to bypass the entire process for god knows how many people, most likely because someone like Gaetz or Gabbard would not do well in a confirmation hearing or likely voting (as they shouldn't).

The Russians are going to win this war and after that, they will rebuild the Russian speaking parts of Ukraine as Russian cities that join them. They already are rebuilding the 4 Oblasts in Russia, as they have Crimea. The Russian military progress is such that the Ukrainians and the West are looking at a military catastrophe.","title":"To all Biden/KKKamala shills and fake dem fascists....Trump's victory does not wash the blood of Gazans off your hands."},{"text":"he resigned from this congress. i do not know if it applies to the new congress","title":"Sen.

He doesnt really mean these things and he says it jokingly and he can get away with it where other politicians cant because people know he just talks out of his ass.Im old enough to remember when Obama was president, Republicans were losing their mind with conspiracy theories about how Obama was going to stay in power forever and become a dictator and how he was the literal antichrist. Now we have someone openly saying it -jokingly or not- and Republicans just shrug their shoulders, as if its no big deal. Do I think he will attempt to stay in power past four years? I have no idea but I hope we have enough checks and balances in place to stop something like that.
