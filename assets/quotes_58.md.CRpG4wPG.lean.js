But History tells us a different story and you would be an absolute fool to ignore it.Throughout our collective past, mass violence has repeatedly led to rapid and profound societal change.In fact, its not just irresponsible to claim that violence is never a solution to societys problemsits dangerous. Dangerous because, time and time again, history shows us that when enough people realize violence can solve some of their problems, they act on it. And then people start dying. This is why its essential to remind society that mass violence is always a possibility. Not because we want it, but because acknowledging this possibility forces us to address the conditions that might push people to such extremes. At its core, mass violence isnt a crime of ideologyits a crime of desperation and fury. Most people dont want to kill. The idea makes almost everyone sick to their stomach. But when people are pushed far enoughwhen they feel cornered, unheard, and suffocated by those in powerthey will absolutely lash out. And thats one way oppressive systems will fall apart. The other way is if the upper class willingly rights their wrongs, but again history tells us that this rarely happens. Greedy people dont want to lose their privileges and they dont want to admit they were wrong.Consider the French Revolution. It began with a single extrajudicial murder against someone in the upper class. And when it happened, society had a choice: turn in the murderer, cheer them on, look the other way, or join them.And soon, killing wasnt a crime anymoreso long as the victims belonged to the elite.The Bolsheviks followed a similar path. So did the Maoists. The Haitian Revolution against slavery, and even the American Revolution against colonial rule, all involved targeted violence that escalated into something larger.The lesson here is stark: when people are pushed too far, violence becomes not just an option but, in their eyes, the only option. Acknowledging this fact isnt condoning violenceits recognizing the need to prevent the conditions that give rise to it.","title":"Bernie Sanders: A Mass Movement can beat Health CEO Greed - Jacobin Magazine"},{"text":"Do you think the anunnaki were an alien species themselves?

So the author, and Chris Murphy, basically say Dems should dislike it back on social issues and be much more of a progressive economics party.Will that win back the working class? No. Because \\"the Dems\\" aren't actually pushing social issues all that much. It's \\"liberals,\\" as in, \\"people who lean left but aren't actually in any real position of power.\\" That's the group of people pushing social issues. Dems haven't pushed any major social policy for a long time. Sure, they're not dicks to trans people, and they recognize racial inequality, but it's not like they're actually pushing for social policy laws that cause a lot of public outcry. It's the economic things that are bothering Republicans.The author cites the fact that a vast majority of Americans support things like government funded healthcare and free college.

While Ashkenazi Jews have ancestral ties to the region, the forced migrations by the Romans are often overemphasized; many Jewish communities across Europe and the Middle East were the result of voluntary migrations and trade connections centuries before Roman rule. Moreover, Mizrahi Jews, who undeniably have deep regional roots, largely lived as integrated minorities under Islamic rule for centuries, contradicting the narrative of persistent and universal oppression.Land purchased?The claim of inflated prices overlooks crucial context: much of the land sold to Jewish buyers in the late Ottoman and British Mandate periods was owned by absentee landlords, not local farmers. These land sales often displaced Palestinian tenant farmers, who were subsequently barred from remaining on the land they had worked for generations. The statistic that 52.6% of land purchases were from non-Palestinian landowners illustrates this trend and challenges the implication that land acquisition was entirely fair or consensual. As early as the 1920s, Palestinian resistance to land sales was rooted in fears of dispossessionfears that materialized with the increasing establishment of exclusively Jewish settlements.Wars won?The 1948 war cannot be assessed without mentioning the context of the British withdrawal and the UN Partition Plan, which allocated 55% of Palestine to a Jewish state when Jews made up only one-third of the population and owned less than 10% of the land. This disproportionate division, combined with forced expulsions (e.g., Deir Yassin massacre), catalyzed the mass exodus of Palestinians700,000 in totalmarking the start of the ongoing refugee crisis. Furthermore, Israels victories in 1948 and subsequent wars were heavily influenced by early arms smuggling networks, international funding, and strategic advantages. Portraying Israel as a helpless underdog during these conflicts oversimplifies a much more complex power dynamic.Pogroms and massacres?The Hebron massacre in 1929 was indeed a horrific event, but it must be placed in the broader context of escalating tensions between Jews and Arabs during the British Mandate. It was preceded by the Buraq Uprising of 1928, in which Jewish nationalist groups expanded claims over the Western Wall, provoking fears among Palestinians of further encroachments. While anti-Jewish violence is inexcusable, it was not one-sided; Jewish militias, such as the Haganah and later the Irgun, also carried out attacks against Palestinian civilians, including bombings of marketplaces in the 1930s.Ethnic cleansing?The displacement of Jewish communities in Arab countries following the establishment of Israel is tragic, but it does not justify the parallel displacement of Palestinians. Indeed, many of these Jewish expulsions occurred in retaliation for Israeli policies in Palestine. The population decline of Jews in Arab lands mirrors, in reverse, the ethnic cleansing of 1948 and subsequent laws barring the return of Palestinian refugees. Notably, Israel absorbed Jewish refugees into its state, while Palestinians remain statelessa stark disparity in outcomes.Final thoughtsThe argument that Palestinians \\"lost wars they started\\" ignores that most of these wars were reactions to perceived and actual encroachments. The notion that Palestinians are uniquely responsible for their suffering overlooks the imbalance of power, historical injustices, and ongoing occupation. Narratives that flatten history into binaries of victim and aggressor serve only to perpetuate the conflict rather than seek equitable solutions.

A lie can travel around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes.","title":"Thousands of Doctors Demand Suspension of mRNA Vaccines Due to Surge in Turbo Cancer and Excess Deaths"},{"text":"1 - On the topic of wealth inequality: \\"Wealth\\" is not \\"money\\". Wealth is *created*, largely *speculative*, and (in the US) is tied up mostly in *capital goods.* *Capital goods are physical assets that businesses use to produce goods or services. Capital goods are a type of capital, which?can be a measurement of wealth and a resource for increasing wealth.* This is important because it dispels the myth that wealth is one big pie, and the rich are taking too much of it. More accurately, the pie is growing, and the rich are creating most of that growth. What does this mean for the poor? Well, a more important metric if you're concerned about living standards is to look at income mobility. The poor are not an enduring class. You're more likely to end up in the top 10% than you are to stay behind in the bottom 10%. Not to mention, the poor have been getting richer. Living standards have never stopped increasing. Further, \\"wealth\\" analysis is a misleading metric in the US because the powers that be deliberately leave out most of the poor's assets. If you buy a $50,000 vehicle, it doesn't count. If you invest in luxury appliances for your home, it never counts. None of my OLED TV's, multi-thousand dollar PC's, laptops, $600 Samsung watch, $1,200 phone or anything else like that count. Basically nothing counts for the poor except for home equity and the raw value of their accounts. It makes us look poorer than we actually are, when our living standards are unequivocally the highest they've ever been. We're also massively wealthy compared to most of the world. Consider this: Our poorest states are still richer (per capita) than almost all other developed nations. The average person living below the poverty line in the US still has more living space than the average European. Not the average European living in poverty -- the average European -- period. 2 - On the topic of NorwayNorway has the population of Minnesota last time I checked which is great because they get basically half their revenue from state-owned oil. A small population that's been living large off a trillion dollar oil reserve. They have the money for their socialist pet projects that we don't. We would need a yearly $3.5T golden goose that doesn't exist. I would agree that their pension system (equivalent to our social security system) is far superior. And that's because it's partially privatized, solvent, and much more tied to your work history. Lastly I think these calculations completely ignore the economic principle of \\"lost opportunity cost\\". This is why corporate tax revenues increased after corporate taxes were cut. It left more money in the private sector to generate taxable business. So when you take all of this money out, that's money that would have been used to generate economic activity. So the estimates are always going to be inflated for what they can take in, and the act of taking them in hurts economic growth. So you end up with the reality that you're not really doing anything other than shuffling money around at a loss.","title":"CMV: The United States should create a social wealth fund modeled after the Norwegian pension fund"},{"text":"ppl will really not vax so they dont get cancer and then smoke lol. wild","title":"Thousands of Doctors Demand Suspension of mRNA Vaccines Due to Surge in Turbo Cancer and Excess Deaths"},{"text":"The only way this is plausible is if they sincerely don't believe they'll get cut, so they can play \\"willing to suffer for my beliefs\\" without thinking they actually *will* suffer","title":"They just make things up now"},{"text":"Preach!

Its not as if the U.S. actively condones violations, its more about how difficult it is to immediately cut off aid to an ally without destabilizing a critical region further.

If the U.S. stopped sending weapons, the power vacuum could embolden extremist groups, escalate violence, and worsen civilian casualties.

One example I remember well is when our 9th grade English teacher went on maternity leave for a semester and we got a replacement teacher with a doctorate in education who came out of retirement to teach this one class for his small hometown as a favor. Not only did he teach us critical thinking, Latin roots, and media literacy, he also grounded all of it with real-life examples where these skills matter.  I worked in education myself for many years, and have many close ties to teachers, administrators, college professors, etc. They all say the same thing about Gen Z/Gen Alpha: the average student has less respect for teachers and institutions, less academic proficiency, and no ambitions that would hinge on higher education. They all want to be influencers or YouTubers, while others just don't give a damn at all and plan on laying down and rotting (like the Chinese youth movement). We are reaping what our generational peers have sown with the iPad at 2 generation of kids that they produced.  I recognize that relying on the most exceptional teachers like the professor I described above is not sustainable. I also don't want to blame teachers - most of whom, in my experience, are saints for putting up with kids who behaved as I did in my youth - but it is certainly easier to change our approach to education than it is to collectively change the prevailing mindset of a whole generation, in my opinion. We need to show kids that having a basic concept of calculus can help them understand their YouTube video performance. That knowing a second language can help you get laid or move to a different country where there are better financial opportunities. That even a welder needs to be able to budget his finances and negotiate a raise using more than a monosyllabic vocabulary. **TL;DR** We can't change kids to fit education, we have to change education to fit kids in the hopes that this will lead them to change.","title":"Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest single-day act of clemency"},{"text":"Climate change is going to make a lot of these places impossible to live in long term.

The Connecticut senator sounded like a man who had done a speedrun through all five stages of grief and was ready to talk about what comes next: how his party could learn from its loss and win overor win backvoters in 2026 and 2028. I have thought for a long time that theres a race between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, Murphy told me. And the question is: Does the Republican Party become more economically populist in a genuine way before the Democratic Party opens itself up to people who dont agree with us on 100 percent of our social and cultural issues?Murphy is onto something. The politics of the average American are not well represented by either party right now. On economic issues, large majorities of the electorate support progressive positions: They say that making sure everyone has health-care coverage is the governments responsibility (62 percent), support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour (62 percent), strongly or somewhat support free public college (63 percent), and are in favor of federal investment in paid family and medical leave (73 percent). They also support more government regulation of a variety of industries including banking (53 percent), social media (60 percent), pharmaceuticals (68 percent), and artificial intelligence (72 percent). Yet large majorities of this same American public also take conservative positions on social issues: They think the Supreme Court was right to overturn affirmative action (68 percent), agree that trans athletes should compete only on teams that match their gender assigned at birth (69 percent), believe that third-trimester abortions should be illegal in most circumstances (70 percent), and are at least somewhat concerned about the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country (79 percent).These facts are not especially convenient for either Democrats or Republicans, which is no doubt why both sides have failed to put forward platforms that represent these views. But lately, more political insiders from both parties have been willing to acknowledge the problem and admit that its time to move on from neoliberalism, the political ideology that champions market solutions, deregulation, the privatization of public services, and a general laissez-faire approach to the economy.Substantial obstacles confront populists on both the left and right. Democrats must contend with a college-educated base and party establishment that embraces maximalist positions on social issues, while Republicans must contend with substantial libertarian cliques. But whichever party figures out how to advance a meaningful post-neoliberal platform could unlock a winning and durable political coalition.Murphy is doing his best to make sure that his side of the aisle beats the Republicans, but he seems far from certain that it will. In an MSNBC interview after the election, the senator sketched out something of a road map for Democrats: We should return to the party we were in the 70s and 80s, when we had economics as the tent pole and then we let in people who thought differently than us on other social and cultural issues. Murphy was quick to add that this reinventionor rather, reversionwill be challenging to pull off. Thats a difficult thing for the Democratic Party to do, because weve applied a lot of litmus tests over the years, he observed. Those litmus tests have added up to a party that is pretty exclusionary and is shrinking, not growing.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/FwrYoQeJ](https://theatln.tc/FwrYoQeJ)","title":"Is This How Democrats Win Back the Working Class?"},{"text":"It's not just lazy, it's intentional rage bait for morons to drive more clicks It works so they'll keep doing it","title":"Biden Is Pardoning Nearly 1,500 Americans, a Record for One Day"},{"text":"Do you have a source?

I don't read stories from those outlets, but there they are. The only left-leaning new provider that does the same is The Guardian, and it doesn't have near the reach or recognition of the Murdoch media properties. Even with that, there's no left-leaning media outlet of significant size that, without fail, supports progressives, right or wrong, good or bad, the way Faux does on the right.             And that exposes another major issue of the left: the continuation of the fiction that we're on an even playing field, and continuing to equate things that aren't the same. Faux is the same as MSNBC only in the respect they're both available on cable TV. A Democrat saying we need to let people \\"into the tent\\" when those people exclude themselves because their worldviews make the tent an uncomfortable place for them to be is a consistent misunderstanding of the people they want to attract.

Even Norway only distributes 3%, and they have oil revenues constantly feeding new capital in. Where's your new money coming from?Also, eliminating tax advantages for retirement accounts would absolutely destroy the middle class's ability to save for retirement. You're essentially forcing everyone to rely solely on this government fund instead of having control over their own investments.The Norwegian model works because it's built on massive oil exports in a country of 5 million people. The US has 330 million people and no comparable revenue stream.

His narrative was that outsiders ruined America and Democrats were using tax dollars to help them because of their elite wokeism, so he wants to cut their programs and return taxes to the market, kick out immigrants for costing tax dollars to sustain and taking jobs for less money, and tariffs to blow up trade agreements. Surveys show the majority of people including Republicans are aware prices will rise as a result of tariffs.

Are you proposing *more* taxation with the social wealth fund or what? Because money taxed from the rich and letting the poor keep it vs. money taxed from the rich and having the government keep it on behalf of the poor seems like almost an equivalent adjustment to inequality.Except of course that the poor don't have it, the government does so while the rich get somewhat less wealthy the poor are still poor. They just in concept have a nanny state to take care of them, which I'm sure it will do with traditional government efficiency and satisfaction of the beneficiaries. /sThe plan you propose would result in **greater** inequality than letting the poor keep their money and taxing the rich for a given amount of taxation. So if that is your main goal then it fails spectacularly. The fund supports a social safety net that raises the floor on standard of living.So this money isn't going to be distributed evenly but instead to the most needy. Basically you are proposing a parallel welfare system? We already have that, why not just propose increasing the level at which people qualify for welfare support? Fund it with increased taxes on the 1% and it is basically the same thing you proposed.","title":"CMV: The United States should create a social wealth fund modeled after the Norwegian pension fund"},{"text":"Oh, dont tell me theres an even harder pill to swallow.\\nI keep mine in a fake tooth!","title":"Ex-FBI informant Alexander Smirnov pleads guilty to lying about the Bidens"},{"text":"I know someone who did freelance work with a group of people for years and quit after the election, because they refused to ever work again with the two Trump supporters in the group.","title":"They just make things up now"},{"text":"No, just sociopaths.

With 54% of American adults having 6th grade or below reading comprehension level, those adults are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies, hold lower-paying jobs, experience legal problems, and need social services. I'm not saying any of that in judgment; we come from all walks of life and different circumstances that we cannot control. We have no choice where we're born and who we're born to.All of that is to say it's not that those kids aren't just behind, but the majority of them will never catch up. That stat (54%) correlates with states and areas that fall within the parameters of the worst funding to education, leading to a lack of access to education, and has led to the current landscape of calling for the abolishment of the Department of Education. If we assume half of that 54% has 1 kid, that's around 68 million kids perpetuating this cycle, but with a learned disdain for public education. From the perspective of my area home area, during COVID, college-educated people were able to remain financially stable while labor industries were not. All while they viewed rich college-educated politicians making decisions that affected their lives. Kids were sponges during this time. Being in the social services field, it's hard to blame many of the people we serve (not speaking of the above paragraph) who have consistently self-defeating views and vote that way. They don't comprehend what they hear and see, but they want a better life and fit in with those around them. They see local politicians talk about a budget and people ruining it but don't understand that the programs those politicians want to cut are the ones the clients are utilizing. The ACA is the biggest one that gets politicized as \\"ObamaCare.\\" I can't tell you how many clients are dependent on that for treatment that they would be dead or very near to it without it, yet they want \\"ObamaCare\\" repealed because their comprehension can't make the connection that the Affordable Care Act is the same thing. This goes down the line: SNAP - food stamps, Unemployment AND SSDI - Welfare handouts, etc.... . It can be very frustrating, but I don't blame them because their ignorance is genuinely exploited. Many of these individuals have kids.

Upon post-publication review, it has been determined that the correlation between mortality rates and vaccination status cannot be proven with the data presented in this article. As this invalidates the conclusions of the article, the decision has been made to retract.The authors disagree with this retraction. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11204115/From the paper:The chart below shows that the number of deaths from all cancers was highest in the 80-84 age group (Figure 2). According to Table 2, more than 90% of people aged 70 and older have received a third vaccine dose [1,17]. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reported that more than 99.9% of formulations administered were mRNA-LNPs, with BNT162b2 accounting for 78.1% and mRNA-1273 accounting for 21.8% [17], up to third doses with monovalent vaccine.Whether or not you find the causal link between mRNA vaccines and a rise in cancer death rates in Japan compelling, the rise in those rates is not disputed. You're free to speculate on other causes. What we're not seeing is a serious effort to attribute causes to much beyond delay in diagnosis.

Assuming that appeal cases are a representative sample of non appeal cases, when denying insurance claims early is industry standard, is not unreasonable.I disagree. Claims are denied for many reasons with The primary one being incorrect or incomplete information in the claim. Correcting this information and resubmitting is not an appeal.

Weve each written books that highlight how too many Americans in leadership positions, especially Democrats, have for decades emphasized education and job skills as the answer to growing economic security instead of focusing on minimum-wage laws, union rights, progressive taxation, affordable housing, universal healthcare, and other policies that improve peoples livelihoods. In 2016, Clinton won voters of color without a college degree by 56 points. In 2020, even with Bidens over-performance relative to Clinton, Trump still narrowed the gap in this demographic to 46 points. In 2024, Trump closed the gap even further, to just 30 points (and only 24 points in Wisconsin). Thats massive. In 2024, whatever has turned white non-college-graduates off Democratic candidates is now happening for other racial groups, as well.  Hillary Clinton touted a supposedly strong economy, while Donald Trump assailed low unemployment numbers as fake news. Though the country was experiencing low unemployment at the time, Trump was right that the numbers belied a deep economic anxiety among working Americans. Democrats must craft a vision of economic rights that tells a story of how we got here and what we need to do. It needs to be big and repeated over and over. We suggest, as Harvey Kaye and Alan Minsky have proposed, a modern version of FDRs economic bill of rights, which includes the rights to housing, universal healthcare, a job with a living wage; and tuition-free public education. The villain in this story is corporate America. Democrats can side with corporate interests, or they can win elections. But they cannot do both. As a mill worker once wrote to FDR: Mr. Roosevelt is the only man we ever had in the White House who understood my boss is a son-of-a-bitch. Great article that everyone here should read. Stop bashing voters and start understanding them. They dont trust macroeconomic indicators because they dont feel that those indicators speak to the anxieties of their lives. They dont trust Democrats to take strong stands against corporate America that express the urgency of their frustrations. They feel that Democrats and liberals look down on those who arent college-educated and dont respect them. Theres a clear messaging and policy problem that begins with acknowledging our own flaws before blaming right wing propaganda or corporate media or bigotry for holding us back.","title":"Why Democrats Are Losing Americans Without a College Degreeand How to Win Them Back"},{"text":"Democrats need to take a cue from their counterparts and find an incompetent, untrustworthy felon with no government experience who can promise us the moon and deliver nothing.

This was a *global* issue, not substantially caused by US monetary policy.But you had all the talking heads from the 2008 crisis getting this wrong and calling for austerity.  The overwhelming take from professional economists was that we needed to engage in fiscal austerity and push up unemployment to fight inflation. The Biden WH said fuck you, youre all wrong, this is a structural not monetary issue, we dont need to make people suffer to beat it.  And they were right!  Inflation has dropped to historically normal levels, and been partially offset by wage gains and low unemployment.  If Biden had acted differently, wed have had the inflation spike AND mass layoffs.  These arent lines on a graph, those lines reflect millions who didnt suffer because this WH was an excellent economic steward.But they werent capable of telling this story.  They didnt empathize enough when the spike hit, and subsequently couldnt convey the its a tough fight but we are fighting this together, and slowly winning message as inflation cooled off and fell.","title":"Democrats Lost the Propaganda War | The party used up about $5 billion on political ads in 2024.

The liberal position can be \\"why does it matter, if it's a victimless crime\\" but normies can feel uncomfortable with the simple fact that the law is being broken, regardless of other factors. There's also the element of \\"fairness\\" with the whole \\"they are cutting in line ahead of people trying to come legally\\" thing that can add to the common sense \\"this is bad\\" aspect. Maybe it would help ease legal immigration requirements somewhat, but the core issue is that people have no idea how hard it is to immigrate into this country or how much immigrants help them.The thing is, many people *do* seem to have at least some idea of how difficult it is to immigrate, considering the arguments of \\"it's unfair that they are cutting in line in front of the folks struggling to come here legally\\" which often seems to be brought up The fact that far too many people think immigrants hurt them is one of the best examples of the different realities some of us live under, beliefs like this shape people's core political beliefs. This probably needs to be tackled somehow for any significant immigration reform to happen with popular support.That's the thing though, it's a lot easier to defend immigration to the average person when the aspect of \\"it's illegal\\" isn't there. To people with higher values, \\"it's illegal\\" may not mean much because it's easy to say \\"so what, maybe the laws are unjust or just not doing any benefit\\" but to regular folks, \\"it's illegal\\" can just matter more. So, get rid of illegal immigration, and then focus on arguing for increased legal immigration, and it's easier for normies to listen to what you are actually saying rather than getting caught up on \\"but you are arguing for illegal immigration\\" or \\"but we already have a lot of immigration and it is illegal\\"","title":"Recent Immigration Surge Has Been Largest in U.S. History - Under President Biden, more than two million immigrants per year have entered, government data shows."},{"text":"States there's a pic, then doesn't post... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)","title":"They just make things up now"},{"text":"That's good.","title":"Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest single-day act of clemency"},{"text":"I agree too, I am dissatisfied with both political parties.

He promoted the vaccines, even got the vaccine himself, and the vaccine rollout was achieved during his presidency before Biden took office.

According to 2013 research conducted at the University of Arizona College of Law, even when pharma companies arent directly funding the research, company stockholders, consultants, directors, and officers are almost always involved in conducting them. **A 2017 report by the peer-reviewed journal The BMJ also showed that about half of medical journal editors receive payments from drug companies, with the average payment per editor hovering around $28,000**. But these statistics are only accurate if researchers and editors are transparent about payments from pharma. And a 2022 investigative analysis of two of the most influential medical journals found that 81% of study authors failed to disclose millions in payments from drug companies, as theyre required to do.

When asked by a senator why he went outside of OPA his response was something along the lines of being the chief law enforcer of the USA.

He eventually won the case in Ecuador, but Chevron pulled out of the country and he was unable to get the judgment enforced anywhere else. Chevron sued him, arguing that the judgment in Ecuador had been obtained through corruption (bribing a judge, writing parts of the judgment himself, meeting illegally with independent witnesses etc.), and were successful. They relied on the testimony of a corrupt Ecuadorian judge. Which presents all sorts of problems.The New York court found Donziger liable for a bunch of corruption, he was disbarred, damages were awarded against him (although later reduced), and arguably committed some crimes. The Ecuador judgment was ruled unenforceable by an arbitration panel at The Hague, and so the whole thing fell apart.At some point Donziger seems to have decided that the whole system was corrupt - including the New York judges - and started being difficult; refusing to comply with court orders, complaining about things in the press, and generally trying to get out of the hole he seems to have dug himself into.There was a civil contempt of court case, and ultimately a criminal contempt of court case, due to his repeated breach of court orders and disregard for the legal process.The local Federal prosecutors didn't want to get involved, so the judge instructed a private law firm to handle the criminal contempt prosecution (as it would be inappropriate for the judge to handle it himself). This is where - in your quote - Donziger lies: That decision prompted the judge to illegally appoint the Chevron law firm to act in place of the government prosecutor.The decision wasn't illegal. The judge appointed *a* law firm to prosecute the case (perfectly fine) and it turned out that some of the 150+ lawyers at the law firm had previously represented Chevron (but not the ones bringing the prosecution).As with everything in Donziger's case, it *looks* bad and *feels* bad, particularly if you spin it one way, but isn't necessarily that bad.He was ultimately prosecuted for criminal contempt and found guilty. He was sentenced to six months in prison, but only ended up spending six weeks there - the rest on house arrest (both while on bail, and after conviction).The whole case is a giant mess, and it is very easy to build a narrative around it that Donziger is a victim of the evil corporate world. But there's also a world where he is simply in the Find Out stage of FAFO.The case does raise some serious problems with the US's legal system and how much power multinationals can exert (Chevron spent over $1bn on the various cases - money they can afford but he obviously cannot). But at the same time, he made it easy for them by (at least, according to several courts) breaking rules to win, and then flouting court orders and taking a hostile position to a Federal judge.","title":"34 Members of Congress Urge Biden to Pardon Environmental Lawyer Steven Donziger"},{"text":"Now he's person of the year?

These microspheres can only have been formed during the destruction of the World Trade Center at temperatures far higher than can be explained by the jet fuel and office fires. Those fires, we are told by engineers employed by NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, were allegedly the cause of the World Trade Centers destruction. The discovery of this advanced energetic material, in the form of red/gray chips distributed throughout the dust, both explains the iron-rich microspheres and confirms the inadequacy of the official account of what happened that tragic day.Even before the microspheres and red/gray chips had been identified and brought to our attention, we were deeply concerned about other aspects of the destruction of these iconic buildings, and how they were investigated. More than two dozen firefighters, engineers, and other witnesses reported seeing substantial quantities of molten iron or steel, flowing like lava in the debris under all three World Trade Center high-rises. Office fires and jet fuel cannot possibly reach the temperatures necessary to liquefy iron or steel.? A mixture called thermite, consisting of pulverized iron oxide and aluminum, CAN generate temperatures above 4000F  far more than is needed to melt iron or steel, which melts at about 2750F.The energetic material that was found in the WTC dust by an international team of scientists (led by Niels Harrit of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark)? was?reported in the peer-reviewed?Bentham?Open Journal of Chemical Physics. It consists of nano-engineered iron oxide and aluminum particles 1000th the size of a human hair, embedded in another substance consisting of carbon, oxygen, and silicon. The sizes of the iron oxide particles are extremely uniform, and neither they nor the ultra-fine-grain aluminum platelets could possibly have been created by a natural process such as a gravitational collapse or the impact of jetliners. The red/gray chips in which these particles were found exhibit the same characteristics as advanced energetic materials developed in US national laboratories in the years leading up to 9/11. They have no reason to be in this dust. Given all the horrific costs in human lives, lost civil liberties, and trillions of tax dollars spent in response to the official account of 9/11, there can be no more urgent need than for our country and the world to find out who put those materials in the World Trade Center C and why.","title":"If you never read the official Architects and Engineers 9/11 statement- prepare to be shocked!"},{"text":"No, were saying something different.

Sounds a bit like Germanys Mitbestimmungsgesetz, which is the law from the 1970s which codifies the modern implementation of Germanys codetermination principles for corporate operations. The key difference would be that the Mitbestimmungsgesetz is just the modern framework for a concept that has been in German corporate management for many decades, a century, even, so they are building on what is already culturally accepted principles that the company is not just for the principle shareholders, its for the workers, too. Having worked for companies with these sorts of laws, at a level where I was regularly working directly with the CEO and board of directors, I can say that it is a very refreshing perspective compared to the US. The CEO I worked with was certainly wealthy, but much more modestly so than US CEOs, and genuinely cared about the standard of living of workers. He considered whether or not the employees were prospering as much a sign of personal success as his own wealth. Does it mean there is never layoffs or other hardships? No. But it does mean that this is seen as a bad thing to be avoided, and labor is seen as a valuable asset, not an expense to be avoided, and generally workers are respected by management much more than they are in US companies. Overall it is, in my opinion, a much better system and one that creates a more equitable society, as well as one which preserves industrial capabilities and a diverse economy better, instead of outsourcing or offshoring everything, which leads to a more stable nation. I would absolutely welcome a German style codetermination approach to corporations in the US.","title":"Elizabeth Warren introduces Senate bill to hold capitalism accountable"},{"text":"For sure.

Isreal will always be a Jewish state.  Even within the Jewish citizens, people from Middle-Eastern origins are treated as second class citizens (forget the name, but there's an excellent documentary on Moroccan jews).Other than Hamas, I'm really unaware of anyone not acknowledging Oct 7 as horrific.  If the requirement is that any statement on the topic requires a lengthy diatribe on how bad it was, we'll, that would very quickly become stale and performative.Israel is engaged in a genocide.  The \\"generals\\" plan that is being floated is an out and out \\"final solution\\", and I do not use that term lightly.  The plan proposes setting a deadline for the north strip, and anyone remaining after will be sealed in and treated as a combatant, regardless of who they are and their current state.  It is literally a liquidation plan for a population of humans.The Palestinians have long been in a position of limited power and influence.  They have relied on the political power of neighboring countries for decades to protect them, and over the last 20 years that support has waned.  For example, Jordan used to issue and validate Palestinian passports, but no longer do.  They have continued to withdraw or reduce support for them in the occupied territories as well.  More and more Arabic neighbors see relations with Israel as beneficial or neutral, and so have stopped supporting the Palestinians.The Palestinians have had to turn their efforts to the UN, but the UN is mostly about broad consensus.  The old major western powers have historical commitments to Israel, which I think have some validity.  So, the only way forward for Palestine is to continue pushing the problem to the front.  The problem is that those historical commitments are hard to overcome for reasons internal to those countries.The current conflict highlights that Israel is literally willing to starve them to death.  Nonviolent protests doesn't work great when the people you are protesting are happy to watch you slowly die.  Moderate/compassionate Israelis tend not to be violent, hardcore settlers, and it is the IDF and those settlers who engage with Palestinians in Gaza.I think there are a variety of solutions possible, without resorting to genocide, but internationally there is no will to enforce them.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"To be fair,  a lot of politicians have eroded them over the last century.

Following impositions of the tariffs on Chinese goods, the prices of U.S. intermediate goods rose by 10% to 30%, an amount generally equivalent to the size of the tariffs.[213]:?233C234?A study published in fall 2019 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that by December 2018, Trump's tariffs resulted in a reduction in aggregate U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month in deadweight losses, and cost U.S. consumers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax.[24] The study's authors noted that these were conservative measures of the losses from the tariffs, because they did not take account of the tariffs' effects in reducing the variety of products available to consumers, or the tariff-related costs attributable to policy uncertainty or the fixed costs incurred by companies to reorganize their global supply chains.[24] A study by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the tariffs reduced employment in the American manufacturing sector.[214][215]An April 2019 working paper by economists found that the tariffs on washing machines caused the prices of washers to increase by approximately twelve percent in the United States.[23] A 2019 paper by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the steel tariffs led to 0.6% fewer jobs in the manufacturing sector than would have happened in the absence of the tariffs; this amounted to approximately 75,000 jobs.[216][217]In May 2019, analyses from varying organizations were released.

The clemency granted to drug offenders  many of whom were imprisoned on low level marijuana-related offenses  partly answers a plea from Democratic lawmakers for the outgoing president to finalize efforts to limit marijuana prosecutions at the federal level before he leaves office, and grant mercy to those convicted on weed related charges.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-issues-record-breaking-commucations-pardons-1235202024/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-issues-record-breaking-commucations-pardons-1235202024/)","title":"Biden Issues Record-Breaking Wave of Commutations and Pardons"},{"text":"[For anyone that isn't aware](https://youtu.be/4bOHYZhL0WQ).","title":"I'm a liberal, but one thing I have to agree with conservatives on is that covid was absolute nonsense"},{"text":"Some of the people he commuted were already out of jail in home detention.

The pardon power is extremely broad.One of the expected uses of pardons mentioned by Hamilton in the Federalist Papers was the ability to offer full pardons to participants in an insurrection as a way to convince them to lay down arms and go back to living peacefully. This would be expected to happen while the rebellion was still ongoing, and most participants wouldn't have been captured or charged with anything yet. The expected need for pardons to be used in this way was one of the justifications for giving the pardon power to the president alone rather than requiring approval from Congress. Washington and Adams both granted pardons in situations similar to this.Pardons were offered as an incentive to convince a bunch of pirates to help the US fight the British in the War of 1812. Many of those pirates hadn't been charged with anything.Carter pardoned all Vietnam draft dodgers, many of whom had fled to Canada and were never charged. The pardon meant they could return to the US without fear of being charged when they got here.And as mentioned by somebody else, there was Nixon's pardon.","title":"Bill Clinton says hes open to talking to Biden about preemptive pardon for Hillary Clinton"},{"text":" Im sure if youre in federal prison, theres a pretty damn good reason for it too.","title":"Biden announces clemency for around 1,500 people C including pardons for 39 convicted of non-violent crimes"},{"text":"Yes, its true.

All of this COMBINED with the trial he was on and got convicted for felony as well as rape would have in in Reagan's time completely disqualified him from the presidency.Yet the fact that despite all of this he still won the 2024 presidency isn't an indication of failure on Joe Biden's part but just how seriously flawed the political system has become with an increasingly partisan Republican party that has become just barely far-right and which was the result of an ever growing rise of right-wing media outlets that have more or less brainwashed many Americans that gave Trump enough tools to stand on a platform of racism, misogyny and right-wing nationalist rhetoric and become powerful through it.Had Trump tried that in 1980 he would have been booted out before he even got a lick of nomination. Meanwhile had Reagan tried running for the oval office in 2016 or 2024 with the same platform and policy rhetoric he had during his presidency he would have never been accepted by the party nor the Republican voters and instead be seen as a \\"Republican In Name Only\\" for having some positions that would deem him as \\"Communist Democrat\\".

The aim and the effect was to hobble the Trump administration from carrying out its agenda, and in many ways it succeeded.?\\nI might also suggest that the Democratic party might take more effective steps than to mimic MAGA populism in order to return to power. It might be an unreasonable hope (ok, it is an unreasonable hope, but it would be effective), but the Democrats could earn the trust and respect of the American electorate if they took an active hand in reforming those cultural and political institutions that are overwhelmingly populated by Democrats. If the leadership of the party stated that it is not in the interests of the United States that 90% of the federal bureaucracy were registered Democrats, nor that 90% of college professors either. They could follow that up by working together with Republicans to right the ship of state to a more equal balance.

We have invested more money in the last 4 years into American infrastructure than any presidency has since the 50s. We have created a genuine revival of American production and industry. We will soon be one of the most advanced chip manufacturers in the world as well as other industries becoming much more competitive. We have seen a real resurgence in the trades in recent years. Going to university to earn a decent living is no longer a requirement. There is excellent money to be made and lots of jobs in skilled trades now. That wasn't the case when I left high school in '07. Union strength and union interest is higher than it's been since at least the 80s.We have brought down student debt by no insignificant margin. We weren't able to accomplish blanket forgiveness like many hoped, but for millions of Americans, they are now able to financially afford buying property and starting families. Europe has begun to rearm itself in a significant way, and American weapons have been crucial to preventing Russia from becoming an imperial power that can grab land wherever and whenever it wants. The Ukraine war can and should have been handled with a firmer response, but we have the hindsight of knowing that all the nuclear bluster from the Kremlin was worth less than the dirt on your shoes. In 2022 we didn't have that knowledge. NATO is now larger and stronger, and European nations are taking action to be able to defend themselves. Probably most important: The pandemic was resolved. People with expertise were put back in the driver's seat for navigating the country out of the biggest health crisis in a century. People got back to work, case loads went down, the pandemic ended.

They didn't even come up with one theory, they said Trump could have done multiple felonies and as long as the jury thought he'd done one of these uncharged and unproven felonies, **and they didn't have to agree which one**, they could convict on falsifying business records. So, he's found guilty based on the theory he hid another felony that was never charged or proven, and no one knows what that underlying felony was cuz the jury didn't even have to agree on what it was. He's guilty based on alleged uncharged crimes. This is a horrible precedent, and flies in the face of our constitution and freedoms.

Only 1/3 of Israelis are Ashkenazi (European/Middle Eastern Jews forced from their ancestral homeland into Europe by the Romans) the rest are 2.5 Million Muslims, Ethiopians, and 3,200,000 Mizrahi Jews who have lived continuously in the region for more than 3,000 years.Land purchased? Point to IsraelJews not only bought the land, they often paid highly inflated prices for that land:In 1944, Jews paid between $1,000 and $1,100 per acre in Israel, mostly for arid or semi-arid land; in the same year, rich black soil in Iowa was selling for about $110 per acre.Wars won? Point to IsraelFive Arab countries attacked a day old Israel which was under a arm's embargo and still lost. They have repeatedly waged land grab attempts and sneak attacks while refusing all peace offer's since and continue to lose, scream and cry that it's not fair before calling for ceasefire and launching more sneak attacks at 3 am in attempt to kill more civilians.In the 1930s, most of the land was bought from landowners. Of the land that the Jews bought, 52.6% were bought from non-Palestinian landowners, 24.6% from Palestinian landowners, 13.4% from government, churches, and foreign companies, and only 9.4% from fellaheen (farmers)There were over a thousand Pogroms and attempts of genocide by the Arabs in Palestine in the course of several centuries including the Hebron massacre where Arabs went door to door killing and maiming over a hundred innocent people in the city of Hebron who's Jewish population existed long before Jews started immigration back to their homeland. It started with the killing of a four year old Jewish boy and his father in their own house by muslim mobs.Lesson learned if you take a group of people's land who have been there over a thousand years before you, kill, torture, colonize, attempt to force convert them for centuries, build mosques over their temples and churches you destroyed, take their money when they buy their own land back from you but then refuse to let them live on their purchased land, refuse agreement set out by the British that would take the majority of the land from the people you just stole from, killed and colonized for centuries.Gang up with multiple other countries on one country under a arms embargo and still lose, attack over and over in new wars you start losing more and more land every time and refusing six offer's to share the land including one for 95% of it, send thousands of rockets into their country on a regular basis and act liked the fact that those rockets are shot down and fall predictably in the neighborhood they're launched from killing your own people means your the victim. Stating in interviews that civilian deaths are the plan and your refusal to build bomb shelters or let civilians use the multi million dollar tunnel system you built then you kill and torture over a thousand innocent people and kidnap over two hundred. Be prepared for a country any country to protect their people.If you're interested in learning about actual ethnic cleansing and attempted genocide look at the population numbers of Jewish people in any country in the middle east before and after Islamic takeover, the Arab African slave trade which rivaled the number of the Atlantic slave trade and lasted longer than any other continuing even now with mass kidnapping, rape and forced labor in multiple African countries and the treatment of afro Arabs in Palestine who are relegated to a ghetto called \\"Abeed\\" street, Abeed by the way literally translates as slave.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"every generation rebels against their parents in some way or another","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Biden is one of the most racist presidents in modern history.

Academia generally can be very temporary or project-based unless you're in charge of your own group, but then it's cyclic and very dependent on constantly renewing funding / getting new funding as old funding runs out and going through that process _but_ you can generally pursue what you want and go down numerous detours if that's where the path takes you + you can still justify it as being useful to do. The emphasis on publication however does add stress/pressure and unfortunately incentivizes certain paths or approaches which might not be the nicest though for you or your work. Still, you have a lot of freedom to problem solve for things people have never done before, even if it's not going to directly yield something beneficial for you or your institution beyond _new understanding_ (/publications).Industry, to my knowledge, is often more stable however, and more focused, but more based on the whims of the higher company strata rather than the people further down. You might not be working for the sake of pushing science further along, but instead to do work that can be marketed or work towards a product, service, or patent that would result in profit. You can't do something just because it might be interesting or it might be useful to know for science / humanity _unless_ it's beneficial for your company somehow. If it's not usable, or sellable, there's a good chance it's not worth pursuing, and your work might be along an established path with a set goal, or exploratory with a specific goal already in mind.","title":"What are the main differences and similarities between academic and industrial sectors?"},{"text":"This is not how I remember the 7th at all.

He obtained 4.5 million views in a day through a recipe revealed by Snoop (machine translated)](https://hotnews.ro/calin-georgescu-si-a-facut-duminica-un-cont-nou-detik-tok-dupa-ce-firma-a-luat-masuri-contra-dezinformarii-a-obtinut-45-milioane-de-vizualizari-intr-o-zi-printr-o-reteta-dezvaluita-de-snoop-1858146) The way in which from December 8 to December 10 Callin Georgescu reconstituted his audience on Tik Tok is described in an article published on Tuesday by the investigative website Snoop.  All other platforms have specialized departments on political content, elections, governance. Where to get support and dialogue. At TikTok there is no such thing, because in them the official policy is that: they do not do politics on the platform C Andrei Bu?e, cyber security specialist. On Sunday, December 8, Callin Georgescu announced his followers that he can be found on TikTok at a new address. The reasons are multiple, but mainly the audience of the old account had decreased after it was targeted by measures taken by the social media platform. In one day, the calin.georgescu.real account climbed a video of the independent candidate in the presidential elections. By Monday evening, at 00:00, he had collected 4.5 million views, 562.4 thousand likes and over 44,000 comments.\\nCapture from the night of 9 to December 10, 2024, with the video reaching 4 and a half million views Starting today, December 8, this is my official TikTok channel, here we will find ourselves together, here we will do live, here we will send the messages, Calin Georgescu said. He dropped his old account after Tik Tok was asked at the European Union level what measures to combat disalformation he took, explained Andrei Buse, digital marketing and cyber security specialist. TikTok representatives were heard in the European Parliament about suspicions of influencing the first round of the presidential elections in Romania. They denied that they favored candidate Callin Georgescu, but admitted that they took money even though the candidate did not mark his posts as political. **The Secret of Comments** Cybersecurity specialist Andrei Bu?e scanned the comment area of the first video published by Callin Georgescu on the fresh account. And he noticed a pattern: accounts that caught his attention that they were fake. Profiles that do not post video images, but only repost clips with Callin Georgescu. Users with Romanian name and surname, but also some who imitate pages, missing letters (syndicate.europo) or, simply, user (user) followed by a long number (code). With the help of specific tools, I realized a template, a model through which this artificial growth is achieved. As stated in the Recorder experiment (ed. Who created from zero a clip with a fake candidate and climbed it up to a million views in just one hour), from fake traffic, organic traffic is generated,\\" he says. Basically, a network of bots breeds the underground current, and then the bots give room for real people. The human audience is captured by a \\"viral\\" video. A few steps are relevant: **Email addresses are made** It all starts by creating email addresses, generally, on sites that generate temporary emails. They are valid enough for enough time to allow the creation of an account on TikTok. It is more difficult to use an account on Gmail, Google service, for example, because it asks for a phone number to verify new accounts. **How to Compose False Names** User names are automatically added to programs (scripts), being extracted from lists of names from online sources, such as Wikipedia (e.g. C from the list of Romanian first names). They are then combined into a table (Excel): in a column with surnames (Vasile, Andreea, Mariana, Petre, Eusebiu, Dorina), in another column with the surname (Ionescu, Petrescu, Ivan, Niculae, etc.) Examples: Elena Pop, Florin Gherasim, Claudia Voicu, Ana Ciolan. It's just one of the options. **The barriers are passing that ask you to prove that you are human** Scripts (codes written by the programmer for automating a process, which would otherwise be done manually) solves the Captcha tests (the system through which the user selects certain images to distinguish between man and robot), and thus can also make accounts automatically. By this, avoid a security gate implemented by TikTok. **A software automatically chooses relevant videos** Through web scraping, the process of automatic data extraction from the internet, relevant videos are identified based on keywords or tags. Then the links from these videos are uploaded to the Telegram app; The rest of the steps you can be seen in today's article on Snoop. All other platforms have specialized departments on political content, elections, governance. Where to get support and dialogue. In TikTok there is no such thing, because in them the official policy is that: they do not do politics on the platform C Andrei Buse **Links with Russia** The mechanism described by the Romanian IT specialist is just one of the recipes used to generate the significant online increase in the posts about Callin Georgescu in recent weeks. Several investigative publications have discovered and shown to the public various methods by which Callin Georgescus name was pushed on networks such as TikTok, Facebook or Telegram. **1. Russian-funded ads: AdNow** Journalist Victor Ilie published, in Snoop, evidence about AdNow, a network of hundreds of publications, influencers and advertisements financed with money from Moscow, which propagats discord and conspiracy theories in the media landscape in Romania for at least eight years. The impact on the public was felt in the long term, and the same narrative used by the candidate Callin Georgescu created his path to users who accessed Russian-funded advertisements and websites. Snoop also showed that, in the same office of the company financed with Russian money, the company of some supporters of Callin Georgescu, some of them SOS politicians, was also founded. **2. Russian network that supported his candidacy, \\"Portal Kombat\\"** The Public Record investigation website showed how dozens of coordinated sites in Russia and Telegram channels supported Callin Georgescu's candidacy in the presidential elections, including through articles posted on sites outside the country. They \\"disminsmining anti-EU messages, describe Georgescu as a sovereignist and, more recently, condemn the annulment of the election,\\" the publication said. **3. Russian-related accounts promote CG** A Context investigation reported on November 29 that \\"data from social networks X (formerly Twitter), Telegram and Facebook show a series of accounts linked to Russia with hundreds of thousands of followers and with obvious pro-Russian, anti-Western and conspirational sympathies that constantly promote Callin Georgescu.\\" **4. AUR accounts, \\"borrowed\\" by Georgescu** Context also showed that a network of propaganda pages for the extremist AUR party, disguised as news portals, is running promotion for Callin Georgescu, the candidate with zero expenses reported in the electoral campaign. The topic was confirmed by journalists Luiza Vasiliu and Victor Ilie, who published on their own Substack, that a network of which includes at least 25 Facebook pages and 25 websites, with advertisements that were viewed 160 million times, paid between 167,900 and 264,909 thousand euros for over 4,000 disinterformation ads in the period August-December 2024. The ads were discovered by researchers at CheckFirst and Reset Tech. The Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) report confirms the data obtained by journalists, showing that Russia has flooded the information space with polarizing narratives and the support of political actors close to the Kremlin (extremists, nationalists, populists). The report highlights the use of local opinion editors with Eurosceptic views and the promotion of conspiracy theories to influence the electoral process.!ping EUROPE&amp;TECH&amp;FOREIGN-POLICY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They essentially can only afford 3 no's/presents\\nSome very fun and very powerful GOP house peeps can do the funniest shit possible if 5 of them agree to vote present","title":"Jeffries: No Dems will support Johnson for Speaker on House floor"},{"text":"Declining to enforce certain laws is not illegal.

It did go both ways but by far the Arabs were the instigators of the violence more than the Jews.

Literally not a single one has been instigated by Israel.\\n1948, 1956, 1963, 1972 and 2023.?\\nThe Palestinians like to play victim when it comes to the Nakba, where they present the story that Israeli was expansionist and just stole their land because they want the Arabs gone. But when they tell this story they will never mention the land was taken in a counter attack by Israel after the Arabs launched a massive invasion on Israel. They also won't tell you that the descendants of the Arabs who didn't flee those territories currently live as Arab Israelis today, with equal rights to the Jews (something that would never happen in Palestine).?\\nWhen it comes to describing Palestine as a prison, yes that's fair you can argue that. But there is a reason it is that way. Ultimately Israels main responsibility is the safety of its own citizens. They have a neighbour that time and time again has proven they will use violence to achieve their goals and will kill Israelis. To not blockade and restrict the Palestinians considering this would be utterly irresponsible and lead to the deaths of Israelis.?\\nIsrael has legitimately tried peace, they have conceded territories that were taken in the many wars. They ended the occupation of Gaza (result of another Arab invasion) in 2005. But the Palestinians went ahead and brought Hamas in who are very vocal about wanting Israel exterminated.?\\nWhen you look at the history of these two countries it's clear as day that the Palestinians have no interest in peace and just see themselves as resistance fighters fighting evil. But they won't accept that they have been responsible for such a huge amount of this violence and their own actions have led them into the situation they are in today.?\\nThe Palestinians need to change and reject Hamas, then they need to accept that they have lost what they lost because they kept turning to violence, then they need to actually give peace a chance. Like OP said, Israel isn't going anywhere at this point, continuing this violence will just ensure every Palestinian will be born into war or occupation.?","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/f2yu8908pe6e1.jpeg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c598a3299f48322c55f4b3c19464dc3b79723e3??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Similarities between Academic and Industrial Sectors\\n * Knowledge Creation and Application: Both sectors are involved in generating and utilizing knowledge.

Marx invented \\"capitalism\\" as term/concept. His criticisms of capitalism and call to arms against it account for 100% of Marx' potency. Even in The Manifesto, there isn't much about what communism is or how it should work. Enmity to capitalism is what Marxism is/was. Ayn Rand , Hayek and other Lenin critics went down the same path. Dagny Taggart, Howard Roark... they are heroic &amp; strong characters with ethos. But... they are characterized by what they are not. They are not the world around them. They are looters. They are not Grimma Wormtongue. BTW... I believe it *was* this group who were first known as r/neoliberals. Libertarians as we know (and love?) is a later denomination... as an economic right concept. Meanwhile... the feistiest socialists *love* fascism. They'll seek it out. Sometimes even invent or imagine it.  Why? One reason is dichotomy. Radical socialism (and fascism) grow best within a socialist-fascist dichotomy. Fascism was born reactionary, an anticommunism. Antifascism born directly following it. Both thrived within the dichotomy... actively (and ironically) defending it.The second reason is the democracy paradigm. \\"*After Hitler, Us*!\\" is a famous communist slogan of Interwar Germany... as Hitler rises. The idea is that Nazism represented the right \\"paradigm.\\" An ideological, revolutionary party wins an election and therefore has a mandate to break institution, remodel and reconstitute society. Exactly what *they* (KPD) wanted to do. So yeah... Lets just remember that Objectivism is a philosophy that claims to have fully solved epistemic truth, morality, history, social science, economics and everything else. It's even *more* expansive and absolute in its perspective than marxist communism. Meanwhile, 100% of its potency comes from contrasting itself with its favorite enemies. We see this playing out in the temporally short lived \\"ideologies\\" of 2024 meme politics too. Woke/Antiwoke. To me, what makes r/neoliberal (the 1990s variety) valuable is rejection of this game.

From wikipedia: Ethnic nationalism is present in many states immigration policies in the form of repatriation laws. Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Serbia and Turkey provide automatic or rapid citizenship to members of diasporas of their predominant ethnic group, if desired.So yes, Germany does exist as an ethnostate in some form. She sees herself as the nation of Germans born out of a desire of unity between the German people who share a culture, a language, and common heritage. Germany has policies in place to protect ethnic Germans outside of her borders. That doesnt mean minorities need to be oppressed or that minorities are excluded from acquiring citizenship. All of this is true in Israel (at least on paper).I dont think youre be antisemitic for being against ethnic nationalism btw.

My issue with this take is it firstly assumes that October 7th was some strange anomaly out of nowhere that precipitated a war that had not existed yet with a population baying for blood and an end to peaceful coexistence. Hamas has emerged and been strengthened by Palestinian support because Israeli actions in Palestine have been in direct opposition to any realistic attempt to negotiate a two state solution. Pretty much any negotiation for a two state solution in the last 40 years or so has been killed predominantly by Israeli action. Hamas emerged in its militant form because of a direct result by Israel to actively undermine any negotiated settlement for a two state solution with Israel famously funding Hamas to draw support from the PLO. So when you say that Hamas has to go for a two state solution to emerge, all I can say is why has Israel spent decades abusing any reasonable attempt to achieve a negotiated settlement with an organisation that gave up its used of armed resistance. This sort of claim feels very much like a give up your guns and stop defending yourself and maybe this time we wont colonise your land sorta claim and its failed repeatedly in the past for Palestinians. Hence why I find it unrealistic to assume that Palestinians should do so again. In fact its more surprising how successfully the Palestinian Authority has kept a check on violence emerging from the East Bank against Israeli authorities. Secondly the cycle of violence you point to has been predominantly one sided again for at least 4 decades. Israel has killed more Palestinians than Hamas did Israelis on October 7th nearly every year for again a few decades at least. Armed forces mixed with colonial settlements have been the cornerstone of Israeli policy in colonised and Occupied Palestine for years and that direct use of violence is a driving force for extremist emergence in Palestine for years. There hasnt been a single armed occupation of a state let alone one as violent and autocratic as Israels in modern history that has not encouraged extremist actors to emerge and it seems unbelievable to assume that even if Palestinians turned against Hamas, without any meaningful shift in Israeli policy, another militant wouldnt just emerge to fill that void. This is especially prevalent given the large scale destruction the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has caused.Finally it is not on Palestine to have to condemn October 7th again and again and again while accepting the tens of thousands likely to be hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by Israeli actions. The Palestinian authority did condemn Hamass actions on the world stage but their is a limit to how meaningfully they can focus on October 7th when their own citizenry is dying to an order of magnitude larger than anything Hamas has done in the last two years. The Palestinian Authority was already facing issues of legitimacy and popularity because of their diplomatic efforts being directly undermined by Israel, there is only so much focus they cna put on attacks against Israel over the attacks against their own citizenry before their own legitimacy collapses entirely.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"\\"?There have been many years where there have been no active attempts at invasion or attack of Israel,?\\"\\nName one.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Yep, and the lack of calling them out really made it feel like there was going to be no fight from the administration.

In the 80s, the PLO was sending suicide bombers at busses and cafes, and Jewish Israelis were building settlements in formerly Palestinian areas.  Peace seemed impossible.Then in the 90s, the Oslo Peace Accords seemed to come out of nowhere and after the long difficult process, a real peace and a Palestinian homeland seemed possible.  Before the last treaties were even signed, militants on both sides were already trying to disrupt it.Shortly after the last agreement was signed, right-wing Jewish Israelis assassinated Rabin for having made peace.  Voters chose the more militant Netanyahu to replace him.   But the process moved on, and the PLO transformed into Fatah, there was a Palestinian government and a Palestinian Police force.And then in 2006 when Palestinians got their first chance at a election, they threw out Fatah for having made peace and they voted in Hamas who refused to recognize Israel's right to exist.  The Palestinian people voted for war.  They hated Israel more than they wanted a homeland.And here we are today and neither side wants peace and it seems as far away as it has ever been.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"I like their vibe, their cheerleaders are hot and they have guys that run really fast with big flags when they score","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Id say hell yeah.

For trans people, pronouns ultimately represent acceptance and affirmation of their identity, so they are voluntarily provided for others since it's not always clear.

Is it a simple thing to provide? That can be debatable. But not wanting to provide pronouns isn't inherently transphobic. For a lot of people, it's just annoying. If they're already respecting other people's preferred pronouns, that's already enough. Why do they need to go even farther?Not using someone's preferred pronouns is rude, because that is disrespecting that person's identity. Expecting everyone to state theirs as a further affirmation of trans people is unreasonable. It is very similar to asking someone of a different faith to follow your own faith's rules.

He did sign the checks to provide weapons, but European countries were going to rally behind Ukraine anyway, and of course all the actual fighting was done by the Ukrainians.?If anything his policy has been muddled and weak, dithering and delaying about providing long range missiles, then giving in, and having no real plan to achieve victory or end the war.??Unified and eventually facilitated the expansion of NATOThis has almost nothing to do with Biden at all. Its amazing how much he talks about NATO as if he owns it, while in reality Sweden and Finland joining was down to Sweden and Finland not Biden.??This is before we even start on the progress made in the pacific, namely Taiwan, the Philippines and The Quad, towards curbing Chinese ambitions of expansion and influenceThis is also mostly empty rhetoric. Bongbong Marcos becoming president of the Philippines (and thus changing from Dutertes policy) was not down to Biden, and he has done very little to actually improve protections for Taiwan, or Hong Kong, or really achieve any positive change in the region at all.?Merely talking about Standing strong against China! is the kind of meaningless posing American presidents do when they want to look tough to uninformed domestic voters.??Now were seeing Assad be overthrown while hes still in office.Also nothing to do with Biden. Indeed, Bidens administration put sanctions on HTS, the group that overthrew Assad, and a huge bounty on its leader, and were taken thoroughly by surprise when Assad fell.??Israel is just one foreign policy area, and frankly not remotely the most important to American interestsThis is like saying the Iraq war was just one policy area for George W Bush.?Biden sent billions of US taxpayer dollars in money and weapons (which could have been used for, e.g. Ukraine or indeed to save lives in Gaza) to Israel, and **directly** made repeated decisions to enable the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people, the displacement of millions, and the mass destruction of Gaza, south Lebanon and now Syria.?Unlike NATO enlargement, the fall of Assad or the Philippines election he made a huge difference here for the worse, dramatically increasing the death toll and carnage by giving unconditional support to Netenyahu, preventing an end to the war by blocking international pressure on Israel, destroying the reputation of the US and all the credibility it gained by supporting the rules based international order over Ukraine, and leading to the deaths of US citizens.??supporting Israel was the pragmatic thing to do, even if domestically unpopular, see conditions for above events in Syria, and our shared interest in Hezbollah and Iran being neutralizedAgain, this is the problem with blinkered thinking. Instead of just stating shared interests, try to think about what those interests actually are. First, I would strongly argue that supporting war crimes and genocide is **NOT** in the interests of the US, or US values.?\\nSecond, the main shared interest people cite as to why the US should pay for a horrific war (and war crimes) against Hezbollah and Iran by Israel is  to help and protect Israel.?In other words people like Biden seriously claim that the US should subordinate its foreign policy to support Israel in order to  just support Israel. Its pure circular reasoning.?**TL;DR - the things Biden wants to claim credit for (Ukraine defying Putin, NATO enlargment, Assads fall, Taiwan not being invaded) had very little to do with him.?Conversely the places he did make a big personal impact (the withdrawal from Afghanistan, helping to perpetrate horrific war crimes and possible genocide in Gaza, enabling Israels military expansionism were almost unmitigated disasters and a horrific moral stain on his legacy.**","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"With other presidents we could go months without hearing anything about them.

The US won't let Israel start a war with Egypt to displace the Gazans. But they aren't going to force an Israeli surrender, which is what giving Palestinian's citizenship and the right of return would be. And it is unlikely the US would even be able to without extreme measures. Israel would switch to China if it had to. Part of the Palestinian's problem is that Israel has valuable economic and technological assets to offer allies, while they have to beg to feed themselves. Israel is the 10th largest arms exporter, a record $13 billion in 2024. Israel's economy is the size of Sweden or the UAE, much more than Egypt. They buy their F-35s, for an important example of Israeli solvency. \\"The problem with the idea of Palestinians surrendering is that they tried that.\\"Surrendering as in negotiating from an acknowledged position of defeat to get more autonomy and whatever land they can. No Palestinian leader or group would even be seen as legitimate within Palestine if it tried. Palestine has more leverage than say the Yazidis or the Kurds. But they waste it by demanding concessions Israel will never give, most especially the right of return for all descendants.Displacement is a common result of similar situations, and simply decreeing it unacceptable does not make it impossible or even improbable. The world is a harsh place, and Palestine is not in a strong position to live by the sword. That said, it's simpler to return a rump Palestinian state to Israel's neighbors if the Palestinians are simply getting ignored.I wouldn't categorically say violence doesn't help them, car bombing Netanyahu is worth trying.
