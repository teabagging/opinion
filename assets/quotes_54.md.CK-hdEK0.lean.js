Ask the Vietnamese.  Look at Korean history.  The Burmese might have something to say about that.And during that whole time when China was the greatest power in the world, they weren't trying to promote human rights or civil rights within their kingdom, or anywhere else in the world.  China's Emperors certainly weren't promoting democracy.  Their emperors were largely promoting Empire.I acknowledge that there are human rights activists and revolutionaries in China.  They're not the ones who would be in charge of maintaining a rules-based global order in the scenario where China was the global superpower though, would they be?  No, I think it would be the other guys, the ones currently suppressing all of the Chinese human rights activists and revolutionaries.I never claimed the West invented everything.  That is a strawman.  I claimed that the west has done a lot of good along with all of the bad, especially in regards to the elevation of the same human and civil rights you think the west works to destroy.Nor did I claim America is some supreme moral commander, again, a strawman.  I do think that America has done more good than bad in the world, especially if we're looking at her history post-WW2 when it began embracing the rules-based order and moving away from the \\"Might makes right\\" global order that had been in place for all of human history before then.  That belief doesn't mean I refuse to acknowledge all of the bad America has done.  I can talk about all of that in great detail.  That doesn't mean I don't challenge America to do better.  I think you're angry at America because things are not as great as they could have been.  America has not always behaved as great as it could, neither has the west.  That's fair.

This was not out of some moral ideal but a practical self-centred decision. And this is also proven by the fact that they maintained control over their previous empire -- several countries for long after they de-colonized some others..And this is not my personal opinion--you can refer to any respected British historian (white historians like William Dalrymple for example whose own ancestors were part of this group of colonizers incidentally) on why the British stopped colonizing the world and the Empire was slowly pulled away-- it was not out of some umm principled moral stance like you are painting it to be. It was a strategic move based on the new organizations they were creating to control the world..And their need to position themselves as arbiters of morality and also escape necessary reparations and moral obligations to previously held colonies.And as to your comment about the Navy, mark my words and you can set a reminder, in the next 10 years, you will see new world alliances forming and a resurgence of the very nations you believe will fail because of ONE decision of ONE administration.

Are they still taking donations? Very little of that 1.5 billion they made during their few months of campaigning was actually put into advertising. And they kept asking for donations months after they knew they lost, if theyre still taking donations now that is. And that money isnt going into Harris private bank account. If it is then its just confirmation that it was the biggest scam in American history on the working class Americans.Lets think about good old fashioned communism. Strange that the deep state keeps attacking Russia and they would do nothing to retaliate when Putin is one of the most powerful and richest men in the world. By your and most peoples standards. Ukraine was a good example of that as Hunter Biden was named a chairman at a private gas company just as the war kicked off from another leaked and failed CIA operation to mess with Russia. But thats what Russia wanted, isnt it? To own more land and deport or send in more people into the United States. Trump says our problem is coming from Mexico and gets weird when he talks about refugees a d illegals, and if youre right, an army of drones are coming. Maybe it is for national security?He failed to build his wall last term he was elected. He could build a virtual wall to monitor and protect the southern border. Id say hes welcome to it. But what about all those people that have been evacuated from war torn countries over the last, say sixty years? Elon Musk has over hundreds, as of right now, satellites orbiting the Earth as we speak. Perhaps we could point some of those with cameras down at some of these states in the United States. Have we enough people in these states now to create separate states? And what would that do to the Federal government? Theyre already paying for budgets in fifty of them. That budget would double. Scary thought. Rats, snakes and all the rats in the room get twice as fat. But a well fed animal is less likely to strike.Theyre all fighting each other and looking to eat one another. And the lions tigers and bears are all just watching to wait and see who will win. A few of them are in the ring with Trump. If random social media posts you read online are actual news of the times. Musk would be a tiger. You never know if hell turn on you and just strike you down. Can you imagine him angry? Thats a scary face, just like a tiger. Hes poking at RFK with his conspiracy post about the right wing and six months. Giving him the paw because maybe he doesnt even believe his approach to the election. Maybe hes competitive and hes looking for more views or attention. My sister-in-law devoutly worships him but I dont see it. My brother-in-law hates him religiously and I dont see why. He said he wants to regulate AI. So hes going to control three major technologies that are going to flourish across America. Or he plans to. That would be nice.

Men aren't known for complaining if a woman cops a feel off his chest, let alone leers at it. Either less of that is happening; in which case women aren't as tempted; or men don't mind it as much; in which case women see their chests as more intimate than men's. If the former, showing off is more overwhelming to those with less willpower than myself, and if the latter, showing off is a more extreme case of vanity, albeit less extreme than showing off the vagina. (Though \\"leering\\" is also rather subjective, and I don't know if I avert my eyes more quickly than others do... if I don't, then the difference is clearly that I'm cute enough for them not to mind because I've never gotten flak for it.) But the acceptance of the gender role that her chest is more intimate, paired with the rejection of the notion that showing it off is more extreme, seems at odds.  \\n2. The beards part is covered above... as for yoga pants, it's setting by setting. I'm okay with schools having stricter modesty standards than society as a whole. I don't know why... but what I do know is that opponents thereof are the same people who smear school principals as pedophiles for enforcing the rules, so that alone reflects poorly on their worldview, and therefore on everything the comes from their worldview, including their opposition to school dress codes. So if yoga pants are a mild case of vanity (and they obviously are a very mild one if so; she isn't displaying the exposed skin *directly*), not extreme enough to resort to censorship over in society as a whole, I wouldn't dismiss the possibility they might just be going a little too far for a school, though I'm on the fence about them in and of themselves. I've never thought yoga pants particularly erotic myself, especially compared to that which exposes skin directly, but I'm just one guy.  \\n3. See, this is the sort of thing that hurts in my mind's eye the credibility of modesty culture's detractors and therefore partly boosts that of modesty culture itself. Why is making modesty standards stricter seen as a slippery slope to burqas, but making them less-strict not seen as a slippery slope to public nudity?  \\n4. Sounds to me like the problem is some people being lazy enough to outsource content moderation to AI in the first place.  \\n5. See point #1.  \\nThe societies that supposedly don't see breasts as sexual are statistically among the more flatchested ones (see world maps of breast size). It makes plenty of sense that breasts less drastically different from those of prepubescent girls and/or underfed women would be seen as \\"cute\\" instead of sexy. When it comes to larger breasts, no amount of exposure can desensitize males. The Internet is chock-full of buxom women showing off their large breasts and this still hasn't diminished the ability of showing off to catch males' attention.  \\nI get that there's a tradeoff here. If there's even a chance that displaying her breasts might have been genuinely intended as a form of protest and not a form of vanity, it's a tad unfair that a cop has one more thing to charge her with. But it's also unfair that women see their chests as so much more intimate that leering is so much worse than the gender flip thereof, but showing off is not.  \\nBy the way, what do you make of the notion of men's chests not being as fanservicey as women's in the context of fanservice (see also Cracked editorials about sexist superhero outfits)?

While some see the inequality of this particular cultural construct, the construct still exists and could cause problems to women from those who do sexualize womens breasts. I know this does not answer the question but instead of just looking at what is fair and unfair, I think we should also consider the culture we live in and not just ask why something is unfair, but what would realistically happen if we started doing that thing.

Several early Western travellers to China and India raved about the governance of these countries- right from 400 AD to the late 1500s. American over-consumerism and climate colonization- read how the West and its use of climate colonization to subdue poorer nations and gets away with it is something that was created in the West. Over use of plastic, the contribution to global waste-- all American contributions to the world. So I don't think America is some sort of template for how the should be or other western powers. Also you are equating current Chinese leadership with China at large despite the fact that there are human rights activists and revolutanaries in China and other countries you think are too morally inferior to lead the world--who are bastions of everything from worker rights to press freedoms. So in the same way as Donald Trump is not America, current Chinese or Indian leadership is not China and India. The works and thoughts and philosophies of people like Arundhathi Roy, Makarafna , Changese , Dhillon, Chin Mai are examples of stuff that the West could learn from and welcome. There are incredible thought leaders in China and other so called morally questionable countries who the West could use as an example.And you may ask---Western nations invented everything --you are wrong. Free Eastern nations invented tonnes and continue to do so. Everything from astronomy to Math-- the concept of 0. But also the earlier concepts of plumbing--flush toilets, theory of numbers, radio broadcasting was invented by India and Indians.  Chinese, Japanese and Koreans have also contributed significantly to the modern technology we use currently..All of this progress was obviously stifled by colonial rulers and the colonization of patents and ownership rights--another example of \\"those who create the laws also dictate who benefits from these laws\\" etc.P.s..The UN is not a rule based global order-- it was always designed as a system for existing world powers to continue to remain world powers and international trade negotiations are an example of that unbalanced world order at work. My deductions may be different from yours. I believe cultural or racial supremacy and nations and humans' need to claim such superiority is what has created the current imbalance in the world. There is much the West can learn from the East--yes even China, India and even the Middle East.  And vice versa. But claiming moral superiority because of how little we know about how the West puppet masters the world is what's dangerous..I have a slight libertarian streak and believe Edward Snowden exposing American hypocrisy was a big step in changing things globally and how we perceive international morality and America's so called commandering of it. If you look at the ways in which America and other 5 eyes spy, intelligence gather, break international treaties and the very democratic ideals you believe they created (they didn't btw), you would realize that the idea of only a handful of nations being allowed to lead the world is based on a false premise of moral superiority and supposition of law abiding-ness that is not based on fact. Like everyone gets up in arms when China spies on America in various ways or Russia when America does the EXACT same thing to other countries. LolI might have a different view from yours, simply because I wasn't born in America and my world view is crafted by having spent time in many different countries over the course of my career (UK, Canada and China to be precise) but this supreme moral comander role that you bestow on America is an unearned honor in my humble opinion..","title":"Aggrieved white men are a threat to democracy  history tells us we can't ignore them"},{"text":"No the reason Western civilizations progressed and lead the world currently is not because they are better but  because they created the dominant geopolitics that the rest of the world is governed by.So UK for example colonized India--a country far, far wealthier when the invasion occured ( read William Dalrymple (A British white historian who has dedicated his life to studying India's comments on the tremendous wealth of India at a time when the UK was rife with disease, malnutrition and rampant poverty, inequality etc ) on how UK was suffering from dire poverty and was dwarfed by the sheer scale of wealth and trade and other progress of the Indian sub-continent. This wealth was then systemically looted through violence, through fraud, through commercial scams which in this day and age would make these countries subject to international sanctions and prosecutions for violation of trade laws..At its start, India was the wealthiest world power--at the end of British rule where UK interfered in everything from Palestine and Israel--it was the poorest. Britain and America (amongst other world powers) then dictated how the world operated and who would make these choices/get a vote etc--so the UN supremacy was dictated by these victors who summarily isolated these other countries from getting a seat at the table or a fair fight at world domination. This global world order has gone unchallenged for decades but now faces a threat from a formidable foe: China. Everything from world trade and prices/global currency donination oh and even wars were dictated by colonizing powers that then became the modern UN so other countries were not allowed entry or supremacy. This global hegemony made these other countries have a harder climb to success and progress. Because everything from nuclear power (read about India and USA nuclear relations and how unbalanced those negotiations were in the 2000s because USA will never allow another nation to become the same superpower as itself--its a really good example of unbalanced geopolitics at play ). China's continued progress is a testament to challenging this hegemony and whatever human rights violations may be happening within the country (USA and other western nations are equally guilty of --not always or only towards its own citizens but other citizens as well--cheap production paid through slave labor, climat colonialism, war funding, backdoor weapon manufacturing negotiations, spying and even active warfare etc) so the hypocrisy always sticks out when Western nations pretend to be the bastions of world morality. I'm American but was born in India and spent my formative years there and was alive when many of these negotiations took place. The desire to change this world order by forming blocs and divesting from USA's control of the world is what the future is going to bring inevitably. And we will see how the structure of the world and its interdependence has made certain goals and fights insurmountable for other countries or rising nations. Sure some of it is their own fault but a lot of it is the structure of the world being what it is and being dictated by what has so far been a coalition of a handful of nations led by some of the biggest war criminals in the world who never faced any retribution for their centuries of crimes.As to your claim --Western civilizations did NOT change world order--they dictated it. Theres is a difference. There were a handful of countries who made these decisions. So for example, while western nations controlled the Nuremberg trials and dictated reparation conditions for Germany, they themselves never issued reparations to other countries and humans THEY and THEIR empires and laws brutalized. American slaves and Indian civilians.Not a single crime committed by British generals in India was ever prosecuted (this is not my personal opinion, this is confirmed by British historians themselves--read the world of any respected British historian and you have your evidence), nor was any crime by American slave owners- no reparations , no retribution. Nothing. They got off scott free while imposing morality on other nations who committed the exact same crimes. British and USA failed Jews by denying them a home and refuge in their countries, summarily closing their borders and post that, using Palestine-- a British colony as the seat of their experiment to house them independently. They didn't try to find a home for displaced Jews within their borders so basically Winston Churchill-- a grotesquely racist PM who is lionized by the British and many in the West-- is responsible for the current conflicts in the middle East--but in the press is described as hero. Thankfully the Irish and the Indians remember Churchill for who he really was. After India fought for freedom and won- the British orchestrated a mind bogglingly cruel departure (a fact every single British white historian of note accepts as fact) that left the country deeply impoverished and suffering from extensive famine..meanwhile, this was not something that the British ever paid India for or assisted India with despite in so many ways being directly responsible for it. So Indian soldiers were forced into battling in World wars fought by their colonial rulers but had no rights to vote on anything. After squeezing out every bit of wealth from India, stealing, looting, killing--they in the decades post independence ensured India never got a table at important world organizations. I might have a different view from yours, simply because I wasn't born in America and my world view is crafted by having spent time in many different countries over the course of my career (Britain, Canada and China to be precise) but this supreme moral comander role that you bestow on America is an unearned honor in my humble opinion..","title":"Aggrieved white men are a threat to democracy  history tells us we can't ignore them"},{"text":"Son of a bitch!??","title":"Biden selling parts of wall for $5"},{"text":"Asians are a Model Democracy?\\nIts pretty much just South Korea","title":"Asians are a Model Democracy"},{"text":"Foreigners usually have to pay for healthcare in most European countries.

Another interpretation of this data is that immigration reacts directly to labor demand. There's an increase in labor demand, so labor magically arrives to fill that gap, legally or not. Isn't that good?It seems to me that finding solutions that enable labor to fill the demand would be better than restricting the inflow of labor because regulation is slowing down the growth that would match that increase in labor.Imagine if we were to flip this to capital inputs. Imagine that your business suddenly has double the raw materials available to make stuff with, and you refuse to hire more people to be able to transform those inputs, thereby creating a bottleneck where the raw materials are going bad and not producing more output. In that case I feel like most people would say you're running that business poorly.","title":"Okay, so maybe tight labor markets really are what drives illegal immigration"},{"text":"Comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

If you use selfish-less acts to alleviate your loneliness, its by definition for your own good and is therefore still selfish.I think it has a lot to do empathy, culture and boundary.If a society advocate independence, moving out as an adult, toxic hardworking, expandable (non loyal) employees, dividing working class for political gains, etc, people will find it hard to find community. While in places such as church, people are encouraged to ask for help, help others and share, people feel much less lonely.A re-structure of societys values and culture is not enough, because in modern society, those are more like byproducts of economic and political structures. How much power big corps and governments have will have huge impact on cultures. Like because people are poorer, its now ok (in US) to live with your parents, and this will lead to more family bonds, but less privacy available for dating. The dating app and social media (companies) impacting dating culture making people in the dating pool (averagely) more lonely or anxious. The apartment units, the design of building structure. Work life balance making it hard to have quality leisure time with friends or family.You want to feel less lonely? I think its simple: ask for help, and offer help. Thats it. A even more sustainable way is to find one or multiple long term group or partners who you can empathize reciprocally and help / be helped often.

The world they grew up in is very different than now. I was met with essentially disbelief from mow 50+ yr old co workers. They seemed to want it somewhere in the 70s range. Even then, they seemed to want to sub in instead of an age limit, a medical competency review that would determine if they were able to continue. I think that is how the elderly politicians see things. They can't see doing anything else. They generally don't have to go into work every day, year round. They can take off at any time to do basically anything and generally have no KPI to meet on the day to day.

So any space where women cannot be topless, men shouldnt be allowed to be either. Im a gay man and I think a mans chest is the most sexually appealing part of the male body. I dont know how straight women or other gay men view it, but I think a guys chest is hot. So I definitely wouldnt want men to go shirtless if it was a professional work environment. Even if its lawn work outside, if women cant do it then men shouldnt be able to either. Both genders can wear tank tops if need be. But its not appropriate for men to go topless in many situations in which we currently allow them to (but we dont allow women to), in my opinion. So I agree with you but in the opposite direction.

Second,?the comparison between a person on house arrest and someone in prison for a DUI doesn't quite capture the complexity of the situation. \\"Good behavior\\" isn't just about avoiding further crimes; it also reflects an individual's willingness to engage in rehabilitation, comply with conditions of their sentence, and show remorse for their actions. It's not an endorsement of the crime committed, but an acknowledgment that someone can make strides toward reform while serving their punishment.Moreover, the concept of \\"good behavior\\" can still have meaning even if the person is under house arrest. If someone is complying with their conditions, refraining from further illegal activities, and demonstrating some degree of accountability, these actions are relevant in evaluating their sentence and potential for future behavior. The purpose of punishment isn't just to incapacitate, but also to promote rehabilitation and reflection, and to give the justice system a framework to assess someone's potential for reintegration into society.\\nWhile the issue of white-collar crime and unequal treatment by the justice system is valid, it doesn't invalidate the concept of evaluating good behavior in sentencing. The fact that a person may have committed a white-collar crime doesnt mean we should entirely dismiss the notion of reform or rehabilitation  or the possibility of someone demonstrating genuine change, even under house arrest.

Perry had driven into a crowd of protesters during a Black Lives Matter protest following the May 2020 police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Foster, who had been legally open carrying an AK-47, approached Perry's vehicle, and Perry shot and killed him. Perry claimed that he had acted in self-defense, but in April 2023, a jury found him guilty of murder. He was acquitted of an aggravated assault charge. On May 10, 2023, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder.[3] Perry had made numerous posts and direct messages on social media where he had expressed his desire to shoot protesters, which, along with contradictory statements to eyewitness accounts, brought into question his claim of self-defense. Following his murder conviction, messages Perry sent of him self-identifying as \\"a racist\\" and of him calling black protesters \\"monkeys\\" were revealed to the public.[2] On May 16, 2024, Texas Governor Greg Abbott pardoned Perry after recommendation by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.[4][5] The Governor had requested a pardon recommendation from the Board, and he had ordered them to expedite the process.[6][7]Note that the govvernor of Texas picks the parole board, so if he instructs them to recommend a pardon, it's not an independent recommendation.","title":"Warrens Reaction To UnitedHealthcare CEO Murder Cements Democrats As Party Of Violence"},{"text":"Shes a 10 but plays Tucker Carlsons podcast in the living room at max volume","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"She was super out of it at the end.

Sit down, let me explain something to you.  None of them are friends.  Bezos and Musk are not friends.  In fact, they're competitors in the quest for NASA contracts, and the competition isn't friendly.  Enter Ole Richie Branson, and he wants a piece of that action, too!It's pretty cutthroat at the top of the pyramid.  It's like playing the children's game \\"King of the Hill\\" on mega steroids.  There's only one spot at the very top, and there's a whole bunch of others trying to take it.  So, you have to fight them all off for as long as you can.  Depending on how hard you're pushed, that's how far you'll fall when unseated.  Then, the other guy gets to stand atop the hill, but, the crowd continues to come.  The crowd is always coming, and the person at the top is always changing.Those are the quadrillionaires.  Not the billionaires or even the trillionaires.  The real wealth.  The real controllers of everything in town and the sheriff.  BUT, even they own individual towns and individual sheriffs, not a collective in lockstep that owns them all.Sure, it's rigged.  But, not for the billionaire, typically.  For the trillionaire, possibly.  For the quadrillionaire, definitely.  However, remember, they all want a spot at the top.  They're all fighting for it.  As they battle, you, with some gumption, can get yours.  Maybe even to the tune of millionaire.  Or, if you do it well enough and quietly enough, to the billionaire level.Forbes publishes their wealthiest list every year.  Trust me when I tell you that not everyone is on there.  There's a shit-ton of quiet wealth out there.  And many of them ARE doing good and altruistic things.  And the quadrillionaires are never named.  By design.It's the way it is, and it's the way it will be until we blow this rock to smithereens.  It's human nature.  Don't be all butt hurt about it, do something to put yourself in a position to make as much of a positive difference as you can.  With an average lifespan of less than 80 years, and life consisting of three distinct trimesters, the first where you're just trying to figure out who you are and where your pee-pee is, the second to make your mark on this world and the third to coast towards the afterlife, you really don't have a lot of time to be the difference you wish others to be.  Use that second trimester well.  Or, don't.  And we can go back and forth about those evil fuckers, but, again, I really don't have time.  I've already resolved I can't beat 'em, I don't wanna join 'em, but, I wanna try to come close to their level to see if I can preserve my moral code in it's current form as I rise higher on that societal pyramid.","title":"My conspiracy about the drones, theyre rolling them out because its essentially the   Patriot Act 2.0"},{"text":"Y'all gotta play more Sonic Adventure smfh","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 14, 2024"},{"text":"Referring to yourself?

Around 1890 a woman's ankle being revealed was considered sexual in England. There also appears to be some societal idea of feet being sexual currently in North America and probably elsewhere. There isn't really a way to control societal norms. You can attempt to influence or change societal perceptions. But it's difficult to achieve, and even if you do, it is impossible to predict the result. The best example I can give is viral videos. A video can go viral for any number of reasons, and can be perceived by the public in different ways. Once a decision has been made about a viral video, it is difficult to change societies opinion on it. As far as the internet goes, you already have what you want.

Use them as an official method to drive political action, community, and resource allocation, financial assistance, and so on. Going into official means instead of just loosely associated scattered niche \\"lefty\\" sub-communities is less as a means to satiate some centrist elite sense of officialdom nor anything like that, but moreso towards establishing a centralizing movement that's built from the ground up to help it's constituents at it's core. Protesting only works when the people being protested against have any sense of shame. They want to play oligarchy, fine. There's frameworks for this that hasn't been utilized yet. Honestly, i'm legitimately surprised that from what I could find, there's absolutely no prior examples of any Credit Unions that are directly tied to politics / party / movement, and after learning more about Credit Unions in general, I think that fact is an indictment against all currently existing political parties commitments to helping their voting constituents.I know that saying is much easier than doing, and especially asking that such an effort for people to establish these organisations themselves all over the place and expect them to be operated at a level of professionalism just off the bat is asking a whole lot, but I've been thinking about what could legitimately be done locally to try and help ease the coming chaos, and this is one of my best answers that's not an unrealistic solution.The Kamala Campaign could have dumped that billion dollars into establishing such Credit Unions across the country and completely flipped the paradigm as it's automatically an out-of-the-box campaign strategy that hasn't been done before, and doing such a thing and getting people involved would have had a much longer lasting beneficial effect than just burning on getting 1% lower centrist republican turnout than Biden got in the last election. This is probably an idealists interpretation on what could have been better spent on a Billion dollars - I don't know how far 1000 millions could have been stretched across the States, but literally anything is better than what the actual result was.we don't need \\"our own Joe Rogan\\", we need to bring back the third place and viciously defend it.

Bailey, 444 U.S. 394 \\\\[1980\\\\]). Despite theoretical options like lawsuits or lobbying, these have historically failed to provide timely redress for systemic abuses in healthcare. Only after Luigis actions did insurers reverse unethical policies, such as denying anesthesia to children. This demonstrates that his actions prevented greater harm, as the harm he sought to avert outweighed the harm caused.Fourteenth Amendment C Due Process and Equal ProtectionUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, no state may deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process or deny equal protection (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 \\\\[1886\\\\]). Health insurers, empowered by government inaction, deny life-saving treatments for profit, effectively violating citizens rights to life and equal protection. The governments failure to act leaves citizens like Luigi without recourse, forcing desperate measures to protect lives.Second Amendment C Safeguard Against OppressionThe Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms as a defense against tyranny and systemic oppression (District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 \\\\[2008\\\\]). While not a justification for extrajudicial actions, the amendment underscores the principle that citizens may resist when government and corporate systems violate their lives, liberties, and dignity.Mitigation and Public GoodCourts recognize moral justification and societal benefit when determining culpability (People v. Serravo, 823 P.2d 128 \\\\[Colo. 1992\\\\]). Luigis actions directly led to insurers reversing harmful policies, demonstrating a broader public good. The law allows for leniency when illegal actions bring about significant social benefits (United States v. Bergman, 416 F. Supp. 496 \\\\[S.D.N.Y. 1976\\\\]).Ninth Amendment C Unenumerated RightsThe Ninth Amendment protects rights not explicitly listed in the Constitution, such as access to basic healthcare. The argument follows Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), where unenumerated rights essential to liberty were upheld. Luigis actions sought to address systemic violations of these implicit rights caused by profit-driven denials of care.\\\\--The case of Luigi isnt about excusing murder but confronting the systemic corruption that drives people to desperation. When government institutions fail to protect the public and instead empower corporate greed to bankrupt, harm, and kill countless Americans, the larger systemic failures cannot be ignored. These defenses arent about justifying violence but exposing the harsh truth of a nation where justice often serves profits over people, leaving citizens without meaningful recourse.This mirrors the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr., who argued that unjust laws and systems must be opposed when peaceful avenues fail. As he wrote in his Letter from Birmingham Jail, an unjust law is no law at all, underscoring the moral obligation to resist systemic oppression. King himself was arrested multiple times during the civil rights movement, often for acts of civil disobedience, such as leading a march without a permit in Birmingham in 1963, where he authored his famous letter. Additionally, the FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover, falsely labeled him a communist and a national security threat, targeting him to suppress his activism.?Martin Luther King Jr., once labeled a terrorist and communist by the government to suppress his activism, was later honored and celebrated as a hero for his work and sacrifice. This shift reveals how such labels are often the tools of a corrupt system desperate to preserve itself, silencing those who challenge its injustices until history vindicates their cause.","title":"Bernie Sanders Says Defeating Oligarchy Now Most Urgent Issue"},{"text":"Or \\"played a major role in putting together\\" bills.

I challenge them to look inside themselves and ask three questions:1.  Do you want to have a billion dollars?\\n2.  Do you want to do the hard work to earn it and the hard work to keep it?\\n3.  How much do you think having a billion dollars would affect your current values?I'm a huge fan of Ayn Rand and agree wholeheartedly with her allegory of Producers, Looters and Parasites.  Of course, I would add Consumer and Failure to the mix.  Her allegory addresses those in the positions of higher power, leaving everyone else not categorized.Our time here in \\"life\\" is short, and it is up to the individual to decide which category they will choose to motivate themselves to pursue.  They can choose to produce, or conversely, never rise above consume, loot (in allegory, or, conversely, criminally), or parasite.  Or epically parasite and be categorized as failure.But, the consumer and the failure, in fact all of the other categories outside producer are in some real trouble without that production.Personally, I pride myself on chasing the title of Producer, and the ultimate reward of billionaire.  Although I probably won't get to that level, I'll make a difference along the way, to a degree, on a micro scale.  And, as the book relates to altruism, I would side on my moral code to guide me to what degree I can comfortably be altruistic.  It is my choice to make.The billionaires surrounding Trump are Producer level people.  Heavily critiqued by the parasites and the looters, who produce nothing.  For those consumers and failures that choose to join their chorus, know your place.  How does one consume without producers?  How does one fail when the producers succeed?I've grown weary of a government chock-full-o' parasites and looters.  They have done little to nothing to \\"Make America Great Again\\".  Because it was.  Back when the producers produced the living shit out of things.  The industrial age.  The rail barons.  Sure, there were robber barons, too.  But the consumer, the parasite and the looter all benefited from the production.So, let's let the billionaires have a chance to MAGA the country.  In spite of their varying degrees of altruism.  However, I suspect that Trump will watch them closely, since he's from their circle, and limit or eliminate the low altruism money grabbers from the crowd.  They'll derail the Trump train towards the legacy station at the end of the line.[https://allegoryexplained.com/atlas-shrugged/](https://allegoryexplained.com/atlas-shrugged/)I am John Galt.

Purchase of firearms may require a background check, but it doesn't require mandatory training. On top of that, many firearms used to commit crimes were stolen from lawful gun owners.

I'm not making trying to make this into a competition. The male example was just an example of a gender difference sexual regulation that I'm sure we all agree with. It was just to prove that gender double standards are not inherently a bad thing. Do you disagree with that? Like do you think men and women's actions should never be treated differently in situations like this? Like should a bulge be treated the same as a woman with tight clothes?Because if that's your position, that's a lower-level disagreement. But if you are fine with regulating them differently in certain circumstances, then the question would just be: is this one of those circumstances where it is allowed to be treated differently.2) I can't usually give 1-to-1 examples because men's sexuality is regulated differently than women's. Men aren't seen as \\"whores\\", they're seen as \\"creeps\\", \\"losers\\", \\"weirdos\\", \\"predators\\" if they overstep their sexuality. Again, it's not a competition. I'm not saying men have it worse because of this. I'm just saying we worry about different things.

His role was controversial because it coincided with his father, Joe Biden, being the U.S. Vice President and point person on Ukraine policy. Hunter was paid up to $50,000 per month despite having no prior experience in the energy sector. Critics argue this was a case of influence peddling, where Hunter was hired to leverage his father's influence to protect Burisma from legal scrutiny, particularly from investigations by Ukrainian prosecutors.China:* BHR Partners: Hunter Biden had business dealings with Chinese entities, most notably through BHR Partners, a private equity firm where he held a 10% stake. BHR was backed by Chinese state entities, and Hunter's involvement came shortly after a 2013 trip to China with his father, then-VP Joe Biden. The business included dealings with CEFC China Energy, where Hunter was involved in a joint venture called SinoHawk Holdings, which aimed at investment opportunities in the U.S.\\n* CEFC Deal: Emails from Hunter's laptop suggest a deal where Hunter and his partners would receive a portion of equity, with one email mentioning \\"10 held by H for the big guy,\\" interpreted by some as a reference to Joe Biden receiving a 10% share.Influence Peddling Allegations from Hunter's Laptop:* Emails and Communications:\\n   * Burisma and Joe Biden Meeting: An email from Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter thanked him for the opportunity to meet Joe Biden. This suggests, at the very least, that Hunter was facilitating introductions between his father and his business associates.\\n   * CEFC China Deal: Emails discuss the distribution of profits from a potential deal with CEFC, mentioning \\"the big guy,\\" which some interpret as Joe Biden. This has been used to argue that Joe was directly benefiting from Hunter's business dealings, although direct evidence of Joe receiving payments has not been conclusively shown.\\n* Other Evidence and Testimonies:\\n   * Devon Archer Testimony: Hunter's former business partner, Devon Archer, testified that Joe Biden was on speakerphone during meetings with Hunter's business associates, including those from Burisma and China, to sell \\"the brand.\\"\\n   * Bank Records and Shell Companies: Investigations by Republican-led House committees have uncovered bank records showing payments from foreign entities, including China and Ukraine, moving through multiple shell companies associated with the Biden family. These are suggested to be part of an influence peddling scheme.\\n* Lack of Direct Evidence: While there are suggestive emails and testimonies, no direct, indisputable evidence has been presented in public records or legal proceedings that Joe Biden personally profited from or was directly involved in these business dealings in a way that constituted illegal influence peddling. The phrase \\"the big guy\\" and other indirect references have fueled speculation, but they remain circumstantial.","title":"Ex-FBI informant Alexander Smirnov pleads guilty to lying about the Bidens"},{"text":"You're overly dismissive of the ease of safe knife use, and overly critical of the complexity of safe gun use. Keep it clean (needs training to perform safely).No, it doesn't. I've cleaned every single one of my firearms the first time by following a YouTube tutorial. Guns are mechanically simple and very straightforward. Dirty guns aren't any less safe than clean guns until you get to the point that the firing pin can't fall, which takes thousands of rounds and months of neglect.Keep it unloaded when not in use (esoteric, not immediately obvious).Not required for safety. Millions of home defense guns are loaded and ready for use at all times nationwide.Use the correct ammunition (not immediately obvious).It's all over the packaging and even written on the frame/barrel and in the manual. Even if you somehow miss all of that, incorrect ammunition generally won't chamber. The only common screwup is 300 Blackout and 223, but even then, most modern rifles have a headspace too tight to chamber them. I've tested this myself with my own AR.Even if you do use a rifle with very loose headspace that does manage to chamber 300 Blackout, the most common result is that the that the rifle contains the explosion with minimal damage. Serious injuries aren't particularly common.Wear eye and ear protection when possible (not immediately obvious).Failure to do so is only a danger in the long term; entire wars have been fought by soldiers with machine guns and no hearing protection, most of whom came whom with only mild to moderate hearing damage. It's very obvious that firing a gun without hearing protection is unsafe after the first round.Keep the barrel clear of obstruction (not immediately obvious; gun could blow itself up otherwise)The only possible negative result is destroying your barrel. This is obviously undesirable, but not a safety hazard unless you continue to shoot, since the rifle will no longer be accurate.Keep the Safety on when not in use (esoteric, not immediately obvious).Not required for safety. Millions of Glocks are carried daily with no safeties at all.","title":"CMV: The Second Amendment needs an amendment."},{"text":"Our ruling class keep people ignorant, time-starved, and in survival mode by design.??\\nI'd put it roughly 70% of it being a system-level problem, and 30% of it being personal responsibility.??","title":"There's an Epidemic of Ignorance."},{"text":"You got it dude!","title":"Bernie Sanders: A Mass Movement Can Beat Health CEO Greed"},{"text":"Already did.","title":"Democrats fundraising tactics arent just annoying.

Because of hormone imbalances caused by all sorts of lifestyle choices or even just biological predisposition, some men or boys grow breasts.Yet pretty much all censorship or criminalization of bearing chests is pinned on women. Now you might say \\"that's because women lactate and use the milk to feed offspring, and these men with some breast tissue don't lactate.\\"To that I'd respond by saying that many women do not lactate and have never lactated before. So, should we only consider breasts that lactate as sexual objects to be covered? Because that's closer to what your argument gets at. If not, then ban everyone with breast tissue from exposing their chests, including the many men that would fall under this no matter how modest their development is (people never cared about size when deciding to censor women anyway).","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"Is it just me or does this read like Dems are expected to just bend over and take it?

Rittenhouse gave Black the money, and told Black what rifle to purchase. What they did comes right from one of the examples on 4473. I just changed the names from Smith to Rittenhouse, and Jones to Black.[https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download)Question 21.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer: For purposes of this form, a person is the actual transferee/buyer if he/she is purchasing the firearm for him/herself or otherwise acquiring the firearm for him/herself. (e.g., redeeming the firearm from pawn, retrieving it from consignment, firearm raffle winner). A person is also the actual transferee/buyer if he/she is legitimately purchasing the firearm as a bona fide gift for a third party. A gift is not bona fide if another person offered or gave the person completing this form money, service(s), or item(s) of value to acquire the firearm for him/her, or if the other person is prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the firearm.EXAMPLES: Mr. Rittenhouse asks Mr. Black to purchase a firearm for Mr. Rittenhouse (who may or may not be prohibited). Mr. Rittenhouse gives Mr. Black the money for the firearm. Mr. Black is NOT THE ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm and must answer no to question 21.a. The licensee may not transfer the firearm to Mr. Rittenhouse. However, if Mr. Brown buys the firearm with his own money to give to Mr. Black as a gift (with no service or tangible thing of value provided by Mr. Black), ATF Form 4473 (5300.9) Revised August 2023 Mr. Brown is the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm and should answer yes to question 21.a. However, the transferor/seller may not transfer a firearm to any person he/she knows or has reasonable cause to believe is prohibited under 18 U.S.C.  922(g), (h), (n), or (x).So if Dominick Black had bought the rifle with his own money, and later gifted it to Rittenhouse when Rittenhouse turned 18, that would be ok.It's speculation, but I think it's likely the feds did not prosecute Black for doing this because they don't want to open up a can of worms with SCOTUS.","title":"CMV: Rittenhouse trial should have been tried at the Federal level, not State.

It is discriminatory to brand women's nipples as suggestive when the same is not done with men.

Even fully clothed professional headshots of female executives get turned into creepy compilations or get plastered across forums with disgusting comments. The reality is that allowing topless photos would create a massive database of non-consensual content that would be used to harass and discriminate against women in professional  \\nand personal contexts.Your argument about \\"cultural constructs\\" overlooks the real-world impact. Sure, breasts being sexualized might be a social construct, but so is money - and both have very real consequences in our society. You can't just declare \\"breasts shouldn't be sexual\\" and expect centuries of socialization to vanish.Exploitation stems from societal behaviors, not from women's choices to expose their bodies.We need to fix the systemic issues first, then work on individual freedoms. Putting the cart before the horse will only create more victims while claiming to liberate them.The real progressive approach isn't to push for surface-level equality that ignores context - it's to address the root causes of objectification and discrimination first.

That's why I mentioned it.  \\n  \\nI agree with you that all of our modesty considerations for what is inappropriate (including the ones pertaining to breasts) are socially constructed (if this is what you're saying).I argue that the current view of women's breasts as sexual is harmful and repressive, just as how I view Victorian standards of modesty are. Even if a society deems a woman's hair or her ankles or her voice obscene and not appropriate for public audiences, I don't think the mob should be the arbitor of what's acceptable and what isn't. I think most people on this subreddit (hopefully) can agree that even if middle eastern societies tell women they are vulgar or depraved for showing their hair, women should still be allowed the right to show their hair, especially since men can.That's where the overlap comes from. If we claim to value gender equality, there can't be special tolerance shown to men in this regard.To answer your last question, I personally think it's weirder or less normal for men to show their bulges in speedos than it is for women to be in skin-tight bikinis. This is just a product of what I'm exposed to, and I wouldn't use this as a reason to ban speedos. I think it would be a slightly different story if sex organs aren't covered and are instead exposed.

He is not interested in being a trillionaire if the buying power of a trillion dollars in the future will drop to the buying power of a billion dollars of today's money... He wants a real, strong economy where people are empowered to produce real value. He doesn't want a huge stake of fragile vaporware and political control. He would rather have a smaller stake backed by more real, stable economic power.\\nTariffs is a mechanism to reduce competition from companies in foreign countries which do not play by the same rules and where workers have fewer rights. It should make local products more competitive and encourage automation to happen locally instead of overseas. There will be hard times as we transition towards a more local economy. Local goods won't be as good or cheap as foreign goods in the beginning as local industry will need time to catch up.","title":"My conspiracy about the drones, theyre rolling them out because its essentially the   Patriot Act 2.0"},{"text":"I wouldnt be a bit surprised if at some point down the road Fetterman switches parties.","title":"John Fetterman calls for Trump pardon in Truth Social debut, cementing progressive pariah status | \\nCant believe I ever liked this dude."},{"text":"No amount of training will meet a standard of \\"always\\".Guns aren't that hard to aim, are extremely intuitive, and humans are pretty big targets.","title":"CMV: The Second Amendment needs an amendment."},{"text":"People are very uncomfortable using the word revenge, but as in cases like this we all viscerally understand its importance.","title":"Pa.

Is that about right?1) Whether or not breasts are \\"inherently\\" or \\"biologically\\" sexual objects I don't think should matter. Sexuality and inappropriateness is societally defined and agreed upon not something that arrives from \\"inherent\\" qualities. For instance, imagine someone saying that \\"words are just vibrations in the air, they're not inherently sexual. Therefore, I should be able to give graphic descriptions of sex on my kids show.\\" Or take a bannana and a mouth, both non-sexual objects. But, used in a particular way, we would consider the use to be obscene and not appropriate for children.Like it or not, currently women's breasts are seen that way. Maybe you want it changed. Maybe I want it to be ok to deepthroat bananas because that's just how I like to eat them. Both of us need to get enough of society to agree with us on that. We can't just declare that the rest of society is wrong and we are right.2) Gender inequality in sexual expression is a part of what society agrees on and is not necessarily a huge injustice or even a bad thing. As you said, people have different parts. Women's breasts are generally different than man's.For a gender difference you might agree with, do you think it's more obscene for a man to war a skin tight outfit with their bulge protruding out compared to a woman in a skin tight outfit with no bulge?

This system creates sharp class divisions between the rich and poor. The oligarchs, focused on accumulating wealth, often engage in predatory lending and economic exploitation of the lower classes.\\nAs inequality grows, the impoverished majority becomes increasingly resentful. They begin to see the wealthy oligarchs as corrupt oppressors. This creates fertile ground for populist leaders to emerge, who promise to champion the cause of the poor against the wealthy elite.\\nThese populist leaders - whom Socrates calls \\"protectors of the people\\" - gain support by promising redistribution of wealth and reform. However, once they gain power through popular support, they often transform into tyrants. They maintain their position through:Creating external enemies to unite people behind them\\nEliminating political rivals under the guise of protecting democracy\\nBuilding a personal guard force loyal only to them\\nMaking increasingly bold promises to the massesThe irony Socrates points out is that the people, in their desire to escape oligarchic oppression, often empower someone who becomes an even more oppressive tyrant. The tyrant maintains power through fear and force rather than just wealth.\\nThis creates an unstable situation that eventually leads to the tyrant's overthrow, potentially returning to oligarchy or another system. Socrates sees this as part of a cyclical degradation of political systems, moving from aristocracy to timocracy to oligarchy to democracy to tyranny.","title":"Bernie Sanders Says Defeating Oligarchy Now Most Urgent Issue"},{"text":"What do you mean pro crime?

If I was reading this in 2017, I'd be apt to agree with OP.  Trump is just one of them, billionaire corporatocracy doing their thing, two wings of the same bird flying in an optimal direction for their own well being, etc.But, Trump is an ego, and he is rich.  He is a super-egotist and not a multi-millionaire, a billionaire.  Next level money.I now contend that the yacht sized ego he has would never stand for having his name dragged through the mud for this long because he went and got himself \\"compromised\\" and was paying the price.  That ego would not allow the shame of the name as part of the game.  Or the reduction in his wealth to be listed in the history books as one of the many negative things they've said about him.I contend that this is about legacy.  The egotist's end game is almost always legacy.  How will I be remembered?Go back and look at the July 4th fireworks at Mt. Rushmore.  He had to do some major gymnastics to get the US Parks to allow the show on Federal land.  Look at some of the camera cuts to his face as he's looking at those chiseled POTUSs up there.  He was measuring his spot.But, the only way he'd ever get up there is by doing not bad things, or good things, only great things.  The \\"establishment\\" screwed him royally in Trump 1.0, Trump 2.0 is chasing legacy.  Hard.  And he's going to get it.Here's the problem.  There really is a bureaucratic deep state.  And that's your snake in the corner.  There really is a ruling class of politicians.  Those are your rats in the corner.  There really is a corporatocracy, of big Agra, big Pharma, big Healthcare, big bunch of bigs, along with a real-life military industrial complex as well.  These are lions, and tigers and bears in the corner.Take a look at this magazine cover:[https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQGvritiWveDuQ/image-shrink\\\\_1280/image-shrink\\\\_1280/0/1725880340463?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qD5GCeBWDsX2Juov68pzaVMsdCuUvWz3uopqiP2sblY](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQGvritiWveDuQ/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1725880340463?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qD5GCeBWDsX2Juov68pzaVMsdCuUvWz3uopqiP2sblY)If there ever was a more foreboding predictor of our future, IMHO, this is it.

Worse yet, they'll arrest us if we try and stop them ourselves. So we tried to burn down the police station.\\"Saying \\"Ah but that makes you also part of the chaos\\" is missing the point, largely. They're not alleging broad chaotic lack of enforcement.They're alleging anarcho-tyranny. In which circumstances, violent action against the state becomes an action in favour of order and the rule of law.So a violent coup against the government is perfectly in line with \\"Law and order\\" rhetoric. Democrats failing to understand this and using it as a retort sort of demonstrates they're a bit out of touch. Then wondering why the voters don't care. Because Democrats didn't understand the conversation and said something very silly in response to it.\\"You are an anarcho-tyrannical regime spreading lawlessness, violence, and chaos. We are going to overthrow you.\\"\\"Um, that makes you no better sweaty.\\".https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GUcVTNSasAAY5qX?format=png&amp;name=largeIf you imagine a straight up dystopian anarcho-tyranny society, it does make them better. Like, it makes them the heroes of the story. The question is whether America is such a society. They think it is. The stats say crime is down though... So...In fact the Democrat response furthered the narrative of Anarcho-Tyrannical rule by the Democrats (I'll push that narrative here to get it across, I don't really believe this:), because from their perspective suddenly the government were very capable of cracking down and arresting those who did disorderly conduct when it threatened the government and its continued promotion and toleration of crime and disorder. That's exactly how an anarcho-tyrant would react. A merely useless and ineffectual government would treat the Jan 6 rioters the same as BLM.However, because BLM merely caused chaos against the public rather than the government, it was supported and promoted. Jan 6 was against the tyrants rather than the public, so suddenly, they were competent at enforcement. Much like they're competent and overregulating and harassing law abiding citizens day to day. They *could* crack down on criminals and stop harassing law abiding citizens, but they don't want to. And not for reasons of being bleeding hearts, because their toleration is selective. (From here, the vibes split into several explanations for why, ranging from ideological, party political, to racial conspiracy theories).The Democrat empathizes with those who wish to do violence against the public, and seeks vengeance on those who seek to do violence to the government. That tells you all you need to know about whose side they and the government are on, especially in conjunction with progressive narratives about the evil America represents.Cast this way, the Democrats are an occupying force hostile to the country.","title":"Pa.

Soldiers for example accept that they are subject to martial law because liberal individualism simply doesn't work in their circumstances. In effect, by accepting particular roles, you accept you aren't so much a private individual but an agent of the state and can be treated accordingly where your actions in that capacity violate the rules. As such whether the individual poses a future threat is immaterial, it is a matter of the state posing a threat in the future, which it will if not punitively dealt with. Whereas normally that collective mentality goes against liberal values, as I said, we can say here it's different because it's an \\"opt-in\\" situation.Example:\\"Well this soldier can't do any more war-crimes if we just discharge them.\\".But a military that allows that to happen will go to shit. It must deal with the soldier punitively and harshly, regardless of future threat he as an individual poses.So it goes here for the Judge. See also; Cops.

However, from personal experience with chemical manufacturers/biopharmaceutical suppliers, there's a gray area when it comes to proprietary knowledge or trade secrets. This is often used to justify the patent exclusivity farming that pharmaceutical conglomerates do, as it entails small shifts in the formulation of things like vaccines so that the companies maintain business. The polio vaccine is step one-something that has been around for decades and is regarded as generally benign. On top of the mountain are the more recent vaccines that make use of untested mechanisms, such as the covid vaccines using mRNA delivery, which falls under the definition of gene therapy. There was a case where one of the manufacturers was petitioning to have the safety data sealed for something like 75 years in order to maintain non-liability, or something like that. And on the other hand, the American Heart Association published a study showing that the mRNA fragments from the vaccine lingered in the body for far longer than those of a natural covid infection. This resulted in more widespread cell infection, especially in cardiac cells, and presented as myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals who would have recovered from covid normally.","title":"Trump's 'Climate Threats' Have Demoralized the Eco-Scam Crowd (for Good Reason!) ??"},{"text":"$15M seems low, considering it could have cost Trump his Presidency, and hundreds of millions of dollars which is what GS was trying to do.

It's simply how the system naturally revolves around financial interests. The people that fund the Party and the candidates are the ones that essentially set the agenda. That's just how the system works. And there's an inbuilt tension within the Democratic party, that both tries to represent it's labour roots and also embrace the capital class. It was Clinton that essentially turned the party into one that embraced capital over labor and the party aligned with Reagan's Republican Party in being also a party of neoliberalism.It's not a conspiracy to believe the DNC is going to represent the capital class first and foremost because they fund the Party. So it's to be expected they need Senators that can help protect the interests of their donors when their more progressive base is pushing legislation that helps ordinary people. It's not difficult to understand\\n There will always be Democratic Senators that vote against party lines and back \\"fiscally conservative\\" or Republican positions. But even during periods when Democrats held a sizeable majority in both houses, they still were unable to pass legislation  that was seen to conflict with corporate interests, without huge compromises.  During the 2009-2011 era you had a larger number of Democrats that voted against the ACA, Dodd Frank, Cap and Trade etc. And I honestly think that's by design. Keep in mind the DNC plays a huge role in determining who even gets to run for the Senate. And they likely know how those candidates will vote before they are even elected.

They don't require you to close to arm's reach with a potentially physically superior attacker (necessary for disabled persons, elderly, smaller stature, or women).

If the assailant is within that distance, it makes little difference to your mortality whether you're armed with a gun or a knife.Firearms are WAY more effective at self-defense than knives...Blade injuries are also seldom instantly incapacitating...Which reinforces my point that guns are a greater public safety hazard than alternative defense weapons.

A knife requires you to be within arm's reach of an attackerThe left's issue with guns, which I am in agreement with, has more to do with public safety and their higher potential for collateral damage. At the end of the day, \\"knives\\" were only an example. Pretty much *any* weapon would be better than guns from a public safety standpoint.Your training comparison also misses the mark. Those gun safety rules are basic common sense that can be learned in a 30-minute video.\\"Easily learned\\" =/= \\"common sense.\\" Common sense refers to things that you should be able to figure out from basic logic and survival instincts. For example, it's common sense not to touch a sharp edge, because your survival instincts should tell you that sharp things hurt. It's *not* common sense to avoid pointing your gun at the sky, or to turn the safety on when you're not using it, or to keep it clean, etc. etc., because nothing about those things are obvious to someone who knows little about guns and could not be deduced from basic logic or survival instincts.The \\"well regulated\\" part historically meant \\"in good working order,\\" not government regulation.I know, I said as much. \\"Well regulated\\" historically referred to training and military exercises.This suggests you're approaching it backwards - looking for ways to restrict rights rather than protecting them. The 2A exists precisely because self-defense is a fundamental human right that shouldn't be subject to government permission.I addressed that already. I agree that self-defense is a fundamental human right. I disagree that self-defense *with firearms* is a fundamental human right. The right to self-defense does not automatically extend to possible tools for that endeavor.Look at crime stats in places with strict gun control like Chicago, DC, or California. Their gun laws haven't made anyone safer.Because guns are still available illegally, yes. These stats also can't prove that arming the \\"good guys\\" in Chicago, DC, or LA would lower the crime stats. For all we know, that might just make things worse.Meanwhile, constitutional carry states generally have lower violent crime rates. More guns in law-abiding hands = less crime.As the old saying goes: \\"There are lies, damn lies, and [statistics](https://www.thetrace.org/2024/08/permitless-concealed-carry-gun-super-bowl/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20studies%2C%20which,rates%2010%20years%20after%20adoption).\\"Your \\"Wild West\\" example actually proves my point.

There is a concept called 'beaten to death' after all.A person punched and knocked to the ground (likely) with the attacker continuing to attack is likely a lethal threat and could justify the use of lethal force.Self defense is about stopping the attack, not 'proportional response'. If a person punches you and stops, you cannot hit them back. Also, the force used to stop the attack must be reasonable, but that is not the same as 'proportional'. The standard for lethal force is credible fear of your life or serious bodily harm.

To paraphrase: If you get slapped, you can slap back but can't punch back. If you get punched, you can punch back but can't stab backThis is categorically false. The laws of self defense dictate that you can't use deadly force unless you fear for your own life, but there is no requirement of proportional force for that to be true. A 5'2\\" 110lb woman has every right to shoot  dead a 6'3\\" 240lb man who keeps punching her in the face. She doesn't have to wait for him to pull a weapon to do so. The law will be on her side.Secondly, your claim that in the wild West days shootouts were common is also not true. Gunfights like the OK Corall arent just famous because they're sensational, they're famous because they were rare. Gun violence was more common outside of established settlements for all the same reasons they're common today: people break into someones home to take their stuff or harm the occupants, and get ventilated for their efforts.The whole point of guns is that they're *incredibly* easy to use. You need a whole lot less training to effectively use a firearm than  pretty much any other weapon type, and your personal fitness doesn't really factor into your ability to shoot effectively (note I said *effectively*, not *well*). Military firearms training lasts about A week or two for basic rank-and-file, while specialists get maybe an extra 2-4 weeks of firearms training based on their designation. Police receive even less training, averaging anywhere between a few days to a week before they're considered \\"qualified\\". If you go to the range for a grand total of 8 hours every month, and a refresher safety course every 6 months, you're getting more weapons training than military and law enforcement do in the same 12 month period.The 2nd amendment does need an amendment, but to clean up the existing language, not to add new requirements. Every single barrier we place in front of public firearms access is another way by which those of limited economic means can be prevented from invoking their constitutional rights making them more vulnerable to corrupt and predatory actors.

They don't require you to close to arm's reach with a potentially physically superior attacker (necessary for disabled persons, elderly, smaller stature, or women). Even a height difference of 3 inches and a weight difference of 20 lbs can be a massive advantage without extensive martial arts training.Blade injuries are also seldom instantly incapacitating, as those vulnerable areas need training and practice to reliably hit. It takes FAR less training to effectively use a gun in defensive situations than a blade. The gun's penetration can simply damage organs or cause severe bleeding regardless of physical strength. I'll have maybe one fatal stabbing a year that ends at the scene, versus many with guns. The incapacitation disparity is simply that high.A gun is also much more reliable against multiple assailants. While struggling to effectively stab the first one, you're grappling with him, and the second or third is free to encircle or attack you with impunity.","title":"CMV: The Second Amendment needs an amendment."},{"text":"An 80 year old women with a gun is on equal footing with a 20 year old football linebacker.This is not true with a knife.","title":"CMV: The Second Amendment needs an amendment."},{"text":"They should bill her anyway","title":"Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi undergoes hip replacement after sustaining injuries in Europe"},{"text":"Why do I have to hear about this clown and his numerous hot takes every single day?","title":"John Fetterman calls for Trump pardon in Truth Social debut, cementing progressive pariah status | \\nCant believe I ever liked this dude."},{"text":"They assumed once they had someones vote they had it for life.They then move on to the next group thinking they dont need to worry about Joe schmo anymore.","title":"George Stephanopoulos and ABC apologize to Trump, are forced to pay $15 million to settle defamation suit"},{"text":"r/politics is in shambles?Sad, small people in that sub, I swear.","title":"George Stephanopoulos and ABC apologize to Trump, are forced to pay $15 million to settle defamation suit"},{"text":"This is reprehensible.

Lets use computer science teachers who, about a decade ago, were in high demand, but are now fairly common. So, under your policy, a decade ago, computer science teachers were making, say, $75,000 while regular teachers who taught less impacted subjects made, say, $60,000.For this theoretical, lets say salaries stay the same / no change (because we'd assume the inflationary salary bumps would even out/be the same % increase).So, fast forward 10 years. Computer science teachers are no longer in demand but, lets say, history teachers are. How do we rectify this since comp. sci. professors are making $75k (now low demand), history teachers (now high demand) are making $60k, and regular teachers are making $60k. Do we increase all teachers to $75k except history teachers who we increase to $90k? How much impact will that have on school budgets? That's a massive pay bump. Or do we decrease comp. sci. salaries to $60k (a 20% pay reduction) and bump history teachers up to $75k? And is it all history teachers or just newly hired history teachers? Or do we keep the computer science teachers who had $75k at $75 and hire any new ones at $60k, creating a massive wealth disparity between them? This is only one of dozens of questions that have to be answered for such a policy to work and the logistics of any one of these is going to piss a lot of people off and just aren't realistic.

A knife requires you to be within arm's reach of an attacker - that's extremely dangerous, especially for women, elderly, or disabled people facing stronger attackers. A gun is the only true equalizer.Your training comparison also misses the mark. Those gun safety rules are basic common sense that can be learned in a 30-minute video. The hard part of knife defense is actually being skilled enough to use it effectively without getting killed. Most knife \\"self-defense\\" ends with both people getting seriously cut.The \\"well regulated\\" part historically meant \\"in good working order,\\" not government regulation. The whole point was to prevent government from disarming citizens. The Founders had just fought a revolution against tyranny - they wouldn't immediately give the new government power to disarm people.The only reason I don't currently support gun control legislation is because the Constitution forbids itThis suggests you're approaching it backwards - looking for ways to restrict rights rather than protecting them. The 2A exists precisely because self-defense is a fundamental human right that shouldn't be subject to government permission.Look at crime stats in places with strict gun control like Chicago, DC, or California. Their gun laws haven't made anyone safer. Meanwhile, constitutional carry states generally have lower violent crime rates. More guns in law-abiding hands = less crime.

Trying to reach across the aislea fruitless gestureand refusing to fight fire with fire.Biden, along with other Democrats, failed to communicate clearly why issues that Americans cared most about were multifaceted and nuanced. Instead of bragging about economic metrics and job growth for instance, the Biden admin should have conveyed why issues like inflation were out of control, and even how the Trump admin and Republican policies contributed to economic issues that extended into his administration.Biden was stuck between a rock and a hard place when he stepped into office. If Trump had won the 2020 election, he would have faced the same issues, and it's very likely that outcomes would have been worse, and precisely due to Trump's previous foreign and economic policy.Democrats also failed to not just communicate why Donald Trump should have been disqualified from ever running for president again after events like January 6th, but they also failed to act on it.Instead, a large chunk of the electorate had essentially memory holed Trump's presidency, which was in itself a cautionary tale.What we can understand from this last election, is that Americans cared more about their immediate circumstances than anything else, including any threat that Donald Trump poses to core Democratic values. And many of these Americans are low propensity voters, they're not making politically informed decisions, instead, they're voting based on their *feelings*, And that's basically what got Trump elected, feelings...Republicans are much more effective at appealing to feelings, fears, grievances and phobias. This is what fuels their culture wars, and it's very persuasive.It also doesn't help that a large percentage of the American electorate trusts the information being delivered to them through algorithmic formulas on social media.Studies consistently show that misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors, propaganda, foreign disinformation efforts, lies and misleading data travel farther, spread faster and reach wider audiences on social media platforms where Americans receive more information than anywhere else.The truth is far less engaging by comparison. It's really a potent combination and a recipe for an uninformed electorate.Voters should have been better informed about both Biden's *real* achievements and Donald Trump's failures as president.But first...Trump is not the economic genius he's advertised as by him and his supporters, and he wasn't \\"better for the economy.\\"- Trump inherited a growing economy and he rode those coattails until a real crisis emergedthe covid pandemic. He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters.  - Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40%- Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin crippled the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*Trump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the consequences are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump criticizes Biden for the \\"trade deficit,\\" but in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.The Trump admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. As foreign policy goes;Trump escalated our country's wars in multiple theaters, leading to massive casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially increased the number of airstrikes. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the violent Saudi-led war against the Houthis. Trump dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone.Trump cozied up to dictators, Putin in particular, glorifying the world's autocrats and oppressors.Trump sought to veto Russian sanctions, aided Russian proxy wars, considered returning spy bases to Russia, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, repeated Kremlin propaganda, particularly about NATO, the annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine. He has proposed abandoning our western alliances, and even sided with Putin over our own intelligence agencies.Trump supported one of Putin's greatest goalsweakening NATO. Trump has both privately and publicly suggested withdrawing from NATO.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to NATO countries.Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but two historic war powers resolutions to end his support for the Yemen war and to mitigate the possibility of a potential war with Iran after he approved the assassination of Iranian Qassem SoleimaniDuring the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran upscaling its nuclear program.

Many families also rely on hunting to feed their families or to make a living. One quote Ive heard to argue against anti 2A arguments was from a Chinese immigrant who escaped China. She said Can you guarantee that the government will NEVER become corrupt or authoritarian or anything along those lines obviously the answer is no. The people who support the 2A but with intense and strict regulation are forgetting the true purpose of the amendment. Its not the governments place to hamper our ability to fight back if the population deems it necessary. Another issue is people who want a ban on assault weapons. The problem with this is that its not a real classification but a buzz word to scare ignorant people. An AR-15 is not used by the military and is no more dangerous than many hunting rifles that look less scary. Im fairly certain that the reason the AR-15 is such a popular choice among mass shooters is because the media says theyre more dangerous. Making them an attractive choice for a crazy and ignorant would he mass shooter. Simply put, its not the governments place to decide how its population can overthrow it.

If someone harms you and there's no state (or the state is too weak), then your reaction is to get revenge. This kind of cycle of vengeance has a long history. Criminal justice has many purposes. It keeps the dangerous away from society. It tried to reform the dangerous into the non dangerous. But it also necessarily involves a component of revenge, so that those who are harmed will not seek revenge of their own accord. We've already seen a small but durable segment of society lionize murderer because of their target. What now if the father of one of the children who's lives were ruined now murders this guy? Will they too be lionized on social media, enticing more copycats yet again?And if it becomes common enough, if it is seen that the rich and powerful are committing atrocities and escaping justice, might this not become a new societal ill, of people getting vengeance by their own hand because they think it was denied by the justice system?If people think the justice system isn't fair, they'll take justice into their own hands. And part of our somewhat irrational conception of fairness is vengeance against the unjust, as you explained so aptly.So if we don't want to descend into mob justice and street murders, we have to have enough vengeance against the unjust that society broadly agrees that personal vengeance is not only unnecessary but unjustifiable.  \\"Murder is wrong, but...\\" will only lead to more copycats.","title":"Pa.

Biden promised to be a one term president, he liedDebatable, I can find no actual public quote of him saying he'd only serve one term, but regardless since he did step down before the nomination he'd still technically be telling the truth.he didnt have an open primaryYeah there was an open primary though. Anyone could have challenged Biden and in fact several people did. They weren't good choices, but an open buffet is still an open buffet even if only a couple people take advantage of it. and he had no clue what was going on during the debateActually he seemed pretty cognizant at the debate to me, more that his mouth was operating faster than his brain, the cumulative effect of sleep deprivation and being sick at the debate. I mean, I was camping a short while later, people asked me who I thought was going to win, and Im like sleepy joe is going to lose.Sure, but realistically voters decided that a year or two ago when they decided to punish the party in power for the price of eggs. This wasn't just a US thing either, parties across the globe were losing election because of the post-pandemic spike in inflation. Biden screwed up his chance to change the trajectory at the debate, but really it was only then that liberal voters started paying attention to the polls and started realizing how screwed we are. Harris was fighting an uphill battle to keep enough distance not to be blamed for inflation but also to get people to the polls for her on short notice. She made the same mistake that Al Gore did though and it likewise cost her the election. Three weeks to step down and then they played king maker yet again, very 2016 folks, very 2016, thats a bunch of malarkey, malarkey I tell you!I mean the nomination was either going to Biden or Harris. Nobody with the influence to even potentially get the nomination was interested in challenging either Biden or Harris for it, and if they did they'd be in the same predicament that Harris was in. Ultimately 2024 happened the way it did specifically because Democrats were trying to avoid the mistakes of 2016 (and also 1968) where a bitter primary fight and the inability to rally the base lead a to low turnout and the party losing. Thinking a primary or another candidate would have changed the outcome this election is to ignore the deeper fundamental problems in our country, our parties and elections that ultimately always lead us to the same place.","title":"The Democratic Power Broker Working to Undermine AOC: Nancy Pelosi is reportedly working behind the scenes to ensure that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesnt secure one of the House's most powerful posts."},{"text":"Mars does not come from a word that means red.

However, the teach ers in most of those States belong to unions. For example, California is a right to work state. It also has strong teacher unions such as the LAUSD Union for Los Angeles teachers and its sister unions for administration and support staffs like janitors. Bus drivers for the LAUSD also have their own union. And these unions would never allow the sort of scheme you're talking about because it undermines the solidarity of the teaching pool. Your solution also doesn't account for the fact that all subjects are important within schooling. Nor do you seem to know that most teachers have Early/Middle Education degrees, rather than degrees in specific subjects such as Physics or Art History. The primary problem I see with your view, however, is two-fold. 1. If we removed administrative bloat and redirected those salaries to teachers (all teachers), we would address much of the issue with low teacher salaries across the board. Essentially, at the same time as we began including more and more levels of administration -- to deal with standardized testing -- while paying them each six figures, our school systems began seeing budgetary constraints they then took out on teachers. So, we already have a better solution for fairly compensating all teachers. Creating a rat race on a public good is a poor solution, especially when the money is there if it wasn't being misused.2. While K-12 teachers would like more appropriate compensation, given the importance of their jobs, it is usually not even in their top 3 problems/reasons for quitting or moving to the private sector. Lack of support from administration is the number one problem. From failing to back up disciplinary choices; failure to place children in the right programs to get them specialized assistance; to an overstuffing of the classroom that makes it impossible to keep under control (let alone teach); failing to support teachers in the classroom is leading them to leave public school teaching and stopping potential new teachers from joining. Compensation is a problem, but addressing it alone wouldn't even be a bandaid on a bullet wound.","title":"CMV: Teachers in subjects that are in higher shortage/demand should receive higher pay on the salary schedule"},{"text":"Watch \\"Old World Order\\" on Youtube or Rumble.","title":"Giants have been hidden from history: Top 10 GIANT Skeleton Discoveries in North America"},{"text":"Makita is the best value for cost.

Sometimes they're popular because they're easy, or fun, or your friends are in it.  You see this frequently with less intensive courses.  \\n2. While this happens, ideally we want stability when it comes to educating youth.  If teachers are constantly changing, students may suffer as teachers will have to build up effective lesson plans.  It can take teachers a few years to build up lesson plans that are effective with students for a subject, this can cause that process to repeat a few times which may be to the detriment of students.  \\n3.

Hobbies are very important and some hobbies might lead to career opportunities that you didn't plan for.

Some skillsets are just more applicable to the workforce than others.  English, Math, or Science are far more useful skills than, art or music.  I'm not saying there isn't value in art and music, however, the number of careers and jobs impacted by those fields are dwarfed by the number of careers and jobs impacted by english, science, or math.

Not to mention, not only does this run contrary to every story so far about how the opposite is true (Pelosi has been very welcoming and friendly to AOC), but for the next two years there is very little that will be \\"powerful\\" for any post a Dem holds. The GOP will have all the actual power, the leadership posts the Dems have will be mostly about visibility. Also, New Republic is basing this entirely on the fact that Pelosi is backing someone else for the ranking position on the House Oversight Committee. Someone who has a long history with Pelosi. This is exactly what happens if you decide as AOC did to be the leader of a cliquish, elite (the Squad is very ageist) group within your own party. As this article reminds us, Pelosi even said a few years ago the problem with that is that the Squad is just 4 people and 4 people don't get to dictate what the other 214 people do (I think the squad is now 6). How hard is that to understand? Worse, they represent districts that are **BEYOND SAFE.** No Republican is going to win those districts (which makes you an idiot if you give them money for general elections, money that more at risk Dems could have used more). AOC herself only won because the Dem who had that seat did not take her as a serious threat and did nothing to run against her. A few ads attacking her weaknesses and she would have lost. She did not win in any sort of landslide, she got 4K votes more out of 30K cast. And that's another thing that calls \\"bullshit\\" on this article - if Pelosi and the DNC establishment wanted her gone, they could easily make it happen by recruiting someone to primary her out. He only primary opponents for every election since have been fake Democrats the Republicans have gotten to run in that district. I am actually a big fan of Ocasio-Cortez, but I am very clear-eyed about the political realm she is within. If she wants leadership posts, she has to go earn them or have the political capital to demand them. As the representative from an effing D+28 district she has very little of the latter. Yes, the Dems love the excitement she brings to the party from young supporters, but those young supporters just failed to help the party in the last election up &amp; down the ballot.Pelosi is one of the most effective House leaders the Democrats have ever had. She is the reason Obamacare happened. Obama himself has said it. She is also fiercely loyal to the party and it's agenda. She is going to back whomever she feels, based on her own expert opinion, will be most effective in getting that agenda passed. But most importantly for the next two years, doing what they can to block the Republican agenda.That article also has something that should really make you question whether AOC is worthy of that position: **The Republicans want HER to get it.** Representative James Comer, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, who has spent years waging investigations into the political enemies of Donald Trump, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Tim Walz. Yes, the person who will be sitting next to whomever gets the job wants her. Do you really think he wants her there because he thinks she will be  strong opponent to the shit they are about to do? He has had the opportunity to watch both her and Pelosi's choice operate on the committee. Get. Fucking. Real.Worse part of this is that the person who should have replaced Raskin as ranking member won't even be in Congress anymore, Katie Porter.

They love paying more because only  the best country in the world can pay for more. Anything that costs more must be better.Unfortunately, in the socialised world, we care about each other and we don't have for profit entities mingled in every step of life saving healthcare.

Let me explain why this approach would actually harm our education system:  \\n  \\nFirst, differentiating teacher pay based on subject matter creates a toxic hierarchy in schools. I've seen firsthand how this damages collaboration between departments. When the physics teacher makes more than the English teacher, despite both having master's degrees and similar experience, it breeds resentment and undermines the collective mission of education.Have you considered how this would affect student perception? Kids aren't dumb - they'll quickly figure out which subjects are deemed \\"more valuable\\" by the system. This subtly pushes them toward certain career paths based on market forces rather than their genuine interests and talents. Is that really the progressive education system we want?Think about the diversity implications too. STEM fields already have serious representation issues. Creating a two-tier pay system would likely worsen these disparities, as teachers from privileged backgrounds would be more likely to pursue those higher-paying positions.Instead of playing into capitalist market dynamics, we should be pushing for universal teacher pay raises and better funding across the board. The real solution is organizing for systemic change, not pitting teachers against each other in some sort of academic Hunger Games.Also, your garbage truck driver analogy doesn't hold up - education isn't a product or service, it's a fundamental right.

But here is the truth about that plea deal.The deal had an unusual structure, involving both a typical plea agreement (which gets approved by a judge) and a diversion agreement (which doesnt). The governments promise of immunity for Hunter, which would usually be in the plea agreement, was for unexplained reasons in the diversion agreement instead  seemingly meaning Noreika would have no authority over it.Noreika thought this was odd. I am concerned that youre taking provisions out of a plea agreement that would normally be in there, she said. Was it crafted this way in the hopes she would rubber stamp it, she asked? Some further oddness, she observed, is that the deal then tasked her with reviewing whether that diversionary agreement was breached  but neither side could cite a precedent for a judge having that role.The main issue, though, was that question of Hunters immunity from further prosecution (which, unusually, was laid out in the diversion agreement, not the plea agreement). The key paragraph states:The United States agrees not to criminally prosecute Biden, outside of the terms of this Agreement, for any federal crimes encompassed by the attached State of Facts (Attachment A) and the Statement of Facts attached as Exhibit 1 to the Memorandum of Plea Agreement filed this same day.That is whats now being referred to as Hunters immunity guarantee.

This means that when hiring teachers, it's easy to advertise a much higher salary than would occur.  \\n- Teacher's would have trouble predicting their long term income.  \\n   - Let's say a subject has a large need for teachers so they advertise at a higher rate.  \\n   - This then leads to many other teachers pursuing that type of subject.  \\n   - This then leads to supply/demand going the other direction which leads to the highest earning teachers being laid off in favor of the newer teachers coming in at a lower rate.  \\n- Perhaps the state or the school is not interested in paying teachers much for a course that is \\"popular\\".  \\n   - For example:  You might have an art class that is very popular with kids in high school.  It's fun, they are hanging out with friends, and it's not too stressful.  \\n   - However, the state might not see much value in that type of class as students with those skillsets aren't as productive in the economy as those with STEM skillsets.  While I'm not saying art doesn't have value, it isn't a necessity for the economy which is why the meme about art students becoming baristas is a thing.  \\n- In addition to the previous point, the school and state should be investing in subjects that it feels will lead to their citizens having the best economic chance that increases the capabilities of the nation.","title":"CMV: Teachers in subjects that are in higher shortage/demand should receive higher pay on the salary schedule"},{"text":"ECon Musk","title":"Twitter is sick and out of control"},{"text":"bob woodward is such a political hack","title":"Bob Woodwards judgement of the Biden admin- what are your guys thoughts?"},{"text":"Even people on the Left are finally waking up to understand how demonic, delusional and corrupt Nancy Pelosi is and always has been.

The issue is, it was not \\"inevitable\\" that Hunter was going to be pardoned. The whole point behind Hunter's plea deal was that, as long as he was given reasonable punishments for the crimes he was actually convicted of, he'd plea guilty and be rightfully punished. And Biden was going to let it happen.Congressional Republicans on national television forced the plea deal to fall through. Which is just about the most vile miscarriage of justice possible, to use the highest governing body as a weapon for something as petty as purchasing a gun while under the influence of drugs. To make Hunter a political and national example, through extra-judicial public and political pressure.Biden was practically forced to pardon Hunter if he didn't want Hunter to be used as a political punching bag, and/or unique and unjust punishments.In this one particular scenario, the biggest thing to criticize, is that Biden still doesn't realize that what happened to Hunter is merely a symptom of the deep rot that infests our justice system. That it is 100% partial, and politically motivated, for EVERYONE. That Hunter was only an outlier in level of national attention, not in actual administration of justice.","title":"I Spoke at a Prison, Then Watched Biden Pardon Hunter"},{"text":"His wife and daughter are also principle free.

Maybe if they were given a different name, like Bidenthen FCC wouldnt even be a possibility.When I learned of President Joe Bidens decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, of federal gun charges and tax evasion, I frowned and shook my head in disgust.The problem is he tipped the scale toward his son. Virtually 99 percent of America would not have this opportunity. Hunters pardon does not say equality and fairnessit screams privilege, whiteness, and being above the law. This is disgusting and further shows there is one United States of America for you and Iand another for folks that look like and possess the status of Joe and Hunter Biden.For many Black people, such as myselfwho were born in povertythe Hunter Biden pardon reeks of the foulest scent of hypocrisy. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, then-Senator Joe Biden was heavily involved in the creation of the 1986 and 1994 Crime Bills.Seeking to combat the crack-cocaine trade that ran rampant in cities across America, the two bills caused a tidal wave in African-American communitiescreating a crack-cocaine sentencing disparity, skyrocketing mass incarceration, and disappearing a generation of peopleall because of crack.None of my friends, neighbors, or family caught up in the war on drugs ever received grace, a diversion, or another shot. They were all punished harshlylives ruined.Imagine living in a neighborhood that is a police stateconstantly being harassed while walking to school, seeing houses raided, arrested just because, and maybe assaulted and beatdue to the war on drugs.So, it leaves a horrible taste in my mouth when the Crime Bills chief authors sonwho has been afflicted with the same addiction that many in my community weregets a free pass.Look, I am no foolthe President pardoning his son was inevitable, but can we extend that same compassion to the thousands of men and women currently incarcerated due to drug charges?Hunter Biden did not grow up like that. He lived a life of privilege and wealth and had chance after chance of mistakes and terrible decisions.

And maybe theres something to this point if everybody keeps mentioning it to you :)Your point just seems predicated on not wanting there to be dead people laying around, which is a personal preference that I dont care to change your view on. But think about that youre suggesting - youre saying cemeteries are a waste of space so we should build something else instead. This implies that land itself is a particular limited resource in the area the cemetery is in, because you cant build this other thing you have in mind somewhere else. So were talking dense urban areas. I would suggest you do some research on the positive impact of green spaces in urban environments to understand the broad social good something like this inherently has (which a park also has). To continue that comparison, a park has an added value of its users being able to play sports and that sort of free roaming stuff. Cemetery doesnt have that same level of freedom for obvious reasons, but it has an emotional value to society that you cannot deny (even if you yourself dont feel that emotion yourself as somebody who prefers cremation). Nonreligious people also find solace in the closure that comes with burial, though not at the same rate as monotheistic societies (again, go do some research on that if you want). So both parks and cemeteries offer somewhat similar amounts of value to society, though with slightly different twists.Also, given that the issue is in urban areas as mentioned, you should compare the foot traffic of cemeteries in major cities vs parks. Because of course in a rural community people would have way more open space options for those same outdoor activities. I couldnt find this level of granularity in data so Ill just say anecdotally living in two major metro areas so far, cemeteries always seem to have people wandering through when the sun is out. To be clear, golf courses dont add any extra value to the greater society beyond being a green space so I agree with you there. But think youre overlooking the value cemeteries bring to most of a community in addition to its park-like qualities in major urban areas (which is where your argument seems to be focused). It just seems like youre letting your personal preferences get in the way of the reality of a society that has multiple interests and values that should be considered.","title":"CMV: We should get rid of all public graveyards and golf courses."},{"text":"Money.

I'm fine with Biden offering them, but a better approach for dealing with this is to set up a VERY deep pocketed defense fund for all of them.  I don't have much spare cash but I'd contribute.  Trump is going to have the resources of the entire government to bankrupt these folks.Trump's fascism is a bit different from Mussolini's or Hitler's in that he's going to use financial violence, not physical violence.  He knows none of his targets will go to jail, but that's not his goal. He wins if their careers are ruined and they are denied a proper retirement.  So, by accepting a pardon, these folks avoid the legal fees and get to retire in comfort.  That's a plus.On the negative side, when someone accepts a pardon they essentially admit guilt.  Unlike Hunter, none of the folks Trump wants to go after have done anything wrong.  It would be far better to put the burden on Trump.  What laws does he think they have broken?  What evidence does he have that they broke these laws?In 4 years, I would like a nation that sees Trump as the one at fault.  That can't happen if everyone accepts a pardon from Biden, but to turn it down without support is financial suicide.
