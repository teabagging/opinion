Technology based investments. These coins are basically equity positions for the companies of the underlying technologies. They are acting as proxies as equity investments for the underlying technologies.  \\n2.) Communities. Scarcity and access based investments. These coins act as barriers to enters to replicate entry fees for country clubs. You basically buy in with the coins, have to be a holder to join the community as the market cap raises it enables the devs, and whales to be able to sell some of their position to put on events and things of that nature so they need a strong roadmap. When they do it generates dips in price enabling rebuys at discounts and generates free marketing and pushes higher prices and the cycle can continue, the con is (Higher risk of rugpulls)  \\n3.) Collectibles and Nostaliga. This is attention speculation and disposable income markets. You are buying coins just like people bought furbies, buy Goatius Maximus, they are doing things to be part of the group in that moment in time. You are throwing money in to be a moment in time, if you can speculate and get in before the moment then you profit. (Again higher risk of Rug Pulls)  \\n4.)

Even if a new plan tried to balance them and failed, it would still be possible to resort to unilateral Texas subdivisionism on Texas part in order to restore the balance.When California was admitted, at first they were compelled to have 1 Republican and 1 Democrat senator. That was when senators were chosen by the state legislature.Even if it was just Puerto Rico being admitted alone, it is still possible to defy the current convention of having statewide senatorial elections, and instead draw two senatorial districts so that one will lean more conservative than the other, likely leading to one Democratic and one Republican seat, The constitution does not forbid senatorial districts. It also does not forbid breaking up the electoral college vote like Nebraska and Maine.Much of Canadas geography features only one large city per province.

All those cameras, microphones, internal cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention and cameras for facial recognition, cameras on the outside for vehicle theft and attempted break ins, microphone outside the vehicle as well.  \\nLawsuits have been going on for years now because data was available for anyone apparently to look it up, data like video and audio of people in their underwear in their garage putting their laundry in their private laundry machines because their Tesla is parked inside their home garage which is totally common to also include a washing machine nearby, now these people and many others are having to battle Tesla in court about what has been recorded and what hasn't, what has been shared by the employees and passed around the offices passed over slack messenger and discord groups etc.  \\nPeople are nasty. The other interesting thing is the data that can be used to create maps for information gathering on various subjects drivers and passengers might discuss while inside their Tesla, other conversations and moments have been recorded outside of a Tesla and shared like neighbors being caught on camera through their windows, microphones working well enough to listen through open windows or thin walls etc. Creepers.  \\nXi Jinping wants data, wants what everyone else wants to know. There's always more going on, layers like an onion.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy Secretly Thinks Elon Musk Is in Chinas Pocket - Resurfaced audio shows Vivek Ramaswamy sang a very different tune about Elon Musk not too long ago."},{"text":"As long as all Democrats vote No.Therein lies the rub.","title":"Nothing To Spare: GOP To Be Left With Single-Seat House Majority, Jeopardizing Trumps Agenda"},{"text":"It's only the media who dislike any thing Trump","title":"New Poll: All of Trump's Nominees Are Viewed More Favorably Than Unfavorably"},{"text":"Kind of like how conservatives get upset when you point out that being anti-antifa is pro-fascist.","title":"Trump wanted to build an anti-#MeToo Cabinet  but it's backfiring badly"},{"text":"They want the entire US to be like Texas.

I personally know dozens and dozens of people who are/were disgusted by what right wing propaganda told them the Democrats wanted to do with respect to issues like trans people, gay people, religious rights, etc. And the fact is, whether its culture war issues or actually-important issues, the underlying problems for the Dems is that they did, yet again, exactly what they always do (and dont do), which is - 1) A terrible, horrible, no-good job of messaging; specifically, they did NOT clearly communicate on ANY of the issues that were a factor in peoples voting choices in 2024and sometimes they didnt even attempt to address thembut when they did try, not only did they ignore the use of the correct mediums (legacy news networks vs social media, podcasts, etc), but when they did make an attempt, it was in a bland, weak kneed, ineffective fashion which not only didnt reach the target audience, but also left them wide open to ridicule &amp; attacks. For instance - Im sorry, but Id bet you that the vast majority of Americans do NOT think biological males should be competing in womens sports. And I perceive the majority of Dems also dont support that. So rather than hem and haw, or worse, appear to be defending it, or worst of all - supporting it - STOP worrying about hurting the feelings of .001% of the voting population and clearly and concisely and powerfully concur with what mainstream America wants, and dont worry about hurting the feelings of those 3-4 trans athletes per state who think they should be able to compete. On a non-culture war front, the Dems ALSO sucked at messaging on the Afghanistan withdrawal, support for Ukraine, inflation, the economy, the infrastructure bill, etc. etcand in each and every case they actually DID what was right, but they were abject failures when it came to telling Americans about it. 2) Unforced Errors - whether w/ Identity politics, Gaza, etc. Closely related to the above, but this is the actions aspect of it, versus the messaging part. For instance - I dont care one bit if Biden wanted to hire a trans person to a public facing, important role, IF that person were the best person for the job, but the reality is that the way Biden went about it was terrible, because it looked to everyone like he was hiring a trans person to an important departmental, public facing role, purely because he wanted to hire a trans person, periodand honestly? That was probably the truth!! Because then that person turned out to be a petty criminal and Fox News made hay for weeks and weeks. Thats just 1 of many, many examples. Other examples of unforced errors would be Bidens over the top, way-too-long and-too-much military support for Israel, or perhaps worst of all - NOT pushing, publicly, hard, and FAST - for the prosecution of Trump after Jan 6. I know Biden doesnt control the Justice department, but I also know he could damn well have been at the podium daily for the first 3 months talking about how he hoped the Justice Department would IMMEDIATELY hold the guilty parties accountable in order to protect our democracy. But nothey just ignored it. Aside from incompetent messaging and shooting their own feet off, I will also add - a very large part of America is sick and tired of identity politics and their perception that the Dems are more interested in pandering to every single ostracized minority group, and more interested in protecting the not-critical sensibilities of tiny portions of the population here and there (human rights  pronouns - they are not of the same importance!).than governing for the masses. I dont buy into this at all as its not accurate IMObut what I think, as someone who closely follows current events and politics, is the outlierthe average low voter information voter is getting the wrong message, because the Dems cant message effectively themselves, and there is a massive right wing propaganda machine custom built to exploit all of the Dems messaging failures and unforced errors. Man Im so frustrated. Im just an average guy w/ no career experience in public relations or politicsbut I have no doubt that if the DNC called me today and said wed like to hire you to run our public relations / messaging.I could do a 200% better job than the nincompoops who have been in charge for the last 8 years !!!","title":"Centrist Democrats should stop blaming progressives for Harriss loss: Whether to use he/she pronouns in emails wasnt a factor in the Harris-Trump race."},{"text":"Ive said this before, but attributing the win to anything trumps campaign consciously or purposefully did is dumb.

Another illness which we do not test for physical signs, but rather use psychological assessment to determine the presence and severity of. Typically the child is the first person to know and they inform others. Important adults in their lives may also see symptoms that clue them in to the inner life the child is leading. These adults who suspect something is amiss seek professional expertise to diagnose and treat said condition.Upon receiving a diagnosis but before treatment, medical professionals get informed consent, informing the parents and the child of the diagnosis, and provide all relevant information for both the illness and the treatment before getting the legally required consent. You're under the impression that children are deciding to transition independently on a whim, when in fact it is treated just like any other health condition.Now as far as why we would want them to make that decision rather than waiting is because waiting is not a neutral choice. They're undergoing puberty and that is permanently changing them too. The neutral choice is to stop them from having puberty until they mature more. That does not necessarily mean wait until they're 18. There is a time when a person is not immature person capable of making decisions and a time when a person is a fully mature person and is capable of making decisions. The time in between is a gray area and which a immature person eventually becomes more mature. It's not like flipping a light switch. Using puberty blockers gives a person more time to mature before they have to make an important decision.It's worth noting that we do allow children to make important decisions before they're 18. For example during a divorce children are consulted about the outcome they seek, for example which parent they live with. We do not weigh very highly the opinion of small children, while we allow children nearing the age of majority to have near complete control over which parent they live with. This choice can have a drastic effect on the child's life, and yet it is commonplace for a child to decide. Similarly we trust children to drive very heavy vehicles at high speeds... But not until they are nearing the age of majority. Does I help clear up the confusion you seem to have? Do you have any more questions?","title":"Trans people scramble to stockpile medication ahead of Trump presidency"},{"text":"Starting my own whatever-these-are.Day 1 of me saying: America will make it through these next four years and don't let the bastards grind you down.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 5, 2024"},{"text":"?he went through all the requisite training.

Most covid deniers believed that covid was just the flu, even while in the hospital on a ventilator and even while their loved ones were dying alone in a hospital after suffocating on their own lungs.  People with bird flu dont know that they are even sick until a few days to a week after being infected.  I have no reason to believe that a future response will be any better.  I have no doubt that a Trump administration will withhold information or not take it as seriously as it should.

Hospitals didnt have the ability to handle COVID patients and they certainly cannot handle bird flu, especially since a lot of hospitals have closed since 2020-2021.  Other people receiving other types of care will also be impacted, since they will not be able to get help due to excessive hospitalization.  So, how bad could it be?  Pretty damn bad.

Such as blatantly showing the people there is, in fact, a multi-tier justice system. Taking away social protections for self enfranchisement of the elite. Etc.

Not to mention that we don't have the means to supply that much electricity to fuel the demands of hydrogen production on top of electricity needed for other reasons, nor the transmission capability to get that level of power where it's needed. Add in the fact that a barrel of sweet light crude distills to about 70% gasoline, which would be a byproduct of getting the 30% we need for all the other aspects of modern life. We'd still get the carbon footprint from disposing of the unwanted gasoline if we went 100% hydrogen. Like it or not, the ONLY viable alternative to reduce, not eliminate, fossil fuels is small modular nuclear reactors. Wind and solar don't even generate enough electricity over their lifespan to compensate for the carbon footprint to manufacture them, much less the footprint for delivery and installation.

But lets be honest:?**DEI was a distraction.**?It gave corporations a shiny toy to show off while quietly ignoring the systemic changes that would make a difference.The truth is that DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) didnt fail because it is inherently flawed. It failed because it was never meant to succeed. DEI was designed to soothe public outrage, boost corporate reputations, and keep us focused on arguments about identity. At the same time, corporations continued their usual practices: exploiting workers, hoarding wealth, and evading accountability. DEI conveniently sidesteps these issues by making representation the centerpiece of progress. Sure, seeing a more diverse boardroom is greatbut what about the millions of workers who will never make it to that boardroom? What about wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and the lack of affordable healthcare?

So it's fine /s\\nCongressional pension is a pension made available to members of the United States Congress. As of 2019, members who participated in the congressional pension system are vested after five years of service. A pension is available to members 62 years of age with 5 years of service; 50 years or older with 20 years of service; or 25 years of service at any age. A reduced pension is available depending upon which of several different age/service options is chosen. If Members leave Congress before reaching retirement age, they may leave their contributions behind and receive a deferred pension later.[1] The current pension program, effective January 1987, is under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which covers members and other federal employees whose federal employment began in 1984 or later. This replaces the older Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for most members of congress and federal employees.\\nThe FERS program takes into account the years served and the average pay for the top three years in terms of payment. For example, a member elected before 1984 and thus qualifying under the CSRS plan, who worked for 22 years and who had a top three-year average salary of $154,267 would be eligible for a pension payment of $84,847 per year.[4] A member elected after 1984 would have been enrolled under the FERS plan, and their pension payment under similar conditions ($154,267 top three-year average salary, but with only 20 years of service, rather than the 22 in the CSRS example) would be $52,451.In 2002, the average congressional pension payment ranged from $41,000 to $55,000.[6] As of November 2014, senior Members of Congress who have been in office for at least 32 years can earn about $139,000 a year.[7][source ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_pension)Edit to addThere were 619 retired Members of Congress receiving federal pensions based fully or in part on their congressional service as of October 1, 2022. Of this number, 261 had retired under CSRS and were receiving an average annual pension of $84,504. A total of 358 Members had retired with service under FERS and were receiving an average annual pension of $45,276 in 2023\\ncrsreports.congress.govA pension after 5 years.....must be nice.","title":"With The Election Over, Republicans Are Suddenly Interested in Cutting Social Security: We've gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"Yes, expect a quick addendum:\\"Well, I said I would quit, but I have it under control, it turns out I didn't need to.

Project 2025 has labeled them woke culture warriors and pledged to wield the full force of the federal government against their efforts to create a more equitable society.Trump and his advisers have already threatened the funds and accreditation of universities they have labeled the enemy, and pledged to dismantle diversity offices across federal agencies, scrap diversity reporting requirements and use civil rights enforcement mechanisms to combat diversity initiatives they see as discrimination.The multi-pronged attack is certain to be met with major legal challenges, but while they prepare for those, advocates warn about the ripple effects of an administration declaring war on inclusivity efforts.The concern is the bigger footprint and symbol, said Nina Ozlu Tunceli, chief counsel of government and public affairs at Americans for the Arts. Federal policies do have a domino effect on other states, on foundations, on individual donors.Last week, Walmart became the latest in a series of high-profile companies to announce a rollback of its diversity initiatives following a campaign of legal challenges by conservative groups. Other businesses and institutions small and large are trying to keep a low profile to avoid becoming the target of anti-DEI campaigns, those who work with them say.There are already concerns that institutions fearful of losing funding or facing lawsuits may overcorrect and dial back their programmes before they are required to do so, advocates warn....Institutions anticipating a similar backlash at the national level are already planning to emphasise projects the incoming administration may be more supportive to C like those celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence, in 2026 C and to turn to alternative funding for those they expect will lose out on federal support.Many now believe that institutions will have to show bravery to uphold their values, even if it means risking funding. What they need to do is find a backbone, and I say that with a lot of understanding and empathy for the situation theyre in, said Young, of PEN America.I worry when I see a university roll over for funding, he added, calling on administrators to leverage their influence with alumni and their communities to stand up to legislators attacks. A university that doesnt have a new building is still a university, its just a poor university. A university that has lawmakers banning ideas and restricting the actions of the administration is really not a university at all.This pre-emptive self-censoring by companies and institutions is a concerning trend with this incoming administration. This inidicates a level of fear by them of retribution or other types of punitive actions by the future administration, and also might let the administration off the hook for having to implement regulations that may run up against various constitutional challenges to otherwise affect these changes.","title":"Trump promises a crackdown on diversity initiatives.

Whether it would be wise or set a good precedent is a separate question, however.Joe Biden is a father, and I think most Americans would understand that a father would have a particular concern for their children's well-being. He did originally say he would not pardon Hunter Biden, but circumstances have since changed. Trump was re-elected, this could raise new concerns about Hunter Biden's treatment in the criminal-justice system with Trump in power. I am not necessarily agreeing with that line of reasoning, but it is a change that doesn't have to do with corruption; if one anticipates a risk of \\"retribution,\\" using the pardon power as a preemptive defense could be seen as a logical choice, not corruption.While there are probably many fathers across America with sons in similar circumstances who happen not to be President and, in that sense, this pardon may not be fair, it doesn't necessarily make it corrupt either because of the aforementioned.The Constitution provides a check against a president's abuse of the pardon power, and that would be for Congress to decide it rises to a level to draw up articles of impeachment.Again, I am not necessarily agreeing with this pardon, but there are reasons it might not be considered corrupt.","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"It makes sense when you consider civilization is still run through the lens of millions of years of animal instinct, and animals feel vulnerable when theyre pooping and peeing.

And as a woman and your mother I feel I must speak out..    You are an abuser of women  that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.    I am not a saint, far from it.. so dont throw that in my face,. but your abuse over the years to women (dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, belittling) needs to be called out.    Sam is a good mother and a good person (under the circumstances that you created) and I know deep down you know that. For you to try to label her as unstable for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you? She did not ask for or deserve any of what has come to her by your hand. Neither did Meredith.    I know you think this is one big competition and that we have taken her side bunk we are on the side of good and that is not you. (Go ahead and call me self-righteous, I dont care)    Dont you dare run to her and cry foul that we shared with us thats what babies do. Its time for someone (I wish it was a strong man) to stand up to your abusive behavior and call it out, especially against women    We still love you, but we are broken by your behavior and lack of character. I dont want to write emails like this and never thought I would. If it damages our relationship further, then so be it, but at least I have said my piece. [Redacted]    And yes, we are praying for you (and you dont deserve to know how we are praying, so skip the snarky reply)    I dont want an answer to this I dont want to debate with you. You twist and abuse everything I say anyway. \\n But On behalf of all the women (and I know its many) you have abused in some way, I say get some help and take an honest look at yourself    MomNow she's going onto [Fox News](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-hegseth-mom-interview-fox-news-b2658709.html) claiming he's a changed man, that the old email was written in an emotional state and she didn't really mean it.

Something multiple guests from the right joked about was how Harris couldnt handle a long podcast with Rogan because she would have to be sincere and not just stick to talking points. Given that Harris was not widely known, and that there was almost no counter narrative to the absurd allegations and stories they discussed, Harris should have gone on.

Then we get a 70 star flag.Taiwan is already considered an unrecognized US territory by one of their smaller political organizations because in their view Taiwans status involving the post-WWII occupation was never officially ended or resolved.US State Department policy also does not rule out this possibility either; it states that Taiwans status is unresolved.The question for them, is would they rather be democratic, or identify as ethnically Chinese? Ideally, both, with Japan and maybe also South Korea guaranteeing Taiwans security. But if that doesnt work out, they may be open to annexation by the US.With a 70 state nation, some of the population in the states from the Philippines, Great Britain, and the 48 contiguous states would immigrate into Canada. Making somewhere around 10 states in Canada is necessary for good administration of such large expanses of land. The population will fill out more as time goes on. Besides internal immigration, when European countries turn majority Muslim there will be Christians and secular minded people looking to immigrate somewhere, and Canada is closer than Australia.","title":"Trump jokes that Canada should become the 51st state, but THIS recent Canadian ruling is exactly why we DONT want that"},{"text":"six times *so far*","title":"Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave.

This unmistakable policy of the legislature founded, I think, on wisdom and the moral development of both races, has been shown by not only declaring marriages between whites and negroes absolutely void, but by prohibiting and punishing such unnatural alliances with severe penalties. The laws enacted to further uphold this declared policy would be futile and a dead letter if in fraud of these salutary enactments, both races might, by stepping across any imaginary line bid defiance to the law by immediately returning and insisting that the marriage celebrated in another state or county should be recognized as lawful, though denounced by the public law of the domicile as unlawful and absolutely void.\\"","title":"Michigan Republican calls for making marriage equality 'illegal again'"},{"text":"Of course there is.

Eight months after the FBI found thousands of classified documents at Mar a Lago, Airman 1st Class Jack Teixeira, age 23, was arrested for posting a handful of classified documents on Discord. He was arrested immediately after an investigation found evidence of what he'd done and was filmed by news helicopters being frog-marched out of his home and loaded into a van. Trump had stolen the documents when he left office in January 20, 2021. He then failed to respond to multiple politie requests from the National Archives to return the documents. He knew he was withholding the classified documents - he had demonstrable \\"consciousness of guilt\\" - and no one knows to this day what, if anything, he did with that classified intel. It would not be cynical to presume that he tried to make money off of them somehow, very possibly even by attempting to sell state secrets to enemies of the US. Last month, Jack Teixeira ws sentenced to 15 years in prison. But now, in part because of DOJ's slow walking the case, but in large measure becausee Trump spent millions to delay the trial and because a Federalist Society fascist judge enabled the delay, he is president again and the entire body of United States classified intelligence is at risk. The bottom line is that he should have been arrested on the same timeline as Jack Teixeira, which is to say on January 21, 2021. Whether or not it was Garland's decision to delay action, ultimately the responsibilty to secure the documents belonged him. History will not be kind to him. Fairly or unfairly, depending on whether Trump succeeds in upending American democracy, Garland may be remembered as a latter day Neville Chamberlain.","title":"I listened to hours of Trumps FBI pick on Steve Bannons podcast.

The Trump Administration has already floated a potential replacement nominee.  Senate Republicans also agreed that they can't simply bypass the traditional process for vetting nominees including a background investigation performed by the fbi. Are some terrible unqualified corrupt people probably still going to get approved? Sure.  But we are seeing evidence of what will likely be more dysfunction to come. The problem is that the media is giving Trump the same deference they would give another president who was taking the job seriously and appointing serious people for those jobs. To pick an old example. When George HW Bush nominated John Tower to be the Secretary of Defense.  He picked a man who was a Navy veteran of World War ii, had a master's degree from the London School of economics and had been a serving senator for almost 30 years and was widely acknowledged to be an expert in defense policy. However within Washington DC circles he was also known to be a raging alcoholic and people asked whether he could actually do a job if the Russians decided to attack it 10:00 p.m.  The media is just reporting on the Scandal and treating the nomination is if it's the same when it's really not.","title":"Trump wanted to build an anti-#MeToo Cabinet  but it's backfiring badly"},{"text":"Your argument depends on us accepting a category error.

He said he also has bipolar disorder, sleep apnea and chronic pain after decades of performing manual labor. Smith said Medicaid, which he has been trying to get since the summer, should not be where the federal government looks to reduce expenses. Instead, he said, the federal government should take savings from cutting other programs and put the money toward more peoples care. **I dont think theyre going to yank health care away from people, he said.

In various polls taken earlier this year, 4 out of 5 Americans said Joe Biden was too old to run for a second term, the government is doing a bad job dealing with migrants at the Mexican border and the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable.Oh, and heres one more area where 80% of Americans concur: Social Security benefits shouldnt be cut.On those other issues, politicians are pretty responsive. Biden didnt run for a second term in the end, after all, and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers will at least pay lip service to the idea that something should be done about the border and prescription drug prices.But despite its unpopularity, Republicans somehow keep coming back to the idea of cutting Social Security.In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., suggested it was time to make some hard decisions to trim the federal budget. Weve gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, said McCormick, who represents the wealthiest congressional district in Georgia. Theres hundreds of billions of dollars to be saved and we know how to do it. We just have to have the stomach to actually take those challenges on.In a speech at Trumps Madison Square Garden rally during the campaign, Musk said he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which would amount to about 30% of spending. Since Social Security is the largest single program in the budget, that would seem to indicate it might be a target, especially since Musk also said that everyones going to have to take a haircut under his plans.Continues at [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-social-security-republicans-elon-musk-rcna182711) ","title":"With The Election Over, Republicans Are Suddenly Interested in Cutting Social Security: We've gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"Here we go","title":"Michigan Republican calls for making marriage equality 'illegal again'"},{"text":"No need for whataboutism.

So a 25 percent tariff across the board will result in a minimum of a 50 percent price increase on the low end and upwards of a 100 percent price increase in the high end. So if your a service provider that relies on imported parts to do your job you have to raise your prices substantially something like double what you were previously charging.Now if your forced to double your prices in a short amount of time the volume of sales will drop by 75 percent. Which means you'll reduce staff by that amount whenever possible.One example would be housing which relies on a substantial amount of imported parts to build new units. By applying a 25 percent tariffs as it feeds through the chain end costs of the house will be 2 to 3 times more expensive which will price almost all Americans out of new housing.Another example is automotive which also uses a huge amount of parts for import they will see 50 percent prices increases at a minimum.  That will reduce the number of sales by 1/3rd. And repairs will get way more expensive which will cause consumers to shift spending eating into food and entertainment budgets.Then there is the petroleum because most of our refinery capacity isn't designed to refine petroleum we mine in the US you'll see a 100 to 200 percent price increase on gas prices as companies rapidly transition their equipment.Food prices will skyrocket as companies pass on tariffs prices especially in the winter months where prices could spike 4 times higher as companies push both the tariffs costs and the risks associated with Trump onto consumers.And then there is the flip side as countervailing tariffs get implemented and companies layoff workers as they lose their overseas markets.Essially a uniformed 25 percent across the board tariffs is a bit like nuking your own people which is extremely foolish indeed.Don't get me wrong tariffs are a great tool for certain situations but the way Trump is attempting to use that tool shows how little he understands about economics and international trade.","title":"How painful will Trumps tariffs be for American businesses?"},{"text":"Fun fact, sexually assaulting someone sober is illegal too!","title":"Pete Hegseth says he will never back down amid rumors hell be replaced by DeSantis"},{"text":"Me too.

The institutional knowledge will remain, but frankly the engineers at NASA will be pumped to (hopefully) cede the work of launches to commercial contracts like spacex, blue origin, rocket lab, etc, and be able to take those 10's of billions of dollars to come up with some kick ass missions to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, plan orbiters for Neptune and Uranus, and get more next gen telescopes launched. All while fulfilling the missions of beating China back to the moon and then to Mars.I can tell you the level of excitement on the space message boards like NASASpaceFlight, which has LOTS of current and former NASA engineers/employees on them is off the charts.

And this guy does.  He personally funded the most ambitious human spaceflight since Apollo on their last mission.  That's the furthest any human has been from Earth in about 50 years.  He could have paid for a short trip to the ISS, but he didn't.  The other concern is that he'll steer more NASA contracts to SpaceX and his \\"buddy\\", Elon.  But....the issue there is a lack of a credible alternative.  NASA's own super-heavy rocket, the SLS, has been plagued by delays and is over budget.  And it's not like SLS is this pure-as-the-driven-snow public project whereas SpaceX is icky and gross and private.  SLS is primarily a Boeing contract with some help from Lockheed.  I mean, do we really want to beat our chests and cheer for the \\"underdog\\" when the underdog is Boeing?  Meanwhile, Boeing's OTHER big NASA funded program is Starliner.which is also massively delayed.  I think it is on-budget because was a fixed cost project (IIRC) and Boeing regrets the fuck out of the contract.  This is the spacecraft that stranded those two astronauts on ISS (they'll be there until February).  The craft came back and we don't even really know wtf was wrong with it.  The private competitors to SpaceX just aren't that compelling.  There's Blue Origin.but that's Jeff Bezos' company.  I mean, who wants to steer funding from Musk to Bezos??  Plus, Blue Origin is just going slow AF.  They still haven't even launched a resupply mission to ISSwhich SpaceX has been doing since 2012.  Blue Origin has launch suborbital tourist flights, but nothing even remotely as ambitious as actually flying astronauts to ISS (and returning them safely and ON TIME for the most part).  And then there's the whole Spaceship program which nobody else is even trying to be in that ballparkexcept sorta SLS.  But it's only flown once and might be years until it flies again.  Look.....I'm in my mid-50s.  When I was a little boy I read space books about the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs.  I cannot believe that in my lifetime all we've done is the space shuttle and ISS.  I mean, I'd like to see a person on Mars before I die and SpaceX partnering with NASA is the only way that's going to happen.  And I know that everyone bitches that SpaceX is only where it is because of government contractsbut I think any honest person should admit that we've ALL seen most government contractors shit the bed and fail to deliverespecially with aerospace and defense: Late, overbudget, cancelled programs, etc.  So what I think will happens is this Isaacman means that ISS will get deorbited later in this decade on schedule.  He could have paid to visit itand he didn't want to.  It also probably means the end of that SLS project.  Which is sad.....but good riddance.  That's never going to get us anywhere in my lifetime.  It probably also means the end of space collaboration with Russia.What I'm curious about is how unmanned probes will be handled.  I like that stuff too and don't want to see it all cut.  And remember those are not really government programs either.  They're mostly supported by government contracts and grants at universities like the Jet Propulsion Lab at Cal Tech or the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins.  But.....I'd just have to guess that someone who wants to go on a rocket 800 miles above earth also likes to get cool pictures of planets we've not seen before.  Again.....I'm in my mid-50s and I'd like to know a LOT more about the moons of the outer planets before I die.  The one wrinkle I've not heard anyone talk about much is how Isaacman also manages Draken which provides \\"adversary\\" aircraft for training of western Air Forces.  That means he has a pretty heavy tie to the military industrial complex.  One of my other curious areas is UFOs/UAPs/NHI and what NASA knows or doesn't know.  I am sorta doubtful that Isaacman seems like the type of guy who would push for any disclosure.","title":"Trump Gives Elon Musks Buddy Total Control Over NASA | \\nDonald Trumps pick for NASA head, billionaire Jared Isaacman, should worry anyone who cares about space."},{"text":"Corporations are people, my friend.

This is what today's GOP has become!"},{"text":"no. sorry, hard disagree. coincidence of elements is the principle that intent and actions are necessary components for criminality. It is not the principle that all physical sub-elements component in a crime must happen within the same component act.Caps for emphasis not hostility.As written, this reads that for an activity to be domestic terrorism an activity must (A) INVOLVE violence (i.e. the \\"activity\\" in 5. being referenced in the lettered list does not STRICTLY CONTAIN ONLY the violence) and also (B) must (in abstract, as a whole, the act which may not be limited to (A) must) involve certain motivations.So you're right, domestic terrorism acts must involve the criminal action element and the intent. They must coincide within the activity and be linked as integral components of the overall \\"activities\\" which constitute domestic terrorism, but the violence need not being the element of the activity to which the political coercive intentions outlined in (B) primarily apply.To put it another way, if I was to rewrite the code to imply your definition:\\\\(5) the term domestic terrorism means activities that(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; which appear to be intended(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and(B) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\\\\The separation of A and B in the original makes clear they are components (which as you say must both be present at the same time) essential to the parent section, but separate components nonetheless. The definition I put there narrows the application of intent to the violent element of terrorism, not the intent of the activities in general.The same is true for the jurisdiction clause, C (B in my modified one); this whole passage considers domestic terrorism to involve acts specifically planned and executed in the US. if it were the case that separate lettered components in this list had to coincide with each other, the \\"domestic\\" element would apply to specifically the involved violent acts with their essential political meaning, meaning domestic terrorism would definitionally include activities primarily occuring outside the US as long as the violence occurred in the US. So 9/11 would be domestic terrorism.FWIW I don't actually have a strong view on what charge is appropriate for any of the rioters; what you posted seems to indicate something different from your interpretation is all.","title":"CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists."},{"text":"He voted with them 98% of the time.

I'm prescribed 1mL single dose vials for a 0.2mL dose. My doctor (and pretty much everyone) instructed me to re-use the vials, even though they're marked as single use, as long as you wipe the top with an alcohol swab, before and after use. My doctor prescribes me one single dose vial per week. Is there anything wrong with that?Because my dose is so little, I can get 4 doses out of one vial, which means I use one vial a month and have 3 extras, thus, the stockpile. But I figured out Walgreens was shorting me because I messed up on one of my shots, and it meant I ran out early. When I went to refill it, they acted like I was a drug addict or something. They gave me the \\"controlled substance\\" bit as well, except they told me they're \\"only allowed to give 2 vials for every 70 days\\". Thats not enough, at all. They blamed my insurance, then my doctor. I checked with both, who said it's bullshit. The insurance even called the Walgreens with ME on the phone and was shocked that they weren't budging. I switched to a mail-order pharmacy and I refill it every 28 days without any issueEdit: Didn't see your edit but, I wasn't implying that you said it was ILLEGAL. I was implying that what I'm doing is legal, not that you're implying it's illegal to stockpile. Is reusing vials risky? Maybe, maybe not.

If you are in the U.S., it's an Rx only drug, and is federally schedule III.  Doctors have access to PDMP databases for controlled substance and pharmacists are required by most state laws to check PDMP databases for controlled substances with some variations in the law.  Most pharmacies require their pharmacists to check the state PDMP for ALL controlled substances and set a limit on how early a patient can get them based on state recommended guidelines and best practices.  This happened because pharmacies started getting sued for not doing enough to stop people building up supplies of controlled substances.  I know that Walgreens requires a PDMP check on EVERY controlled substance prescription and the max we are allowed to allow is 3 days, although every pharmacist is allowed to make their own call based on the area and their professional judgement.  Some locations do NO days or 1 day, MOST do 2 days early nowadays, and I've seen some will do 3 days but calculated across 3 months.Source: I am a pharmacist and I work for Walgreens.  I can be fired if I don't check the PDMP and make the appropriate documentation.Also, I didn't say it was ILLEGAL to stockpile it.  I said you cannot do it (if people are doing their jobs right) because the nature of the medication requires pharmacists to gatekeep (literal FDA wording to describe our function) controlled substances.  I don't like it, but I'm not going to get fired over it.

Moreover, I suspect that the answer of tariffs solving everything is already wearing thin with many. Trump's first term was an absolute giveaway to the richest amongst us. Why would anyone think that this time around would be better? Just in terms of tax cuts, he gave a multi-TRILLION dollar tax cut where 83% of it went to the top 1% and he \\"paid\\" for it by putting it onto the national debt - which he managed to raise by about 25%, a feat that hasn't been done in nearly a century. Those tax cuts will be expiring soon and he has said that he intends to extend them, more trillions onto the national debt. He says that this won't be the case because - and this will come as a shock - tariffs will pay for those tax cuts. Last time, he promised that trickle down economics would pay for them. That didn't happen either. It's all going onto the national credit card, and the kicker is that most of the people who voted for him either won't care or won't understand how profoundly the expansion of the national debt affects their lives. It, like pretty much all of his policies, will cause interest rates to rise, and it will add ever more to the yearly bill to pay interest on those loans - over a trillion dollars a year in interest payments. How many schools and hospitals could that pay for?

He threatened to when they kept shooting down his bills and other labor laws. It ended with the supreme court backing down on some bills. It might be because FDR, it might be because they found effigy's of them hanging from treesExactly proving my point, no? FDR trying to fight the good fight, even if it did not succeed everyrime is one part of many of why he was so popular and got reelected 4 times (also the war obviously). We needed a new FDR for the 21st century and Biden ran against candidates who very well could have been. Overhead failed to show he would be willing to radically fight for America and be the leader we needed. He kept playing ot save based on precident until it was way too late, and the only exception he is making is a corrupt pardon. It's a failure of a presidency only made palatable by the horror show that precided and will follow it.\\nHe tried to end the filibuster. He tried to pack the court. He had such a majority Dems had to sit with Republicans because they ran out of chairs on their side. He couldn't pack the court. Know why? Because if they had, ending the filibuster and packing the court, Donald Trump would walk in with his majority Republican Senate and house, and he would pack it even more. It would never be ending. And it would ultimately accomplish nothing.Here's the problem with this counterfactual: we played it safe and still lost everything. Those that seem to fight radically muster the enthusiasm and support from their base to overcome. I truly believe that the attempt to fight fire with fire if fought honestly for the people would have been popular with the left and would have drum out voters in mass. Like John Stewart said recently, be willing to break norms and own them...but not just for your son.Do I give Trump a pass? Not really. Do I understand why he did some things? Sure. As a human I understand, as a voter I'm disappointed.I mean as a human rights and restorative justice advocate, sure see the humanity in everyone including hitler...but also no don't fail to absolutely condemn corruption in power. Trump.doing it was heinous, and bidens doing it is marginally less heinous (didn't make him the ambassador of France and all that nonesense)There is nothing Biden could do to road bump Trump that Trump couldn't turn around and undo. Obama ruled by EO's, he watched Trump undo them by the stack with a pen stroke. EO's are toothless unless your replacement is willing to keep them. Biden reversed most of Trump's on day one.Obama is infamous for playing it safe.

To be fair as the first black president there are also cultural reasons his hands were tied and coming in aggressive could really backfire, but also once his term had passed and trump won 1 term there is no reason Biden should have taken the same playbook.","title":"With his son's pardon, Joe Biden cedes the moral high ground and plays into Donald Trump's hands"},{"text":"These people have only rage, never any serious answers or solutions.","title":"Biden White House Is Discussing Preemptive Pardons for Those in Trumps Crosshairs"},{"text":"This is giving me \\"we really ARE living in a sim game vibes\\". ??","title":"Trump Defense Nominee Asks Mom to Call Senators for Him in Effort to Land Job: Report"},{"text":"Can you point out Canada on a map?
