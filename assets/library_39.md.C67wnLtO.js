How do you distinguish it as intellectual property? Its incredibly hard to do, especially for seeds that have been cultivated and passed down for generations. Yet, when seeds were first allowed to be patented, corporations like Monsanto exploited the system to devastating effect.Monsanto famously went into seed banksrepositories of genetic biodiversity built over decadesand patented seeds that had been preserved by generations of farmers. Then, armed with these patents, they approached farmers and essentially said: These seeds are now our property. You cant use them anymore. Farmers who had relied on these seeds for generations, often tailored to their specific local environments, were forced to discard them.This is where the distinction between *personal property* and *private property* becomes critical. Farmers had *personal property* in the form of their seeds, which they used to sustain their livelihoods. But the introduction of *private property*in this case, the patenting of seedsenabled a corporation, with no intrinsic stake in the process, to exploit a legal framework and claim ownership over genetic material they didnt create. This wiped out centuries of agricultural heritage and left many farmers at the mercy of a single entity.Private property, in this case, didnt reward innovation or effort; it rewarded capital. It allowed one party to monopolize a critical resource by virtue of their initial wealth and access to the patent system. This fundamentally disrupted the balance, creating artificial scarcity and destroying the communal system that had worked for centuries.So while private property might seem fine in theory, this example shows how it can lead to exploitation, market manipulation, and cultural erosion. The privatization of seeds didnt just hurt individual farmersit undermined a shared resource vital for humanitys food security and ecological resilience. Today, over 75% of genetic biodiversity in our vegetables has been lost since the beginning of the 20th century.For me, this is a prime example of how private property can enable things to go wrong: it allows those with resources to appropriate and control things that should remain accessible and communal, causing harm that ripples through entire communities and ecosystems.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Are these headlines designed to be confusing?

What it deprives people of, in a direct manner, is the economic gains produced by said Capital. Imagine there's a car manufacturing plant (the Capital), it is owned by the company owner, the work produced is sold (value created), and the profit goes to the owner. Workers exchange their labor, time and expertise for money, sure, but by design the sum of all salaries and benefits *must* be lower than the total value produced, even after expenses.Workers not benefitting from the fruit of their labor is what leads to point 2, exploitation and inequality, which in turn leads to lack of access to private property, aka Capital, by the working class.Another point often made is that a factory for example could run without its owner, thus the owner is some arbitrary construct there merely to siphon profit from the workers. However, without the owner the factory would not exist, there would be no wages for the workers to earn, there would be no no machines into which to pour their labor, the workers wouldn't gather there in the first place etcYou're right in that there has to initial investment for manufactories to be built, raw resources to be bought and wages to be paid. However, that doesn't imply that that initial Capital has to come from a private individual. There's plenty of examples worldwide of companies being nationalized and working out pretty well. In that case the initial Capital comes from everybody pitching in, and everybody reaping the rewards.I'm not arguing that private property should be entirely banned and forcefully seized, I think the important part here is recognizing that the system that allows unbridled private property necessitates inequalities and exploitation.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Biden meeting Trump in the white house really irked me.

As a perhaps extreme example, if you could brutally torture one person in a way that you can guarantee will make everyone else on earth 0.000001% happier, there's a net gain in happiness for the whole human race, but you're seriously harming a human that makes up the human race. As another example, you could argue that the best thing for the environment and the long-term survival of humanity is to kill humans down to a more manageable level. That is obviously bad for many of the humans in society, while arguably being good for humanity as a whole. The purpose for which we should selectively breed people is quality of life and viability\\"Quality of Life\\" is still pretty vague and up to interpretation. Should depression be selected against? Should intelligence be selected for or against? If someone has a genetic predisposition to be better at meditating, should that be selected for? What about many genes that do multiple things? If you have a gene that may lead to early Alzheimer's, but prevents depression, how should you handle that?The point is that it's way too unclear to just say \\"quality of life\\" and assume that answers any time people are trying to decide what to select for or against.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Get used to this type of governance for the next 4-8 years, while our Country collapses due to REAL problems.","title":"Republican introduces anti-transgender bathroom resolution at Capitol after first transgender woman elected to Congress"},{"text":"They made a mockery of it for the Supreme Court, I'm sure they can do that here.

Secondly, most of the claims fold into \\"eugenics\\" that idea that it will necessarily be used in ways that aren't desirable.  There are very few things in the world that are bad without consideration for how they are commonly used.  The critiques of eugenics claim the idea that abuse of the power of eugenics is _essentially guaranteed_.  For example, the past abuses weren't considered \\"abuses\\" - they had noble objectives, you just don't think they are noble.  The problem behind critiques of eugenics is that when you mix tremendous power with people thinking they are being good you are often amplifying badness.  I think your mars example is great.  It certainly sounds sensible.  However, if we look back 500 years at the war between earth and mars and the martian population is smarter, stronger, better looking, wealthier than the earth population would we still feel good about that choice?

If that's not common knowledge, then... I don't know... I've never heard a person who wanted to have unhealthy, disabled, or deformed children. The undesirable traits I'm talking about are ones that would negatively impact quality of life. If a parent wants to have children with a lower quality of life, I'd say they're a bad parent, and I think most of us agree. Almost no one disagrees with the statement, \\"Parents generally want their children to have a good quality of life.\\"We are not avoiding inbreeding because of the unfavorable traits.The genetic mutations you described are exactly the kind of unfavorable traits I'm talking about. Your examples about purebred dogs represent selective breeding done wrong. I am arguing, for example, that dogs should be selectively bred to ensure health, genetic diversity, and minimal chance of harmful traits and mutations. Someone is selectively breeding pugs to make their noses better. That's more in line with my point than the people that have selectively bred dogs to have pug features. YEs, Nazis did it wrong, so how would you do it \\"right\\"?Genetic studies on people to let them know their predispositions toward various illnesses and defects. Inform them about how genes are passed on and reproduced. Increased availability of family planning services, specifically to discourage people with harmful genes from reproducing, and to encourage people with less harmful genes to reproduce.  Basically, you would educate and guide, rather than dictate and enforce. The example of an ark is an extreme situation, where a standard of some kind would need to be enforced. Broadly speaking, that's not the same way we'd need to go about things in modern society. The way humanity survives is by diversity and numbers, not by controlling our own selection on a mass scale.I'm more interested in improving quality of life than in perpetuating the species, TBH.   \\nIf a person has a child with a low quality of life, I don't think they've done humanity any favors.

Many of them were arrested and deported for the exact reasons you said above. Fast forward a few years. Thousands of deported gang members are back in El Salvador after the war ended, except you cant arrest someone for a crime they committed in another country, so these dangerous criminals were set free into the country. The gang problem was rampant  El Salvador had the highest homicide rate in the world at 105/100,000 in 2015, and over 70% of all of the countrys businesses were being extorted. Now they have a dictator who was elected after running on a gang crackdown. It worked because of mass arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment, and an ongoing 2-year state of exception that suspends certain civil rights like the right to an attorney and the right to a fair trial. They are trying accused gang members in groups of up to 900. Prisons are at 200% capacity and innocent people are dying. He also just staged a self-coup and changed the constitution to stay in power.

The Tax Policy Center suggests this would mean high-income families would receive roughly $11,420 (9,030) in extra savings.?He also floated the idea of cutting capital gains tax to spur growth, in a move which would boost wealthy investors.?It would put the US at odds with the approach taken by the UK Government which last month announced plans to raise capital gains tax rates. Rachel Reeves claimed this was necessary to fund the UKs public services and restore its public finances.?The Mulberry chief said he saw a growing opportunity to sell more of its Somerset-made handbags into the US market.?Theres a big opportunity in the US if we have the right product. Theres much more of a larger group that we can target, I think.It comes despite warnings that the US president-elect risks damaging Britains luxury market.?Mr Trump has said he plans to bring in levies of 60pc on Chinese products being sold to American businesses, alongside 20pc tariffs on all other imports.?Luxury trade group Walpole earlier this month issued a warning over the proposals, saying North America was a huge export market for British luxury goods, accounting for around a quarter of all global exports or 13bn.?Writing to members earlier this month, Walpole chief executive Helen Brocklebank said: This would be a clear threat to the success of British luxury brands, and the hundreds of thousands of highly skilled jobs which our sector supports.However, Mulberry shrugged off the risk on Tuesday, saying it was too early to see whether this would hurt the handbag maker. It said it was feeling more optimistic on selling into the US given the opportunity there is so big.?Sales in the US were up 9pc in the first six months of the year to the end of September, partially offsetting a sales slump in the UK and Asia Pacific.

If I knew that my children were more likely to have some deformity, I would be less inclined to have children, and I feel like we as a population can express that together without needing it to be enforced or mandated by anyone. It should be a social inclination, not a law or authoritarian act. You seem to be conflating the science or practice with its past implementations, the way that people conflate racism and systemic racism, or socialism and some socialist societies. I don't see the problem with selective breeding for the effort of increasing health. Someone has been selectively breeding pugs to fix their deformed noses, for example. Most people know that mutts are healthier than purebreds, so selectively breeding dogs of different breeds is healthier than selectively breeding dogs of the same breed. Let's hit the most important one first:?**why should premise 3 be true?**I don't think I understand your premise 3, because it doesn't represent my view at all. \\"The human race\\" and \\"the humans that make up the human race\\" are effectively synonymous, and thus of equal merit. Arguing that I think one has more value than the other seems to be a misrepresentation of my view. If we're going to terraform Mars and populate it with &lt;1% of earth's population, then most people aren't going to be represented in the new society. That's just math. The 99% aren't being forced to give up anything, other than the chance to participate in a new, genetically optimized society. Some 99% are going to miss out on that opportunity no matter how they're chosen, so choosing for genetic health seems like the most reasonable and objective standard. Who is actually in a position to determine which genetics are \\"best\\"? Is it better to be blond or brunette? If you cannot simultaneously breed for mental flexibility and mental stability, which do you prioritize? When we breed animals, we are breeding them for a specific, human-defined purpose -- and we're not interested in whether it makes the animals happier with their lives. We breed turkeys to have bigger breasts; we breed bloodhounds to have sharper noses; we don't breed anything to be \\"best\\", we breed them?*for a purpose.*Hair color has nothing to do with health, it's purely aesthetic. When I'm talking about selecting for healthy genes, I mean those with less chance to require valuable resources to construct artificial assistance. A repopulation ark wouldn't have an abundance of resources to use in making sure all members of its society can participate equally. If we have one less air purifier because someone needed a wheelchair, then that person has caused an objective detriment to the group, and so selecting for people that are less likely to need assistance like that is preferable. **The purpose for which we should selectively breed people is quality of life and viability**.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"My point was just because it's a homeschool/private school doesnt mean there's guaranteed outcomes.

Eugenics would have a negative effect on pretty much everyone that was unlucky enough to not have the \\"desirable\\" traits of the ones in power. Oh you've got brown skin? You ain't allowed to breed. Oh you got some kind of birth mark? You ain't allowed to breed. Oh, you're Deaf with no chance of passing it on to offsprings, you still ain't allowed to breed.

Have you interviewed most people?  Did you ask: \\"If you and your partner where deemed to have undesirable traits and told you cannot have children, would you be ok with that?\\"I think most people would not be ok with that.The taboo of inbreeding is not eugenics, its to avoid major birth defects, also, having children with a close family member is weird AF.  We are not avoiding inbreeding because of the unfavorable traits.  Eugenics is actually junk science.  Having diversity in a breeding population results in stronger genetics overall. Selectively breeding actually results in weaker and unhealthy offspring.  Look at purebred dogs - without a wide pool of parents to choose from, purebred dogs end up with many undesirable traits - blindness, hearing loss, lack of fur color, hip and bone problems, shorter lifespans.  Mutts (mixed breeds) live longer and have less problems.  Similar issues happen with humans.YEs, Nazis did it wrong, so how would you do it \\"right\\"?  Any approach would have unethical results. Astronauts are tested and chosen for the best abilities because going to space is incredibly hard.  Most people cannot withstand the experience and survive. Building an escape arc is science fiction.  In stories that I ve seen, its the rich and powerful that get on arcs.  If people were chosen by desirable traits, it wouldn't matter how much money or power they have, and the rich and powerful would not be ok with that.  \\nThe way humanity survives is by diversity and numbers, not by controlling our own selection on a mass scale.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"The only thing that Clarence is gratuitous with is his pubes and opining about his opinions on the latest bang bus/casting couch drop on xhamster.

There is a clear distinction: private property refers to assets like factories, land, and businesses that generate profit through the labor of others, whereas personal property includes things like your home, car or personal belongings. The key difference between private property and personal property is that private property is used explicitly to extract surplus value from workers' labor, while personal property is for individual use. \\"and I believe its existence is a positive for people.\\"The existence of private property is solely so owners can control the means of production to workers who have no choice but to sell their labor power to survive. Therefore, it is not merely a question of ownership but a social relation of power, where workers are dependent on capitalists for wages and capitalists profit from this dependency. \\"To deprive someone of access to something would imply they initially had access to it or were inherently entitled to it.\\"Under capitalism, the working class is systematically deprived of access to the means of production due to historical processes that concentrated ownership in the hands of a few. For instance, during the transition from feudalism to capitalism, peasants were dispossessed of their land and became wage laborers dependent on those who owned productive assets. This is \\"market dependence\\", a form of coercion specific to capitalism where workers are compeled to participate in exploitative relations because they have no other way to meet their material needs.\\"\\"without the owner the factory would not exist, there would be no wages for the workers to earn, there would be no no machines into which to pour their labor, the workers wouldn't gather there in the first place\\"This perspective overlooks how capitalism organizes production in such a way that benefits owners at the expense of workers. This investment into machinery and infrastructure is only possible because of profits extracted from workers' labor. Without workers producing surplus value, there is no profit for capitalists to reinvest. Capitalists (\\"owners) are also NOT indispensable because production could be organized democratically or cooperatively by workers themselves. This is the Marxian idea where workers own the means of production. In feudalist societies, workers would manage their own lands and pay rents or taxes to local lords. In this circumstance, farmers possessed acccess to the means of production and could cooperate with neighboring farmers if they saw fit. It was only when peasants were dispossessed of their land in the transition from capitalism to feudalism that wage laborers became dependent on owners. \\"No system is exempt of economic and material coercion due to the material reality of the world we live in, scarcity is a fact, not a capitalist construct.\\"Scarcity is not a capitalist construct, but market coercion through market dependence is a capitalist construct. Again, in feudalist societies, peasants had access to land and resources for subsistence and coercian was due to direct political figures like lords. Capitalist societies took it further by compeling individuals to participate in wage labor under conditions they cannot control.\\"most leftists would concede that a house is personal property, yet apparently its metaphysical nature changes should you rent it\\"The distinction is indeed due to the social relations being different. The metaphysical nature changes when the ownership is done for individual use or extracting of value from others (workers/renters).","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"It has.

We realize there's problems with inbreeding, or that the deformed and disabled don't have the same quality of life as everyone else, and thus we can see good reasons to choose for ourselves how best to make the population more ideal. I realize that like most sciences, the study of eugenics can be misused by people in hypothetical situations, but that's not what I'm arguing here. Growing more corn is good; doing so to make all of our food corn-based is unhealthy. Similarly, genetic improvement to a population is good; forcing people to procreate or not based on your own ideas is unhealthy.Why shouldn't we reduce the number of undesirable people in a population? Isn't that a byproduct of natural selection? Given the choice, people will try to be (and be with) more desirable, and they'll move away from people who are less desirable. This causes the undesirable people to have a lower quality of life, which is unnecessarily cruel to them. In contrast, having less undesirable people minimizes that cruelty, and thus seems like a good thing.","title":"CMV: Eugenics itself isn't bad, though it's been misused and abused in the past."},{"text":"Conservatives have been talking about scrapping birthright citizenship for a while: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and **subject to the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.The argument they tend to make is that \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" means people whose parents are in the US illegally don't count.It is a really terrible argument and isn't what is intended by those words, but conservatives - including on the Supreme Court - have never let that sort of thing get in their way.

It undermines the importance of your point. Trust me, alot of us feel the same.   Past performance is not a guarantee of future success.  Governments are changeable.

I'm hearing and seeing alot of,  'Oh, he won't really do that\\"    I'm also seeing a lot of people who feel safe and  say , \\"You don't understand how our constitution works\\".   It worries me.  Why ignore what the elected leadership is saying?  Why do we think he is bluffing?  Why do we laugh it off as, oh that won't happen?Autocratic governments first come into power by causing gridlock in legislative processes to crush the political opposition and stalemate bipartisan agreement.  We have seen the Republicans do this several times already (constant threat not to approve the budget, slowing the approval of judges and other appointees until change in power, invoking chaos to overthrough legislative leadership, blocking high priority actions that favor the incumbents, eg. the border bill).   Judges are then appointed based on loyalty to the party and who are politically minded and willing to reinterpret the law to limit equal protection and provide immunity to government officials.  We have seen this too.Brings us to the next step.  The leader exploits popular momentum to surround himself with advisors based on loyalty, and with the purpose to tear down the Departments they lead,  rather than run them effectively.    The legislature willingly relinquishes power of oversight and its role to control executive power (recess appointments).  This is what we potentially are seeing now.  Next, the experienced civil service and military leadership, which itself is a major check of misuse of power,  is purged and replaced. This is exactly what  the President-elect says he wants next.If you read history,  it's hard not to see the parallels of what happens when we elect prople who have as their aim the tearing down of our current method of government.  It usually starts when people insist on voting based on economic pains and ignore honest displays of ideology.  The last check to go is free elections.

If that understanding is wrong, then my premise is flawed.?It is the study of how to do so **through selective breeding**, which is a pretty important missing piece as to why it has a negative reputation. It is *not*:* Any taboo around impregnating your close relatives (as these taboos far outdate the concept of eugenics, and further appear to be largely driven by human biology, via the [Westermarck Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect)).\\n* Picking an attractive spouse; you're picking them because they're attractive and you want attractive children, sure -- but that's *why they are attractive,* it is a basic biological function that drives what *is* attractive.\\n* Terminating a pregnancy due to a genetic defect in the fetus; you aren't doing this because you don't want the defective gene to be put into the gene pool, you're doing it because you don't want to care for a child with that deformity.So boiling it down, caring about your kids' genes or your spouses' attractiveness isn't \\"eugenics\\", because if it were there'd be no need for the term to exist; eugenics has to function at the larger group level, and involve external influence (choosing *for other people* who gets to breed, and with whom, based on your own beliefs about what constitutes \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" genetics).If we had to build an escape ark and leave Earth to go terraform Mars, no one would have a problem with genetic testing for potential repopulators. If the earth is overcrowded with people and many of us shouldn't be having children, isn't selecting for the most ideal parental candidates healthy? The reasonable view of wanting a genetically diverse and healthy population isn't immoral. Only the way that it's been enforced in the past is immoral.Let's tackle that one head on. You have a few premises here that you really should examine: you're taking them as given, and I don't think you should do that.* Premise 1: selecting for ideal parental candidates would create genetic diversity and a healthy population\\n* Premise 2: it is plausible to artificially select for ideal genetics in an objectively beneficial way\\n* Premise 3: benefiting the \\"human race\\" in the abstract, as a whole, is more important than benefiting all of the individual humans that make up that raceLet's hit the most important one first: **why should premise 3 be true?** Even if the other two were true, let's say only 1% of people have the \\"best\\" genes and should be allowed to breed. Why should the other 99% sacrifice their own happiness (and the survival of their own families and their own legacies) so that the \\"human race\\" becomes 'better' in some abstract way? It won't benefit *them* in any way; it'll only hurt them.Now let's talk about the other two premises.* Premise 2: Who is actually in a position to determine which genetics are \\"best\\"? Is it better to be blond or brunette? If you cannot simultaneously breed for mental flexibility and mental stability, which do you prioritize? When we breed animals, we are breeding them for a specific, human-defined purpose -- and we're not interested in whether it makes the animals happier with their lives. We breed turkeys to have bigger breasts; we breed bloodhounds to have sharper noses; we don't breed anything to be \\"best\\", we breed them *for a purpose.*\\n* Premise 1: And finally, you'll notice that turkeys, bloodhounds, racehorses, etc... all these highly bred animals ... *are not genetically diverse.* You cannot selectively breed for specific traits, *and* promote genetic diversity.

Leveraging his wealth and connections, he played a pivotal role in facilitating Vladimir Putins political rise. His support for Putin stemmed from a belief that the then-relatively unknown politician could stabilize Russia while allowing the oligarchs to retain their economic and political privileges. Berezovskys media holdings, particularly ORT (now Channel One Russia), were instrumental in crafting Putins public image. ORT portrayed Putin as a decisive, competent leader capable of restoring order to a country plagued by economic turmoil and regional instability. This media narrative helped secure Putins popularity and, ultimately, his election as president in 2000. However, Berezovsky underestimated Putins determination to centralize power. Shortly after taking office, Putin sought to diminish the oligarchs political influence, initiating a broader campaign to reassert state control over critical industries and media. This clash of ambitions led to a dramatic fallout. Berezovsky, unwilling to cede his influence, became one of Putins most vocal critics. He openly denounced the Kremlins handling of high-profile crises, such as the Kursk submarine disaster, which further alienated him from Putins administration. Under increasing legal and political pressure, Berezovsky fled Russia in 2000, seeking refuge in the UK. In exile, he continued to oppose Putin, financing opposition movements and accusing the Kremlin of authoritarianism. His criticisms made him a prominent figure in the anti-Putin diaspora, but they also left him vulnerable to political and personal risks. Berezovskys life ended in 2013 under mysterious circumstances. Found dead in his UK residence, the official inquest could not determine whether his death was a result of suicide or foul play. His demise symbolized the precarious existence of former power brokers who challenged the Kremlin.","title":"Elon Musk Reportedly Had a Massive Blowup With a Trump Adviser"},{"text":"I've lost all hope of that.

It's why the right keeps running further right - all gas, no brakes.If we're right about what Trumpian social and economic policy is going to do, that'll be the remedy. If we're not, or Republicans manage to shield these people again through stimulus or some other mechanism, then they'll continue doing this.It has to become a choice for them and right now it's not.","title":"Trump border czar warns Temporary Protected Status can end tomorrow for Haitians in Ohio"},{"text":"Id never heard of this Boris guy before.

Especially without a DOE since the only way you can increase educational standards nationally is with a national effort.I would also point out that there is a thin line between education and indoctrination.   Teaching people \\"how\\" to think, e.g., logical consistency, primary and secondary sources, statistical significance, etc, is to impose the values of **one particular epistemology** \\\\- logical empiricism.  Now my undergrad degree is in neurophysiology and I spent my life as a biomedical design engineer, so that is MY preferred epistemology, too.  But post-grad I've also studied philosophy and I'm well aware that there are many **other** epistemologies out there that don't share the same assumptions that modern science is based on.   And I don't think the state has a moral right to impose one particular philosophy on its citizens.    Of course you can argue that an epistemology derived from logical empiricism is the 'best' one to teach simply because it **works** better than the alternatives (try designing a spaceship based on phenomenology).    But that's only true if you pronounce utilitarianism as the final arbiter of what's best, which again, is indocrinating a narrow philosophical viewpoint.Logical positivism/empiricism and its derivatives have not been the foundational epistemologies for human societies and civilisations for the vast time we've been on this planet.    They've been dominant in the west only since the 19th century.If you're going to insist that people be educated then maybe they should first be educated in philosophy, so they can get a wide range of views and choose for themselves.","title":"Nearly 40% of young Americans get their news from influencers.

There are two reliable methods for detecting guilt or deception. One is to look for the significant presence of truthful characteristics in the telling of a story.The other is to look for differences between what a person says, and what a reasonable *and innocent* person is likely to do or say if they were in the same position.\\"Why did you steal that money?\\"   \\"WTF?! I didn't steal it!\\" (Okay, that sounds right...)vs   \\"Oh, was there money? Well, you know, I'm a very honest person. I'm sure whoever took it probably needed it. Maybe it wasn't stolen...\\" (Hmm, this person REALLY wants me to stop investigating them in connection with this theft. Why is that?)The second method (deception detection) is slightly less reliable than the first method (truth-marker tabulation) because deception detection relies on us, the listeners, to imaginatively take the place of the speaker and ask, \\"If I were innocent and someone asked me the same question, what would *I say*?\\" We can do statistics to figure out what *most people* would say, but there's still wiggle room for interpretation that skews the result and biases the interviewer one way or another.It's easier to go through the mental checklist and tick off the characteristics of truthful narrative-sharing (which I won't mention here because I'm not in the business of making you all better liars, LOL).HOWEVER, all you need to know, to know that the report is bad, is that an innocent person would not only welcome the chance to clear their name, but they would DEMAND their day in court, to be cleared.

Mahalo for contacting me with your opposition to H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act.\\n \\nThis bill would postpone certain tax filing deadlines for U.S. nationals and their spouses who are unlawfully or wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad, and it would grant a refund and abatement of tax penalties and fines paid by detained individuals.\\n \\nIn addition, the bill would authorize the U.S. Treasury to revoke the tax-exempt status of any organization deemed to have provided material support or resources to a designated terrorist group within the past three years.\\n \\nH.R. 9495 required a two-thirds majority to pass the House. Although I voted for it, the bill failed by a vote of 256 to 145.\\n \\nThose who voted against it mainly focused on the section of the bill dealing with organizations supporting terrorist groups. This section of the bill passed the House as a stand-alone bill (H.R. 6408) by a vote of 382 to 11 on April 15, 2024.\\n \\nI was joined by a majority of my colleagues in voting for H.R. 6408 and H.R. 9495 because it is a reasonable step towards combating the financial networks of terrorist organizations across the globe, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\\n \\nAs for concerns that a second Trump administration could abuse this power, there are guardrails against that. The bills allow a terrorist-supporting organizations designation to be rescinded if disputed and found to be an error.

Theres no Concept of a Plan to Replace Those Workers.As of 2023, the top five states driving the U.S. economyCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinoiscollectively contribute trillions of dollars to the national GDP. Agriculture plays a key role in four of these states economies. In Texas alone, agriculture benefits from the labor of 1.6 million undocumented immigrants, who make up 8.5% of the workforce and contribute significantly to the states $1.77 trillion GDP. Nationally, 11 million undocumented immigrants play vital roles in industries like agriculture, construction, and hospitality, all while contributing $4.9 billion in state and local taxes annually in Texas alone.Their labor not only sustains food production but also drives spending in retail, housing, and services, supporting countless businesses and generating revenue. Many undocumented immigrants even pay into Social Security and Medicare, despite being ineligible for benefits, effectively subsidizing these programs. Yet, amidst proposals for mass deportations, no concrete plan exists to replace their contributions.The private prison industry, led by corporations like CoreCivic and The GEO Group, stands to profit immensely from mass deportations. These companies already operate detention centers under lucrative contracts with ICE. In 2021, ICE contracts accounted for nearly $550 million in annual revenue for each company. With the expansion of mass deportation programs, these profits will only grow, as more detention centers will be needed to hold deportees.Its no coincidence that these corporations direct the majority of their political contributions to Republican candidates and causes. For example, CoreCivic and The GEO Group have consistently funneled millions into campaigns that support stricter immigration policies, effectively lobbying for policies that ensure their financial growth. This relationship between corporate interests and political agendas underscores the profit motive behind these draconian policies.Beyond the profits for private prisons, the societal costs of these deportations are staggering. Deporting 5 million people annually would cost $31C43 billion and require massive expansions of ICE, detention facilities, and immigration courts. This program would destabilize industries and local economies, especially agriculture, which contributes over $1.53 trillion to the GDP. Higher food prices, labor shortages, and disrupted supply chains would ripple through every aspect of American life.Undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates per capita than U.S. citizens and contribute immeasurably to the economy and society. A sustainable solution like a path to citizenship would enhance their contributions while avoiding devastating economic and humanitarian consequences.Deporting 11 undocumented immigrants will crash the agricultural industry. There isnt even a concept of a plan to replace those workers. Theyre going to be detained, sent to a private detention facility, and used as slave labor. The national guard from red states are going to be used to round up undocumented immigrants and will be performing workplace raids. How many undocumented workers work at meat processing plants? Tyson chicken will definitely see an impact. https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/immigrants-in-texashttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/https://everytexan.org/2024/08/06/undocumented-texans-paid-4-9-billion-in-state-and-local-taxes-in-2022/https://texaslmi.comhttps://www.opensecrets.orghttps://www.newsweek.com/mass-deportation-trump-plan-nationalities-affected-1980105https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/1-million-migrants-us-rely-temporary-protections-trump-115848975https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2019/feb/5/under-pressure-some-politicians-return-private-prison-campaign-cash/https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Revised-ICE-detention-numbers-fact-sheet-final.pdfhttps://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?ind=G7000https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-ratehttps://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate","title":"'Shock and awe': What Trump 'border czar' Tom Homan has said he plans to do starting on Day 1"},{"text":"Student loans etc.: Sounds like Oklahomans are smarter shoppers than Bay Staters, but not by a lot; the difference in the averages is less than ten percent, if Im doing the numbers correctly. What makes a degree useless is, I guess, a matter of opinion. I myself went to a small liberal arts college. I only remember two art history majors, and they both became art history professors and turned out pretty well, so  what? We shouldnt have art history professors? I certainly disagree with you if thats what youre suggesting. As for the rest of us, there are some other professors, yes, but most of us leveraged those degrees into successful careers in other fields. Ill use my own career as an example. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry. I was a research chemist for just two years (one of my coworkers eventually became the CEO of Gilead Sciences), then went to law school, practiced for 33 years, helped a lot of people with their legal problems, was President of my state bar, was given several prestigious awards, was very happy and satisfied, retired at the age of 60, and am still living my best life as I always have. So you can call my liberal arts degree useless if you like, but my experience tells me otherwise. Steve Jobs went to my school too. Hes considered an alumnus even though he didnt graduate. (From anywhere; he had no degrees.)Federal funding: Oklahoma has 4 million people and Massachusetts has seven. The per capita for Massachusetts is higher, probably because they elect representatives in Congress who work to make that happen. And Im betting a lot of that goes into economic development; Congress isnt just writing checks and expecting nothing in return-as they shouldnt. Personal finance: Oklahoma has a lower cost of living, no one can argue with that.","title":"CMV: Voters in economically disadvantaged states who support the Republican Party are voting against their own self-interests."},{"text":"Define \\"good thing\\".??

To the president-elect, it doesnt matter that the Haitian workers and families are there legally; he has vowed that were going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country  and were going to start with Springfield.In September  after Trump, his running mate J.D. Vance, and so many other Republicans spread racist lies about the citys Haitian immigrants eating their neighbors pets  Rolling Stone visited Springfield, and found a city paralyzed by fear as its residents faced bomb threats and school evacuations. It got so bad that the citys Republican mayor was practically begging Team Trump to stop demagoguing the Haitian residents during the tail-end of his campaign. After spending time with members of the Haitian community and their allies, one thing became clear: Trump hadnt even won the election yet, but his blitz of racist terror on the small Ohio city was working. Many Haitians were suddenly afraid to be in public. Some felt the need to follow their children to and from school, out of concerns of violent retribution..Now, Trump has won, with significant political backing in Clark County, where Springfield sits, and things have only gotten worse. When Rolling Stone returned to Springfield in recent days to meet with members of the Haitian community and support network, very few, if any, would allow their names to be printed in this story. There is widespread uncertainty about how much Trump will follow through on his promise to rid Springfield of its Haitian immigrants, which would involve, as Trump has publicly stated, stripping them of the federal Temporary Protected Status (TPS) that allowed them to call Ohio their new home. There is, of course, pervasive fear and panic. There are lots of tears, and still enduring affection for a county, a state, and a nation that just resoundingly abandoned the Haitian immigrant community at the ballot box.He is coming for us, one Haitian family man says. We dont want to leave. We love this place It is home.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-springfield-ohio-haitians-terrified-1235171187/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-springfield-ohio-haitians-terrified-1235171187/)","title":"He Is Coming for Us: Springfields Haitians Are Terrified After Trumps Win"},{"text":"I mean he is the guy bragging about fucking his friends wives so that tracks","title":"Sex abuse allegations against Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth only make Trump like them more"},{"text":"Funny how a thread like that stays up (10 hours and counting), but anything about Palestine/Israel is locked immediately.","title":"Soccer sub seethes after USMNT celebrates with the Trump Dance"},{"text":"Hes won the election, whats the point of this fear mongering bs.

Leveraging his wealth and connections, he played a pivotal role in facilitating Vladimir Putins political rise. His support for Putin stemmed from a belief that the then-relatively unknown politician could stabilize Russia while allowing the oligarchs to retain their economic and political privileges.\\nBerezovskys media holdings, particularly ORT (now Channel One Russia), were instrumental in crafting Putins public image. ORT portrayed Putin as a decisive, competent leader capable of restoring order to a country plagued by economic turmoil and regional instability. This media narrative helped secure Putins popularity and, ultimately, his election as president in 2000.\\nHowever, Berezovsky underestimated Putins determination to centralize power. Shortly after taking office, Putin sought to diminish the oligarchs political influence, initiating a broader campaign to reassert state control over critical industries and media. This clash of ambitions led to a dramatic fallout. Berezovsky, unwilling to cede his influence, became one of Putins most vocal critics. He openly denounced the Kremlins handling of high-profile crises, such as the Kursk submarine disaster, which further alienated him from Putins administration.\\nUnder increasing legal and political pressure, Berezovsky fled Russia in 2000, seeking refuge in the UK. In exile, he continued to oppose Putin, financing opposition movements and accusing the Kremlin of authoritarianism. His criticisms made him a prominent figure in the anti-Putin diaspora, but they also left him vulnerable to political and personal risks.\\nBerezovskys life ended in 2013 under mysterious circumstances. Found dead in his UK residence, the official inquest could not determine whether his death was a result of suicide or foul play. His demise symbolized the precarious existence of former power brokers who challenged the Kremlin.","title":"Musks Massive Blow-Up With Trump Aide Rocks Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Look at Trumps hairwell, whats left of it","title":"Trumps bald AF"},{"text":"Good grief.

Like many teenagers and young adults, they often get peer-pressured into doing stupid stuff like stealing people's lawn gnomes or trying weed in a state where it's illegal. Their friends dare them to do some stupid prank that they don't know the laws around (such as graffiti in the wrong area). They get caught. The rest of the friends are ordered by the city to pay for the replacement paint job. But the undocumented one gets a much more severe punishment than any other teenager: they are banished to a country they don't even remember and have to start life from scratch alone.Most Americans have done something illegal, whether it's trespassing, trying some sort of drug or alcohol before the proper age, or something similar.

(full link below)When the historian Robert Paxton was asked about Trump and fascism a few weeks ago, he made an important point. Of course, Trump is a fascist, Paxton concluded. It was fine to compare him to Mussolini and Hitler, but there was a larger point. It took some luck for those two to come to power. The Trump phenomenon looks like it has a much more solid social base, Paxton said, which neither Hitler nor Mussolini would have had.Fascism is a phenomenon, not a person. Just as Trump was always a presence, so is the movement he has created. It is not just a matter of the actual fascists in his movement, who are scarcely hiding, nor of his own friendly references to Hitler or his use of Hitlerian language (vermin, enemy within). He bears responsibility for what comes next, as do his allies and supporters.Yet some, and probably more, of the blame rests with our actions and analysis. Again and again, our major institutions, from the media to the judiciary, have amplified Trumps presence; again and again, we have failed to name the consequences. Fascism can be defeated, but not when we are on its side. ?https://archive.ph/2024.11.09-143222/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/dispatches/what-does-it-mean-that-donald-trump-is-a-fascist","title":"Joyce Vance: Trump's possible revenge plan for Jack Smith is utterly unacceptable'"},{"text":"Apparently Trump must also be the smartest guy in the room.

In prior administrations (including Democratic ones) threatening deportation after misdemeanor or traffic violations led to, UNSURPRISINGLY, profound distrust of police. Less law and order, less calling the police, because many in our community agreed that a minor fender bender shouldn't upend someone's life. We should be very concerned with labeling groups of people as \\"other\\", \\"criminal\\", or \\"enemies from within\\". The US House just voted again on a proposal to label particular nonprofits as \\"terrorist-supporting organizations\\", a label that can easily be weaponized against nonprofits with agendas that those in power dispute.Such labels can embolden those in power to act cruelly, with the public's seeming consent.https://nonprofitquarterly.org/bill-threatening-nonprofits-advances-in-us-house-again/","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Bring it. Mr Thundermaker would love to bark at Fascists.","title":"Trump supporters will come after democrats too"},{"text":"I don't necessarily disagree with the deportation of undocumented immigrants who engage in hard criminality in the US. But Republicans, and Trump, are grossly misrepresenting the numbers. Republicans seem to hold this belief that immigrant crime is rampant and the main driver for crime in the US. [This is simply not the case.](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.migrationpolicy.org%2Fcontent%2Fimmigrants-and-crime&amp;utm_campaign=aga&amp;utm_source=agsadl1%2Cagsadl3%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) [There has never been a study where undocumented or documented immigrant crime has been higher than the crime rate of US born citizens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6241529/) since 1870, when they started recording this data. And why should it be? If you are an undocumented immigrant in the US, why would you ever want attention brought on to yourself to get deported, when you worked so hard to find a way into the country and escape wherever it is you fled from? That's why between 1990 and 2018, nearly 90% of incarcerations for immigrants were related to immigration violation laws.My issue with Trump's war on immigrants is very simply that the numbers aren't there to warrant the scale of his war, for one. For two, because of the nature of undocumented immigrants, being that they are not accounted for in the US system and therefore cannot be precisely tracked, many legal immigrants and US citizens will be caught in the crossfire, should Trump enact this Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think back to the Haitans of Springfield: Trump has repeated wrongfully that they are eating animals and committing crimes in the city. Haitan immigrants in Springfield could very well be targeted by his anti-immigration policies, even though they are in the country legally, and theres nothing they can do about it. It would be one of the most Orwellian events of our lifetime.And if you think it's absolutely not possible that citizens could be targeted, [George Takei, a US citizen, recounted that his family, who were legal US citizens during the Second World War, were detained with other Japanese immigrants, because they were at war with Japan.](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2024%2F11%2F03%2Fgeorge-takei-worries-trump-repeat-dark-past%2F75828007007%2F&amp;utm_campaign=aga&amp;utm_source=agsadl1%2Cagsadl3%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) That's the level of overreach we would be dealing with. Again, if an undocumented immigrant is committing heinous crime, they should be deported. The numbers do not exist for what Trump is planning, and it will be detrimental to the US if he follows through.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Ukraine is a few months away from having enriched uranium.

Some things are scarce because people want them to be scarceAnd that is exactly what artificial scarcity is - that is why you may have hard time discussing the topic with others or understanding their points. You can't understand others if you don't understand what they mean.If i were to for example become a hugely popular artist, and i had a backlog of thousands of paintings, but drip fed them to the public, this would by most people's conception be an artificially scarce good, but should i not have the right to do it?Whether you have right or not is a completely different discussion - what I aimed is for you to understand natural vs artificial scarcity. In this case this is a clear case of artificial scarcity and there is nothing wrong with it - you have produced those yourself and are not stopping anyone from producing paintings and selling them - because the demand is for paintings made by you.But your example of diamonds is not the same - in this case you have obtained exclusive mining rights to a resource that would be available to others. And now you are limiting the output of that resource to keep the price higher and stopping others from producing diamonds. This is where is the issue.You can't fine or jail a corporation, someone is still responsible for paying the bills, giving the orders and so on, its not some automatonNo, there are cases where no one is really responsible. It works by dissolving responsibility to the point where there is enough plausible deniability to make it impossible to have someone be responsible.  And yes, you can fine a corporation - in fact it is only way of effectively exercising responsibility. But that means that forgoing responsibility is effectively a tax to be paid, not really a punishment.Material conditions dictate that never will everyone demand the exact same things in the same amount and have the same means to obtain resources. A very tall person will by no fault of their own need to pay for bigger clothes, more legroom on planes, A person with a faster metabolism will need to eat more, someone with one mindset will work less than a person with another.Yes, but those differences are effectively too small to matter at scales of whole country. If you produce clothes then at scale the cost of tracking those differences would be more than approximating them. That is why companies set price points that mean that on average they don't lose money, despite one $20 piece of clothing will use less material than other.And that applies to every single trait - they balance themselves over time simply because of how random distribution works and how approximation is more effective at larger scales.Repeat across a lifetime, across generations, and these things will always breed inequality and bring about economic inequality that causes one person to be more financially endowed by the latter,No, that is a very large leap of logic for which to be true you would need to assume that there is some part of population that is inherently better at economy by traits that are transferable. Which is not the case - all examples of \\"disadvantageous\\" traits aren't guaranteed to transfer - after all tall people can have short kids and the same is true for metabolism or other traits.What I want to single out is \\"mindset\\" - we do understand that mental traits are more affected by nurture, not nature. After all they are largely shaped by your upbringing.and these people will seek to, for their own best interest, grow wealthier and more secureAnd that has natural limit. Let's say you have $200 million that can be kept in investment account that gives you reasonable 5%/year - meaning your money grows passively by $10 million per year. How increasing that amount would benefit you? Not much, because at this point you are already in position where you can afford all necessities and add a large amount of non-necessary spending, without even crossing the yearly ROI. This is why $1 does not have the same worth to everyone and it will be worth less to you if you have more of them. The only way to achieve equality in this sense is to constantly correct for it by taking away from the people getting ahead to pull everyone else up, which i would say is no less exploitative than wage laborWage labor is paying the market price for labor you need to produce something and make a profit. But the constraint there is that people need to cover their basic necessities, so there a problem of bargaining power - if you are underpaid, you cannot stop working and seek other employment without risk of falling into destitution. At the same time the wage is dictated by the market that can easily take those risks, because if you own $200 million in form of a company, you can easily take a risk of having less workers and making less profit if it means that you will be able to save on labor costs. This is an inherent factor that makes wage labor exploitative - the playing field is not equal and one side can afford to lose while other don't.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"So Susan Collins.

Also note that despite former high level older republicans throwing in support for Harris, trump made massive gains among current republicans and democrats.  Now the democrats probably were protest votes where they didnt vote, voted green, and yes, voted trump.  The republican of old is dead and gone.  It is maga now across the board driven by fear and hate.  They fear a loss of power socially and economically.  They are fed things to hate so they be unified and controlled.  Hate minorities, hate women, hate hate hate.  The maga party uses ignorance, religion, and fox news to package and deliver messages that have little to no truth.  The target audience devours it because they lack critical thinking skills and it feeds on their fears.  It soothes them and stokes more fear at the same time.  It does not matter that he doesnt have a mandate.  It doesnt matter because trump will rule the same regardless.  It doesnt matter because maga controls the entire federal government  ALL OF IT.   What matters is that the democratic political machine is failing to rally support. How can the democrats regain those that they have lost?  Can you simplify messaging down to lock her up, type chants that work for democracy instead of against it?   I doubt we can raise the cognitive level of the masses.  The Democratic Party needs a cohesive set of messages and goals.  They need to not provide only lip service to minority and young voter issues while trying to convert solid maga voters.

It could only make the situation worse while doing nothing to prevent him from becoming president. The penalty for refusing to sign the ethics agreement is that the president-elect forfeits their legal right to access transition materials. The White House, however, has the discretion to provide those resources anywayits not obligated to refuse, but it can if the agreement remains unsigned.Regardless, this doesnt change the fact that the president-elect will assume office on the same day, no matter what. The real consequence is the chaos caused by a sudden handover instead of a smooth transition. The law relies on the assumption that no president-elect would allow such chaos to happen. Unfortunately, Trump has shown hes perfectly willing to let it happenand would likely shift the blame onto Democrats to gain political support instead of losing it.Many laws related to the presidency were written with an unspoken assumption: that presidents would adhere to a baseline level of decency and a desire to at least appear as though they were acting in good faith to preserve order. Even if a president harbored unethical agendas behind the scenes, legislators assumed theyd want to maintain an image of competence and propriety.The problem is, those laws were built for a system that assumed a certain degree of shame or political accountability. Legislators didnt feel it was necessary to safeguard against a president who openly disregarded the rule of law in such an obvious, public way. They assumed such a candidate wouldnt be electedor, if they were, theyd be impeached immediately for being so blatant.That assumption no longer holds.

I am running out of time however so i will only answer some of the questions you asked and key pointsHonestly, there seems to be an issue with your definition of scarcity being something different than what is generally understood as scarcity. So what is scarcity to you and what would you qualify as artificial scarcity?Like i said, i consider all scarcity 'real'. Some things are scarce because people want them to be scarce, and of course others will disagree with their decision, moralize about it, but at the end the scarcity is there. If i were to for example become a hugely popular artist, and i had a backlog of thousands of paintings, but drip fed them to the public, this would by most people's conception be an artificially scarce good, but should i not have the right to do it?As for your point about LLCs, i think i grasp what you're getting at. You're specifically talking about the corporations-as-legal-persons concept. However, even in this sense, there needs to be a person behind the legal framework. You can't fine or jail a corporation, someone is still responsible for paying the bills, giving the orders and so on, its not some automatonAnd ultimately on financial violence, i would say that there is very clearly a functional difference. You are in essence saying slavery is the same as wage labor (Which i do understand a lot of leftists would in fact argue for) but i'd say its very clearly a different concept.Material conditions dictate that never will everyone demand the exact same things in the same amount and have the same means to obtain resources. A very tall person will by no fault of their own need to pay for bigger clothes, more legroom on planes, A person with a faster metabolism will need to eat more, someone with one mindset will work less than a person with another.  Repeat across a lifetime, across generations, and these things will always breed inequality and bring about economic inequality that causes one person to be more financially endowed by the latter, and these people will seek to, for their own best interest, grow wealthier and more secure. The only way to achieve equality in this sense is to constantly correct for it by taking away from the people getting ahead to pull everyone else up, which i would say is no less exploitative than wage labor","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Hell probably suggest dumping them in the ocean.

There were no improvements anywhere, and so they could go anywhere. They had the natural right to travel without artificial boundaries.?Then somewhere along the line, we decided that if someone made improvements to a place, it became their own land, and they could decide whether others could use it and how.That *necessarily* reduces the freedom that others have, by taking away a natural right they would possess if not for the establishment of property.Societies made the argument, more or less, that if you did not permit people to gain exclusive use rights over the land, then nobody would have much reason to improve the land, and the improvements overall produce a society which is better than what you get from nature.?The problem here is that creating these exclusive use rights *everywhere* creates highly exploitable situations. Certainly you can manage that with governmentslimiting how property may be used, putting limits on how exclusive those use rights are, requiring a percentage of the benefit of that property to be returned to the public via taxes, etc.?But property itself definitely limits the freedom of everyone else, and that exchange is premised on the idea that doing that must produce a net positive return for the public in a material sense. If you have a property system which is *not* producing a net return for everyone else to compare sate then for the loss of use of the land, then you have an exploitative property system.TL;DR: if youre going to claim property rights over some land, youre going to owe some taxes to the public to compensate everyone else for their loss of use of the land.?","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Ugh....this stupid issue again.

The rust belt didnt just decline because of globalization or bad weather, it declined because industry will go where things are cheaper to make. A lot of southern states that still have large manufacturing sectors dont necessarily have the luxury of hoping that raising costs on those firms will keep jobs in America.?Second: tariffs. Tariffs weaken exports by making them more expensive, and they make imports more expensive. But they also frequently boost domestic manufacturing, by making up some of the difference between foreign and domestic labor costs in taxes. If you work a well-paid service sector job, thats obviously not worth it. But if you have a more blue collar job, the injection of cash into local labor could be good for you.?Third: the Democratic Party at some point has to run on its record, not its goals. The democrats have had power for the last four years. What can they realistically claim they did for the common man? Did they fight to raise the minimum wage? No. Did they fight for drug reform? Also no. Did they fight to reduce gaps in social insurance? Also no. The last substantial improvement for common people made by a democratic federal politician (not the court) that they can claim is probably Obamacare, which is almost 15 years ago now.?Forth: the Democratic Party has open contempt for working class America. How many times have you heard Donald Trumps I love the poorly educated played for laughs among liberals? Basket of deplorables went viral and was said by a presidential candidate. How many liberals have claimed Idiocracy was some profound prediction about American politics instead of just upper crust snobbery? How many times have you seen highly upvoted Reddit posts calling for the genocide of the South? Would you really trust a group like that to take care of the working class, especially outside of the coasts??I still voted for the Democratic Party. But, when people see the Democratic Party as an out of touch institution looking to enrich coders, bankers, and lawyers at the expense of everybody else, I think its clear why. The pervasive sense of snobbery, complacency, and lack of interest in the average person does not a healthy party make.?","title":"CMV: Voters in economically disadvantaged states who support the Republican Party are voting against their own self-interests."},{"text":"Why do these satellite photos have crowd sizes written in sharpie?","title":"President-elect Donald Trump is now receiving intelligence briefings"},{"text":"Well you see the dems were GOING to cheat, so GOP just *had to* work with russia to win the election.

This bill, which was already defeated once due to overwhelming public outcry, poses a dangerous threat to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. It grants any incoming administration unchecked authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profit organizations without oversight or due process. Such government overreach is not what the Founding Fathers envisioned for our democracy. This bill undermines the principles of free speech and freedom of association, cornerstones of American liberty.H.R. 9495 threatens to pave the way for political suppression, allowing the government to selectively target and shut down organizations based on ideological disagreements. This could affect any non-profit, including churches and conservative groups, as well as organizations that champion human rights and civil liberties. Regardless of political leanings, this bill sets a chilling precedent that no American patriot should support.While situations relating to the hostages deserve careful attention, they can and should be addressed in a separate, narrowly tailored bill. H.R. 9495, however, is a broad, unconstitutional overreach that strikes at the heart of free speech and freedom. It is unpatriotic and incompatible with the values we hold dear as Americans.  I implore you to stand as a defender of liberty and uphold the rights of your constituents. Be a patriot, listen to the voice of the people, protect our God given right to free speech as Americans, and reject this dangerous legislation. Vote NO on H.R. 9495.

Houses for example are a scarce resource,They aren't. Taking US as an example, there are around 700k homeless people while there are also approximately 15.1 million vacant homes nationwide (10% of all homes). Scarcity is defined by being in lower supply than demand. The problem is not scarcity of houses, it's mismanagement of them as a resource by allowing them to sit unoccupied and produce enough value that you are gaining money from them rotting away.there must be a method to determine who has access to themAnd there is - personal ownership instead of private ownership. You can have as many houses as you want as long as you are responsible for them - and on that foundation we can have legislation that controls faults in the market caused by inflexibility of demand and other connected issues.Even the most common example of artificial scarcity, diamonds, is not truly artificial.Of course it is - there are enough diamonds for the price to tank, but the artificial price is limited both by artificially limiting supply (companies who own mining rights don't increase the amount of mined diamonds despite it being possible) and artificially inflating demand (by industry-funded campaigns that smeared the exact same product that is not mined).If they were to flood the market they would ruin the value of the product not only for themselves but for the customers and owners tooWhat value of the product would be lost and why there is such value? Diamond is diamond and it's qualities don't change whether you buy it sor $100 or $10000 - which means that the value comes from the price itself. But if that price is kept high by limiting supply, how it is not artificial scarcity?Honestly, there seems to be an issue with your definition of scarcity being something different than what is generally understood as scarcity. So what is scarcity to you and what would you qualify as artificial scarcity?One wouldn't say the government is artificially limiting the supply of money by refusing to print infinite money for everyone.Because money is a medium of exchange, not a product. It means that it's only reason is to represent value for transactions between people and printing money destabilizes that value - because only thing that changes is amount of money in circulation, not amount of products on the market.Would i for example, not be taking care of my house if i pay for a plumber instead of doing it myself?No, because you are still maintaining responsibility and owning the house as personal property - hiring someone to take care of your house does not change that, you are still one who is taking the risk if that plumber fucks up and floods the house, destroying renters property. But if that house is your private property (ex. owned by LLC that you have 100% control of) then the same does not apply. LLC is responsible, not you. Of course in reality there will be some laws that need to be taken into account as to how to do that without breaking them - but these laws aren't going to cover everything and they were only created because private property allows for disconnect from responsibilities - they are patching the issue created by inherent problem with private property.i mean thats in essence what happened to some people, so, yeah?If you are seeing all of those as legitimate then this is one of core reasons why you are not going to see anything wrong with private property - because it seems that for you using your wealth to take advantage of others in dire situation is not an issue.If i purchase a roll of toilet should my right to own it really be decided whether i want to wipe my own ass with it or sell it in a taco bell restroomYes. Because your right to own is not inherent - it's a right given you by social contract where the society is guaranteeing your right to own property. So why society should be ok with you using said property in ways that negatively affect society?Let's put it that way - why are you able to own that roll of TP and I can't simply go to your house to take it when I need to crap? Because you bought it and own it. But why were you able to buy it and own it in the first place? Because there are laws that state how you can come into ownership and forces that protect your ownership. And they are in place because people do understand from collective experience that without them there would be chaos where anyone can lose everything because someone stronger came in and took it - which would stiffle the growth of society.But there is an important question - what is the difference between:  \\n\\\\- me being stronger than you, forcibly taking the stuff you have by overpowering you to the point where you don't have enough strength to resist   \\n\\\\- me being wealthier than you, forcibly taking the stuff you have by overspending you to the point where you don't have enough wealth to resistThere is no functional difference.

Anyway:**Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessents battle to be Trumps Treasury secretary turns bitter**Wall Street factions fight for top economic post in president-elects cabinetThe rising opposition to Howard Lutnicks candidacy, disclosed in interviews with top Wall Street executives, has made the battle for the Treasury job the thorniest for Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessents battle to be Trumps Treasury secretary.By James Fontanella-Khan in New York, Colby Smith and James Politi in Washington and Alex Rogers in Palm BeachYESTERDAYHoward Lutnick and Scott Bessent are at the centre of an increasingly bitter battle to be Donald Trumps Treasury secretary, as Wall Street factions fight to discredit each others candidate.Several financiers who supported Trumps election bid moved on Monday to kill off Lutnicks chances, saying he lacked the experience for the position and was abusing his position as a leader of the transition team to promote himself for the job.Bessent came under attack later on Monday, when a purported record of poor returns at his hedge fund Key Square Group was circulated across chat groups on Wall Street and beyond, appearing to cast doubt on his financial acumen.Bessent is known for making a windfall in bets against the Japanese yen and British pound for philanthropist George Soros.One person familiar with the deepening rivalry described the contest as a pissing match between the Lutnick and Bessent camps. Others said the friction could point to deepening divisions within Trumps inner circle.The dispute erupted two days after Elon Musk threw his support behind Lutnicks candidacy, saying in a post on X the Cantor Fitzgerald chief would actually enact change, in contrast with Bessent  the business-as-usual choice.The post on Saturday from Trumps close confidant sparked alarm among some Wall Street executives, who had backed Bessent as a more predictable candidate, and rejected Lutnick as out of his depth.Its unfortunate that Howard . . . is now abusing his position to put his candidacy ahead of everybody else, said a person close to Trump. Im sure the president will not be bullied into picking him  it would be a huge mistake.Another Trump supporter on Wall Street described Lutnick as a swashbuckler who had been vital in the Republican candidates run for the White House, but was ill suited for a job with huge sway over the worlds biggest economy and global bond markets.The rising opposition to Lutnicks candidacy, disclosed in interviews with top Wall Street executives, has made the battle for the Treasury job the thorniest yet for Trump, who has appointed much of his proposed cabinet with breakneck speed in the past week.One Trump donor said the Cantor Fitzgerald boss had led a Cheney-style selection committee that has ignored the president and focused on himself, referring to the search committee run by Dick Cheney to find a running mate for George W Bush, which picked Cheney himself.The president-elect wont be playing the Lutnick game any longer, said the top donor, who supports Bessent.The bitter fight between Bessent and Lutnick initially focused on the candidates stance on trade, with Trump seeking commitment to his hawkish plan to ratchet up tariffs on imports.A pro-Lutnick Trump donor said the Cantor Fitzgerald boss and the president-elect were fully aligned on tariffs and his economic agenda to boost the economy and achieve energy dominance.President Trump and Howard Lutnick are hand-in-glove on these critically important initiatives and Lutnick understands the chain of command.In an effort to discredit Bessent on Monday, anonymous people circulated an account purporting to show poor returns from the investors hedge fund. The Financial Times could not verify the accuracy of the numbers. Semafor first reported the document in circulation.Top financiers backing Bessent said he had the experience and credibility to deliver key tenets of Trumps economic agenda. He has also won over some former opponents on Wall Street.I hate Trump but I love my country and I want us to succeed . . . Bessent is a person that we can all live with, said a top Democratic Party donor. The pitched battle for the top economy job has also forced Trump to widen the search for a candidate.It now includes former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh, private equity boss Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and Robert Lighthizer, Trumps former US trade representative. Some Wall Street executives welcomed Rowans potential candidacy, but they warned it would be hard for him to step away from his job managing a firm with $700bn assets under management. Warsh, who is advising Trumps transition team on the economy, is considered a candidate to replace Jay Powell when the Fed chairs term expires in 2026.A spokesperson for Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment; nor did Trumps transition team, Warsh, Lighthizer or Hagerty. Apollo and a spokesperson for Bessent declined to comment.At the Palm Beach airport close to Trumps Mar-a-Lago home, outgoing Utah senator Mitt Romney and Florida congressman Brian Mast were chatting, waiting for their flight. Romney, a Trump critic, said he would spare any thoughts on the Treasury contenders because he would be a private citizen and out of office next year. Mast said Lutnick was my bet but would not elaborate.","title":"Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessents battle to be Trumps Treasury secretary turns bitter"},{"text":"The problem with the notion of \\"private property\\" is not necessarily visible to everyone so let me show why it is a problem.

He focuses on obscure felonies, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\\"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access\\"), that you can commit unintentionally.  Are you sure that you have never \\"exceeded authorized access\\" to any computer?  Do you know exactly what you're allowed to download from your legitimate library account, for example?  When you build a new account with an online company, how closely do you read the Terms of Service or the EULA before you click on \\"Accept\\"?  Silverglate may be exaggerating when he says \\"three felonies a day.\\"  However, the point he is trying to make is that we have all probably violated some obscure criminal law for which we could be charged and convicted.  This, presumably, would include unauthorized immigrants.  If you look hard enough, probably ALL of them have violated SOME criminal law, just as you and I and every other adult in the US has probably done something for which they could be charged and convicted.

Attempting to minimise coercion is still possible, in the same way we will never do away with murder but we still wish to minimise that.Also I think it's disingenuous to say that without factory owners a factory wouldn't exist, there is nothing having stopped any factory from being constructed via different funding methods.","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Do you really think Trump and his sycophants will worry about the rules?They will be dumped across the border into Mexico and then the door will be slammed behind them.","title":"Trump will need Venezuela to cooperate for mass deportations"},{"text":"She will instead blame the liberals for killing her son and continue to binge on Fox.","title":"Donald Trump is Already Looking to Gut Medicaid: Republicans are looking to cut federal assistance programs in order to extend Trump's 2017 corporate tax cut."},{"text":"Hopefully Putin is not stupid to fall in their trap.","title":"Why is Biden trying to encourage further war before Trump takes office?"},{"text":"Elon Loomer","title":"Trumps bald AF"},{"text":"If you entered the USA illegally and have tried to make a life for yourself, they should be given 6 months to register here without punishment.

The government basically just has to ask us nicely, and we'll take the fact that they bothered to ask at all as a sign to leave. We might try a different country if we really didn't like our old home, but we won't bother you any more.But it's very hard to deport somebody who will *die* if they ended up back in their \\"home\\" country, and people who illegally immigrate into a stable country - sometimes crossing oceans in sinking boats - are overwhelmingly part of this category. You can't get them to pay for their trip back because they have nothing, and they will do literally anything to survive in the country, including crime, because again - if they return, they will die, and if they starve, they also die.From a pragmatic standpoint, by doing nothing, the government is hoisting the cost of handling illegal immigrants on the communities themselves - they'll need to be fed and dressed, and it'll come from illegal jobs, charity, or crime. This is not ideal.Alternatively, the government can spend money to support illegal immigrants, try and deport them, or just shoot them on the spot; the third choice is decidedly cheaper and has the same effect as the second, while the first choice could be (but isn't necessarily) more expensive than the second.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Video is 1 minute long and mentions absolutely nothing about what the legislation entails.","title":"And here comes Trump's anti-Semitism laws"},{"text":"Section. 3.He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcriptHow about now?","title":"On Trump's Cabinet Picks, McConnell Issues a Warning"},{"text":" For example Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos... the Koch Brothers...Soros, Gates, Oprah, Mark Cuban, the owners of ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, **Alphabet**.Google was *firmly* in the tank for Harris.

Your justification for private property is that someone else produced or purchased the asset. But then your example is land. Humans did not create the Earth, so produced is not an option. Which leaves purchased. But in order for a purchase to count, the seller needs to have owned the thing in the first place. If you buy an item that a seller didn't own, you're just a fool that got scammed, you don't get it.So how did the farmer come to be the owner of the land in the first place, if both creating and buying it are impossible?Well the real answer is that hundreds or thousands of years ago someone a piece of land was theirs, and they used force to claim it and protect it, and since then it has passed hands until it eventually came into the claim of the farmer.In the modern sense however and for the purposes of our hypothetical, we would bring up homesteading. If someone took a piece of unused and unclaimed wild land and started to turn it productive by working it and such, they would gain a claim to their land.In many places, the owner of the land and the farmer who work it are not the same thing. Usually, the farmer merely rents it. (And going further, the farmer renting it may not be doing the work, but hire farmshands to do it for them). This is a key feature of private property, but would be unjust by the logic you're using here.Yes and i mention this in my post. A part of my perspective of course recognizes that purchase of labor is acceptable, so even if some farmer does plough every field he owns, typically its going to be ploughed by labor he purchased, using tools he provided, which i believe is the same as him putting in the workThis is a point you need to substantiate? Why can factories not exist independently of owners?Its not that they cannot exist. Of course if someone builds a factory and then you kill them the factory is still there and will change hands etc. What i meant is, if there was no incentive for the owner to build the factory in the first place, such in the case of him not being able to actually own it, he wouldn't have built it in the first place","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"That's not necessarily true.Republicans won the popular vote in the House of Representatives in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2014, 2016 and 2022.

This is the society we are headed towards. If return on investments R is greater than economic growth G consistently, then wealth concentrates.

For everyone else, they would work to survive on the bare minimum while a small minority received everything they could want. Is this a society you would want to live in? If you are one of the few, then sure maybe you don't care about everyone else. We are at a point in society where growth is outstripped by investment retuns and has been for several decades. If this continues, private property will lead to immense concentration of wealth, such that almost everyone will be unable to own any assets, of particular importance are homes, without which you cannot retire.

I don't believe everyone is inherently entitled towards say, a resource, much less a productive asset, that was produced and purchased and is maintained by someone else. Does a farmer deprive his neighbor of his field by not letting him use it?You make an interesting leap of logic here. Your justification for private property is that someone else produced or purchased the asset. But then your example is land. Humans did not create the Earth, so produced is not an option. Which leaves purchased. But in order for a purchase to count, the seller needs to have owned the thing in the first place. If you buy an item that a seller didn't own, you're just a fool that got scammed, you don't get it.So how did the farmer come to be the owner of the land in the first place, if both creating and buying it are impossible?Why does his neighbor ( a stand in for in essence anyone who might desire to use it) have a greater right to use it than the farmer, who perhaps put in the labor necessary to make the field productive, or bought it in such a state?In many places, the owner of the land and the farmer who work it are not the same thing. Usually, the farmer merely rents it. (And going further, the farmer renting it may not be doing the work, but hire farmshands to do it for them). This is a key feature of private property, but would be unjust by the logic you're using here.Crucial to this discussion is the concept of economic coercion and the idea of stealing surplus value. While its a big discussion to be had in a separate debate, in short my position is that no system is exempt of economic and material coercion due to the material reality of the world we live in, scarcity is a fact, not a capitalist construct.Another point often made is that a factory for example could run without its owner, thus the owner is some arbitrary construct there merely to siphon profit from the workers. However, without the owner the factory would not exist, there would be no wages for the workers to earn, there would be no no machines into which to pour their labor, the workers wouldn't gather there in the first place etcThis is a point you need to substantiate? Why can factories not exist independently of owners?","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Its 4 years that can deeply hurt almost all aspects of some peoples lives.

We live in reality where people are at risk of being homeless because they barely can afford to buy or rent. This means that action is needed to resolve this issue (and I would agree that some parts of the left do have proposals that are not fueled by rational attempt to resolve the problem, but rather by pursue of vindictive \\"justice\\").All scarcity is 'real'. Houses for example are a scarce resource, there must be a method to determine who has access to them. In our current system it's the legitimacy of their claim to property and then contracts to rent it out.Even the most common example of artificial scarcity, diamonds, is not truly artificial. Diamond companies control the flow of real diamonds into the world because there is Demand for Demand itself. If they were to flood the market they would ruin the value of the product not only for themselves but for the customers and owners too. One wouldn't say the government is artificially limiting the supply of money by refusing to print infinite money for everyone.It really isn't. Personal property is yours - you own it, you use it, you maintain it and more importantly you are responsible for it and how it affects others. Private property is a construct made so you can own something while being able to forgo usage, maintenance and responsibility.Would i for example, not be taking care of my house if i pay for a plumber instead of doing it myself? People who own productive property are still responsible for it and are in fact responsible for how it affects others. Its just that for sake of management there is a hierarchy to it and a division of labor.   \\nLet's use reductio ad absurdum to check if that is really the case.

You live in France, benefiting from its freedomsfreedom to dress how you please, freedom to protest, freedom to critiqueyet you frame its secular policies as \\"oppression\\" while championing a Saudi system that enforces mandatory dress codes and punishes deviation. Frances laws do not forbid you from practicing Islam; they enforce secularism in public institutions, applying equally to all faiths. Saudi Arabia, by contrast, mandates not only attire but behavior under theocratic law, stripping women of any choice in how they express themselves.Why havent you moved to Saudi Arabia, the supposed utopia of womens rights and Islamic governance, if you find Western secularism so oppressive? Could it be because the rights you enjoy in Franceeducation, unrestricted movement, and the ability to critique systemsdont exist under the Saudi regime?Is it truly \\"oppression\\" to ask for neutrality in public spaces, or is it more oppressive to jail women for unveiling their faces?--- **\\"Where do you think its better to live: in a country where youre free to live your religion or in a country where when you go out you have the fear to be spit on, insulted, harassed, killed because of your religion and where the media tries as much as they can to make you and your other religious folks the bad guy, as terrorists, as the problem of the world (just like Nazi Germany did)?\\"**This is a blatant false equivalence. Comparing Western criticisms of Islam to the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany is not only offensive but historically illiterate. Nazi Germanys atrocities involved systemic extermination, the West does not strip Muslims of their fundamental rights or humanity. You are free to wear a hijab, practice halal, and openly criticize governments in France, none of which would be tolerated in Saudi Arabia, where dissent is criminalized.Your argument collapses under your own choices. If Western countries are so dangerous for Muslims, why do you remain in France instead of moving to Saudi Arabia, where your faith supposedly thrives unchallenged? The reality is that you enjoy freedoms in France that Saudi women can only dream of, including the right to practice your religion without state-imposed penalties for deviating from it.If Saudi Arabia is the shining beacon of Islamic virtue, why do you choose to stay in a society that allegedly treats you as \\"the problem of the world\\"?--- **\\"As many others already said, youre only seeing this from your Western point of view and dont try to understand the point of others.\\"**The classic \\"Western bias\\" accusationa convenient deflection used to avoid engaging with universal truths. Human rights are not a Western invention; they are codified in global treaties that Saudi Arabia itself has signed, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Are you suggesting that Saudi women, who campaign against guardianship laws, imprisonment, and torture, are also blinded by Western bias? Or do their lived experiences not count because they challenge your romanticized narrative?Its not \\"Western bias\\" to assert that women should have the right to marry, travel (a freedom you freely indulge in while residing in secular France), and study without male permission. If you claim to champion Islamic equity, why defend systems that deny women the Quranic principle of free will? You benefit from the very autonomy you deny others.If cultural relativism excuses oppression, where do you draw the line? Should we accept apartheid, child marriage, or honor killings as valid cultural practices too?--- **\\"Moreover, youre acting like a neo-colonialist when people tell you that some women there are fine with it.\\"**This argument is intellectually bankrupt. A handful of women expressing contentment under oppression does not justify the system. History is full of examples where marginalized individuals defended their oppression: enslaved individuals who opposed abolition, women who resisted suffrage, and workers who supported exploitative labor practices. This isnt evidence of consent; its evidence of internalized subjugation.Saudi womens \\"happiness\\" under guardianship laws mirrors the psychological coping mechanisms of the oppressed. Research, such as the Hostage Behavior Model, shows that prolonged exposure to control breeds compliance, not genuine contentment. Even if some women claim to \\"choose\\" their oppression, what of the thousands who flee Saudi Arabia every year, risking imprisonment or death? Are they merely \\"brainwashed\\" by Western ideals?Every year more than 1,000 women try to flee Saudi Arabia. Text alerts sent by the Saudi authorities enable many guardians to catch them before they actually escape. The fact that so many risk their lives to escape doesnt signal satisfaction with their society; it signals desperation. The absence of large-scale revolutions isnt proof of contentment; its proof of repression.If you equate cultural acceptance with morality, would you also defend slavery or apartheid because \\"some people were fine with it\\"?--- **\\"You think they have been brainwashed into oppression, and they feel the exact way about Western women and their 'freedoms.' In fact, I personally know many conservative Muslim women who are not happy with the 'progressive' changes happening in Saudi Arabia.\\"**Conservative discontent with progress is nothing new. Every civil rights movement, from ending segregation to legalizing same-sex marriage, faced backlash from traditionalists. Discomfort with change does not invalidate its necessity. The fact that some Saudi women oppose reforms like driving rights or independent travel reflects the strength of systemic indoctrination, not the righteousness of the status quo.Your argument that Western women are \\"slaves to corporate desires\\" is laughable when compared to the reality of Saudi women requiring male permission to marry, work, or even leave their homes. Western freedoms include the *choice* to reject corporate cultureSaudi women are denied even the basic agency to decide their futures.If conservative women fear \\"progress,\\" does their resistance stem from faith, or from a lifetime of conditioning that equates independence with immorality?--- **\\"I personally think its better to live in a society that protects women through systems like guardianship than in societies where women are exploited and objectified under the guise of freedom.\\"**This statement reeks of paternalistic arrogance. Guardianship doesnt protect womenit infantilizes them. Saudi women are among the most restricted in the world, facing one of the highest rates of domestic violence globally. With male guardians controlling their legal, financial, and social lives, victims often have no escape. Contrast this with Western societies where women can access shelters, legal recourse, and financial independence.Objectification in the West pales in comparison to Saudi Arabias state-sanctioned denial of personhood. In France, you can critique media representations of women or campaign for change. In Saudi Arabia, voicing dissent against guardianship laws can land you in prison. Protection through control is not protectionits a gilded cage.If guardianship truly safeguards women, why does it rely on surveillance, coercion, and punishment to enforce compliance?--- **\\"By living in France, I can follow my religion freely, but Saudi Arabia is a better place for true Islamic values.\\"**This is peak hypocrisy. You cherry-pick the benefits of living in Francefreedom of speech, independent travel, and access to educationwhile romanticizing a Saudi system that denies these very rights to women. If Saudi Arabia embodies \\"true Islamic values,\\" why havent you relocated there? Perhaps its because deep down, you recognize the suffocating realities of life under Sharia law for women but prefer to virtue-signal from the safety of a secular society.Why is it that you advocate for Islamic governance while enjoying the liberties of a secular state?---If Saudi Arabia is the shining beacon of justice, equity, and Islamic perfection you glorify, then why do you hypocritically choose to live in Francea secular country you claim \\"oppresses Muslims\\"? Is it because, deep down, you know that the freedoms you cling to in Francelike unrestricted travel, education, and the ability to speak without fearwould be nonexistent under the suffocating system you so eagerly defend?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"If this passes, new member of Congress Sarah McBride should go into the Men's Room at the Capital and stand near the urinal watching all the guys piss while writing comments in a notepad as she shakes her head disparagingly and giggles at their unimpressive dicks.","title":"Republican to introduce transgender bathroom ban at the US Capitol"},{"text":"You knew what else is a safety net?Money","title":"Trump allies eye overhauling Medicaid, food stamps in tax legislation"},{"text":"Stewart - Colbert 2028Or Colbert - Stewart 2028","title":"Jon Stewart Urges Dems to Fight Like Republicans and Exploit Loopholes"},{"text":"Do you have a link?

I'll quote what I said in another comment:People who complain about fascists being called fascists likely are sympathetic to authoritarianism. They also don't seem to have any issues with the years of constant bigotry and attacks coming from MAGA and republicans for decades before that - they just don't want Trump and his cult being called out.**What also goes hand in hand with that is the idea that Biden and NATO are a warmongers for helping Ukraine stand up to a fascist dictator invading and conquering their country, and literally enslaving their people.** \\n-Why is it that democrats hate this country and republicans love it?What an absolute load of shit.The election shows us that majority of Americans are fed up and tired of this woke bullshit.The majority of Americans did not vote for republicans.","title":"Trump allies attack Biden for allowing Ukraine to use US missiles inside Russia | US foreign policy"},{"text":"Speak for yourself.

As much as I support republicans and conservatives, their isolationism is going to be the death of the free world and the death of american supremacy.And you hit the nail on the head about Biden slow-walking military aid to ukraine. As it stands now under Biden, ukraine is trapped in an eternal stalemate with Russia because the aid they recieve is just barely enough to slightly maintain the status quo but never enough to make a change. I mean seriously, whats 30 or so abrams tanks and a handful of f16s going to do against russia. Thats barely enough to maintain the frontlines. And so I laugh at these aid deliveries not because they're necessarily bad, but because they're so piecemeal in quantity.Furthermore, while Trump does have a hard stance against China, which is good, he needs to recognize one major fact.The war in ukraine is a proving ground for the U.S and Nato to how far they're willing to support an ally. Because if that support dwindles, then its a greenlight for China to take Taiwan without a care in the world.Because heres the thing with Ukraine, it is perhaps in the most ideal location to send supplies and aid to. It shares a land border with several Nato allies including Poland, thus simplifying logistics. As such, the process for delivering military aid is incredibly easy to perform. Just ship the equipment to a port in Belgium or Netherlands, send it by train all the way to Germany then Poland, then send it on a train to Ukraine. Simple as that. And thats just for heavy equipment like tanks and IFVs. Smaller munitions can be delivered by plane straight to Kyiv or any other city in Ukraine. Meanwhile you have Taiwan which is several thousands and thousands of miles away from the U.S. if we wanted to send heavy support to Taiwan, we'd probably have to adopt a convoy system to ship material across the biggest ocean in the world. Air deliveries are out of the question as all of Taiwan would be under Chinese air cover. And any ships that come near the island are at risk of getting sunk by submarines or anti ship missiles. This creates an almost nightmare scenario that the U.S and its allies have to solve if they want to help Taiwan.But if we fail in supporting Ukraine, a nation with perhaps the most ideal routes to deliver aid to, then how do we even hope to support Taiwan.","title":"That's MY President.

Personally, I would lax the laws and make it easier to entry, as documented migrants are easier to trace in case they break any law. Some other people already explained better than me, why judging people by misdemeanours and barring them entry to US is unjust, seeing how US has already broken prison system. I would make sure to regulate companies from using people as cheap labour as they're the ones fuelling the problem and gain the most by hiring illegals, these same people wouldn't mind having slaves. If you can't hire people properly, without using cheap labor and immigrants, you shouldnt be having a business in the first place, as clearly you don't mind slavery as well if it were legal. I would rather focus on fixing the system itself, instead of demonising whole groups of people, as most migrants don't commit crimes and many have/had valid reasons to flee. US is so vast, rich and the unemployment is so low, clearly not the migrants are the issue itself, but rich people want you to believe that instead. I would take examples from countries, where recidivism is low like Denmark and rather fix those prison system and migration, than force people onto inhumane conditions. Rich folks laugh at us seeing how we fight for scraps blaming each other. All countries should have the need to thrive for better environment, further growth and comfortable life for its people, unfortunately we can only dream.Seeing how many immigrants there are in the US there's no way to deport them all at once, without gassing them and making it costly. Then again, I have empathy.You can blame all the countries' problems onto poor, elderly, migrants, women, disabled, like it always has been, see Margaret Thatcher or read some books about the Civil War and how people were being told rumours about black people - and maybe realise we make the same mistakes all over again with the issues being the same, as we put trust and power onto the same rich folks, who profit from populism as it gets them elected.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I have no idea what \\"constitutional crisis\\" is supposed to mean.

Personal property is yours - you own it, you use it, you maintain it and more importantly you are responsible for it and how it affects others. Private property is a construct made so you can own something while being able to forgo usage, maintenance and responsibility.I believe its an archaic construct and idea that stems from a time where the line was more definite and split across class lines, an era of aristocrats and peasants in essence, and it does not apply in our modern times where class mobility is more feasible than ever.On the contrary. It was more fuzzy before, but nowadays it is much more clear by introduction of LLCs and other virtual entities that serve only to disconnect ownership from responsibility. This makes it really clear now - all that is directly owned by you under your name giving you responsibilities alongside ownership is personal property, held by you in person. All that you disconnect via creating artificial persona whose ownership you hold is private property.Looking at it like that should clear the problems that you see in your post. Why we assume that people initially had access to property or were inherently entitled to it? Because we had formed countries who oversee a territory and guarantee the ownership of property while also enforcing rules of responsibility. So it's still ok for Joe Schmoe to own a $1mil company - as long as it is his personal property that he is responsible for, not a 100% stake in some LLC that would take the responsibility for him.Even most leftists would concede that a house is personal property, yet apparently its metaphysical nature changes should you rent it.This is caused by the fact that there are goods that are needed for every single person to fulfill the basic needs. This alone means that this kind of property is not the same as other kinds of property that you can do without, so it will change how their nature works.In a perfect scenario fact that Pierre L'andlord owns 15 homes and rents 14 would make no difference - but we don't live in that reality. We live in reality where people are at risk of being homeless because they barely can afford to buy or rent. This means that action is needed to resolve this issue (and I would agree that some parts of the left do have proposals that are not fueled by rational attempt to resolve the problem, but rather by pursue of vindictive \\"justice\\").I personally see no difference in legitimacy in the use of a tool, regardless of whether the owner uses it personally or pays someone to use itLet's use reductio ad absurdum to check if that is really the case. Would you say that f.ex. a person buying large amounts of masks, toilet paper and hand sanitizer and selling them only for those who are able to afford 1000% markup during last pandemic would be as legitimate as people who stock up on them in quantity that covers their personal use for next year or those who were buying large amounts and selling for modest 10% markup?","title":"CMV: There is nothing wrong with private property"},{"text":"Did you even read what I wrote?
