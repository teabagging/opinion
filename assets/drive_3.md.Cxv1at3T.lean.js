When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white man, what she did was both illegal and disruptive. The law dictated that she had to move, and her refusal meant that the driver could not continue the route. All the people on that bus ended up being late to wherever they were going until the police showed up and took her away. Her protest sparked the Montgomery bus boycott, which damaged the finances of the bus company so much that they pressured the city into repealing the law and ending segregation in the bus system. Sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, the march on Selma, the Freedom Riders, and countless other episodes in the civil rights movement were illegal protests that were highly disruptive to businesses, bystanders, and the governments who expended substantial resources to suppress them. Would you consider these protests an unfair circumvention of democracy? Or are they demands that the promise of democracy be fulfilled in circumstances where government has failed to uphold that promise? Your argument presumes that electoral politics are the only valid politics, and there is a one-to-one relationship between electoral outcomes and democratic will. History shows us that this is clearly not true. Democracy can be subverted, and the electoral system can be corrupted. In those circumstances, direct action is both justified and necessary to restore it. Protest is not a debate. It is not an airing of grievances in the marketplace of ideas. Protest is a demand, for when debate has failed. A demand with no potential consequences is pointless. Likewise, a protest that is not disruptive is just performance art. Disruption is a *necessary* component of protest. Supporting a right to protest without supporting disruptive protest is like being pro-firefighter but anti-water. It just doesn't work.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"Lets make these last 27 days countevery vote matters!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 9, 2024 - 27 days until election day!"},{"text":"were required to wear business professional in the office bc the CEO who is in his 80s thinks casual looks unprofessional.

In countries like England, where citizens elect their local representatives this may work for minorities that are geographically localised, but not for minorities that are spread all around the country, like the LGBTQ+ community. It really depends on the specifics. Also \\"drawing attention to your cause\\" is a tactic, not a goal.

I believe that they absolutely deserve it, even if their cause is good.Protesters themselves accept this, though. Look at all the times Greta Thunberg has gotten arrested and charged with various crimes related to this. She doesn't stop, she sees it as a cost she pays for protesting her cause. Of course and there is nothing wrong with such protest. It is completely legal, the city can prepare for it and it happens all the time. It is a way to make yourself visible, not to threaten someone that things will get worse.But it *does* inconvenient people. You can't really hold a protest without it. Inconvenience doesn't have to be massive, but it's a pretty inherent part. Otherwise it's just a random meeting of people, not a protest. I find this rather problematic. Of course they are right, but why can't they try to go through normal democratic process? They are a big minority and can absolutely make themselves visible and gain legal representation. I don't think blockading buildings can be justified.Democratic processes sometimes lag. They respond to public pressure, and the group that is afflicted is usually the only one making noise. If there are no protests, sometimes nothing will get done at all because politicians will read silence as \\"nobody cares\\". And democratic processes aren't always good either. Sometimes there's corruption, or those in power are opposed to certain ideas. Look at the early workers' rights movements, for instance. Unions and such. Strikes today are a *massive* inconvenience both to individuals in society, and also to employers. They cost loads of money, and depending on the sector that's striking, it can cause anything from trash to pile up in the streets to people not getting their mail delivered. The threat of that is the only thing that works, because strikes happen after negotiations have broken down. Inconvenience is the whole point.And strikes today are still pretty lame. In the past they'd be violent. Strike-breakers were attacked or even killed, companies where bombed, people died. All that was sadly necessary though, because people were *suffering* under horrible working conditions and too little was being done. Push people too far and they will push back. And strikes are a form of protest. So yeah, some inconvenience is needed when progress stagnates too much, especially when the stagnation causes suffering.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"Iirc they're the most effective at 80% success rate, but A) I think 1/5 nukes getting through is still huge, assuming there are enough THAAD's to stop a full scale attack, which there aren't, not even close.

You see this all the time.But you also see people being upset about protestors getting completely normal sentences for vandalism or disruption of order. I believe that they absolutely deserve it, even if their cause is good. There's a good middle ground, though. A protest can't really be very visible without also causing some inconvenience. But of course there's a balance of disruption. A well-organised protest will do things like march down streets, which will disrupt traffic and public transport for a while, but it'll be done in such a way that it doesn't actually pose danger, e.g. it won't block emergency vehicles. It gets attention by being up in people's faces, but it won't cause harm.Of course and there is nothing wrong with such protest. It is completely legal, the city can prepare for it and it happens all the time. It is a way to make yourself visible, not to threaten someone that things will get worse.Sometimes people who protest feel that things have gone so far that they need more extreme measures, and that's when people do things like blockade buildings and such. That can be reasonable in some cases, especially when dealing with injustices, and sometimes this actually has an effect. E.g. back in the day in Sweden, when homosexuality was considered a disease, there were protests at a government agency where people basically occupied the building. I find this rather problematic. Of course they are right, but why can't they try to go through normal democratic process? They are a big minority and can absolutely make themselves visible and gain legal representation. I don't think blockading buildings can be justified.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"I'm not asking how they interpret it in the US. that's a terrible principle and it's not even used consistently, you can't ask for a permit to blockade someone's house.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"This is a really terrible take and definitely not pro-democracy.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"I wouldn't worry about Nukes - I would worry about getting bombed by a camera that can withstand a Nuclear blast.

They won't be accessible to most people regardless of price gauging or not - heck, price gauging is possibly the only way to make flights more accessible. A crisis immediately increases the cost of managing the flights - why would a pilot want to risk their lives flying into a dangerous area without a sufficient compensation? Price increase during crisis is an important incentive to get more flights (or anything) to a region experiencing the crisis. If the price is high enough airlines would reroute many of their usual flights to the region - reducPrice increase also deters people that might have other choices - if a flight is too expensive for me and I have a car I might make the decision to drive out - if it's inexpensive and worse case I won't be able to get a ticket that's fine, but I would still try getting a cheap ticket because it's a better alternative. Meaning I am taking a seat away from someone who needs it more. Your only other alternatives is to literally force people and companies to actually fly those planes and  find a better way to filter those that truly have no other choice than flying from the region.Or, if you really want you can ask your government to subsidize these flights - but you would still have the problem of people taking up space from those who might need it more, so I would focus on subsidizing for the poor rather than for everyone.","title":"CMV: The drastic increase in airline ticket prices out of Florida is not because of corporate greed"},{"text":"how do you blackmail someone by using a bribe?","title":"EVIDENCE OF CORRUPTION_ Obama, CIA, FBI blackmailing Hillary Clinton with $18 million dollars"},{"text":"Compromise?

Raising awareness about an issue is an important part of protests but there are other aspects as well. For example doing the protests in a relatively peaceful way like just going and standing but if it is in an important area then it can cause problems. Like suppose a company is destroying a building of significant value and I want to protest against it, I could start a protest around the building so it would prevent construction crew to enter or go in the building and refuse to leave so if they demolish the building they will be killing all the protesters. I am not saying protestors should go and sabotage and harm individuals but blocking traffic, preventing entry into areas is an important way to protest especially against a deadline.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"Because it's a business practice that screws over customers while maximizing profits?

If you have a ticket you should get a seat, period. With a waiting list the airline could still ensure that almost no empty seats are on an airplane. That way customers can make informed decisions. They can purchase a ticket on a waiting list, know which number they are, and then make the decision if that risk is worth it or if they rather look for a guranteed seat.These waiting list tickets probably have to be sold at a discount and come with reasonable refund options if the ticket isn't available. The airline would still make extra money, since the seats that got available are still paid for, so they still get the full price + waiting list price for that seat.  \\nBut that generates less profit than tricking people into thinking they have a guranteed seat and just dealing with the consequences when they happen.

You see this all the time. There's a good middle ground, though. A protest can't really be very visible without also causing some inconvenience. But of course there's a balance of disruption. A well-organised protest will do things like march down streets, which will disrupt traffic and public transport for a while, but it'll be done in such a way that it doesn't actually pose danger, e.g. it won't block emergency vehicles. It gets attention by being up in people's faces, but it won't cause harm. Sometimes people who protest feel that things have gone so far that they need more extreme measures, and that's when people do things like blockade buildings and such. That can be reasonable in some cases, especially when dealing with injustices, and sometimes this actually has an effect. E.g. back in the day in Sweden, when homosexuality was considered a disease, there were protests at a government agency where people basically occupied the building. This was one of the reasons that rushed on changing the classification so it was no longer considered a disease. Another part of it was that people called in to work as sick, saying they were feeling homosexual and couldn't work. Also a pretty big inconvenience for the employers. These things work. Progress needs inconvenience, but of course it should usually be done in a way that doesn't threaten the lives of innocents.","title":"CMV: Protests in a democratic country should not disrupt, but try to win over the population or they are in principle undemocratic and fair to punish if against the law"},{"text":"At the end of the day, all that matters to huge companies is their net income.

Anyway it is complicated but it isn't the same as the game concept.If you want an idea of how amorphous it is this is the definition  2. (noun) prestige, authority, control, power, influence, status, spiritual power, charisma - mana is a supernatural force in a person, place or object. Mana goes hand in hand with tapu, one affecting the other. The more prestigious the event, person or object, the more it is surrounded by tapu and mana. Mana is the enduring, indestructible power of the atua and is inherited at birth, the more senior the descent, the greater the mana. The authority of mana and tapu is inherited and delegated through the senior line from the atua as their human agent to act on revealed will. Since authority is a spiritual gift delegated by the atua, man remains the agent, never the source of mana. This divine choice is confirmed by the elders, initiated by the tohunga under traditional consecratory rites (tohi). Mana gives a person the authority to lead, organise and regulate communal expeditions and activities, to make decisions regarding social and political matters. A person or tribe's mana can increase from successful ventures or decrease through the lack of success. The tribe give mana to their chief and empower him/her and in turn the mana of an ariki or rangatira spreads to his/her people and their land, water and resources. Almost every activity has a link with the maintenance and enhancement of mana and tapu. Animate and inanimate objects can also have mana as they also derive from the atua and because of their own association with people imbued with mana or because they are used in significant events. There is also an element of stewardship, or kaitiakitanga, associated with the term when it is used in relation to resources, including land and water.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thats right.

More one man than all others, but most of you wouldnt like the answer. \\nBut the real issue with lack of aid and slow responses is for the same reason.  Were talking about huge areas of land and hundreds of thousands of people.  And regardless of whos in power, we still dont have the right processes, procedures and people in place to respond to disasters of this magnitude.  Not even close.

You can also usually find polling hours there, as well as any opportunities for early, mail-in or drop-off voting they might have, which might mitigate some of your privacy concerns. - Finally, yes, YOUR VOTE IS ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE!

It is possible that you could accomplish something by voting for Harris. So you are choosing guaranteed failure versus the possibility of success.  I'm not going to debate whether or not the IDF committed human rights violations and whether or not the war can be properly characterized as a genocide etc etc. I'm not trying to tell you not to have emotions or to feel outrage I looked at the pictures and I'll share an honest truth with you.  Whether or not do you believe it I will leave up to you.  There have been times where I have been equally outraged and horrified by the images.  In particular in the early days I remember seeing a video of a desperate parent carrying the corpse of their child and it was beyond tragic. I am not some unfeeling robotic liberal caricature.  You act like I cannot see any reason why Arab and or Muslim people may be outraged by what they perceive to be a genocide and the complicity of the Biden-Harris administration in it. But you're wrong. I can understand it intellectually and can empathize with it. But you're wrong l think its idiotic because you are not going to gain anything whereas you stand to maybe get something and also if you let Trump in maybe terrible things will happen. Imagine it like a lottery ticket. Letting Trump win is like not buying a lottery ticket.  You know you're not going to get what you want. Letting Harris win is like buying a lottery ticket. You can be pretty sure that you're not going to... BUT there is at least a non-zero chance that you do win. At least you have a chance. But then there's an extra dimension to the lottery ticket metaphor.  Because not only does letting Trump win guarantee that you're not going to get what you want.  But it could also result in things getting worse. Much worse. And not just for you but for all of us. We also get to have concerns and be outraged.  We get to be outraged at you for treating the threat of Trump as though it's trivial just because you are outraged about Gaza. We get to pull out our hair and want to rage at you for refusing to expand the number of issues that make you decide who to vote for beyond just this one.Of course there are things the Harris campaign should have been doing that they did not do.

Trump does not make the effort to listen to the things your movement has to say. Notice that difference. Consider the possibility that candidates run their campaigns in ways that are indicative of the way they would run the office.

Also, there are more variables that need to be input into the equation than whether or not you consider Israel's war against Hamas to be a genocide or not.  Even if you're an Arab or a Muslim person. Trump is at odds with the rule of law and the proper functioning of our government.  He will rule in lawless and dysfunctional ways that we will regret.

Now, it isn't fair to compare polling with the final results of a previous election, but it is interesting. Though, when exclusively Black voters in battleground states were polled by Fox (a very good pollster) Trump's ceiling is at about 12%. So there is a very real possibility that Harris's support among black voters is being understated because of the small subsections of the polls.Edit: It is also interesting to note that Trump is running ahead of the other GOP candidates.

They call themselves \\"neoreactionaries\\" and include pieces of human garbage like JD Vance whom was given 15 million by Peter Thiel during his Senate run.There is no evil a man like him wouldn't sink to.

What's Israel gonna actually do if they don't? Even the most Israel Hating, Hamas loving civilians are still civilians. Even most ardent Zionists have a number of civilians they'll start to hesitate with. What's the most amount of people can actually kill? 500,000, maybe? That's on the extreme end, but that still wouldn't be anywhere enough. Gaza would still have 1.5 million people, and Palestinians breed like rabbits. Fact of the matter is, Hamas, or whatever other terrorist insurgent groups sprout up, can keep attacking Israel every few years, knowing that Israel can't exterminate everyone, then rake in the new recruits. Palestinians have all the time in the world to wait until Israel's star begins to stop shining, and they won't have to wait that long. Moving to the US, it might shock you to hear that Gen Z isn't very pro-israel, and I'm not just talking about the left. Gen Z is actually more conservative than you would think, but that's not very beneficial to Israel. Look at some of the most popular right wing figures for Gen Z like Andrew Tate, Adin Ross, SNEAKO, and Candace Owens. They're all pretty anti-Israel, and its not really impacting any of their conservative credits. In 20 to 30 years, when Gen Z becomes the main electorate, they might have a much less favorable view of Israel. Although, it might be far less time than  I thought even a couple months ago. Anecdotally speaking, I occasionally hang around more conservative spaces, both online and IRL, and I'm starting to see a slow shift against Israel. It's not massive, but it's also not insignificant, and it's from even older conservatives, not just gen Z. I have a coworker (39M) at my job who's both pro-palestine, and pro-Trump. Remember, the more maga Republicans turned against Ukraine, only a mere couple days to a week or two after the invasion. Populist conservativism in general is starting to become pretty anti foreign policy. Whenever Ukraine ends, the right wing eye might start pointing at Israel, regardless of what Ben Shapiro or Dennis Prager have to say about it. Right now, Trump is mostly keeping these guys relatively at bay, but whenever he kicks the bucket, I'm not sure that'll last. Although, even Trump, while generally being extremely pro-israel, has occasionally said some very odd shit about the war. Nothing too extreme, but with Trump, you never really know, do you? There was also a \\"Genocide Joe\\" chant at one of Trumps Rallys a couple of months ago. Trump even appeared on Adin Ross's live stream. Now, obviously, none of this is too significant for now, but you never know. You've mentioned that America generally has a center-right electorate, so I think you'll agree that while a left wing backlash against Israel isn't currently too impactful, a possible right wing shift is a little bit more interesting. I'm aware that a true right-wing shift against sounds ridiculous, but policy can sometimes change like you fall asleep, slowly, then all at once. The possible reality is that Israel should really try to find some kind of solution to Palestine soon because if they don't, their options might get a lot worse without the worlds largest superpower backing them up. As I said, Palestine has all the time in the world, but I'm not sure Israel does.","title":"Antisemitism Drives Democratic Jewish Voters Towards Republicans: Poll"},{"text":"Now, what I heard was that Jim, over in targeting?

For one thing, we know now that some (maybe many?) pollsters are giving Trump an automatic +2 or 3% advantage in many of their poll models so they can avoid a repeat of 2016 and 2020 where they didn't account enough for the \\"silent\\" Trump voters.But there are a few things I find difficult to wrap my head around about all these close polls.One possibility is it figures that a large chunk of people who voted against Trump in 2020 will suddenly vote for him in 2024. I've not really seen much evidence of people who didn't vote for Trump in 2020 now deciding they want to give him a chance again. The vast majority of Trump supporters voted for him both in '16 and '20. So if we assume this isn't a factor, that leaves Trump finding a different group of people he's winning over that's helping him make up ground with Harris. There's been talk of latinos and blacks but there's no hard evidence they're making a break for him  all of a sudden despite some claims out there.That leaves the \\"young Gen Z white men voting for the first time\\" theory. This, granted, COULD be true, but I find it hard to believe there are suddenly enough newly minted right wing Gen Z white men in the last 4 years could really be that much of a difference maker in the polls.I've always felt that, when you look at all things objectively, the most realistic scenario is Harris winning by close to the same margin of victory as Biden did. I just don't think the political landscape has changed all that much in the last 4 years despite all the noise, but many Conservatives have now started openly and publicly supporting Harris which has NEVER happened before so that indicates she's been eating into the right.

In 2026, when Peru has presidential elections, theres going to be a strongman candidate. Someone who correctly says that all the institutions are corrupt and that constitutional &amp; democratic methods to solve these problems are not viable. He will probably be correct unfortunately. Hes going to get elected and immediately move to dismantle all democratic institutions and checks and balances, and justify that as a necessary step to fighting corruption (unfortunately he will be correct). Hell probably seek to dissolve Congress and if hes popular, his allies will win Parliamentary elections. Then hell set forward on taking over the judiciary. [He will do what Bukele did &amp; just remove judges through legally dubious processes](https://www.conectas.org/en/noticias/el-salvador-legislative-assembly-removes-supreme-court-judges/). So while he probably will crack down on corruption, hell also stamp out democracy. This is what the Peruvian Congress will cause to occur. And if the choice is between the status quo of corruption, poverty &amp; violence or authoritarianism by a strongman who vows to clean it up (may or may not not be lying) then I dont blame people for voting in the strongman &amp; being okay with everything he does.","title":"Peru: Congress Ramps Up Assault on Democratic System"},{"text":"There is instability in Israel because Hamas massacred 1200 Israelites in October 2023.  Israel was going to respond to that regardless. Biden should have used leverage to change Israel's tactics but there's no reason we collectively should have expected Israel to withdraw and accept that an organization that just committed a massacre gets to continue to control the Gaza Strip.  Hezbollah is an iran-funded paramilitary organization that has been launching rockets into northern Israel since October 2023.  Again Biden could have used leverage to discourage Israel from moving into Lebanon but it's unreasonable to expect that they wouldn't seek to destroy an organization that has been launching rockets into their territory. So this idea that Biden is to blame for Israel responding to Hamas and Hezbollah is wrong.Russia invaded Ukraine when he did for reasons that we don't know. It's possible, since we're speculating, that he chose to do it when he did partly because he wanted to create chaos during Biden's term in the hopes of getting Trump back into the White House.  He probably really expected that it would be a special military operation and Kyiv would fall in a week. But acting like the invasion of Ukraine is Biden's fault is wrong. I'm guessing that you were talking about Israel and Ukraine, but maybe you were also talking about Sudan. If so I'd note that the conflict in Sudan is the result of two generals seeking power.  It is not Biden's fault so if you're trying to blame that on him as well it is wrong. I would also note that the situation in Haiti is not Biden's fault.  Nor is the gang activity in Ecuador. Europe is not at war.  There is no war in the Pacific. There is no war in South America.  There is no war in Mexico or Canada. There is no war in the majority of Africa. There is no war in Afghanistan. Now you saw the word Afghanistan so you'll want to criticize Biden for the way the withdrawal went down. There's some valid criticism there but I would counter it with the fact that the situation that led to it was the creation of the Trump administration meeting with the Taliban at camp David and agreeing to stop using American air power to support the Afghanistan security forces such that the Taliban was able to stage an invasion across the country and eventually take Kabul.  The idea that there might be some chaos when you are trying to evacuate tens of thousands of people at the same time that a militant organization is raiding across the country is par for the course I'd say.  Also nobody is giving credit to the servicemen who pulled off an evacuation under those conditions. Also the end result of the withdrawal is that we are no longer in Afghanistan.  So what we have in totality then is the conflict centered on Israel which Biden did not cause. The conflict in the Ukraine which Biden did not cause. A feud between two generals in Sudan that Biden did not cause. And the breakdown of order in Haiti which Biden did not cause. That is not global chaos and none of it is Biden's fault. You may or may not be a Trump supporter. Maybe you're not a Trump supporter but you foolishly think that capitulating to Putin would result in peace rather than emboldening him to move on the Baltic states.  The people and the leadership of the Baltic States are not so ignorant and you can see that through their actions.  You may think that Trump will end Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon but if so then how the fuck?  You may imagine some speculative scenario where Trump won in 2020 or succeeded in overturning the results and Russia chose not to invade Ukraine and Hamas chose not to commit a massacre.  But that is a speculative scenario.","title":"Harris faces new urgency to explain how her potential presidency would be different from Biden's"},{"text":"She makes 230k.

What the majority want changes who is in power.And as you alluded to, Israel has been open to negotiating and giving up stuff with just about every group in the middle east.

I actually think the article is sort of correct, but trying to hide the real reason it's happening and blame it on racism or something. Reality is all issues polling points to the fact that this is a \\"change\\" election. Harris was popular of the hop because she was unknown, and represented change. That should have been snowballed into a big lead, but the clinton/obama advisors insisted on dropping the \\"calling them weird\\" thing and urged them to act more like the Republicans.The Cheney/right swing has been a colossal flop so far. She needs to challenge the status quo. Doesn't matter if it's radical, she can't let Trump become the change candidate and settle into status quo. Which is why the campaign needs to go left. Make some controversy. Just get some attention because attention spans are fading. This moved from likely Harris to a toss up because they pumped the brakes way too hard instead of leaning into the momentum. The \\"return to normalcy\\" works when Trump is the incumbent. Biden is unpopular. Stop trying to run a neoliberal boring campaign and emulate the historically unpopular candidate. They are their own worst enemy. Luckily, Trump is totally dogshit, so they control their own destiny. But if they insist on the \\"I'm with her\\" \\"If you vote she will win\\" type energy, it's gonna be a lot more nailbiting than it needs to be. \\nForget the DNC happened and fire any campaign advisers since then. Stop sticking Walz into corporate suits and acting like a politician. Let him be a regular dude again. \\nI think the campaign miscalculated. When people said they wanted \\"normal\\", they meant they wanted people who didn't feel like the same bush/clinton/biden dynasties. They want normal feeling people. That doesn't mean biden, or Dick Cheney, that means Kamela and Tim. They will call you a communist, but then it's on them to prove \\"feeding children in schools\\" is a bad thing. And that looks weird. They just to find a way back into the news cycle that's less boring. If people wanted boring, Biden would have won a landslide. \\nThey want change. Change to a new normal. Not the noeliberal gig and subscription based economy. All polling indicates radical progressive issues like sweeping healthcare and immigration reform are overwhelmingly popular. Play to your strengths, not weaknesses. This has nothing to do with race or gender. Obama was overwhelmingly popular because he represented change. People didn't care he was black, he felt different. Kamela needs to feel different. And lately she sounds like a random neoliberal Romney/Clinton face. Stand out. Be bold. She will win.","title":"Democrats start to hit the panic button"},{"text":"Daaaamn this is very interesting.

Theyre failing to capture it in the exact same way that they failed to capture the Biden/Trump enthusiasm gap in 2020.In  the lead up to the 2020 election,  Biden voters were 7% less likely to say they were very or extremely excited to vote than Trump voters. In the 2020 Election, Biden under-performed polling slightly to moderately across the board.This year, its reversed.  Harris voters are 7% more likely to say theyre excited than Trump voters.The logical inference from that information is that we could reasonably expect Harris to over-perform polling across the board slightly to moderately.This also makes it more likely than it otherwise would have been that the adjustments pollsters made in response to 2020 results will end up being in the wrong direction.  They set all of their methodology based on a Biden/Trump rematch, and it doesnt look like most of them have made any significant adjustments since Harris joined the race.And then you have to consider the rest of the content of this article.  I really do think that theres a hidden woman vote from the partners of Republican voting men.

The Club of Rome funded a study using a world simulation created at MIT. The simulation said that do to limited resources, society would collapse by 2040. No matter how many times they re-ran the simulation, or altered variables, they were unable to push that estimate back any further than a decade or so. The simulation was fed every bit of data they could input. Shocked by the result, they started by trying to come up with peaceful solutions, none worked. They tried variables that included war, disease, natural disaster, but they could not push that by more than a decade or so. They never ended the simulation, they continued to update the software, updated after every census, after every world event. When computers and algorithmic technology improved, their simulation became more precise. With the rise of smart phones and social media, they had access to more data. This is one of the reasons why data is so important, they can get the most minute details about every single person, and use it for predictive analytics.It does not matter if you believe the findings of the simulation, because the wealthy do believe. NYT thoroughly bashed it after it was published and people continue to call it misleading. But the fact is none of those reviews took into account the algorithmic learning we have now, and the advancement of predictive analytics. This study is the reason why so many billionaires have built underground bunkers. This study is the reason why corporations have dramatically increased how much chemicals they put into our Earth, air, water, and food.

Anything before WW1 would not be considered the modern world. WW1 and WW2 \\"birthed\\" the modern world in the sense that all political ideologies and society frameworks follow what survived those decades. Every country on the global stage to stay alive will always fight for first and foremost the largest and most modern military possible, countries that didn't strive to do so ceased to exist entirely (the Ottoman empire, almost France, etc.) WW2 onward showed that in times of peace you need the best economy in the world to continue to exist, or you will be subject to other countries with greater control of finances. (Think the vessel states of the cold war.) So now the West needs the greatest economy and military to stay number one, the only way to do so is to print unlimited money while forcing other nations to use your currency as a baseline so that its value is cemented despite not having a gold standard backing. Europe and the UN are willing to go along bc they benefit from the military protection of the west and of an unlimited money economy. If we cease the unsustainable practices we will lose out to competitors like China who will do the same infinite money glitch. That's why no political party is willing to change anything serious, both in the US want to back Israel (greater military spending and resources) and print more money. It's a cheerleader pyramid that's shaking and the nations don't care when it falls as much as how high up on the pyramid they will be when everyone falls. We could maybe fix the issue by assigning financial risk factors to countries through the UN and adjusting tariffs/trade deals etc through that scale, but the politicians who push this broke system get to live good until it crashes so there is little chance of that happening. No financial experts were warned or pushed for serious change before the 2008 crash.

I do!!!  The simplest solution is to make Rey struggle with Kylo in the same way - make her feel the same fear of Kylo that Luke felt.  This would allow the visions origins to be explained - as either a natural reaction to seeing Kylos inner darkness or a vision sent by Snoke to intentionally provoke Luke. These explanations currently dont work because otherwise Rey would have felt it. It would also give the two a common shared feeling to bond over: Rey could, at first, be naive and critical of Luke:  how could he give up on Kylo??  But then she too feels the fear he had, understands his perspective, and then they work together to defeat Kylo.  Or have Rey succumb to her emotions while fighting Kylo. Anger, fear, hatred.  Maybe she encounters kylo at a weak point and has a moment of failure just like Luke,  instinctively ready to kill him before Luke intervenes, remembering his own mistakes and using the lessons his previous encounters from Kylo and Vader to stop her and either defeat Kylo or turn him back. Personally, Id do it at the final salt planet scene, with Kylo Ren going in, personally tearing down the door using the force (after Finn and the rebels successfully destroy the cannon),  and easily massacring the rebel defenders in a manner similar to Vaders final scene in Rogue one.  Rey, watching Kylo through old security cameras with luke in a control room, finally feels the same sheer terror as she watches Kylo massacre a young child rebel (possibly a kid they picked up in Cando byte).  Zooming in close, we see that Kylos eyes have turned yellow. Likewise, I think just simply making Kylo Ren as evil as Lukes vision portrays would be a good start and make this a lot more palatable. Use the scene above, or truly show him as a true threat to the galaxy - one equal to if not surpassing Palpatine himself.  Show him destroying planets with glee or using the force to oppress people in new, terrifying ways.  Make him gladly murder his parents and boast about how easy it was. Show Lukes perspective (or show it better), and make the audience understand it.  Show that Luke had a point, that if Rey had been in his position she would likely have done the same.  Show that his conflict was nothing but a ruse.   Show that turning Kylo back to the light side as a near impossible task, one so incomprehensible that even the man who saw the light in Vader would lose confidence that he could be turned - and justifiably so.  Also make it so that Rey cant turn him back alone, either - only the two of them, working together, have a tiny chance of success.  Another simple way is, if you coordinated with Rian Johnson on episode 9, is to have Kylo Ren obsessed with and instrumental in the return of emperor Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker. I think Kylo Ren being directly responsible for Palpatines return could actually be one of the few reasons that could believably justify Luke instinctively lashing out. After all, his original arc was defeating Palpatine, and if he was brought back that would not only fit irredeemable suffering but it would be the return of what he and his father had worked so hard to defeat.  If Palpatine returns, Lukes sacrifice and work would be for nothing - so it could be believable that Luke would truly do anything to prevent that from happening - even if it means killing his own pupil.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"The president was shitting in the bathroom when the dog barked and scared the kid at the door on Halloween with the candy who dropped it so that the illegal immigrant child who happened to wander by could find it later.Main Stream News Headline:President sits down and barks out orders to ensure food could be delivered for starving immigrant children","title":"What has Biden done well?"},{"text":"Some in the big media missed the part where Joe Biden was forced to retire for age, not for policies, even though the hammered Biden's age for weeks.","title":"Harris faces new urgency to explain how her potential presidency would be different from Biden's"},{"text":"Thats it.

Yet the amount of stuff I see from far leftists and others who are so angry that she's trying to appeal to not just Democrats is insane.

Her words carry more weight now. She can literally enact an anti-racist agenda if she gets enough support and she recognizes that her calling people racist now will have greater repercussions than when she did it on 60 minutes as the VP.I do agree its frustrating to see a person contort themselves to carry what is essentially a near impossible tent to win an election to preserve the fucking republic. On one hand it feels like she shouldnt need to do this. Trump shouldnt even be on the opposing ticket.But I see what shes doing differently - she is doing this to win the election because the consequences of losing are great and she said about as much on her Howard Stern interview. Losing medical insurance, drug caps, Ukraine, and deporting millions of legal immigrants who are propping up smaller economies through the country would make both America and the world a worse place.Making peace with the Cheneys at this juncture isnt selling out.

There are Arab Israelis and there are Palestinians. Two very different groups of people. You and I and others conflate the two and this is a root cause of the misinformation.Arab Israelis are Israeli citizens who live inside of Israel (not West Bank / not Gaza). Palestinians are Arabs who do not have a country and live in Gaza and West Bank and who are usually the one's who harbor / are terrorists. Israel does not run West Bank or Gaza and left those regions many years ago.Much as other countries need to protect themselves from immigrants that might be moving drugs, committing crimes or bringing in illicit items or worse, Israel is merely protecting its own borders, by imposing road block checks, walls, etc. against Palestinians who do not live in Israel (not against Arab Israeli citizens who do live in Israel) who want to take part in the booming economy there. This is what all countries do. Israeli Arabs, on the other hand, since they are Israeli citizens do not undergo road blocks, walls, etc. because they are already living in Israel and are Israeli citizens.Add to this the fact that there has been a history of suicide bombings by Palestinians in consecutive weeks in the past (prior to the walls and increased security checkpoints being erected - otherwise how could they have bombed inside Israel?  -obv. there were no walls then) and you can understand why there is an appearance of double treatment between Palestinians and Israelis - because there definitely is - you are right. But Palestinians are not Israelis. Should the USA be responsible for the treatment of Mexican citizens? Or for policing / treatment in Native American areas? Obviously the USA should not.And I understand about the moral obligation. Since a people need help, Israel should help them. But let me ask you this: Are Palestinian regions (West Bank / Gaza) any more rundown than Egypt or Lebanon or Libya or Jordan? They are more or less the same (I have been to them all). Is it just that Palestinian regions are being juxtaposed with Israel, which has had more patents per year published than any other country and is very successful?

That's how revolutions happen, not how 'Marxist theorists' imagine they do with some 'vanguard of the revolution' teaching the 'proletariat' to overthrow their masters.  Even the French revolution had outside help.  In the modern world, with the state of international commerce, it is impossible to overthrow a government without external backers who will finance the revolution and maintain the country's ability to trade.If Khomenei had help from the usual suspects, UK/USA, it will have been because he promised them continued ownership of Iran's OIL.  Once he consolidated power, he immediately broke that promise and nationalized the OIL.  So he became public enemy #1, and they've been trying to assassinate or coup Iran's leaders ever since.  Should they ever succeed, they will immediately seize Iran's OIL (like they did in neighboring Iraq) and install another obedient puppet who will collaborate with the CIA in running the death and torture squads that give those fucks their orgasms.And Iran's continued resistance to this agenda is why USA, UK and all the others bandy about the 'terrorist' label and say they're a threat to regional peace, are building nukular boms, and all the other bullshit propaganda they make up about Iran.  The truth is that the fundamentalist mullahs that run the country would have had to liberalize their rule decades ago were it not for the continued attacks on their country from UK/USA/Israel.  Every time Iran is bombed, sanctioned, prominent people assassinated, etc etc etc, it just drives the population into the arms of the mullahs.  To protect themselves from the death and torture squads that happen when UK/USA manage to take control of their country.And everything Iran is doing, from the religious fundamentalism at home to the support of resistance movements abroad, is purely defensive.

Well, the explanation is garbage and falls apart at the slightest thought.   experiences strong visions from the force  \\n1.  Why did he experience these visions about Kylo from the force, especially if theyre so catastrophically wrong?  2.  Why didnt Rey experience these visions whenever she interacted with Kylo? 3.  If Rey can see the light and conflict within Kylo, then why couldnt Luke?  4.  If Luke, who saw the light in the 2nd greatest terror in the galaxy, saw such pure darkness in Kylo that he felt the urge to kill him, then wouldnt this be the RIGHT decision?  One could argue that the world would have been spared much suffering if he finished the job that night.  Why is this a mistake?  5. Lukes vision is not what we see in Kylo at all: \\n[going to the official scene itself](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LqPEPPytDzI&amp;pp=ygUYTGFzdCBqZWRpIGx1a2UgZmxhc2hiYWNr), its worth noting that what we see is actually NOT a vision - but Luke is directly looking into Kylo RENs mind  - and saw it completely corrupted with darkness. To quote the movie directly:    I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined  Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction and pain and death of everything I ever loved  \\nLukes glimpse into Kylos mind showed kylo filled with a darkness that would cause immeasurable suffering across the entire galaxy, an irredeemable evil like never before.  Yet, Kylo as we see him in the last Jedi is not only incredibly conflicted, but it feels like hes being dragged to the dark side against his will.  He has zero motivations toward the dark side EXCEPT that one incident with Luke.  Surely, if Lukes vision made any sense, Kylo would have some darkness somewhere outside of his beef with Luke?  Some other evil or motivation?  Greed? Selfishness? Anger?  Theres nothing about him that would suggest hes an evil greater than the galaxy has ever known. Theres nothing we see that would justify Lukes vision of nothing but darkness inside of Kylo.   The explanation doesnt work because the vision doesnt make any sense, and neither does Kylos character in relation to the supposed explanation.  Thus, This is not a sufficient explanation at all, and the writers need to give us a better one if they want us to accept this currently impossible character change.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Bro, Harris forecasting odds have dropped from 64 to 53 in the past threes weeks from that very site.","title":"Donald Trump Overtakes Kamala Harris in Seven-Point Swing Nationally: Poll"},{"text":"Witch! ?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 9, 2024 - 27 days until election day!"},{"text":"\\"[Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign operation crossed the $1 billion fundraising threshold in September, two months after she took over as the Democratic Party's 2024 standard bearer, according to two people familiar with the numbers.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-political-operation-crosses-1-billion-raised-2024-election-rcna174696)\\"\\"That figure includes money raised by the campaign committee itself and by a campaign-affiliated joint fundraising committee that also collects cash for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.\\"That'd mean that Q3 (July/August/September) is the only time she was in the running while raising.

Identifying as Republican on the whole and Democrat is dangerous as both parties use working people as fodder while they reap the rewards for themselves and their donors. If we can't put that at the base of thought, then I do think less of you because the priorities to the working class are put by the wayside in favor for your stronger military (already fully funded and the largest part of the budget) and other Repubcian values, without regard for thinking about how their social doctrine is oppressive to your more liberal values.If you agree that Republican social doctrine in dogwhistling to anti-LGBTQ sentiments is not acceptable, you need yo show that with how you vote.If you think government spending is excessive, you should demand more to be put into universal programs that allow for a better thriving working class, cuts out profiteers of our health/education systems. If you can't agree with Dems on their social programs, then that is correct because when they draw a line on what level of poverty you need to get help, it draws a line between the working class and reinforces cyclical poverty.I've met plenty of conservatives that agree with you on government spending, but they make an exception for healthcare and sometimes education. It's necessary for you to be clear to liberals on your arguments for or against privatization of that type of government spending.

Members of the Organization of American States (OAS) should discuss the situation in Peru during the organization's general assembly in Paraguay in late June.\\nDuring the first week of June, lawmakers moved forward a constitutional amendment that would eliminate key judicial bodies and undermine the independence of electoral authorities. They also advanced bills that would provide the government with overly broad powers to control nongovernmental organizations and undermine investigations into human rights violations committed in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Peruvian law, constitutional amendments need to be approved in two separate congressional periods, with the next one starting on July 27\\n\\"Peruvian legislators are ramping up their actions to **control judicial and electoral authorities, weaken accountability systems, and undermine oversight and criticism of their actions with a flurry of destructive legislation suddenly moving forward,\\"** said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \\"These measures are likely to have serious consequences for all Peruvians, allowing organized crime to thrive and making it harder for people to receive protection when their rights are abused.\\"\\nOn June 5, Congress' Constitutional Committee moved forward a **constitutional amendment to eliminate the National Board of Justice, the body in charge of appointing and removing judges, prosecutors, and electoral authorities.** The change would instead put **legislators in charge of appointing and removing electoral authorities, as well as removing the heads of disciplinary bodies for the judiciary and the Attorney General's Office.** If the amendment is approved by Congress this week, and again in the next legislative period, it will severely undermine the independence of judicial authorities and threaten the legitimacy of future elections.Also on June 5, Congress' Foreign Relations Committee moved forward a bill that would vastly increase the governments authority to control nongovernmental organizations that receive foreign funds. The bill uses overbroad and vague language that would, in practice, **provide the government with the power to arbitrarily fine or sanction groups that criticize or oppose government actions.**\\nOn June 6, Congress approved, on its first reading, a bill with the stated purpose of \\"clarifying the application and scope of the crime against humanity and war crimes\\" in Peru. The bill, which needs a second congressional vote to pass, says, contradicting international law, that war crimes and crimes against humanity committed before November 2003 are subject to a statute of limitations. It could be used by judges and prosecutors to undermine ongoing investigations into serious human rights violations committed during Peru's armed conflict (1980-2000) and could open the door to reviewing convictions against members of the Shining Path, a Maoist armed group, and against security and government officials responsible for war crimes.\\nThis measure undermining accountability for past human rights violations-including crimes against humanity and war crimes -fits within an existing congressional pattern of actions furthering impunity and dismantling the rule of law, Human Rights Watch said.\\nIn recent years, Peru's Congress, where **half of the lawmakers are reportedly under criminal investigation,** has moved forward with a range of decisions that undermine judicial independence, weaken the fight against corruption and organized crime, and dismantle democratic processes and human rights protections.\\nPresident Dina Boluarte has repeatedly joined forces with Congress, which recently voted down several motions to remove her from office.\\nIn 2023, lawmakers shortened the period for tolling the statute of limitations in criminal cases. **The president of Congress, Alejandro Soto, then invoked the new law to seek dismissal of a criminal case pending against him.** Lawmakers also made substantial changes to the Efficient Collaboration Law, weakening what had been an essential tool in investigations of organized crime. On May 30, they approved, **on first reading,** a bill that would narrow the definition of \\"organized crime,\\" making it harder to investigate many related offenses, **such as extortion, which has skyrocketed in recent years.**\\nCongress used an unfair process to appoint six of the seven Constitutional Tribunal judges; appointed an ombudsperson with no human rights experience; removed a top prosecutor without basis; and removed two members of the National Board of Justice on questionable grounds. Some lawmakers are also seeking to remove the head of the National Elections Tribunal, the highest body in charge of electoral matters.\\nAmong other cases involving members of Congress, prosecutors are investigating an alleged influence-peddling scheme between members of Congress and former attorney general Patricia Benavides, whom the National Board of Justice removed on May 22.\\nInvestigators allege that Benavides influenced congressional decisions by closing criminal investigations against lawmakers. Separately, Benavides is also under investigation for allegedly attempting to block an investigation against her sister, a judge, who was accused of unlawfully releasing members of drug cartels.\\nOn June 7, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said that the way Peru's Congress has exercised power could put the rule of law \\"in critical danger.\\" \\nMembers of the OAS will meet on June 26-28 in Asuncin, Paraguay, for the organization's general assembly. Since 2001, AS members have agreed to a shared \\"obligation to promote and defend\\" democracy, including the separation of branches of government, respect for fundamental rights, and periodic, free, and fair elections.\\nOAS members at the general assembly should urgently raise concerns about the dismantling of the rule of law and democratic systems in Peru, Human Rights Watch said. The European Union and other concerned states should also publicly urge President Boluarte to ensure respect for the rule of law and judicial independence.\\n\\"Governments in the Americas urgently need to speak up on the democratic backsliding in Peru,\\" Goebertus said. \\"It's in their interest to stop the infiltration and expansion of organized crime and corruption in their neighbor's institutions-and that's certainly in the best interest of Peruvians.\\"I can remember everyone celebrating the \\"triumph of Peruvian Democacy\\" when **this** congress impeached Pedro Castillo almost two years ago, but boy, were we wrong. \\nThe Peruvian Congess, an unrepresentative legislature dominated by the wealthy, the reactionares, and the plain corrupt, is taking full advantage of the absence of a unified or empowered opposition to re-shape Peruvian Governance into the GOP ideal; a bicameral consortium of hereditary neo-aristocrats, hyper-reactionaries, and corrupt bureaucrats united against the idea of \\"governance\\", \\"social contract\\", or \\"social mobility\\", who operate without any checks on their power from the two other branches they control, any transparency to their actions, or any fear of being voted-out in the face of the righteous fury of the people when can simply pick-and-choose their voters and \\"dissapear\\" those that try to oppose them at the picket-line or any sort of method that lies beyond their ballot box. It's funny that nearly half of Peru discourse here, almost entirely critical due to the \\"threat to democracy\\" Pedro posed, vanished almost a week into the post-Pedro Peru, more comical than surprising in retrospect. Regardless how terrible a President and his policies were, his tenure was only gridlock, a period of complete non-cooperation with his congress, and looking at how blatant their corruption is nowadays, I can kinda get what he was doing with that. Gridlock, even to the end of time, is ever-preferable to any compromise of democracy, especially looking at the end of Peruvian Democracy unfolding right now.","title":"Peru: Congress Ramps Up Assault on Democratic System"},{"text":"So I take it you're excited about Jill Stein?","title":"Kamala Harris' 'world salad' response on 60 Minutes edited out by CBS"},{"text":"This is all reasonable.

But he does.  And he grows from it.  Luke emerges from that experience a wiser, better and more mature man.  Thats what protagonists are supposed to do in stories - they start off flawed, and learn and evolve through their experiences.  They improve. They overcome their flaws. They become better people. The last Jedi suggests that no, actually Luke never overcame his flaws.  He never changed, never grew, never improved - hes still the impulsive, emotional hotheaded idiot that he was In a New Hope. He never learned from his mistakes, as he apparently kept making them after Return of the Jedi.  Basically, this makes his entire arc - the one about learning from and overcoming his personal flaws - in the original trilogy worthless.  \\n  is what happens at the end of Jedi. Theres a few key differences:  - to just about everybody in the galaxy, Vader is, indeed, evil and irredeemable.  Hes the mass-murdering enforcer of the most evil, tyrannical and oppressive force in the galaxy, whos killed thousands if not millions of innocent people. Throughout the trilogy, hes been built up as one of the movies leading villains - an unfeeling, evil threat to both Lukes goals, his friends, and the galaxy itself. Vader also killed Lukes master, his forces have wiped out Lukes adopted parents, and the fleet Vader commands is on the verge of destroying everything else that Luke cherishes: his friends and the rebellion he has come to fight for. Thus, Lukes anger and hatred for Vader is understandable and even sympathetic.  Luke giving in to his anger makes sense given the context, and makes his decision to put aside that anger truly heroic.  How many of us could say the same - that, when confronted with the chance to enact revenge on our own worst enemy, we would take the higher road ourselves as opposed to giving in to spite and petty hatred?  Lukes decision here is also the climax and culmination of an arc - one formed as the result of those very mistakes and the consequences he suffered from them. Those earlier mistakes and their lessons are what enable Luke to make that momentous decision to curtail his anger. Compare that to the last Jedi.  Instead of the 2nd greatest terror the galaxy has ever known, Luke now tries to kill  a child.  An innocent child who, up to that point, hasnt been shown to have done anything wrong.  This makes no sense and ruins Lukes character.  Unlike Vader, we have no reason to hate Kylo Ren - so we cant emphasize with Lukes motivations. Lukes hatred of Vader is well- portrayed and understandable, Lukes hate of Kylo is not. Its believable that someone would lose control fighting a merciless villain like Vader - Who, on instinct, tries to murder a child?!?   Another difference is the place and context within the story.  Again, In Return of the Jedi, Lukes decision to not give into anger is the culmination of his entire arc. Its the result of his entire journey, everything hes learned and experienced. Its a heroic moment that allows him - and Vader - to succeed in defeating the emperor and his empire.  Its a satisfying triumph, showing and highlighting Lukes strength and his character.  Its showing how hes evolved beyond his flaws and learned to control his emotions and his anger. However, in the last Jedi Luke not giving in to killing kylo is not Lukes moment of triumph, but a moment of shame and weakness. Rather than showcasing character growth, its shown as some impulsive mistake - an embarrassing character flaw that not only doesnt work but undermines his original arc.  Lukes decision not to kill Vader is also rewarded, when Vader turns against the emperor and saves Lukes life.  In the last Jedi, Lukes decision not to kill Kylo is not only not rewarded, but actively punished.  So Luke ultimately had the restraint to not kill Kylo - so what?  Hes still an embarrassing failure.  Kylo then goes to murder all of his other Palawans, destroy the temple, and start empire 2.0.  Lukes restraint in not killing Kylo isnt rewarded, so it doesnt come across as the right decision - heck, when you really look at it, I think everyone would be better off if Luke actually DID kill Kylo.  Since Luke isnt rewarded for his restraint and it only results in misery, his restraint thus doesnt come off as a heroic, admirable action but instead a moment of cowardice and failure - like Luke just wasnt strong enough to finish the job.  Oh, and Kylo Ren then kills his padwans and destroys his temple.  Because apparently Lukes so weak and pathetic he cant even stop one of his own trainees from destroying the thing he loves most. While the original scene shows Luke as a responsible, mature man able to control his emotions, the scene in the last Jedi makes Luke look the exact opposite -  miserable, pathetic, weak, and so susceptible to his emotions his first instinct when he sees a glimmer of darkness in a child is to try and murder him. \\nWhat also makes the last Jedis version worse is Rey. In return of the Jedi,  everybody else sees Vader the same way as Luke does when he succumbs to his anger - irredeemably evil. However, in the last Jedi, we have Rey taking the place of Luke in seeing the light in Kylo REN. This creates a rather big question - if Rey can see the light in Kylo, why isnt Luke able to?  Why wasnt he able to sense the conflict in Kylo Ren, when Rey so easily can?   Why did he only see darkness in his vision?  Theres no explanation as to why, which is why Lukes character is out of character and the last Jedi version sucks compared to return of the Jedi.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"the whole point of the ridiculous claims is to get attention.","title":"Biden rips beyond ridiculous hurricane claims from Greene"},{"text":"Your vote for anyone but Kamala is a vote for Trump.

Someone I know had to fix her roof on Maui due to insurance issues even though her roof was probably better than most of the older houses but she had to fork over the money anyway due to insurance. Turns out, since people want to live on Maui so bad, the real estate didnt collapse in the sense no one wanted to live there but everything got even more jacked up in prices. Maui is still likely to have more fires or a hurricane might finally ravage it as Hawaii has its hurricane season, but well see. The people remaining there refuse to leave the island they love, and wealthy folks like Maui. For whatever reason, people like living in Florida. It wont collapse but the people remaining there will be either poor or wealthy.","title":"CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years"},{"text":"Republicans wanting to retake their party from MAGA can only do so by voting D down ballot.

Going on SNL would ruin his image for folks who who haven't already listened to *Albuquerque &amp;* see SNL as a den of vice and, more recently, *politics*.Plus, SNL's brand might be damaged by having Weird Al host due to modern day political correctness and the viciousness of Amish Paradise towards a group with less privilege, like the Amish, who haven't had the privilege of using microwaves, electric whisks, or facebook marketplace, since at least 1997.Plus, SNL's brand *might* also be damaged in the eyes of people with bad grammar (which includes 54% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 and 99.94% of people under the age of 18).  These are very valuable demographics for comedy, because they can't spell, conjugate, or use conjunctions confidently, which means they're easy pickings for cheap jokes and obvious lies, and lying to your audience is how comedy works these days for like... every right winger on the internet these days, and SNL probably wants to get in on those profits because holy crap do those groups buy a lot of diet pills and testosterone boosters going by the ads of their favorite podcasts. Even bad spellers might buy pre-faded t-shirts or novelty comedy records sometimes. If those folks remotely understood the laws of grammar, they'd all be very upset with Weird Al's vicious and searing song *Word Crimes*, and putting Weird Al on SNL would increase the risk of that happening, thus increasing the risk of SNL getting a bad reputation.And then there are the celebrities.  Weird Al's spoofed so many songs and so many celebrities that they might be offended if SNL doesn't invite them to cameo on a skit with Weird Al.  Which would also lead to celebrities believing Weird Al *didn't* invite them on purpose, and making Weird Al's life worse.  You can't have that.  Weird Al is a gloriously people-pleasing people-pleaser and displeasing people could only displease Weird Al, and then his people would suffer because a displeased people-pleasing Weird Al is less likely to people-please and they're probably people used to being people-pleased.","title":"CMV: Weird Al should be asked to host SNL"},{"text":"Actually, his language is quite reserved.He should be describing her as a bat shit crazy nut job.","title":"Biden rips beyond ridiculous hurricane claims from Greene"},{"text":"She's black and owns a firearm, that's why the racists are mad.","title":"Why Kamala Harris is facing criticism for owning a Glock"},{"text":"Knowing his penchant for both attention and being an ass for the sake of being an ass, I think you're half right.

The NHTSA does so with some input from the DOT, who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Transportation. Congress is quite far removed from the actual implementation of the regulations. They initially passed them in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo, but left the bulk of the implementation up to the DOT, who in turn sent it to the NHTSA, who in turn sent it to the EPA. Most of the \\"light truck\\" regulations came about in 2007. Reading through the Wikipedia page, They're an absolute mess right now. And especially with the improvements in hybrid/EV technology, it's high time to take a good hard look at them from the ground up. But again, between that requiring an act of congress, and just the absolute spiderweb of cross-references, directives, memos, amendments, and stuff... You need to have the ability to implement a radical change in federal rulemaking to fix things like this. Again, my initial argument was that we needed to radically reform how this process worked. And the more I read about CAFE in particular, the more I believe that. Yes, we could try to have congress do something.

Normally, these shouldn't exceed more than about 30% of one's spendable income.My mother's property tax went from up $1,689 on a $250K house - which we all knew it would.

YOU... are going to have to pay back that $7.8 Trillion *plus interest*... out of all the money you will make over the course of your lifetime, not even including any further tax increases.  Which means you'll have less than you would have had, had the woman with the emails gotten elected.

Current law - The electors Shall vote for the President/VP that obtained more votes in the state of Arizona and the winning party will select the electors to represent Arizona.  This is the commonly accepted way to select who represents your state in the electoral college. This new law says the state legislature will select the electors.  Has no reference at all to honoring the popular vote at all.  It just states that the state legislature will pick the electors.   Why would you drastically change how electors are being chosen?  Why would you state that the state legislature is SOLELY responsible for selecting the electors.  .... It is rather obvious.   \\n**West Virginia**  \\n  \\nThe WV is not about certifying their votes which is in their authority.  It states that they will not recognize the duly elected president if a few key people in the state of WV think that fraud in other states happen.  Doesn't say they need evidence, doesn't say they won't certify the WV election.  It states they will not acknowledge the DULY elected President.  The state of WV has no authority, no reason to certify the election in say, Wisconsin.  It also states that there are protections ONLY for republican candidates. If you think this is just .. oh WV will only certify WV if they think it is legit .. you clearly did not read it.  Why does the feelings of WV on the election in Wisconsin matter?  They have no real insight, no real evidence, no way to dig into the due process in Wisconsin.  They have no legal authority.  Why do they think they know better than the election officials in Georgia who certified the election?  Or Arizona?So on these two items. **You stated that it is just a change that the State legislature in Arizona being in session is the only change.  This is FACTUALLY not true.  It is a substantial change to who Arizona currently appoints electors to represent Arizona in the Electoral College.** **You stated that in WV they are just ensuring they can certify the vote and would go through the correct legal process if they could not.  Yet that is not what the bill states at all.  It states that if for any reason they find that in ANY state, not limited to WV, they feel the election had fraud in it they would not acknowledge the President.   This has nothing to do with WV certifying the vote in WV.**  **Vance and his Yarvis connections and reference to the plan**Here is a link to the podcast where Vance made the statements on the plan and the connection  \\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qAVzioyWlG3u3RM7902cL](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qAVzioyWlG3u3RM7902cL)In it he states how to rip out the tumor - He says there is this guy Curtis Yarvin as the way to rip out the tumor.   Yarvin's plan is RAGE (retire all government Employees)   \\nThis was given at a 2012 BIL Conference.   \\nHere is a general over view of Yarvis - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis\\\\_Yarvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin)  \\n  \\nVance knows of this plan and has been present when Yarvin has given the idea of a monarchy at least once.   They have spoken at the same conference. Vance has acknowledged his work and has referenced him as a major influence on his thinking.   Stating that someone was a major influence on your thinking while that person wants to install a Monarchy is generally a deal breaker for public office. The connection is really deeper than that though.  Peter Thiel who believes that freedom and democracy are incompatible funds both of these men.  Vance doesn't have a political career without Thiel. This is not a loose connection.  Vance doesn't run away from it, he doesn't recommend Yarvis loosely.  He references Yarvis as one of the people that shapes his thought and when asked directly about how to replace the government employees he references Yarvis's plan which includes a monarchy.","title":"America dying if Democrats are elected is crazy, top comment is about how America will die if Republicans are elected"},{"text":"So Trump can see them on TV when he's in those states most likely.","title":"Trump plans rallies in solidly Democratic states in an unorthodox strategy for the election's final weeks"},{"text":"Nothing its a cult","title":"There is no redemption for these people"},{"text":"Or absentee moving forward.

You will have no lasting legacy, your name will be forgotten and your works will fall. In the blink of an eye relative to the universe Homo sapiens as a species will have at best evolved into something else or at worst collapsed in on itself and the fact of your individual existence as a conscious being will be forever lost to time.The only choice you get to make is to embrace this reality or be horrified by it and deny it, but whatever you choose doesn't matter and won't change anything.","title":"Give me some Black Pills."},{"text":"Dude, this is just recent Trump news.

We all know how weak FEMA response can be and we know we are a month away from an election, so why would a sitting administration put themselves in a position of looking like bumbling fools with lackluster disaster relief by manipulating a hurricane to wipe out a couple small towns in Appalachia with sparse populations that wont have any impact on an election.

There are survivors of this history (the legacy of conquest, the spice and people trade, and colonization) of the Americas and few listen to them but mention this as a past issueinadvertently engaging in erasure, particularly the blood quantum that designates people as Latina (blood % for socially constructed definitions of race yet we categorically reject discrimination and % identity based eugenics for all other people) and the forced re-labeling of native/indigenous people as Mestizo then Latin). This also happens within discussions among people of indigenous descent from the Americas as the appropriation of being anti Columbus with nearly no recognition of who actually had to fight against invasion, attempts of enslavement, and theft by Columbus and his crew. This history is all too often misunderstood and inappropriately interpreted by those jumping on the anti-colonial bandwagon without adequate understanding of this history. Also slave codes that forced people of mixed descent to identify as only African American despite a diverse and rich heritage including oral histories and traditions affects far more than the U.S. but instead the whole region including all CARICOM countries and people of this continent who are just as interested in their futures as they are all impacted by the effects of U.S. policies and conventions. Many people who appear black from CARICOM and southern neighboring countries in the Americas are also Native American people with a shared history from the legacy of trade, colonialism, and slavery as was tied earlier to capitalism. It is so rare enough time is given to them to hearing in depth the oral histories of people and places. This is the lesson. Radical change should be led by and center these voices and encourage functioning governments in order to restore government to government relationships that rights historical wrongs and restores both governmental representation with decision making and voting ability and the environment. Many are both descended from people indigenous to the Americas and who were moved from the horrific business of slavery. Just mentioning it while the intentions are well meaning often furthers erasure. Id argue any radical change must center those with the smallest populations and oldest cultures and meaningful connections to their ancestral land, the environment, and cultural preservation. The radical part would be giving up power and representation to right these historical wrongs far beyond modern borders and land acknowledgments to recognize the rights, interests, and relationships and descendants of people who engage in cultural and environmental preservation of their own territory or ancestral homelands that existed on the continent before the power structures that shape society as we know it.","title":"CMV: Society does not need radical change"},{"text":"Biden endorsing Trump would be the greatest October surprise ever!","title":"Are we witnessing President Biden's revenge tour?"},{"text":"Wouldn't it make more sense just to give her a script?

They had a state briefly in the 1800s by the way. They rioted a couple of times at the large numbers of ships coming to Haifa ports after they read the Belfur declaration. \\nWhen 1948 happened: the head of the jordanian army was a British officer. What the brits did is tell most of the newly displaced people cross east of the river instead of the \\"west bank\\". In retrospect, that was well played by the brits to get out 750k Palestinians out of the newly taken territories by the new Israeli state. \\nThe arab armies were newly formed and barely equipped. Against a fully armed army from the brits (they left all the ammo and depts intact for the israelis). So for those Palestinians it was quite a shock. To one day be living in a town where you barely set foot outside to being compulsed to leave to a desert. Who to blame? The new people...who are? Jewish. Now to the situation afterwards: a lot of debate is going to be held here. But the essence of it is: the Palestinian peoples' liberation serves no one. They don't have wealth or power. They're basically oppressed by a regime that is backed by the superpowers, money, tech, weapons. Later on, the mass king of multiple ethnicities in Europe provided a better narrative to move the jews to a specific land. The setup is a bit more understood when we realize that the cross section of Christian zionists, oil companies, and major corporations coincided with what the zionist movement aspired for, albeit for different reasons (same reason but different person). So it was not OK by the powers to be to grant the Palestinians any land. Just prolong the status quo until settlements make it an impossible solution. How does this relate to the Palestinians nowadays? Well, they realized they will never be given any solution, and long term they will be squeezed into pockets of irrlelvancr eventhough their numbers are high. Any scenario can happen to cleanse them again to another country. That scenario is to be perpetrated by the right wing of the Jewish state that has 3 times the fertility of the left wingers. So by no means it's jewish as much as it's the occupiers. Replace the word and it's still OK.","title":"CMV: A vast portion of Arabs/Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza have no idea what Palestinian \\"statehood\\" is; for them \\"statehood\\" is merely the absence of Jews"},{"text":"Ive found a new candidate here in WNC that I think, while he isnt that likely to win, could gain some substantial votes from shy Dems: Adam Tebrugge.

I do not have any obligation to report a crime unless it happens under my supervision like if I am a teacher and see abuse or if the crime is like murder. If prostitution is made legal, then I will have to accept that because I have no desire of becoming a vigilante and imposing my ideology on everyone. But I would still try to petition or advocate about how it is wrong and why it should be declared illegal by the government. But currently if I see prostitution occuring, then I would report it the police, you or people who think it should legal, can just make the choice to not report it. If there is no minimum wage, it is better for the homeless person because they will get the 1$ per hour instead of being homeless but it is much worse for all the people who are employed because if the company can hire homeless people at 1$ per hour. They will realize they do not have to pay the minimum wage they have been paying to their employees and will pay them like 1$ per hour. Existence of minimum wage laws are not to protect the homeless but to ensure that if a company agrees to hire an individual they pay them atleast the bare minimum to be able to live. The way for homeless people or people without jobs to make do in the meantime is with the unemployment benefits they will get from the government. For example, there are household workers in a lot of countries like Middle East, South Asia, SouthEast Asia, Latin America, etc. The workers are grossly underpaid like I know of workers who make 200$ in a month while working 8 hours a day for the entire month. It is much better than them not having that work. If they go to the government and say they are being underpaid, they will be fired and there are 10 other homeless people who would agree to working for that rate. Similarly I agree that legalizing prostitution is better and safer for prostitutes. They will have protection against assault, there could be cameras, guards to protect them. They would have to report their contract, income to the government and in case there are disagreements between the employer and employee then the government can intervene. But I would still argue that the morally sex/body is not something which should be acceptable to be sold. The same way certain drugs like LSD, heroin, etc should not be sold even if the seller accepts to sell them and buyer accepts to buy them","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"Haven't heard of the couch thing and they push that Project 2025 at every turn but I have no idea what that is either, and they never explain it.

Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to ensure that every American can turn on their tap and drink clean water without fear of lead and other toxic chemicals. As part of this historic commitment to clean water and environmental justice, President Biden committed to replace every lead pipe in the country within 10 years, issuing a comprehensive Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan to achieve that goal.Today [October 8th], to deliver on this promise, President Biden is traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency is issuing a final rule that will require drinking water systems nationwide to replace lead service lines within 10 years. EPA is also investing an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water upgrades and lead pipe replacements, funded by President Bidens landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  This announcement comes as part of the Presidents commitment to spend his remaining months in office sprinting to the finish and delivering on his historic Investing in America agenda, which is improving the lives of Americans and planting the seeds for a better, more prosperous future for decades to come.In its first year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that it would develop this new rule, known as the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, to establish the first-ever national requirement to replace all lead service lines. Since then, President Biden secured a historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement, and hundreds of thousands of Americans have already had their lead pipes replaced. Because of the Presidents actions today, millions more will benefit from lead-free infrastructure in the years to come.Lead poisoning can cause serious health effects, especially in children. It can cause irreversible damage to cognitive development, damage the kidneys, slow learning, and cause cardiovascular disease. Lead exposure can also impact pregnancies, increasing the risk of low birthweights or even miscarriage. No level of lead exposure is safe. Yet, due to decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color.Todays announcement will help protect Americans in communities across the country from these harms C the EPA estimates that every year, this final rule will prevent up to 900,000 infants from being born with low birthweight, stop up to 200,000 IQ points lost in children, and reduce up to 1,500 cases of premature death from heart disease.To build on these commitments, today, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is investing over $420 million in new grants, prioritizing lead hazard reduction to protect children, alongside efforts to improve home health, energy efficiency, and community safety. HUD will provide funding to address lead-based paints in homes, develop training and partnerships to identify and control lead-based paint hazards, coordinate home inspections and more.*Replacing Lead Pipes in Milwaukee*Lead pipe replacement is actively underway in Milwaukee through a $30 million investment provided by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has accelerated Milwaukees lead replacement timeline from 60 years down to 10 years. Milwaukee is replacing lead pipes using union labor and prioritizing replacements in disadvantaged communities with the most need. The city is now a leader in the region, partnering with cities like Detroit in the Great Lakes Lead Pipes Partnership to accelerate lead pipe replacement across the Midwest.*Progress Replacing Lead Pipes Across America*Beyond Milwaukee, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to accelerate lead pipe replacement nationwide. President Biden secured a historic $15 billion in dedicated funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for lead pipe replacement, and an additional $11.7 billion that can be used for both drinking water projects and lead pipe replacement. Nearly half of this funding is required to flow to disadvantaged communities, including in neighborhoods and communities that shoulder most of the burden of lead poisoning. In addition to providing clean drinking water for millions, this effort is also creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs, in replacing lead pipes and delivering clean water to households. This effort also advances the Presidents Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.*These actions from the Administration have already put cities across the country on track to meet the Presidents goal of replacing every lead pipe within a decade:** Detroit, Michigan, has received $90 million from this Administration for lead pipe replacement, which has allowed the city to accelerate from replacing 700 lead pipes per year to replacing over 8,000 this year. Detroit is now on track to replace all 80,000 lead pipes within 10 years.\\n* Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has received $98 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan to replace lead pipes, and is on track to replace every lead pipe by 2026. The city is already over halfway done with this work.\\n* St. Paul, Minnesota, received $16 million from the American Rescue Plan to enable the citys Lead-Free St. Paul program to target the replacement of all lead pipes by 2032.\\n* Denver, Colorado has accelerated its efforts through $76 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allowing the city to be on track to replace all lead pipes within a decade.\\n* Akron, Ohio is now on track to replace all lead service lines by 2027 thanks to $9 million in funding through the American Rescue Plan.\\n* And some communities have already finished replacing lead pipes. Following a lead-in-water crisis, Benton Harbor, Michigan, successfully replaced all its lead pipes within just two years, fueled by $18 million in funding from the Presidents American Rescue Plan. And Edgerton, WI has replaced 100% of its known lead pipes after receiving funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.*Delivering Clean Water*The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes more than $50 billion to help ensure every community has access to clean water C the largest investment in clean water in American history. Combined with new protections against toxic chemicals and over 42 million acres of lands and waters protected under President Biden, the Biden-Harris Administration has embarked on the most ambitious conservation and clean water agenda in the nations history, making historic progress to secure clean water for all. Highlights of this ambitious agenda include:* Combatting toxic forever chemicals in drinking water and wastewater. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $10 billion to address harmful PFAS pollution in drinking water and wastewater. The EPA has also finalized the first-ever national standard to address these forever chemicals in drinking water, which will protect 100 million Americans from PFAS exposure, safeguarding public health and advancing environmental justice.\\n* Protecting freshwater at the source. Our rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands are the sources of clean drinking water that flows into our homes and economic drivers for many communities. Through the America the Beautiful Freshwater Challenge, the Administration has launched a nationwide initiative to protect, restore, and reconnect 8 million acres of wetlands and 100,000 miles of our nations rivers and streams by 2030. Over 200 states, Tribes, local governments, and businesses have joined the effort to meet these goals.\\n* Investing in clean water for Tribes. The Biden-Harris Administration has announced historic Tribal water infrastructure investments totaling over $5 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will help bring clean water to Tribal Nations, where half of Tribal households lack access to basic clean drinking water or adequate sanitation. The Administration has launched 900 Tribal clean water infrastructure projects to date through these investments.*Investing in Wisconsin*Todays announcement builds on a record of investment in the state of Wisconsin over the course of the Presidents term in office. In addition to the President delivering on lead pipe replacement, the Presidents Investing in America agenda has deployed $7.2 billion in public sector clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure investments, which have catalyzed an additional $8 billion from the private sector.These investments include:* $1.7 billion in funding to provide affordable, reliable high-speed internet to everyone in Wisconsin, with 72,000 homes and small businesses already connected.\\n* $4.1 billion for transportation C to rebuild our roads and bridges, expand our transit and rail, modernize our ports and airports, and more. This includes $1 billion in funding that the Biden-Harris Administration announced earlier this year to replace the Blatnik Bridge, an important route for people and freight in the Twin Ports area.\\n* 1.3 million seniors and Medicare beneficiaries who can receive free vaccines, $35 insulin, and, starting in January, a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs.\\n* $3.3 billion from Microsoft to bring a new data center that will create over 4,000 jobs to Racine, Wisconsin on the site of a proposed investment from Foxconn in the prior Administration that never materialized.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-Harris Administration Issues Final Rule to Replace Lead Pipes Within a Decade, Announces New Funding to Deliver Clean Drinking Water"},{"text":"Remember all the \\"Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction\\".
