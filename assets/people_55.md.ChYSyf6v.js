So far, 90 per cent of the vote has been counted.So far, in counties with over sixty per cent of the population of Hispanic origin, Trump has seen his vote share increase by four points, almost double his national average.In Miami-Dade, home to 1.8 million Hispanics, Trump looks likely to secure the county for the first time since 1992 with a ten-point margin.The figures reflect data seen in exit polls which show a 13-point jump with Trump?[among the Hispanic community](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-huge-surge-latino-voters-exit-poll/).The exit polls also showed that Harris had failed to see a surge in support from women voters widely seen as necessary to securing a comfortable victory. Instead, Trump saw a two-point increase among female voters to 44 per cent.So far, just two states have declared over 90 per cent of their vote. Delaware - which went to Harris - and Kentucky - which went to Trump.Early data from Republican states Virginia, Tennessee and Florida have counted at least sixty per cent of their votes and show a six-point jump in vote share for Trump.However, if Trump sees the two-point bump he has received in these states in Pennsylvania and Michigan, hell take the presidency comfortably.It promises to be a long night.Pennsylvania has counted fewer than fifty per cent of its votes but shows a narrow Trump lead. Michigan has counted just 17 per cent of its vote.It is clear though that the momentum is thoroughly on Trumps side.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-showing-early-signs-of-winning-election/)","title":"Donald Trump showing early signs of winning election"},{"text":"Lying about history wont lift the curse.","title":"Trump is smiling in all the MSM photos now.

Claiming that Democrats are the *real* racists, and \\"the party of slavery and the KKK.\\"This is revisionist BS I've even heard from some alleged black voters that they're frustrated because Democrats just \\"expect\\" them to vote blue.But that's not the case. If there's any expectation, it's one that asks American voters of all backgrounds, races and ethnicities to understand an important history, and not just the history of the civil war era, but one that sheds light on the modern Republican party's roots in a conservative movement that exploited racial tensions to thrive. The conservative platform since the 60s and 70s, has contributed to many of the widespread sociocultural issues that have been plaguing black communities for decades.But let's start with \\"Democrats are the party of slavery\\"It's more accurate to view the history of our country's changing political landscape as shifting along a conservative-liberal spectrum. Party platforms can be more correctly characterized by where they fall on that spectrum.Our first party system emerged with the national politics of its time. The issues that split the two major parties, the Federalists and the Democrat-Republicans, were steeped in a divide over early questions about federal powers, economic policy, the constitution, social issues, etc, in other words, it was grounded in the context of the past.But over time that context has changed dramatically, and our major party's platforms have transformed to reflect this change.In the early 19th century, the first party system began unraveling in response to a split within the Democrat-Republicans party, among other things.Several new parties emerged in response to changing ideas and a changing country.But what remained relatively constant, was where Americans fell on that ideological spectrum.So calling democrats \\"the party of slavery\\" is extremely dishonest.It was, in fact, the  *CONSERVATIVE* party that was largely pro slavery, made up of many southern whites and biblical literalists who defended their God given right to *own* black people, who later obstructed reconstruction efforts and facilitated the Jim-Crow era and the \\"black codes.\\"It was largely southern white *conservatives* who argued in favor of slavery. Promoting ideas of paternalism, and using the Bible as a justification for slavery.Which party today proudly brandishes their Confederate banners and memorabilia? Appeals most to evangelicals, biblical purists, white supremacist groups? Which party paints the South red on an electoral map? Proudly identifies with their \\"southern heritage,\\" and throws a fit every time a confederate icon's statue is taken down?Today's Republican party has its so called \\"values\\" steeped in limited government policies, religious doctrine, chauvinism and over-the-top nationalistic and nativist attitudes. A party that insulates itself, is intolerant of out-groups and foreigners, and has grown increasingly obsessed with its own culture wars. The Republican party of today doesn't resemble, at all, the Republican party of *strong federal government* founded during the antebellum period.So what happened? Did the parties \\"switch?\\" Well, I prefer to call it a realignment.In the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of shifting perspectives and political platforms, the Democrats began departing from earlier policies. This realignment involved Democrats supporting social justice reforms and the role of the federal government in helping to establish these changes, it also involved new deal Democrats who sought to expand federal power to address economic crisis, labor rights, banking reforms and the emergence of social programs. The Democratic party began adopting more liberal policies. By the mid 20th century, Republicans began shifting towards conservative social policies and staunchly supporting a platform of limited government, deregulation, segregation, Christian fundamentalism, the redistribution of wealth to the top, and anti-gay and \\"law and order\\" messaging. Democrats on the other hand, became more and more associated with liberal policies, civil rights, welfare, labor reforms, and a stronger federal government.The southern strategy was employed by Republicans, starting in the 1960s, to draw white, southern conservative voters to the party who felt alienated and disarmed by civil rights movements and desegregation policies. The strategy was also successful in appealing to racial tensions and promoting conservative and religious \\"values.\\"The strategy proved very effective.By the 1980s, a new conservative movement had formed. Over the course of two decades, conservative figures like George Wallace, Barry Goldwater, William Rehnquist, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan of course, used \\"Law and Order,\\" \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric and campaign talking points to engage with aggrieved white conservatives in the south particularly. This language was riddled with dog whistles meant to inflame racial tensions and inculcate conservatives with fears of racial violence, desegregation, and crime in their neighborhoodsOut of this movement also emerged the \\"moral majority,\\" and a Christian fundamentalist revival that drew more and more conservatives to the Republican partyThey also attracted white conservatives to the party by appealing to their grievances around how these deep societal changes were challenging the heteronormativity of a pre racial America and a dominant white culture.The Republican party began ramping up its \\"culture wars,\\" and \\"holy wars\\" that sought to establish a fight between the forces of good and evil, a war threatening the White, Christian hegemony.Politically, the Republican party around this time also began reviving and refashioning for the modern era, policies that previously brought about Jim Crow, Including policies that widened the racial wealth gap, that contributed to racial injustices, disparities in generational wealth, that reinforced race-based housing discrimination and black voter suppression, policies meant to sequester and neglect black communities, and policies that disproportionately jailed black people and denied loans to black families, farmers, business owners, etcThe Conservative party today has deep roots in this movement and has grown increasingly more ethnocentrist as a result.We don't *expect\\" black people to just vote for Democrats. We just understand that Republicans have been deliberately inattentive to your needs and your problems by undermining efforts to address them.That Republicans *and* conservatives have been demonizing you and your communities for decades, highlighting crime in your neighborhoods to push their agendas, using you as scapegoats, and dismissing the ubiquitousness of race related problems through \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric.Not to mention, how conservatives minimize your experiences by claiming that racism is over, that anti-white discrimination is more prevalent than any other kind of discrimination. That black people have been overly catered to, that any talk of racial injustice is simply the curse of \\"wokeness.\\" We understand that Republicans/conservatives have historically contributed more than most, to the ongoing generational issues that impact black communities in particular. That theyd prefer if you didn't vote at all, and are doing everything within their power to try and make that happen.","title":"Trump doubles support among Black voters in Wisconsin compared to 2016, exit poll shows"},{"text":"Wah wah.

All your friends are like OLIVES ARE AWFUL. Olives are the devil and will destroy you and give you the worst shits ever. Only literal monsters eat olives.But. You know some people eat olives, and like olives, and are just fine and happy! They dont mind that you dont eat olives. Or that your friends dont eat olives. They are welcome not to.

Colin Allred on Tuesday, defying another spirited and well-funded effort to turn Texas blue and preserving his status as a leading conservative voice in American politics.  \\n  \\n\\"This decisive victory should shake the Democratic establishment to its core,\\" he said in a speech to his supporter in Houston.  \\n  \\nAfter his close scare against then-U.S. Rep. Beto ORourke in 2018, Cruz vowed to enter this election cycle better prepared and more aggressive, determined to avoid the ignominious fate of becoming the first Texas Republican to lose statewide since 1994.  \\n  \\nCruzs victory once again dashes Democrats dream of breaking their decades-long drought in Texas statewide elections. But it was not without a serious challenge: Both candidates raised north of $80 million and attracted millions more from outside groups eager to sway a contest that carried potential to decide control of the U.S. Senate.  \\n  \\nLike in 2018, polls in the lead up to Election Day remained close. Allred was repeatedly polling within single digits behind Cruz, with one September poll showing him one point ahead. The Allred campaign revealed internal polling just days before Election Day showing the two tied.   \\n  \\nFueling Cruzs win was his standing as one of the most popular Republicans among conservative voters in a state where GOP voters still outnumber Democrats.

This amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida. The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time. Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS AMENDMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO AMBIGUITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE AMENDMENT'S IMPACT.
