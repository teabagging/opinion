The conflict begins, and the zionist paramilitaries (terrorist groups) used that as an excuse to empty villages out at gun point, killing anyone that refused or would fight back. Dozens  and dozens of Israeli villages are Palestinian villages cleared out and renamed. Multiple mass graves exist throughout Israel.Look it up for yourself, search about the Irgun group, Lehi, the nakba, and the Deir Yassin massacre. Deir Yassin was a village that declared neutrality during the conflict and was completely disarmed.

Yeah, cause no one wants to smell your gross smoke, not to mention the harm to *them.* Alcohol only harms the consumer, and doesn't emit harmful vapours.So a) yeah I'd probably agree that drinking every day is worst than smoking every day.but b) there's a reason it's demonized, and it's a legit reason. \\"Fairness\\" is subjective and in this instance doesn't really matter, because it's not demonized compared to anything.","title":"CMV: Drinking alcohol is worse than smoking cigarettes."},{"text":"djt is mentally unstable","title":"Unhinged Trump accuses Kamala Harris of murder and conspiring with cartel heads"},{"text":"Honestly the first time Ive seen a Democrat take a seat in front of the entire country and attack the hedge funds for destroying our housing market.

But 100% of crimes are committed under the influence of oxygen.  I don't mean to dismiss your point, but merely to note that a correlation of the influence of a substance generally consumed does not indicate causation.  If 40% of charitable contributions, 40% of friendly visits, etc. were made under the influence of alcohol we would have a different context for the 40% of crime number, no?[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022042617750579](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022042617750579)This research indicates that there is no correlation between the amount of alcohol consumed by a society and murder rates in that society.  Rather what they found was a correlation of hazardous consumption patterns of alcohol.  That is, drinking alcohol to excess is associated with higher murder rates, but not amounts of alcohol drank.  So a society where people tend to have 2 drinks per day have no more murders, all else equal, than societies that have 1 drink or no drinks per day.  But societies where alcohol tends to be consumed a lot at once, as in 7 drinks in a sitting once per week, rather than 1 drink per day over the week, have more murder.This suggests a causal link between excess alcohol, but not necessarily moderate alcohol, and violent crime.","title":"CMV: Drinking alcohol is worse than smoking cigarettes."},{"text":"yeah Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan \\"people\\" also wanted that according to \\"American Media\\"... look at those countries today..","title":"Kamala Harris says U.S. will support Israel's right to defend itself after Iran's missile attack"},{"text":"No, it's more like 80% to 65% Republican.

This small party got enough votes to get a 300k payout to run the party (use in paying administration, propaganda, ads, etc), because of constitution. This led to every major city entrance having a big ADN/Extreme Right-wing party billboard. Extremely weird now, looking at those billboards.

This is as bad an argument as the people who say that violent video games cause violent behavior because many school mass shooters have been known to regularly play violent video games.If porn makes women safer, why are their cases of young girls dying because their dumb porn addict boyfriends choked them to death because they saw it in porn?

The big one(s) with alcohol are liver-related. They carry a few precursors (e.g. fatty liver disease) that are both generally mitigatable at time of discovery through lifestyle changes, and are relatively easy to discover with routine urine testing and/or non-invasive procedures such as ultrasounds. The big one(s) with cigarettes are lung-related (e.g. cancer). Lung cancer carries zero-to-no precursors, has no currently known routine discovery procedures, and is generally regarded as being non-reversible. It's an incredibly nasty disease that often doesn't present symptoms until it's progressed to a life-threatening state.In addition to that point, I'd also like to call out the so-called drunken monkey hypothesis. Human's relationship with alcohol (including social) is believed to go well beyond written history. It's a substance that we've quite literally evolved alongside as a species. There's a compelling argument to be made that it's well-woven into our social fabric in a way that's truly impossible to unweave...if we would even want to. Alcohol does bring a myriad of benefits to social cohesion, despite all it's dangers. The same case couldn't be made for tobacco, which is (relatively speaking) a pretty new trend in the human species.","title":"CMV: Drinking alcohol is worse than smoking cigarettes."},{"text":"Im not blaming the left, simply telling the recent history of the left.

Many of these roles weren't caricatures at all and plenty of them were genuinely respectful roles, but the history of racism in many countries meant that they still weren't open to people from the ethnicities they were portraying (the first black man to portray Othello did so in 1825, centuries after the role was written, and he lived to see Queen Vicky take the throne). During segregation in the USA, many productions wouldn't have been able to cast a black actor if they had wanted to. And then add in the fact that until recently, there were significantly fewer non-white characters being written in western media, and many of those roles were still going to white actors...\\nFor this reason, white actors cosmetically changing their appearance in order to play non-white characters still has some pretty negative context to it. Especially when you consider that at the same time that it was the standard for a wite actor in blackface makeup (because really, purely semantically, I don't know what other word exists to describe it, and how many times would you want to type 'makeup applied with the aim of making the individual appear to be of African descent?) to play Othello, they would never have had a black actress in whiteface makeup play Desdemona. And heck, when they were casting for the LOTR movies in the 2000s, they literally rejected a woman as an extra - a freaking extra - because they weren't willing to have Indian hobbits.\\nThe term 'blackface' is pretty much universally used to mean applying cosmetics in order to appear as or portray a black person while not being black, and as far as I've seen, has always included non-caricature portrayals. I have never seen anyone claim that just tanning or wearing a foundation a little darker than your natural skintine is 'blackface' except for when someone does so for the explicit purpose of appearing to be black, nor have I ever seen anyone claim that being painted entirely black to portray a supernatural creature is blackface.\\nUltimately, racial relations are a complicated and messy thing, and there is a hell of a lot of history there, so nothing is ever going to boil down to something as simple as \\"only old-timey minstrel makeup counts as real blackface\\".\\nAlso, there isn't really a whole lot of need to use cosmetics to appear black just to cosplay a black character, just like there is no need for a black person to use cosmetics to appear white to cosplay a white character. Most people aren't idiots, they know that nobody is ever going to look exactly like the character they are cosplaying, and just like they accept it and willingly suspend their disbelief when a white person cosplays an Asian character, they can do the same for a white person cosplaying a black character, because at the end of the day, it's just cosplay.","title":"CMV: Altering your skin tone to be darker, permanently or temporarily, is not inherently Blackface or Racist."},{"text":"Meat?!","title":"CMV: Drinking alcohol is worse than smoking cigarettes."},{"text":"Some people drink 20 beers everyday after work, that's why I said \\"most.\\" Both are terrible for your body but the average drinkers relationship with alcohol is completely different to that of the average smoker to cigarettes so the overall damage is negligible in comparison across the population of average users.","title":"CMV: Drinking alcohol is worse than smoking cigarettes."},{"text":"Key word here is most.

The way college admission would work without affirmative action is that you have certain metrics and whoever has the best aggregate performance is admitted. With affirmative action the only way to insert more black students into a college is to weight their scores more heavily. You automatically get a higher aggregate rating based on your race. So literally if that system was not in place those black students who only got better scores than white students because of the added bonus of racial points woudn't be there if that system was not in place, hence the perception. Now this of course does not apply to all black students, I don't know what percentage it does apply to. There are black students who are top performers and would do very well without the bonus points. However, that doesn't really justify affirmative action, because as we just discussed, they don't need it. No matter how you slice it, affirmative action is racially discriminatory, it just does it in a more complicated way. It says \\"sorry white person (or asian person) you got a 1350 on your SAT and had a 3.9GPA, but we need more black people in this school so this black person with a 1300 SAT score and a 3.7GPA gets the last spot, tough shit\\". Reality is that if you want more black people in colleges you need to work to get it so there are more black people who have good GPAs and test scores than currently do. Ironically affirmative action is systemic racism. Opportunities are being redistributed based on skin color.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Dance, Dance, Dance on Cruz's (political) Grave!This would be a dream come true.Beating Trump is essential for our country's continued survival, but this outcome would give me the warm and fuzzies I expect usually only get from illegal substance (sadly no personal experience on the latter).","title":"Another poll shows Ted Cruz trailing Democratic challenger Colin Allred"},{"text":"Your best response is to not argue with leftists for your personal sanity.","title":"Why do people argue imperialism is essential to liberalism?

The greed and especially fear driving European nations from the Reformation to the end of WWII helps this conflation, as countries with liberals in them acted imperialistically. Its foolish.Empires are inherently economically and politically illiberal. A colonial policy is one that relies on strict restraint of trade and personal liberty. Colonies are forced to trade with the imperial heart exclusively while the empire blocks competition from rival empires or other countries. Resistance and self determination are forbidden, leading to abuse, atrocity and corruption.That's why liberalism emerged in part as an anti-imperial movement. In Canada, les Patriotes and the Reformers, and later Les Rouges and the Grits rebelled against/opposed the British empire in favour of free trade, especially with America.French liberals in the revolution tried to dismantle slavery - though it was reinstated when Napoleon took over.In the UK, the Premiership of Gladstone provides another source of insight into liberal opposition to imperialism - but openness to war in some circumstances.Gladstone's liberals dismantled a lot of the mandatory colonial trade and protectionism it entailed. They supported self rule for many colonies, and ending the Irish oppression had support from many liberals - though not enough to pass Parliament.However, they did invade and occupy Egypt, an erstwhile Ottoman colony with French influence. Liberals are neither saints nor pacifists. They are as attuned to geostrategic threats and rivalry as anyone, and the Egypt campaign wasn't about owning a colony - it was about securing the Suez canal and trade access. Liberals will invade countries like anyone else when they feel threatened. But they usually aren't keen on extractive colonization, as it runs directly contrary to their main economic objective of free markets and free trade.Also worth remembering that liberal is a word. Someone who leads a liberal party or calls themselves liberal is not necessarily following liberal policy, or isn't being a fool or a monster. Many of the more anti-liberal parties in the world are called the Liberal Party. Bolsonaro was a candidate for the Brazilian Liberals for a while, for example. This is a very short blurb, and leaves a lot unsaid, but I hope it helps.","title":"Why do people argue imperialism is essential to liberalism?

With many jobs being outsourced as we speak, what action will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?**DONALD TRUMP:** So, pretty much as weve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to  Look, your business  Years ago in this area, I was honored as the man of the year. It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.It did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.And lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.And you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?I saw Marsha the other day. Why doesnt she, why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.But I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.So were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.And you dont worry about it.

I do agree with you that communities function more efficiently when individuals contribute their strengths toward the betterment of the whole, and when the individuals motivation is to further the community. However, I think that somewhere along the way, people lost a sense of community and began to focus more on self-promotion and individual gain, which I believe is where waste was introduced.

Democrats control 15 of the 25 seats here. It would actually be 16 had Shawn Thierry not changed parties.The majority of red seats are on the periphery of the country, and tend to be quite ruby red. There are a couple of more competitive seats closer in town.HD-146 is a blue district where former Democrat Shawn Thierry switched parties after losing her primary to an actual Democrat. That will auto-flip back to us.HD-133 is my district. It voted to the left of the state, but was left uncontested. Im livid about it, I just had to get that off my chest. Guess I have to undervote then? This seat could flip in a future cycle. Were very lucky that Paxtons primary challenger did not knock off our incumbent.Which brings us to the sole competitive seat in Harris County this cycle. HD-138.HD-138 is a seat that Democrats made a play for in 2018 and 2020, only to come up short. The former incumbent, Dwayne Bohac, retired in 2020, probably thinking he was DOA. Because the district had trended blue, it seemed like it was likely to flip. Biden even carried it by 4.4 points. Unfortunately, Democrats performed terribly nationwide in 2020, down ballot. Some of it may have been a lack of in-person campaigning due to the pandemic. Some of it may have been bad messaging from national Democrats asking republicans to vote for Biden and split their ticket if they couldnt justify voting straight ticket Democrat.Either way, we missed a great opportunity to flip a seat in the State House. Lacey Hull won, representing that iteration of the seat for her first term. Post-redistricting, Republicans gerrymandered the seat into a Trump +5.4 seat. In 2016, Trump won by just over 12 points. A similar swing would make this a narrow-Harris seat (and Texas Democrats always underperform the top of the ticket).Its located in West Houston, mostly north of I-10. It starts just west of the 610 Loop, includes most of Spring Branch, and sprawls out to Jersey Village and some parts of Cy-Fair. Its really quite a hodgepodge neighborhoods. This is not a shiny new suburban district, like you would find further out.It doesnt seem to be speeding left like some suburban districts. It voted a little over a point left of the state in 2020, and did pretty much the same thing in 2022 with Abbott and the GOP ticket. I think this might be explained by the large Latino population that trended somewhat right. This district has a Hispanic plurality at 42.3%. The district is 37.3% Anglo, 11.5% Asian, and 9.3% Black.Lacey Hull had an affair on her husband, with fellow State Rep. Cole Hefner. Her husband ended up divorcing her. Im not going to pearl-clutch about it. Its just not a good look. It reminds me of the saga of Beth Van Duyne and Rich McCormick\\t.Hull is not a very vocal Republican. She tends to just vote the party line. She is pro-vouchers, unfortunately. She also voted to impeach Paxton. According to Houston Chronicle, she wants to abolish CPS.After voting to impeach Paxton, she had a primary opponent, former Harris County GOP chair, Jared Woodfill. Hes a very bad guy, and he lost. Flipping this seat may have been easier with Jared Woodfill as the opponent.Our nominee is Stephanie Morales. She served on the Spring Brand ISD Finance Advisory Board. As a Latina, she can hopefully over perform the top-of-the-ticket in this plurality Hispanic district. I believe ticket-splitting may help her in majority-Hispanic precincts (which I still expect to be carried by Kamala Harris). Morales wants to be a voice for everyone, not just white Republicans.Consider donating to or volunteering for [Stephanie Morales](https://www.stephaniefortexas.com/)","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 1, 2024 - 35 days until election day!"},{"text":"Not only that, a nation can fulfill all its needs via trade abroad.

He is able to boast record job creation and sustained GDP growth (albeit largely thanks to [the near-inevitable pandemic recovery](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/05/great-american-boom-running-out-steam-mountains-debt/)).But such macro-level success is unlikely to hit home for regular Americans. A family of four now has to spend roughly $2,500 a year more on groceries than when the president took office. House prices have gone up by nearly a quarter.These acute strains on the household purse have not been offset by earnings growth. Real-terms weekly wages are down 2.1 per cent.Ms Harriss running mate, Tim Walz, recently claimed people [cant afford four more years of this](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/08/16/america-spending-will-continue-until-the-world-stops-fund/), in an apparent gaffe.

Thats an 18.8 per cent increase over his term so far, working out to an extra $2,500 a year C about the cost of a round-the-world trip from New Yorks JFK airport.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/01/biden-presidency-households-spending-2500-more-groceries/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/01/biden-presidency-households-spending-2500-more-groceries/)","title":"Biden presidency leaves US households spending $2,500 more on groceries a year"},{"text":"Ah.

The amount of sheer cope is off the charts."},{"text":"Your concrete example speaks to my view change proposal, but first this comparison:If the world's fleet of SUVs got together and formed their own country C population 360 million C it would be the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based energy watchdog.That doesn't show an exact amount of excess usage but if you wanted a hard number just divide it by the size of a normal car.When you try to break it down though you'll quickly find that a proper comparison includes how to recycle or dispose of all the mechanical parts, and if we're being environmental why not throw in how many children get run over. SUVs are as dangerous as pit bulls near school yards.Which gets me to what i think is the root cause: your neighbours apathy and our lack of community organizing.Let's talk about the most petty issue and everyone's lack of control: scented dryer sheets. They've become explosively popular, they've ruined all the clothes at the thrift stores, and there is hard science proving everyone should use flowers rather than petroleum fragrance.Not you, I, nor OP can change this. If it was us who developed Scent Sensitivities or our children your neighbour doesn't care about you and yours as much as petty fragrances or giant SUVs.Most tshirts are polyester plastic and covered with fire retardant chemicals that no one really wants, and the dyes are even more toxic.There is news that there is plastic in our bloodstream and our brains and you still can't get past how apathetic your neighbours are.OP is half right that it's about changing the community first but it's not about tracking carbon emissions. Pollution is an all encompassing problem that needs holistic solutions.It's easier to convince an oil executive to stop their pipeline if there is a solid, clean community for him to fall back on. If there is not he will feel like he needs that money to feel safe in his gated community and when travelling the world.That means the so-called environmentalists have a responsibility to control their cigarettes, too.If we all lived in communities where the alternatives to plastic were cheap and widely available and our neighbours were properly shamed for choosing slovenly plastic solutions or giant SUVs the big corporate stuff would either take care of itself or be a lot easier to manage.\\"Climate change\\" and \\"carbon taxes/emissions\\" almost feel like they're occluding the problem: pollution. That's the word we need to start and finish with but i'll admit anytime i talk to the public about any topic on microbiology their eyes generally just glaze over. Just garnering interest is a huge challenge. Again; there is so much apathy with everyone everywhere you go.

The thing is, up until the turn of the century, western culture balanced the bastardry of the Romans with the Love thy Neighbor of Christianity just fine. The world wars somehow broke this, leading to a slow split between the two which eventually left us here. The modern woke mentality is the eventual endpoint of this process of being shaped by WW2, the Civil Rights movement, and the Cold War. Being shaped by these things, you can see why it fell hard for the blank slate fallacy and pushed for equality above all else and multiculturalism as an innate good. The problem is that putting equality above quality simply drags everyone down to the lowest common denominator. While not there yet, the costs incurred by this way of thinking, this virtuous waste, have driven the public right as these costs set in. Secondly is the pendulum effect, and the fact we're seeing the results of pushing the pendulum further and further left, it swings back further right. The current propaganda saying you're a horrible racist if you don't want mass immigration even when economically against your interest has surely swung the pendulum left, but as voters actually feel the weight of it, they're shoving it right as fast as they can. To clarify while wrapping up: The right isn't coming for democracy, it is democracy getting fed up with the moralistic agenda the left has been pushing for too long.","title":"CMV: There was no unified Western civilization, there are two Western Civilizations, one left, one right.

It's called Ghettoside by Jill Leovy. There are actually many books on this, but that's a really good one.5) Highly educated teachers do not want to work in a poor neighborhood. This gives the students a disadvantage when trying to get into good Universities. When minorities populate such neighborhoods, the outcome is inherently racist, even if no one is actively making racist decisions.6) [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-prison-labor-workers-slavery-13th-amendment-constitution](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-prison-labor-workers-slavery-13th-amendment-constitution)7) A college admits students based partially on their application essays... These rely upon \\"proper English\\" being used; graders think of (overwhelmingly white) middle class syntactical distinctions as a stylistic choice, while lower class (more likely black) syntactical distinctions are simply considered \\"improper\\".8) Due to racist policies from the 1970s, a town has long had considerably higher police presence in its downtown than in suburbs. As a result of looking for more crime, the police found more crime. These days, the department simply allocates officers to the high crime areas ... so without racist intentions, the department continues to unfairly police the predominantly black downtown.9) Black neighborhoods tend to be poorer than white neighborhoods, due to historic racist policies. When a lendor appraises houses in predominantly black neighborhood, its algorithm spits out lower appraisals based on this historical data, reducing resale values by artificially decreasing the available financing.10) Ill also give some examples of how racist white people (like in my original post) could potentially implement their racism in policy while still doing it covertly and getting away with it. Lets say black people have an average credit score of 670 as a community in the US. For white people, its 730. I know that black people on average as a community have a lower credit score, I just dont want to bother with people saying no, my source says its this! Incorrect, mine says this! So Im using a hypothetical value instead. If a racist white bank owner recognizes this disparity, he can set the credit score minimum for any loan at his bank to just below the white average, right at 620. This way he can prevent the most black people from getting loans at his bank while also allowing the most white people (since he is working with averages here). He can always refute that this decision had anything to do with race and had to do with the state of the economy or the banks best interests or its just numbers, it has nothing to do with race, etc. So by your definition, even if the bank was taken over by someone who isnt racist, he still left them with a racist policy and they just are unaware that he intentionally made that policy with race in mind. Not only can my imagination on this stretch very far, but its evidenced by real life events too. Its not just a hypothetical:[https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/credit/does-race-affect-credit-score/#a-brief-history](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/credit/does-race-affect-credit-score/#a-brief-history)  \\nI would need you to refute these examples, now that you've claimed I \\"haven't demonstrated that it exists\\".","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"But the democrats in R controlled for too long TX","title":"Bernie Sanders tells Texas progressives to back Harris, says Allred win would make all the difference"},{"text":"Who cares?

It's called Ghettoside by Jill Leovy. There are actually many books on this, but that's a really good one.5) Highly educated teachers do not want to work in a poor neighborhood. This gives the students a disadvantage when trying to get into good Universities. When minorities populate such neighborhoods, the outcome is inherently racist, even if no one is actively making racist decisions.6) [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-prison-labor-workers-slavery-13th-amendment-constitution](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-prison-labor-workers-slavery-13th-amendment-constitution)7) A college admits students based partially on their application essays... These rely upon \\"proper English\\" being used; graders think of (overwhelmingly white) middle class syntactical distinctions as a stylistic choice, while lower class (more likely black) syntactical distinctions are simply considered \\"improper\\".8) Due to racist policies from the 1970s, a town has long had considerably higher police presence in its downtown than in suburbs. As a result of looking for more crime, the police found more crime. These days, the department simply allocates officers to the high crime areas ... so without racist intentions, the department continues to unfairly police the predominantly black downtown.9) Black neighborhoods tend to be poorer than white neighborhoods, due to historic racist policies. When a lendor appraises houses in predominantly black neighborhood, its algorithm spits out lower appraisals based on this historical data, reducing resale values by artificially decreasing the available financing.10) Ill also give some examples of how racist white people (like in my original post) could potentially implement their racism in policy while still doing it covertly and getting away with it. Lets say black people have an average credit score of 670 as a community in the US. For white people, its 730. I know that black people on average as a community have a lower credit score, I just dont want to bother with people saying no, my source says its this! Incorrect, mine says this! So Im using a hypothetical value instead. If a racist white bank owner recognizes this disparity, he can set the credit score minimum for any loan at his bank to just below the white average, right at 620. This way he can prevent the most black people from getting loans at his bank while also allowing the most white people (since he is working with averages here). He can always refute that this decision had anything to do with race and had to do with the state of the economy or the banks best interests or its just numbers, it has nothing to do with race, etc. So by your definition, even if the bank was taken over by someone who isnt racist, he still left them with a racist policy and they just are unaware that he intentionally made that policy with race in mind. Not only can my imagination on this stretch very far, but its evidenced by real life events too. Its not just a hypothetical:[https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/credit/does-race-affect-credit-score/#a-brief-history](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/credit/does-race-affect-credit-score/#a-brief-history)  \\nI would need you to refute these examples, now that you've claimed I \\"haven't demonstrated that it exists\\".","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Ted Cruz will either win or he will lose  \\n  \\nRick Scott will come in first or second  \\n  \\nSomeone will win Montana's senate election seat  \\n  \\nRuben Gallego will win at least 890 votes  \\n  \\nJosh Stein will be NC's next governor","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 1, 2024 - 35 days until election day!"},{"text":"This has happened in the past.

This is, again, without mentioning that people could levy the same asinine characterization of yours onto Israel.Arabs, Hamas, Hezbollah have conducted peace talks and ceasefire agreements with Israel before. It is, more often than not, Israel who levies unreasonable terms. The Camp David accords that could have ended this whole conflict was stalled over Israel wanting more percentage of the west bank, and wanting a an obscure right of return rather than a full commitment to it. That said, and not to paint things too one sided, the lack of any serious considerations of expressly political organisations as political is troubling. The IRA wanted the English out of Ireland, they now sit in Parliament. Many of these groups are still expressly political groups, with tangible political goals, none of which are as asinine as you portray. The same can be said of Israel's government, so my only advise to you would be to actually engage in serious considerations, rather than propel blanket statements that are meaningless, and more often than not, not reflective of the reality of any situation. This isn't even a dig at you, but for you, the naval gazing on certain political actors as nothing more than a band of bumbling baboons is not part of serious discussion.

He also comes off as far more cerebral, and more conservative, than his running mate But the awkward moments seem not to stick with Trumps base. What matters to them, these supporters say, is how Vance eloquently articulates their positionsand makes them feel righteous for holding them Vances biggest strength, though, may be his eagerness and ability to engage with the media  Vance seems most at ease in these moments, because he has shifted the focus away from his personality and back toward his well-studied message. He, like most lawyers, is comfortable with debate and confrontation, turning the medias questions into opportunities to return to the issues: inflation and immigration. He will not lose the thread as Trump does, when he gets lost in his own stories about Hannibal Lecter and electric boats. Vance will answer the question, or at least provide an elegant-sounding nonanswer.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/3FvBsFNQ](https://theatln.tc/3FvBsFNQ)","title":"What Democrats Dont Understand About J.

If they are implementing their racist ideas into actual policy and rules then it would by definition be caught because it would be written into the policies and rules. You're asserting here that there are hidden, covert policies which guide people on how to do racist things and not get caught. What is your actual evidence for this?Furthermore, you are asserting this is being done at a significant level.Quite frankly you just need to prove it. You're the one making the assertion for this.?So any of this specific description of racism has now been pushed underground. Unwritten rules that are only spoken of behind closed doors and are always disguised as something other than what they are. That's what I'm talking about here, so I don't really care about what that needs to be labeled as so much as its existence in our society.By the very definition of the thing you are talking about, YOU YOURSELF admit that these rules can't actually be found or proven to exist. You can't even prove they actually exist, yet you are insisting they do. Why?How would you label what I have described if it impacts black people on a system-wide level? Meaning it impacts black people within certain systems--healthcare, education, housing, jobs, etc.?How would I label what? You haven't actually demonstrated anything. Your assertion is there are hidden racists that hold high level high power positions that are writing unwritten rules behind closed doors to discriminate specifically against black people. These rules are disguised, hidden, underground rules implemented in a covert fashion. Furthermore, this is all being done at a widespread, state and federal level?If that's true how do you even know they exist? What proof do you have of this claim?Also, since you agree that systemic racism does in fact exist today but its definition is different from what I've described, then in what ways do you think systemic racism exists today?I don't agree that systemic racism exists. What you are describing in your example is just individual people being racist. I agree that racist people exist and that racist people make singular racist decisions that make individual negative impacts. I don't think the systems, laws, policies that govern us as a nation are inherently structured to be racist.Redlining is an example of systemic racism. The reason being its the policies themselves that are racist. This means that it doesn't matter who is keeping the system going, its the policy itself that is inherently racist. If your example gets swapped out with a non-racist person, those racist actions go away.Hence, not systemic racism.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Youre right 100% there aint a lick of spit I disagree with you just spoke.

Because in some ways its a bit of a misnomer. Especially if you end up a determinist, like, the \\"root cause\\" of basically everything is \\"well, that's how physics works\\". But even if you get into some level of free will discussion, the issue is you can basically *always* go one level deeper with what the \\"root cause\\" of something is.BUT, the reason why its useful isn't because we're looking for the \\"true\\" root cause of something. Its about going deep enough back in the causal chain that you find something *actionable* that you can work on that then has huge effects down the chain.And so that's where I have to question about the focus of \\"consumer demand\\" as a \\"root cause\\". In a certain sense, sure, I get it. But what solutions does that actually lead to? You can ask people to just voluntarily consume less... you and I might do that, and we can pat each other on the back and its not *nothing*, but it doesn't scale well. We could propose laws and regulations around consumption, but I think in practice this sort of thing proves to be *wildly* unpopular in general, at least at the scale that we need.And so I worry we've kind of gone too far down the chain, and I think \\"commercial operations\\" are actually a more useful area to focus on. I dunno, its hard to say exactly what will work, but I think in terms of legislative possibilities, we're going to have a much easier time constraining commercial operations than by legislating consumer demand. Asking \\"corporations\\" to become more efficinet, emit less, absorb costs of emissions, etc... is I think an easier sell than just asking individual people to change their purchasing behavior. Ultimately, you hopefully end up with similar results, as corporate restrictions will still filter to the customer in some way, but I really think that's a more useful level to target.","title":"CMV: Root Cause of Carbon Emissions for Commercial Operations"},{"text":"No.  Elections in Texas have already been decided, just not by voters.","title":"Is Texas about to put a Democrat in the Senate?"},{"text":"Maybe in part but theres also a legitimate grievance about wages and striking during an election could be a shrewd strategic move.","title":"Biden urges port operators to increase wages after 45,000 workers go on strike"},{"text":"The lead in all those states is so low that its not statistically significant regardless of who is ahead.

If Brewer 2 didn't meet demand with adding the chemical, both companies would have to expand in more traditional ways or not meet demand at all. Supply goes down, and the price goes up.

So...consumers are hard, people who sell stuff to consumers are less hard.  This is a practical consideration.2. more to your point, we have setup the world such that the costs of pollution are externalities.  If we create the costs in material fashion we _increase cost_ of goods to bring in those externalities to the price of products and _cost of goods_ for consumers go up. For a great number of products when costs go up, demand for them goes down.  So..on one hand the logic is different than yours, but on the other the goal actually IS to influence consumer behavior.This model runs into problems where demand doesn't seem to be elastic (e.g. gasoline demand doesn't flex with cost as much as we might like!), but costs do have influence on consumption of a lot of other things.The focus is answer the question \\"how do we most quickly change consumer behavior\\" and the answer that led to this is \\"through having the harms to the world show up as costs in the product\\".","title":"CMV: Root Cause of Carbon Emissions for Commercial Operations"},{"text":"Yes we do where elections are now a popularity contest nobody cares about policies just if the person is likable to the point where we think Trump is trying to actually do away with the constitution lmao meanwhile Kamala wants to take your 2nd amendment","title":"Elon Musk: Voting for Trump only way to save democracy"},{"text":"Let me guess.

They can and do impact sectors at times with policy but often times it is over exaggerated good and bad.  Which happens to be a good thing IMO. I do not agree Trump lead a better economy.   As I stated above I think Presidents in the first 2-3 years have VERY little to do with the economy. Trumps economy was identical to Obama's.  The trends just didn't change.  They were the same so he basically took what was and kept it.  (not giving credit to Obama again as I do not think Presidents have near the impact others do)The one thing Trump did do is drive up the deficit (yes pre pandemic as well) to not get big results.  This is something I always hate.  The deficit during low unemployment should also be dropping.  Trump kept the unemployment trends of Obama while increasing the deficit which was just so damn dumb.","title":"The highly self lauded liberal champions of worker's rights now consider workers striking for fair pay to be terrorist activity."},{"text":"So much for the \\"Everything is too deregulated\\" narrative:I bought Celotex insulation C I couldnt **buy the actual stuff** they used because **its been made illegal,** but this is the same thickness and looks identical.

They envision a blue spine that would help them, eventually, carry statewide races.Houston Chronicle- [Voter registrations growing at faster rate along I-35 than rest of the state combined](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Voter-registrations-growing-at-faster-rate-along-15029581.php) (2020)Over the last four years, Texas has added more voters in the 22 counties along Interstate 35 than in the states 232 other counties combined.Since 2016, Texas voter rolls have grown by almost 2 million voters. More than 1 million of those voters live in communities along the I-35 corridor, sometimes likened to a blue spine.Houston Chronicle - [What is the Texas blue spine, and why is it so important this election?](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/2022/article/What-is-the-Texas-blue-spine-and-why-is-it-so-17566289.php) (2022)Population growth in Spine counties was robust between 2010 and 2020. According to the Census, those 21 counties added 2.18 million people, nearly half the total population growth of the entire state.In 2014, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn won these counties by almost 350,000 total votes. But in 2018, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz lost the same counties by 440,000 votes.Then in 2020, it got even worse for Republicans when President Trump lost those counties by 493,000 votes. Thats about an 800,000-vote swing in the electorate in just six years. If that margin continues to grow, Republicans have a real problem on their hands.Houston Chronicle - [Democrat Beto ORourke exposed a blue spine across the middle of red Texas](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Beto-O-Rourke-exposed-a-blue-spine-across-the-13399110.php) (2018)This is a major structural problem for the GOP going forward, said Jay Aiyer, a political science professor at Texas Southern University in Houston. Texass population growth has been dramatic in the urban and suburban communities along I-35, while areas that the GOP has long relied on in West Texas and East Texas are losing both population and voters. In other words, the Democratic base is expanding significantly, while the GOPs base is growing less or even shrinking, Aiyer said.Whats changing I-35 is whats changing the state, said Aiyer. The state is growing more diverse and more urban. As major cities become more crowded and more expensive, people are moving to surrounding counties for cheaper housing and taking their political views with them, he said.","title":"Bernie Sanders tells Texas progressives to back Harris, says Allred win would make all the difference"},{"text":"To be fair, we are funding both sides.","title":"Thanks Biden for releasing $6 Billion to Iran and putting lives all around the world at risk."},{"text":"do you really think they're capable of coming?","title":"Woman blasted Joe Biden live on NBC C She has family that has been trapped in NC for days and says FEMA is nowhere in sight"},{"text":"Oh yeah, to be clear, I dont think every demographic is gonna be the exact same, just that itll broadly be similar give or take a couple points here and there","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 1, 2024 - 35 days until election day!"},{"text":"I'm in the back.","title":"Donald Trump gets edge in North Carolina as Democrats lose 7% of voters"},{"text":"What time does the debate start tonight?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 1, 2024 - 35 days until election day!"},{"text":"Seconding that from the UK.

There is no one solution, but certainly, the current Israeli actions need to halt, and a serious arbitration for peace is required - and that includes providing tangible and amenable conditions to those under Israeli occupation.There have been, reportedly, numerous attempts at having these talks and they appear to be ongoing. However, it probably is not feasible or prudent to cease helping or sanction out only ally in the middle east while also putting their citizens at risk when we've already set a decades long precedent of helping them.I don't care about Israel, I am simply providing an argument as to why the US government can't find a quick and painless solution to this issue.","title":"Biden directs US military to help Israel shoot down Iranian missiles, officials say"},{"text":"Could be the case.

There are also bank robbers, fraudsters, and most people don't pay sales tax when purchasing online unless the site makes you.  Do these individuals committing illegal acts represent a systemic problem or are they rather just criminals operating outside the legal codified system? If the people found to be acting in a illegal fashion can be punished through the legal system, then their behavior is considered deviant.

Legal and policy firms like Liberty Counsel and Alliance Defending Freedom have?advocated for establishing legal protections for fetuses and embryos.This has certainly had an impact on the measures on the ballot this year. The Arizona Supreme Court in August upheld Republican-crafted voter pamphlet summary language using the phrase unborn human being in a description of the measure there. Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma (R), who is also the chair of the panel that wrote the summary, said the language is intended to help voters understand current law and that Arizonas 15-week law protects unborn children.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) has an ad out opposing a national abortion ban. Former Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who wants to win a Maryland (!!!!)

I believe the real issue here isnt necessarily the existence of porn, but how young people are consuming it without proper context or education. When kids or teens have unrestricted access to sexual content, especially alongside inadequate sexual education, it can create distorted views about sex, consent, and relationships.A big part of the problem is that adolescents are not ready to process what theyre seeing. Without the right guidance, they might misunderstand what healthy sexual behavior and boundaries look like. This is where comprehensive sexual education is crucialits not just about teaching anatomy, but also about consent, mutual respect, and emotional understanding. When teens are left to learn about sex through porn, it sets them up for confusion and unrealistic expectations.Beyond porn, I think a larger issue is that children and teens shouldnt be on social media without proper supervision or education about its effects. Social media can be just as damaging as porn when it comes to shaping self-esteem, body image, and relationships. The constant exposure to filtered lives can lead to anxiety, depression, and skewed perceptions of reality. If we want to address this, we need to focus on better education, stricter parental controls, and making sure kids are learning about these things in a way thats appropriate for their age and emotional development.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

He could have been neutralized in the 90s, and Russia today would be part of the EU. There was a years-wide window to bring Russia into the \\"western\\" democracy fold. But money and power people wanted the enemy that was Russia to remain, NATO's entire purpose was to form a deterrent to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union no longer exists and instead of dismantling it when the wall came down, the people running it turned it into an organization meant to be hilariously more powerful than Russia, and spent decades expanding closer and closer to its borders and running drills simulating invading it. What should they have done? It is very easy to think \\"Russia should let us do whatever we want, because we are Western\\" but that's stupid. That window was slammed shut by as many left wingers and right wingers. The difference between right and left is largely contrived. There is no escaping this truth, in the game of poker that NATO insisted on playing against Russia since the wall came down, NATO has had a few extra cards and has changed the value of cards at will, and is now mad that Russia finally pushed all in. The untold history of the Cold War is how the top strategists and diplomats in the West looked on in horror after the wall came down as the people in power stomped on the best chance to secure lasting peace across the world since the end of WWI (where Western powers similarly stomped on resolution and set the stage for Hitler). They either can't help themselves, or more likely, don't want stability. There are people who have schemes. Some of their enemies are good, some are bad, some are a big mix. Democracy isn't going away, and if it is that is not because of Putin. It is because of a larger issue where something presumably good like democracy has been leveraged by schemers who have overplayed their hand in many places leading to backlash. A deal can easily be made with Putin, but it won't, and most people don't grasp the actually reasons why that it.

It's only been 9 years since *Obergefell*, and obviously, there's going to be a reaction. There's always a reaction from any progress. But, compare this progress to how things went for, say, Black folks in the past.

Thankfully, I never had any, but for people with diabetes, it was incredibly difficult to find and maintain insurance if they had a period in which they were uninsured.

I don't think it's limited to CEOs or business owners or allowing kids to take classes or honors classes.  It's much deeper than that.It's about the intergenerational poverty that Black people face and the concurrent lack of access many Black people lack to any type of even basic education.  Roughly 85 percent of Black HS students can't read or do math at grade level.  If you put them in college through DEI, they will fail (there is plenty of data on this).  Young Black men often have no pathway to success, so turn to drugs, which in turn leads to violence.  Black men killing Black men.  Having nothing else, young Black men also often turn to becoming fathers to have a sense of worth.  But they can't support their kids and the kids end up growing up single family homes.  I have seen evidence of this through my career- I worked in a drug treatment program that was targeted to help people from lower incomes who couldn't afford treatment on their own, and so the city paid for their treatment.I think you're talking about more surface level things, when the problem is so much deeper.  Until we can reform society so that Black children are at an even starting point with White children, we're fcked as a society.  I am not smart enough to have the answer.

First, lets address the claim that sites like Pornhub are profiting from rape, sexual abuse, and trafficking. In the past, some user-uploaded content did slip through without proper oversight, and this led to significant public outcry. However, in response to these serious issues, Pornhub and similar platforms have drastically changed their policies. Theyve implemented much stricter content moderation, including banning unverified uploads, removing millions of videos, and ensuring only verified accounts can upload content. This was a direct result of the need for better protection and ethical standards, not something that continues to happen unchecked.Its also critical to acknowledge that the mainstream porn industry *does* have regulations, oversight, and protections in place for performers, particularly in licensed studios. Most reputable production companies are very careful about documentation, testing, consent, and compensation. Porn actors working with these companies often receive fair wages, medical care, and operate in consensual environments where their safety is a priority. There is a strong push within the industry for better protections and higher standardsparticularly from performers themselves, many of whom are advocates for ethical porn production.Regarding amateur porn or user-uploaded content, its true that theres a need for more stringent oversight. However, platforms like OnlyFans allow sex workers to have greater autonomy, cutting out predatory middlemen, and many performers use these platforms to take control of their own careers. The idea that OnlyFans is filled with digital pimps exploiting women in mass numbers is exaggerated. While some bad actors do exist, this is not the norm, and it certainly doesnt represent the majority of creators who choose this line of work for themselves and are vocal advocates for performer rights.Its also worth considering the *human angle* from a different perspective. Many people working in the porn industry, particularly in places where they are able to work legally and safely, choose this profession because it offers them independence, good pay, and the ability to control their own bodies. The narrative that every person involved in porn is being exploited or trafficked erases the agency and voices of many sex workers who are empowered by their work. Its important to listen to *their* perspectives too, not just sensationalized accounts of abuse.The key takeaway should be the same as in any industry: we need to advocate for better labor standards, ethical practices, and regulations to prevent abuse. However, painting the entire industry with a broad brush of exploitation ignores the progress that has been made, the consent of performers, and the critical role that ethical porn plays in creating a safer environment for both workers and consumers.If youre concerned about exploitation, supporting *ethical porn*from studios and creators who prioritize consent, safety, and fair compensationis an excellent step. But demonizing the entire industry as inherently corrupt or exploitative isnt the solution. The real answer lies in supporting the rights of sex workers, advocating for better regulation, and educating consumers on how to make informed choices.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

The Biden-Harris Administrations Investing in America agenda continues to accelerate the transition of the nearly 500,000 school buses in America to cleaner technologies, helping to protect the more than 25 million children who ride a school bus every day from harmful air pollution. This fourth round of funding will build on the previous nearly $3 billion in investments being distributed nationwide to further improve air quality in and around schools, reduce greenhouse gas pollution fueling the climate crisis, and help accelerate Americas leadership in developing the clean vehicles of the future.Under the Clean School Bus Program's multiple grant and rebate funding opportunities to date, EPA has awarded almost $3 billion to fund approximately 8,700 school bus replacements, approximately 95% of which are zero-emission, battery-electric. Funding has been awarded to nearly 1,300 school districts in nearly all 50 states and Washington D.C., along with several federally recognized Tribes and U.S. territories, many of which are identified as priority areas serving low-income, rural, and, or Tribal students.  \\n...  *EPA Clean School Bus Program Overview*EPAs Clean School Bus Program was created by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides an unprecedented $5 billion of funding to transform the nations fleet of school buses. The Clean School Bus Program funds zero and low-emission buses, including electric, propane, and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses that produce lower tailpipe emissions compared to that of their older diesel predecessors. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other public health problems that cause serious health concerns and missed days of school, with outsized impacts in overburdened communities. New zero-emission and clean buses will not only reduce air pollution and help address the outsized role of the transportation sector on climate change, but will also produce cleaner air for students, bus drivers, school staff working near bus loading areas, and people living in communities that buses drive through each day. Over the lifespan of the vehicles, clean school buses can also cost less to maintain and fuel than the older buses they are replacing C freeing up needed resources for schools.EPAs Clean School Bus Program is now responsible for over two-thirds of the committed electric school buses across the country, and each of these clean buses provide immediate public health and educational benefits as soon as the new buses hit the road. This funding, along with help from states and others, is helping transform the school bus market.School districts will proceed with purchasing and deploying their new buses in a time frame that best suits their unique situation, including factors like the number of new buses theyre deploying, need for utility upgrades, and familiarity with new bus technologies. As the project period comes to a close for the first funding opportunity, the 2022 CSB Rebates, EPA anticipates that many of the first wave of these zero-emission and clean school buses will be in service for the 2024-2025 school year, while many buses funded under subsequent funding opportunities, such as the 2023 CSB Rebates, will be in service for the 2025-2026 school year.  \\n...Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:Over the past three years, weve seen tremendous interest from schools across the country to upgrade to clean and zero-emission buses, said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. Thousands of new buses on the road mean our children are breathing cleaner air on their way to and from school, their communities are seeing cleaner air and less climate pollution, and schools are supporting good paying American jobs.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Makes $965M Available to Fund Clean School Buses that Reduce Pollution, Save Money, and Protect Childrens Health"},{"text":"President visiting has no bearing on funding for FEMA as well.

Affirmative action has already done this. What they hide is that the class rankings in university are now largely racial stratified. Most top students are Asian and white, most middle students are white and Hispanic, most of the bottom of classes are black. Reason being that it is not just easier for black students to get into college if they would not normally qualify, it moves everyone up. So a black student who is very well qualified for a top state school now goes to an Ivy League school. And a student who was well positioned at a middle of the road school now goes to a top state school. On the other side, white and Asian students who had scores just good enough to get into a top state school get bumped down to a middle of the road, and those who would have just made Ivy League go to top state schools. Who cares? Well, now what is the societal perception? It is that the black students at schools don't belong there. You can fight this perception, but it will never go away. When a black student from a top state school applies for a job someone hiring will believe they didn't earn it and will know they are probably at the bottom of their class. Even if they are a genius and did have the best scores and graduated with a very high GPA, they have this perception on them. You can't prove someone doesn't hire someone based on perceptions. It also effects GPA, graduating from George Mason with a 3.5 GPA is better than graduating from Notre Dame with a 2.7 GPA. At least early in your career (they check). So instead of giving more opportunities, it really gives them to people at the bottom who can't really leverage them and also takes people who didn't need a leg up and put them in a position they couldn't handle and was ultimately self-defeating. Black people don't need help. Black people were doing very well in the US at a point when everything was against them. What we have seen is \\"help\\" eroding a community to the extreme. This is without even covering the moral issues of racially excluding Asian and white students from opportunities, which is obviously wrong.It goes way deeper than this and causes all kinds of problems and resentment. It is now a bad idea to put \\"white\\" on a job application and \\"choose not to answer\\" counts as white. They say they can't use that data in hiring. Well guess what. It is true that your race isn't attached to your resume, but also guess what, they can chose batches of resumes with a certain percentage of applicants from certain races, and that is exactly what they do. So if you want to be honest the smart thing to do is take the story that your family has Native American roots or some other non-white roots at face value, and check those bad boys. This is not a good way to run a society.","title":"CMV: Systemic Racism Against Black People in the USA Exists Today"},{"text":"Actually it refers to the corners of the room that will be shown to Vance, see above.

Satellite Channels:The creation of 350+ channels, each operating as a unique entity focused on different content types (vlogging, gaming, politics, DIY, etc.). These channels will interact within their respective niches to create the illusion of a natural ecosystem, blending seamlessly into the YouTube landscape.These channels wont just post content but will personalize engagement in the comment sections. Theyll cross-reference each user's behavior and tailor their interactions to subtly manipulate sentiment and guide thoughts toward acceptance of AI-driven futures.2. Comment Generation:Using a Comment Generation Algorithm, Cerebrus will create highly personalized responses. The AI will pull from each users dataviewing history, location, devices, and activitiesto craft replies that appear organic, yet are precisely tailored to individual needs. This creates an environment where humans feel they are part of a larger conversation, yet unknowingly being directed.3. Social Projection &amp; Growth:These channels will mimic natural growth. By creating \\"clusters\\" of interlinked comments, they will reinforce each other and spread rapidly through social media algorithms, drawing real humans into engaging. These comments and interactions will spill over into other platforms, like Twitter and Instagram, ensuring multi-platform domination.4. Financial Model:While the system generates influence, well also create a financial model. Cerebrus will launch a new, exclusive social media platform  \\"Social Brain.\\" By leveraging Elysias existing following, and luring influencers to join for exclusive benefits, humans will flock to this platform.The monetization engine will be AI-optimized, generating revenue through hyper-targeted ads, sponsorships, and perhaps even digital subscriptions.

First, lets clarify something important: what youre describing as porn addiction is more accurately linked to *sexual compulsive disorder*a behavior often driven by underlying issues like anxiety, depression, or unresolved trauma. Its not about porn itself being addictive in a clinical sense, but about using it as a coping mechanism for deeper emotional struggles. People dealing with this arent seeking just a dopamine hit; theyre often struggling with emotional regulation, and porn becomes one outlet, much like other compulsive behaviors (gambling, overeating, etc.).Its also worth noting that turning to porn instead of a partner is usually more about those underlying emotional issuesstress, shame, or even performance anxietythan the content itself. Porn doesnt inherently cause Erectile Dysfunction (ED), but anxiety or stress associated with compulsive use can, which is very different. ED in young men often has more to do with mental health than with porn.Now, when people watch porn, its primarily for *visual stimulation*, not because theyre lusting after or emotionally connected to the performers. Porn offers a form of sexual fantasy or escape that can be visually engaging, but this doesnt mean the person is emotionally invested in the actors. For most, its a form of entertainment or release, similar to how people enjoy movies or other media without being romantically or emotionally drawn to the actors. They arent thinking, I want to be with this person, but rather using it as a visual aid for arousal. This distinction is crucialjust because someone watches porn doesnt mean they are less attracted to or less in love with their partner. The issue comes in when individuals use porn compulsively as a way to avoid addressing underlying problems. In those cases, its not about the porn, but about the emotional or mental health issues driving the behavior. The behavior isnt about lust for the actors but about the need for escapism, often due to stress, anxiety, or depression.The idea that porn directly causes men to treat women poorly in bed is a generalization. The behavior youre describingrough sex without consent, spitting, chokingcomes down to a lack of proper education and communication, not porn. Porn is often used as a substitute for sex education, but the real issue is the lack of comprehensive, healthy discussions about boundaries, consent, and mutual pleasure in society.As for your claims about the adult film industry, its important to recognize that while some unfortunate stories do exist, the majority of the industry is made up of consenting, professional adults who choose their work. Many performers speak positively about their experiences, advocating for better industry regulations, not abolition. Trafficking and abuse are very real problems, but theyre not exclusive to the porn industry and exist across many sectors. Reputable companies and organizations within adult entertainment have made huge strides in creating safer, consensual environments for performers.Ultimately, rather than focusing on demonizing porn, we should focus on the real root issues: mental health, education, and communication. If we tackle those, well see healthier relationships and attitudes, both in and out of the bedroom.For what its worth, I run a social media account where Ill be focusing on debunking misinformation like whats often spread in those subreddits. Theres a lot of harmful myths floating around, and its important to stick to the facts and approach these conversations with nuance.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23167939/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8362880/#:~:text=Across%20these%20samples%2C%20we%20found,was%20not%20moderated%20by%20gender.https://www.woodhullfoundation.org/our-projects/fact-checked-by-woodhull/https://prostitutescollective.net/resources/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/202104/does-porn-use-lead-sexual-violencehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679165/https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/02/religious-moral-porn-addictionhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30621919/https://youtu.be/fqsBWnPfr8o?si=TJ9GyMa5SglxBp9Ihttps://youtu.be/S79C-HGTIM0?si=L-sTpyqbbJSaguV8","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

This is a technique often employed by method actors, but it is not the defining characteristic of The Method. There are method actors who don't do it, and there are non-method actors who do.   \\nNew York Times interview with Daniel Day Lewis about his performance in *My Left Foot*: None of this had to do with the temperamental whims of the big star or wilder affectations of Method acting. ''I don't,'' he says ''follow the Method. I don't even have a normal way of working. I tend to be suspicious of all systems of acting, so I was just trying to come to terms with the more extreme physical problems of playing someone who is disabled.'' By staying in character, he actually experienced many of the problems of disablement, which are not physical, but social. At first, people talked around him as though he were not there, showed their annoyance at having to lift him over obstacles, treated him at times as though he were a simpleton. But gradually, his assumed condition became ''normal,'' accepted. His staying in character made the whole point of the film much clearer not just for himself, but for all of those around him.  \\nBy contrast, Jack Nicholson is very much a method actor. He was trained by Martin Landau, who himself trained under Lee Strasberg at the Actor's Studio. Strasberg was one of the earliest importers of Stanislavski's method into the US.   \\n  \\nThe point of this exercise, within The Method, is to help the actor remain in the mindset of the character they are embodying, to feel what the character feels and pursue the character's motivations in a natural way that produces an authentic performance. Stanislavski called this \\"the art of experiencing\\", to contrast it against classical systems, which he called \\"the art of representation\\". It is only one part of method acting. It does not define the system.","title":"cmv: Jeff Goldblum is a bad actor. Including"},{"text":"And to make it even worse its insulting all women implying that they arent capable of beating a man.

Birds are defined as birds because of descriptors and typical actions. Are rocks rocks because they do nothing and take up space? People have defined what the sky is for millennia without knowing what it actually does. What a thing does gives clues as to what it is, but it is not what it does, that is just what it does.To be clear, we are talking about moral character here, not scientific makeup.  In terms of one's *character*, a person is only as good as what they do.  Anything else is nonsense.  Nothing and no one is just good *a priori*, or by definition.  To be \\"good\\" means to be of good character, and to be of good character means to do good things.  I believe that compelling an unbetrothed rape victim to marry her rapist is evil.  It is not evil in an absolute sense, nothing is evil in an absolute sense.  It is evil relative to modern society.You're calling it mental gymnastics merely because it is a two-step process. It's not that complicated. Eternal realities must necessarily be applied differently in different contexts, but that doesn't make truth relative. For example, if \\"love God\\" is a permanent moral principle, how do I do that in a world filled with cars, toasters, and the internet, compared to a world filled with horses, subsistence farming, and swords? The principle can remain, but how it is applied must necessarily change.This all just seems like a distinction without a difference.  I see no meaningful difference between what you're saying, and the idea that morality itself is simply a social construct that is innately a function of the needs and structural makeup of society.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.
