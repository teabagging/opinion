As [this poll](https://exhibitions.ushmm.org/americans-and-the-holocaust/topics/public-opinion) shows, most Americans were sympathetic to the plight of Jews in Europe, but most also didnt want any immigrants coming over. They also didnt want to get involvedWWI was still fresh in many peoples minds, and nobody was eager to send over another generation of young men to die in Europe. On the other hand, several big-name people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh were flaming antisemites; the US famously [turned away a boat load of Jewish refugees and forced them to return to Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis#:~:text=The%20memorial%20is%20a%20polished,issued%20on%20November%207%2C%202018), where many did not survive; the KKK was burning crosses on Jewish lawns; and then there was that one time they held a [literal Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/02/20/695941323/when-nazis-took-manhattan). When the US entered the European theater, it was done with the justification that it was a moral war, one of duty and responsibility and being The Good Guys? on a rescue mission. So all of a sudden, America had to start acting like the things Nazis do are, in fact, bad. And in order to be anti-Nazi, America had to be anti-expansionist, anti-racist, AND pro-Jewnone of which was/is possible without radically rethinking American national identity.Seems like a lot of Americans are still grappling with this concept today.TL;DRAmerica: Nazis are evil!Nazi Germany: We are literally copying youAmerica: oh god oh fuck oh my sweet Jesus Christ on the cross oh my god what do we doEdits 1&amp;2: formattingEdit 3: Holy shit how could I forget about the mutual idolization of the Roman Empire (which also *definitely* didnt have a problem with Jews lmao)","title":"Biden told allies that Netanyahu doesnt want to end fighting in Lebanon"},{"text":"She is still blaming voters for her loss.

The assumption a lack of innovation is always a problem. Granted in the way weve set up our global economy, with constant competition against rivals and a zero sum outcome yes it is. But arguably were all trapped in a race to the bottom. Were fucking the environment more and more to produce lifestyles that are making us unhappier. Perhaps we dont need to continuously innovate to make more social media apps/smart phones/cars in the grand scheme of things.2. A cut in foreign students is necessarily to blame for this. Assuming youre like the U.K. on this, its not necessarily beneficial to Australia to educate people who then leave and use that education to innovate in their own countries.Whilst I dont completely buy into the anti immigration rhetoric myself, I do understand their argument. By taking out the crutch of cheap labour and foreign money, we will force our institutions to treat our citizens better. Better schooling, better education, and ultimately a smarter home grown workforce. 3. Innovation is also a very general term. As more of a question, how are you defining this?

I dont think anyone is actually going to claim that James Bond copied DOOM because they have quite different identities, but maybe thats just subjective ultimately and I am not a lawyer Where as by contrast, as stated, its pretty clear that Palworld was *imitating with intent* Pokmons creature style and identity (the ball throwing) - regardless of whether you think thats great idea or a heinous offence, the point here is that it is true there was intent (as reinforced by the devs other work and obvious imitations scattered around). Most other Pokmon likes deliberately put their own ideas and aesthetics on top of the inspiration - e.g Cassette Beasts replaces the balls with the cassette recordings. Note how Nintendo has not nuked any of them.So similarly, it shouldve been easy for Palworld to just make their stuff a bit more different and call it a day. But they didnt. They chose, intentionally, not to. - And if it wouldnt have been as popular if they didnt is the gut response to that, you thereby likely see why Nintendo sees a right to take action, because its leveraging another owners concepts for their gain.As you say, Palworld and Pokmon are mechanically different in core gameplay just as the Ark comparison is always drawn. And its not those mechanics theyre attacking on, if they had made a creature collector survival game that was more distinct from Pokmon, there wouldnt have been a legal case to be made and they couldve called it a day.Fans want it is also irrelevant to a debate about the facts of the matter. Lets say the inverse scenario true, and Pokmon was found to have infringed on something the little guy Palworld had done for its gain, Nintendo would likely be highly villainised for the same thing because theyre not the underdog in this equation. Would fans want it be a valid excuse for that scenario also? I dont think so.","title":"CMV: Nintendo's patent lawsuit against PocketPair (developer of Palworld) proves that patents are a net detrimental to human creativity."},{"text":"Netanyahu has had a chokehold on Likud since the 90s.

An example of this beyond Pokmon is the game has basically straight up Evergaols from Elden Ring, or the devs previous game obviously going after BotW.So its not oh theres a successful monster catcher thats the issue, otherwise why wouldnt Nintendo have gone after say Persona (as an SMT subset) because no one is actually mad about that - attempts to waive it away like that are misleading.

Like the idea of a phone lockscreen that looks like a deadbolt.

There is also the entire sales and talking to the customers process which maybe I could do better but patents prevent me from doing that. It is completely possible that I am better suited to having the product and could develop it much better but as the other person first patented it they have the rights to it for the duration of the patent. The advantage is that the people have more of an financial incentive to create new products with the protection of patents. If I come up with some idea and a big company could just copy it and do the execution much better then there is no incentive for me to try to come up with ideas and go through a lot of R&amp;D generally speaking.

Perhaps there's a patent on a new way to make insulin? Because I don't think it's possible to patent insulin itself.But in general, this is the exact point of patents, to secure to inventors an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited time. This is intended so that they can charge more than just the profitability of producing their their inventions, but also to recoup the expenses they laid out in inventing the thing in the first place, plus some profits for inventing the thing. The US constitution presumes that this will promote the useful arts, ostensibly by giving a financial incentive for inventing things, but making it for a limited time so that others can use it later. The downside to the inventor is that, to secure a patent, he has to tell everyone how his invention works. Without patents, an inventor can just sell their product and hope nobody ever figures it out, and if they don't, nobody can force them to divulge it. So there's risk and tears on either side.If you're only going to give one example like pal world, then I think it's more likely that a particular patent, or set of patents, was improperly granted, and my understanding is that the court can so rule even when the patent holder brings suit.To show that the entire system fails to meet its goal of promoting the useful arts, you'd have to show a pattern not only of a patent holder suing people, but also that the patent wasn't actually anything new, and that the courts upheld the patent against the alleged infringers. You haven't shown any of these here.If you'd like to see a counterexample of how patent laws weren't long or strong enough, check out Philo Farnsworth and the television.","title":"CMV: Nintendo's patent lawsuit against PocketPair (developer of Palworld) proves that patents are a net detrimental to human creativity."},{"text":"Rational expectations dont apply in my brain?Me before the date: what if shes dumb.

Mr. President, on this celebration of the fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations, I should like to start with the words of someone who was present at its creation, Winston Churchill. In his Fulton speech in 1946 he said: We must make sure that the United Nations work is fruitful, that it is a reality and not a sham, that it is a force for action, and not merely a frothing of words, that it is a true temple of peace in which the shields of many nations can some day be hung, and not merely a cockpit in the Tower of Babel . And so, Mr. President, it is about the work of the United Nation that I shall speakThe United Nations' work has been fruitful over those 40 years. It has acted as a court of world opinion. And now no Government can afford to neglect or ignore its views.The Security Council has given us a forum for managing both the unexpected crisis and the stubborn problem.The General Assembly provides a setting where the voice of any member country, however small, can be heard. In Perez de Cuellarthe Secretary General we have an impartial and skilled negotiator in whom we have total confidence and trust.The United Nations has also shown that it is a force for action. It can help to keep the peace in three vital ways.First, setting the stage for negotiation, as it did with the famous Resolution 242 on the Middle East.Second by acting as the catalyst which persuades those in dispute to prefer negotiation to confrontationAnd third by pursuing its peace-keeping role. Had it not been for the blue helmets and blue berets of the United Nationsguided by a great British servant of the United Nations, Brian Urquhartlocal conflicts would have spread, and the toll of death and the flood of homeless would have been even greater. But there are those, Mr. President, who refuse to make their fair contribution to these vital peace-keeping operations. I believe they are failing in their duty to the United Nations, to mankind and to peace. It's about time they felt guilty that they leave others to bear an unfair share of the burden.I pay tribute to those specialised agencies, which have concentrated on their appointed task: for instance eliminating disease, caring for the needs of children, feeding and sheltering refugees. They and the men and women who serve them, deserve all our thanks.In these ways the United Nations has shown that it is a reality not a sham; it is a force for action not a mere frothing of words; it is a temple of peace not just a Tower of Babel.For all its dangers, our world is safer and more orderly thanks to the United Nations.Mr. President, it would be easy on this Anniversary simply to praise and to express support. But if we really mind about the United Nationsand I am one of those who dothen we must make it more effective by recognising its shortcomings and putting them rightWhy Mr President do we hear cynical assertions that the United Nations has ceased to be relevant that all it does is pass resolutions that disputes brought before it are prolonged not resolved that collective action by such a disparate body of nations will of necessity always be weak and ineffective.The answer is two-fold.Wishful thinking has led some people to believe that the United Nations was intended to be a kind of World Government! \\nIt may be a kind of Parliament of the world but it is not, and never can be, a Government of the world.Its structure limits what it can do.Secondly, when we ask about shortcomings we should start by looking at ourselves.The United Nations is only a mirror held up to our own uneven, untidy and divided world. If we do not like what we see there's no point in cursing the mirror, we had better start by reforming ourselves.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They walked so you could run","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I can answer that.

JFK of course had the assistance of speech writers, but he wrote much of this himself. I still listen to it on Youtube a few times each year, just to remind myself what it means to be an American.Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time, and I am confident that the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high measure of public service and public support.\\"There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university,\\" wrote John Masefield in his tribute to English universities--and his words are equally true today. He did not refer to spires and towers, to campus greens and ivied walls. He admired the splendid beauty of the university, he said, because it was \\"a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see.\\"I have, therefore, chosen this time and this place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived--yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace.What kind of peace do I mean? What kind of peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children--not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women--not merely peace in our time but peace for all time.I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn.Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy and never create--is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace.I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war--and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task.Some say that it is useless to speak of world peace or world law or world disarmament--and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we can help them do it. But I also believe that we must reexamine our own attitude--as individuals and as a Nation--for our attitude is as essential as theirs. And every graduate of this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet Union, toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home.First: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable--that mankind is doomed--that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.We need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable--and we believe they can do it again.I am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of peace and good will of which some fantasies and fanatics dream. I do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making that our only and immediate goal.Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace-- based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions--on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to this peace--no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each new generation. For peace is a process--a way of solving problems.With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it.Second: Let us reexamine our attitude toward the Soviet Union. It is discouraging to think that their leaders may actually believe what their propagandists write. It is discouraging to read a recent authoritative Soviet text on Military Strategy and find, on page after page, wholly baseless and incredible claims--such as the allegation that \\"American imperialist circles are preparing to unleash different types of wars . . . that there is a very real threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American imperialists against the Soviet Union . . . [and that] the political aims of the American imperialists are to enslave economically and politically the European and other capitalist countries . . . [and] to achieve world domination . . . by means of aggressive wars.\\"Truly, as it was written long ago: \\"The wicked flee when no man pursueth.\\" Yet it is sad to read these Soviet statements--to realize the extent of the gulf between us. But it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements--in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage.Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war. Almost unique among the major world powers, we have never been at war with each other. And no nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union suffered in the course of the Second World War. At least 20 million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and farms were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's territory, including nearly two thirds of its industrial base, was turned into a wasteland--a loss equivalent to the devastation of this country east of Chicago.Today, should total war ever break out again--no matter how--our two countries would become the primary targets. It is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first 24 hours. And even in the cold war, which brings burdens and dangers to so many nations, including this Nation's closest allies--our two countries bear the heaviest burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combating ignorance, poverty, and disease. We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counterweapons.In short, both the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race. Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet Union as well as ours--and even the most hostile nations can be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own interest.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"There's no concrete details available publicly","title":"CMV: Nintendo's patent lawsuit against PocketPair (developer of Palworld) proves that patents are a net detrimental to human creativity."},{"text":"They had 12/16 last years and are still blaming all their problems on gop :D","title":"Kamala Harris, current vice president of the United States: We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don't work.\\""},{"text":"Rootin tootin dead and shootin","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Wait, Boris Johnson talking about invading the Netherlands wasnt a neoliberal shitpost?

In order to \\"get Trump\\", where he has been Public Enemy No#1 non stop for basically the past decade ( How is that even possible?), the core of the establishment Democrats, Obama, Harris, Pelosi, Biden, Schumer, Jeffries and a cabal of the corporate donor class had to 1) Destroy the FBI. When the GOP eventually regains power at some point, the FBI is going to be crushed or dismantled2) Destroy the legacy corporate media. Their \\"audience capture\\" has cratered. No one believes what they say anymore, except the very hard left, and there will be no recovery from it3) Destroyed the existing powerful American teachers unions. Now they have a huge target on their back. I don't think the GOP was invested in reforming education, but now they will4) Enraged poor white rural Christian America. Now they are a consistent powerful voting block. Their potential to change elections is staggering. There's a reason the cooked MSM keeps screaming about the threat of \\"white people\\" and shouting endlessly about racism. 5) Lost a staggering number of working class minority voters for good. Why would Asian Americans be so invested in voting Blue anymore? How about young Black America? Jill Biden called the Hispanic/Latino base a bunch of breakfast tacos. I kid you not, she did it. Those working class minority voters were hit the hardest by the lockdowns. It was their kids locked out of public schools, some for up to two years, and had the least amount of options and means to find alternatives. It's their lives at stake as cost and inflation explode, where things like groceries, gasoline, rent, insurance, etc, etc is driving them to the brink. 6) Lost a large cross section of the Jewish vote for good. Now the Jewish community realizes they are no longer welcome as part of the DNC's \\"intersectional coalition\\". They were useful until they were not. Now people tragically have to learn the hard way. 7) Lost a large cross section of suburban women voters for good. Try convincing a soccer mom anywhere how it's OK to put a guy with a penis in the same bathroom as their middle school aged daughters. Or to share a lockerroom. Or to play a contact sport against their daughters. And it's those soccer moms who are buying the groceries and filling up their gas tanks and workout out many family budgets. They see the financial wreckage that the DNC and Obama have inflicted on them every week. 8) What about all the small business owners, many minorities, who were abandoned during the rioting, burning and looting of 2020? The military vote? The law enforcement vote after being demonized and \\"Defund The Police\\"? How about the Libertarians who are still enraged about the vaccine mandates? I don't think Blue elected officials, especial the core establishment ones who are serfs to their corporate donor overlords are afraid of a Trump reelection. I just think they are desperate and have nothing else. Once you take away \\"Trump Evil\\" off the table, what policy wins exist for working class America? Functionally every last policy decision and Executive Order for nearly the past four years has been an open declaration of war on the American working class. Everyday people. Just trying to survive and feed their children. What we are seeing is desperation. The hard left keeps shooting themselves in the foot over and over again to get some marginal new jabs and attacks at Trump. I mean the Democrats might lose New York over this. We can't even be sure what will happen in Chicago, because working class minorities there, actual citizens, are furious. Here's the crazy part of it all. Personally I think Trump is a moron. I find him totally exhausting. I'd say 15 percent of the time, he doesn't help himself and only eggs on chaos that makes his situation worse. And about 85 percent of the time is non stop persecution, lawfare and TDS. Why self inflict this much damage over one person? The simple answer to stop Trump was for the hard left to just ignore him. He generated nearly 3 billion in unpaid media coverage in 2015 to get to POTUS the first time. So for idiots like Alvin Bragg, Tish James, Fani Willis, Adam Schiff and others, going after Trump is a desire to raise their own profile and standing, to help their \\"careers\\". But , in aggregate, it only creates the roadwork to put Trump back in power. A lot of leftist are in this stupid co-dependent circle of destruction with Donald Trump. If you think he's such a loser, then why sacrifice nearly everything to fail at stopping him. How pathetic is that? For basically a decade, throwing everything at him, and they still can't stop him. There's a common saying to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder - \\"I hate you for not leaving me\\"  That perfectly explains TDS at it's core. They hate Trump, but they wouldn't know what to do without him around to try to batter and beat down. This is the greatest troll job ever in recorded human history. If it wasn't so brutal to actual working class Americans, I might even laugh at it all. You couldn't get Hollywood writers to come up with a sitcom as ridiculous as this has all become. \\"They\\" hate Trump for not leaving them. And are willing to burn down this Republic over it.

A bully starts bullying, and someone steps in to stop the bully. All well and good, but then the person who stepped up starts wildly flailing about and causes harm to innocent bystanders. Well now, thats just careless isnt it? When it comes to peoples safety, nay, mortality, one should never be careless. Its one thing to commit yourself to a cause to stop terrorists, but its different when a leader of a nation uses it as a front to stay in power, while endangering innocents. This is why there needs to be a ceasefire. There are better ways to handle this, and you cannot rationally reach such a conclusion when your first instinct is to kill, no questions asked.

You cannot afford to ignore a third of the electorate completely.Also as a point of reference, the white working class vote makes up the majority of the electorate in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and straight-white men make up upwards of 40% of the electorate in the states that the democrats desperately need to win this time around.

Harris needs to drive home the point that he, in fact, wasn't \\"better for the economy\\"- Trump inherited a growing economy. All he had to do was ride those coattails, but as soon as a real crisis emergedthe covid pandemiche mismanaged it at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee an economic recovery. Republicans exploited both opportunities to point fingers, to escalate their culture wars, to blame and vilify their enemies, and take advantage of a crisis for the sake of political gain and campaign talking points.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge. This only worsened inflationary issues. All of these things did.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.Now, to elaborate more on that last part: Most economists agree that tariffs are not beneficial, do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency. To put it simply, it hurt Americans BIGLY. And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and a process that Trump couldn't be bothered with. It should involve complex negotiations and considerations that Trump doesn't have the mental capacity, the intellect nor the desire to work towards Trump's tariffs have and will generate world wide economic tensions, raise prices, stifle innovation and make domestic industries less efficient.Ironically, his tariffs will also hurt rural communities more than they will Americans living in cities.Small businesses will face challenges of their own as well as they do not have the same power as larger businesses or industries to do something about these policies. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And this next part is important, because whenever Trump gets the opportunity, he criticizes Biden for \\"the trade deficit,\\" when in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.The trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesTrump is touted as an \\"economic genius\\" among his supporters, but he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth and his penchant for fraud. He's bankrupted or destroyed practically every business, product or service he's tried to slap his name on.Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of them including financial fraud, tax and state law violations, corrupt business practices and defamation suits.He has exploited his wealth and power throughout his life to game the justice system and avoid having to be held accountable for his crimes and his failures.Tax information also shows that over a period of time in the 80s and 90s, Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. He was literally the biggest loser.I remember Ivanka telling this story once where she describes her and her father encountering a homeless man on the streets of NYC. Trump pointed to the homeless man and said something to the effect of \\"he has more money than me.\\"Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Donald Trump is not some financial guru, his presidency's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire, an example of the luck and privilege that he's exploited all his life.Before The Apprentice, Trump had squandered his riches, and if it weren't for the luck of this reality TV show opportunity being dropped in his lap at just the right moment, he'd be known far and wide as the failure that he's always lived up to being.He is a self serving, narcissistic billionaire only interested in how he can govern for himself and improve his own net worth in the process, while his rich benefactors and beneficiaries come in a distant second.And when it comes to the labor movement, the next Trump administration, in conjunction with Republicans in power, will work towards weakening whatever is left of it, while not just preserving, but worsening the power imbalance between employers and employees.It's all part of a broader agenda to redistribute wealth to the top, an agenda that Republicans have been working towards for decades.Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"Kamala Harriss Campaign Thinks She Can Win on the Economy.

That record set to be broken again with the next inauguration whether it was Biden or Trump until Biden dropped out of the race. 87.1% of primary voters voted for Biden/Harris delegates, those delegates voted based on the commitment to the primary voters that elected them because its well understood that the votes were for Biden/Harris, not just Biden. If Biden and Harris had ran separate primary campaigns instead of on the same ticket, its clear Harris would have won that race based on the large increase in donations and volunteers since it became clear shed be the nominee. Eleven potential democrats felt strongly enough that Harris had the votes that they declined to run against her for the nomination. The debate removed any doubts people had about Harris moving to the top of the ticket. Republican primary voters are the only ones that got screwed over by not having choices this year.

It sucks that my presidential vote is basically useless, but I still think theres *some* benefit to having the states represented in the presidential election.Theres certain things that larger states, like NY or CA would try to ban that could be bad for OK citizens. Were a union of 50 states, after all, and each of those states deserves to not be drowned out by the larger, more populated states.But, the Electoral College needs to be reformed. For one, we need to get rid of the cap on the House of Representatives to allow better representation of the larger populated states, which would give more Electoral College power to those more populated states. But, to preserve some of the smaller states power, I think we should keep the winner take all part of the Electoral College for each states two senators.So, say OK has 7 Electoral College votes, 2 for the states senators, and 5 for the states representatives. Lets take the 2020 presidential election results; Trump got about 80% of the votes, and Biden got about 20%. With this reformed Electoral College, Trump, since he got a majority, would get the 2 votes for OKs 2 senators, and hed get 4 of OKs 5 votes for its representatives. Biden would get the remaining 1 vote from OKs representatives.Its probably not a perfect system, but I feel like its a good compromise to keep some of the smaller states power without allowing them to be governed by the larger states on the federal level.","title":"What stance should the Democratic Party take on the Electoral College"},{"text":"He not wrong.","title":"Biden, on The View, Calls Trump a Loser Who Lacks Redeeming Value"},{"text":"Hearsay and a photo, he did it!!!Least regarded ledditor","title":"Why do Liberals keep saying Laura Loomer is having an affair with Trump?"},{"text":"Diddy's room: 'Room of the Imagination'","title":"Barack Obama told ex, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination."},{"text":"Just enforce the law as it is written.","title":"JUST IN: ?

Anybody who plays the game that its propaganda for whatever team they root for is straight up pretending they dont live next to a concentration camp. You cant be for illegal immigration without explicitly condoning a true humanitarian atrocity in your own back yard.?Go ahead and pretend its a fairy tale if it makes you feel better, but reality marches on. The only result is suffering and exploitation. This is not how you solve problems. Its just as close as they can get to actual slavery in modern America. It hurts the immigrants, it hurts us, it makes sickos rich. Women and children are getting raped and killed for it, and any politician who downplays this or denies it is complicit. Its the opposite of xenophobia to give a crap that an underclass of vulnerable people are being chewed up and spit out. Violently.?Nancy Pelosi straight up said they needed to be imported to pick cotton - excuse me, grapes.?Ive seen people whine about Jane Austen and her describing slave-made cotton products in her books, but cheer on illegal immigration as they guzzle down some overpriced wine made by a modern day slave master. None of it is okay. I dont care how complicated anyone says it is. To me, incentivizing the most vulnerable people to come freeze on the streets because some winery needs the cheapest grape picker (until they get hurt, and tossed out the back door like trash) is unconscionable. The fact is, if they would just reform the system to make it legal (totally doable), the oppressive bastards would no longer desire it, because the appeal of illegal immigrants is that they are dirt cheap, easily replaceable, and dont have any education or resources to fight back when they are grossly exploited and abused.?I saw a Venezuelan guy on local news say that coming here was the worst mistake of his life, and that he could have been homeless and starving at home in nice weather, near his family. Who is this benefiting, again? Some imaginary family thats living the dream? Yeah, right. I have helped people come here and establish homes and businesses, and use chain immigration so their families could join them. They did it legally. They thrived because they had a solid plan, and support, and werent in legal no mans land. Why would you want immigrants to be in the worst possible position unless you saw them as nothing more than a cog in an economic machine? No one actually cares. Legal reform is possible.

But, in returning to the body, I see that I have been made a man, and physically in life, I choose to accept that contingency, he added.\\"          Can we discuss this statement? And I mean, really discuss it. I'm not asking for the protectors of the gays to come through, nor the homophobes, but it does strike me as interesting. I often play with this idea myself, as I am attracted to women (as a woman) but I think I more or less just accept that in this lifetime, I was born a woman and am probably best suited for the companionship of a man. . It doesn't cause me pain or strife, it's merely a mental thing, a belief, a perspective and I think it really is in the mind to a great deal, sexuality. Just like heterosexual women can sometimes be convinced of an attraction to women and then not, I believe the same can be said of homosexual or bisexual women... to me, it's about openness. If openness, as a trait, is in your big five in terms of personality, you could be convinced either way.... that it is fine to accept your sexuality as is or it is fine to play with it or change it or let go of fear regarding the other sex. Personally, once I became aware of my fear of men and began to move through it, my attraction to them sprang up again, like it was always there but repressed? Now, this isn't going to be everybody's case, it is mine, but I am curious about how openness affects not just sexuality but other facets of life. Because the above quote, to me, resonates in that Obama recognized perhaps an attraction to men but was willing to accept the best case scenario for his design as a man, which is, well, another woman. Anatomically, mentally, and emotionally I think it's hard to argue that the other sex does not hold the perhaps the greatest potential to balance out one's own energies. Anyway, I am rambling, but this quote really fascinates me and is staying with me.

And if someone offers you a free $30k roof you're probably not turning it down. So naturally, these contractors became experts at navigating insurance and making them pay. On top of that, Florida laws, which had good intentions to protect homeowners, backfired drastically.... Basically the laws made it difficult for the insurance companies to deny claims and even if they did deny, if the claimer(s) decided to sue, the insurance company would be forced to pay their legal fees, so ultimately the insurance companies were forced in to a lose/lose situation. If just 10,000 people get a free 20k roof that's already 200 million in losses the actual numbers are in the billions.

A majority of Americans would prefer that the popular vote chose the president, and would like to ditch the EC.  The constitution states that the presidential electors shall be chosen in a manner determined by the states, so technically speaking if the state government made a law saying that they would a jellybean from a bag of red and blue ones to determine the electors that would pass constitutional muster (but it would cause public outcry).In order for the compact to activate, it requires enough EVs that it represents the majority of the electoral vote.  Within that, what the Compact does is fix what is a very non-democratic and antiquated way of choosing a president.  The founders created this mechanism to keep the public from being swayed by someone high in popularity but low in character.  That said, what weve seen in recent years is the GOP getting successively better at gaming the EC to the point that they only GOP presidents who have ever won the popular vote and the  EC this century was GWB in 2004 (lost popular vote handily in 2000).  And when it came to DJT - the quintessential high in popularity, low in morals candidate - never passed muster with the electorate.  He lost the popular vote two times, in the widest margins ever.All of this aside, there are other movements that have occurred since the constitution was written and ratified that have moved us in more Democratic directions.  We now elect senators directly - they were originally chosen by state legislators.  We have approved term limits for the presidency (via a constitutional amendment).  We have freed the slaves and given the male former slaves the vote, and subsequently all women received the right to vote.The general arc of the US is on a road toward more direct democracy in choosing our leaders.  To that end, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is just one more step in that regard.","title":"What stance should the Democratic Party take on the Electoral College"},{"text":"*Mooch hesitates and then searches for movie tickets, looking a little confused.*","title":"Anthony Scaramucci says he is 'working alongside' Kamala Harris on her campaign's crypto policies"},{"text":"I got an email saying my mail in ballot is being sent.

Texas is generally a different story, population centers are always shifted blue. Texas was able to avoid much of this until now because despite having a large state-wide population, it was largely spread out. There were very few large population centers and most of the population was not concentrated in them compared to places like Michigan where detroits heavily blue population can overshadow a very large portion of the state population in terms of voting power.Florida is similarly an odd case, while it does have both a large population and some decently large population centers, Florida also has by far the oldest population demographics of any state, its not called americas nursing home for nothin, and older generations are more likely to vote red. Every other state follows the general rule of population centers almost voting significantly blue while rural areas vote largely red. Its just a matter of if those population centers are large enough to outweigh the rural areas or not. Texas is pry the best example of this with how its tending. One of the fastest growing states and the vast majority of transplants are to high population areas shifting the cities bluer. California on the other hand has the 2nd most republicans of any state, aside from Texas, and they vote so far blue that it still doesnt matter because so many people are in major cities.","title":"'Florida is in play': Democrats put money into states where they were struggling"},{"text":"I would say 80%+ of global events and war are to manipulate world economics.

Pretty much every county in Florida gets effected by a named storm at least once every 3 years, most of the time, for most houses, they do essentially zero damage, but due to the extremely long 3 year allowance a bunch of roofing companies started going door to door offering free roof inspections. They'd inevitably find some damage, blow it out of proportion, attach the damage to the most recent named storm in the area, and then tell the insurance company this homeowner needed a new roof, if the insurance company said no, they would sue, and inevitably the insurance company paid.

While Herzl or Bankers may have had a plan, Most immigrants were motivated by statelessness, fear, and desperation. To get a sense of this, pre-war immigration to Israel inspired by the \\"plan\\" between 1900 and 1940 was on the order of 10,000 Jews per year.Very important to contextualize these numbers.The Jews immigrating to Palestine from 1900 to 1940 were fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe, however **it's inaccurate to argue that they were desperate refugees with no choice**. During the same time that they were immigrating to Palestine, [millions and millions of their fellow community members were immigrating to the US](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/jewishexp.htm). Only a small percent chose not to.The *choice* to move to Palestine was very unpopular among Jewish communities fleeing pogroms in eastern Europe. Those who did move went there clearly under the stated intention of colonizing the region. They also went there knowing exactly what they were getting into, as there were influential and vocal critics (Jabotinsky and like) of Herzl's proposal within the Jewish community who were plainly stating that the region was already occupied and that it was wrong/would result in bloodshed to go there and try to claim it.Just to double down on the point I've made here, the British actually resisted or tried to limit Jewish immigration into Mandatory Palestine, and it failed because of how determined Zionist Jews were to get into Palestine. **So not only were they taking the unpopular and frowned upon choice, they were doing so even in the face of official resistance.**So the Jews who immigrated mandatory Palestine clearly went there knowing the risks and consequences of their choice, and with Herzl's plan in mind.Post war immigration was on the order of 200,000 Jews per year. I Think this speaks to the relative importance of the two motivations.And these were mostly Mizrahi Jews being expelled from surrounding middle-eastern countries as a result of the founding of Israel.And then after a few years into the 1950s there wasn't really much for Jews specifically to flee from so we can't really label the later immigrants as desperate refugees.Ultimately, the entire narrative that the Jewish population that founded Israel was shoved there against their will, or desperately fled there is just historically wrong. They were people voluntarily going to a region with the clear intent of capturing the entire region for themselves and establishing a state for themselves. They were well aware that they would have to kill many locals to do this, they were well aware that the region was populated, and they went anyway.Are Hispanics migrating to California Colonizing it?No, because they are not going there with the clearly stated intent of seizing the entire state and turning it into an independent state for Mexicans.Now, does this mean we should blame current Israeli citizens for the actions of their great-grandparents? Does this mean Israel should not have a right to exist? No, of course not. Israel is a democracy, it is a healthy place to live, we should not hate them for their past. But is is very disappointing and very indicative of bad-faith that they will not be honest about history.","title":"CMV: Zionists have no right to say that we as a society must support Israel."},{"text":"Nate Silver is getting into it with Alan Lichtman on Twitter about his keys, with Nate saying the keys predict Trump wins while Alan is basically calling him out for being a dumbass.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 27, 2024 - 39 days until election day!"},{"text":"I see the bots showed up for this one.

Also when Russia tried drilling deeper than anyone ever has through the crust, at one point their drill \\"broke through\\" and just started free spinning. and no, it wasn't melted by magma or anything - I read a report on it years ago but every time I've searched since I've come up empty. Another good example, though not necessarily evidence of hollow earth, is the Soviet deep water exploration of lake Baikal. The divers encountered beings ridiculously far down that appeared to have no scuba equipment or anything but interacted with them and sent 5 divers shooting to the surface with the push of a button when the divers tried to capture one of the beings. that one is a fascinating read. similar stories in South America with several lakes that locals say have balls of light emerging and entering regularly. probably entrances to cave systems that drop to the hollow earth.all in all it seems at one point in time it was more accepted that there was a lot deep under water and underground that we don't understand. hopefully we will get back to exploring those areas within our lifetimes.","title":"Is This Why Saturn Is Worshipped By Every Religion and Secret Society?"},{"text":"CA-22: its the same picture","title":"Golden State, Blue Wave"},{"text":"Definitely not playing sides here but like come on we had Wilbur Ross (a literal fucking Rothschild banker) as the secretary of commerce from '17-21'.You are never going to see a candidate that is not part of the machine, and if people ever realize this maybe we could do something about it.","title":"Three years in Iraq"},{"text":"Im gettin real fucking tired of having to pander to just a handful of individual states because of the fucked up electoral college system we have in this country.","title":"'Florida is in play': Democrats put money into states where they were struggling"},{"text":"There's a crew of morons downvoting normal non-inflammatory posts in hereSad little trolls","title":"Fact Check: Kamala Harris Falsely Claims Guns Are No. 1 Killer of Children"},{"text":"Looks like the leftist bots are down voting you for telling the truth.

Theres no room for debate here. Im not Russia, so stop deflecting. These are the facts.**In the document titled ICEs Signed Response to Representative Tony Gonzales, the term non-detained by ICE refers to individuals residing in the United States who are on ICEs national docket but are not currently in custody. As of July 21, 2024, there are 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICEs docket, including 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 individuals with pending criminal charges living in the community.While these individuals are not detained, ICE may monitor them through various means. This includes requiring some to check in periodically with ICE officers as part of their immigration proceedings. Additionally, ICE evaluates cases on an individual basis, considering factors such as risk of flight and public.The document notes that ICE may release noncitizens under certain conditions based on specific guidelines, taking into account any criminal history and ongoing legal issues. Despite not being in custody, individuals on the non-detained docket may still be subject to immigration enforcement actions if they are found to pose national security threats or public safety risks.ICE has also indicated that local jurisdictions refusal to honor detainer requests complicates their ability to monitor these individuals effectively, as it can allow potentially dangerous individuals to remain free in the community without regular oversight.In relation to ICE, non-detained refers to individuals who are in the United States but are not currently in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These individuals may have pending immigration cases or unresolved legal status, meaning they are not being held in an ICE detention facility.**Where are non-detained persons released to?**Non-detained individuals are typically released into the community where they reside. They may be living with family members, friends, or in their own accommodations. While they are not in custody, they may be subject to certain conditions, such as:1. **Check-ins with ICE:** They might be required to report to an ICE office periodically to update their status or provide information about their whereabouts.2. **Conditions of Release:** Some non-detained individuals may have specific conditions placed on them, like not leaving the state or country, depending on their case.3. **Pending Legal Proceedings:** Many are awaiting decisions on their immigration cases, which could include asylum claims, appeals, or other legal processes.ICE monitors these individuals through their reporting requirements, but their ability to enforce compliance can vary based on local jurisdiction policies and cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.","title":"JUST IN: ?

I have a couple major thoughts in response. I think there are major inconsistencies in the definition of colonization applied to the Israeli context, and the key characteristics of European colonization from the Age of Discovery. I think the difference between Settler colonialism contrasted with exploitation/imperial colonialism are relevant, and this is generally ignored. Settler colonialism is carried out in a decentralized way through individual actions, even if there is a common sentiment or someone first sparked a \\"plan\\". Individual settlers are not the agent of an emperor, but many independent individuals, often economically desperate. Just as there is an overlap between imperial colonialism and settler colonialism, there is also a significant overlap between settler colonialism and refugee migration. While Herzl or Bankers may have had a plan, Most immigrants were motivated by statelessness, fear, and desperation. To get a sense of this, pre-war immigration to Israel inspired by the \\"plan\\" between 1900 and 1940 was on the order of 10,000 Jews per year. Post war immigration was on the order of 200,000 Jews per year. I Think this speaks to the relative importance of the two motivations. Second, I contend that the difference that the unspoken definition of colonialism has more to do with historic recency and racial identity of the migrants than anything else. The Aztecs, Qing, or Abbasids where just as much colonizers. Are Hispanics migrating to California Colonizing it? There are advocates and bankers involved, and the composition has grown form 15% in 1900 to 40% today and become the single largest racial group.

This is the one I feel that everyone has been waiting for. After covering the two RGV seats, we are now in suburbia! HD-118 includes southern Bexar County, although it has a moon-shape and kind of wraps around east and up north.Biden won here under the new boundaries by 2.7 points, although it was 10 points bluer before redistricting.We actually won this seat back in 2020 (and 2016 and 2018). The former Democrat was Leo Pacheco. He selfishly resigned before the end of his term, to take another job. I dont have much sympathy for people like that. Its one thing if its health related, but I digress. The legislative session was already over, so he could have stayed on at that point.But there was a special election in early November of 2021, and Democratic complacency lead to Republican John Lujan winning this seat. John Lujan actually had won this seat in a previous special election but lost the seat in the 2016 election. Texas Democrats often drop the ball in special elections, leading to dire consequences. It happened in CD-06, where we didnt make the top two, CD-34 with Mayra Flores, and down here. I could write another article about how incompetent the state party is here in Texas, but I wont. We are getting new leadership in 2026 and hopefully things can turn around.In 2022, Beto actually won here, by 1.5 points, with Rochelle Garza carrying it by 1. Oddly enough, Dan Patrick narrowly edged out Mike Collier here. Unfortunately, John Lujan defeated Frank Ramirez by 3.6 points. There has been really bad down-ballot lag here in Texas, drastically effecting State House races. Had Democrats won the special, perhaps they would have held on.While John Lujan is not the worst republican in the state house, he does go along with what Greg Abbott wants. He supports Abbotts ESA voucher scam, despite the fact that Beto carried the district. He also said he would force his daughter to have a baby if she were raped, if he had a daughter (he doesnt).

In any case, the Constitution doesn't quite establish a federal system, but was rather a compromise between very different political forces ranging from post-Francoist rightists to Communists and Catalan nationalist and as such deliberately established a vague framework of autonomy which requires the central government to grant autonomy to regions (in fact when the constitution was drafted it wasn't clear whether regions other than Catalonia and the Basque country would be autonomous). This has lead to each autonomous community having its own statute of autonomy which wildly range in terms of the amount of powers granted to each region. This is particularly important in terms of finance, as Euskadi and Navarre have practically full autonomy in this topic while all other communities have a far more limited fiscal powers making them far more dependent on the wims of the central government, which tends to favour Madrid and the regions with parties that can extract pork (mainly the Basque Country and Catalonia).IMO a better defined federal system would do much to alleviate the constant push and pull between the central government and regional governments and would allow the different regions to carry out their own policies without having to rely on the interest that dominate the central government at any given time.","title":"Madrid: Southern Europe's future 10-million-inhabitant megacity?"},{"text":"Why is it a joke?","title":"Dem Senator Introduces Bill That Would Add Six Supreme Court Seats, Expand Federal Judiciary"},{"text":"I th in k th er e' s pl en ty of ev id en ce th at De mo cr at s fe ar an ot he r Tr um p pr es id en cy .

If anything they saw the light.","title":"Do libertarian-left political parties exist?"},{"text":"I don't think the right way to think about it is \\"good ole\\" vs \\"today's\\". Political parties evolve over time. Watergate was 50 years ago. Republicans in those days stood behind Nixon...up to a point. In 2020, Trump's attempted coup was far, far worse than what Nixon did. The evidence is all out there. And yet Republicans still stand behind him and his lies. Why? Well, because the Republican electorate changed. The GOP politicians who wouldn't support Trump's coup at first have now either backtracked or retired. They did it because their constituents demanded it. Whether you blame it on disinformation or just lack of character, the electorate has evolved over time. I think part of the reason why it seemed like such a dramatic change is that all those changes were happening \\"under the radar\\", unless you followed politics closely. To pick race, for example...Reagan ran on \\"welfare queens\\" - it wasn't about race, of course! Bush's Willie Horton ad was a bit more blatantly racist, but still not explicit. But from today's perspective, Bush's immigration stances would make him a normie democrat. The GOP ran two \\"boring\\" candidates against O'Bama, McCain and Romney. Both of them were very careful to not attack O'Bama's race. But even during the 2008 run, the GOP electorate had gotten dramatically more comfortable with explicit racism. Everyone around those days saw the facebook memes of O'Bama as a \\"savage negro\\", the \\"birtherism\\", etc., but the party leaders refused to stoop to explicit racism. Then Trump came on the scene, fully endorsing the racism from the base. And they loved him for it. And now we're at \\"immigrants eating pets!\\"Along the way, the media Republicans consume has evolved as well. Oh, how we hated \\"Fox News\\" during the O'Bama years. They were so biased! We were naive children. Rush was a jerk, spreading disinformation, thinly veiled bigotry, calling democrats \\"libtards\\", etc. Such an ass. Now? There's entire subcultures of far-right message boards, discord servers, spreading the most disgusting bigotry imaginable. Places that try to control it, like Reddit and (formerly) twitter, are \\"censoring\\" conservative viewpoints! Oh no! Which ones? Go look at 8chan or xitter. Hate feeds hate. That's how today's GOP is different from \\"the good 'ole days\\". Reagan Republicans hated the evil godless socialist Russians. Bush Republicans hated the evil radical islamic terrorists. Trump era Republicans hate the evil godless socialist Democrats. Except unlike their previous boogeymen, we're right here. We call them on their bullshit. We point out their lies. We tell them \\"No, Haitians are not eating people's pets, that's a disgusting, racist lie.\\". And they absolutely hate that. It makes them absolutely furious, with no way to deal with it, because they know we're right.So. That's the difference between today's Republicans and the \\"good ole\\" days. The electorate, politicians, and media have all become addicted to hatred and lies, and feed each other. There's a reason all the \\"Republicans\\" who oppose Trump have \\"former\\" or \\"ex' next to their titles - they're the ones who don't need to get elected to keep their jobs.","title":"CMV: the good ole republicans are no better than Trump in practice"},{"text":"House gop continues their ragebait clownshow while accomplishing nothing of value for the American people.We need to flip the House in November[https://dccc.org/](https://dccc.org/)","title":"House approves GOP resolution condemning Biden and Harris over Afghanistan withdrawal"},{"text":"They've been arguing about the same shit for like... foreverIn the 70's there was pro-Palestinian protests outside college just like there is todayThe abortion topic..

Historical election results will show you that the more educated and politically engaged people are, the more they tend to lean Democrat.Also, polls are wildly inaccurate and are often skewed to favor the desired outcome of the pollster. Since we're talking Arizona, here's an example:It continually flip flops between Harris up 1-2% in the polls or Trump up 1-2%.Poll aggregators like 270towin and 538 only average the latest 5-6 polls, which is already a very small sample size. If we look back at the last 6 polls in Arizona, they surveyed 500, 926, 764, 1264, 789, and 713 likely voters, with one of them being Suffolk that has been wildly inconsistent from any other poll and usually leans in Trump's favor by like 5-10%+.But, altogether, 270towin's latest Arizona poll shows Trump up 2% based on the polling results of **less than 5,000 likely voters**. There are over **4 million registered voters in Arizona.** These polls that everyone gets worked up about is literally a snapshot in time of **less than .00125% of Arizona voters**, and even then, it's often a snapshot pointed in the direction the pollsters want it to be.","title":"Ruben Gallego leads Kari Lake in Arizona Senate race by double digits: Polls"},{"text":"The gravitational center of the conservative movement is white supremacy.

Four candidates ran in the Democratic party presidential primaries. Only one of those four had a running mate on the ballot, Im sure you know which one. The other three candidates won a combined total of 7 delegates, Biden/Harris won 3,905. Those 3 candidates received 6.1% of the total votes, Biden/Harris received 87.1% of the total votes cast in that Democratic primary race. Why would anyone vote for an 81 year old for a four year term if they did not like his running mate and do not think she is qualified? Republicans can tell you voters pay closer attention to the running mate of a candidate in his 70s+ because of the potential that the VP will end up in a position to actually use executive powers as President. Sarah Palin made that an undeniable fact. Check the numbers. The support for Kamala Harris is apparent by the total amount and the number of small dollar donations from fundraising. The number of new campaign volunteers is an another number to check out. She has been filling rallies, including the arena the RNC was held in. If youre not seeing that Democrats are happy with the pick, its because you dont want to.Conversely, Republican voters in states with primaries after Super Tuesday were not given a choice for nominee. A Trump family member became the chair of the RNC before Super Tuesday, nothing suspicious about that at all as the other candidates were being pressured to drop out of the race so the RNC could hand the nomination over to the same guy that lost the last election. He received 76.42% of the votes while running against nobody in a majority of primaries. Is very presumptuous to believe voters wont have a problem with the guy that instigated Jan 6th, left DC on Inauguration Day in true Sore Loser style but with boxes of national security documents he knew he wasnt supposed to take.

So this will be the new normal going forward. A Democratic president will not be able to confirm any Supreme Court nomination unless they also hold the Senate. But perhaps their own tactic can be used against them. If Alito and/or Thomas have to leave the court for whatever reason, she can simply refuse to nominate anyone.

It's time for me to share a post here. Doing such a writeup comprehensively is a lot of work and something I may not fully have time for while I'm doing other work for my own local races (Texas), however... I don't want to leave people without the resources to learn about who is running this cycle.A lot of people get nervous or skeptical about our chances to keep the Senate for 2024, but I remain reasonably optimistic. To better empower our chances to make that happen however, I want to help increase awareness of *every* Senate race. I want to make sure you know who is running in your state, point to where we have incumbents defending, and also where 'all' of our potential flips are, no matter how likely or unlikely. Some of them will be close races you already know about (MT/OH), some we have a surprisingly good shot at, but will still be an uphill battle (TX/FL), some may have the potential to surprise people (NE), and yet others are very long shot flips who are still names you should be aware of. Some are Dems running in swing states that we can likely win if we win the state (most of those are polling well ahead of the Presidential results). Some may be very safe seats but still are D candidate names you should be aware of and drum up local support for.Regardless, my goal is to make sure no (viable) Dem is left behind.

If that IS the case, (and I'm not necessarily saying it is), then that would mean they're significantly undercounting her level of support.

Not only does moving there automatically make the place more progressive, because a progressive person is now living there, but they bring along with them the information and presence of that progressiveness. A good example would be when my mom was in the military, and one of the people she was in charge of came from a conservative household that believed black people were beneath white people. As he got to learn more about black people in the military, he discovered that his family was wrong. In that scenario he had to leave in order to grow. And for a long time that's what how it was. Conservative sit in this little bubble of anti-diversity, echoing back and forth these stereotypes that have been fed to them their whole life. That's why a lot of conservatives talk down college. Because it's a melting pot where people get to experience new things outside of this bubble, and they don't like that. That bubble is essentially being pop because the progressives are moving into it.But I also think what plays into it, is people speaking out and society trying to change for the better. Like my friend. For example, he never thought that he would have been able to confess to his family. And if he had stayed in the closet and not been his true self, then his family would have never changed their view on the lgbtq+ community. But he only had the confidence to come out because of how hard people have been fighting for equality.","title":"'Florida is in play': Democrats put money into states where they were struggling"},{"text":"I too have imaginary gay sex with Obama daily.","title":"Barack Obama told ex, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination."},{"text":"He IS an actor/standup comedian.\\"Nye worked as a writer/actor on a local sketch comedy television show in Seattle called Almost Live!.

The media then lied about what he said and shortened the clip. So we have the media trying to divide and Trump trying to do the opposite and bring people together. It's only because of how they report it that it becomes polarizing.In reality the vast majority of the population agrees with what Trump says and what his points are if they are presented accurately. If treated honestly by the media and our institutions I firmly believe he would be one of the least polarizing presidents and most popular/unifying in history. But because he opposes the corrupt people in power they create division as a way of protecting their own interests. But that's them doing it not Trump.Go rewatch his speech after he won in 2016 it was extremely unifying and you could see that's what he wanted to bring the country together. What happened on day one when he was inaugerated? The media posted doctored photos of the crowd and made front page headlines about how Trump's crowd was smaller than Obama's and Trump \\"lied\\" when he said off the cuff he thought it was the biggest crowd he'd seen for an inaugeration.

Because firearms are used in approximately 80% of murders in the United States, addressing gun crime is essential to addressing violent crime. The President and Vice President secured funding through the American Rescue Planwhich every Republican in Congress voted againstfor law enforcement and community violence interventions. President Biden and Vice President Harris announced executive actions to keep guns out of dangerous hands and, by the middle of 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration had already taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other administration. On June 25, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Actthe most significant new gun violence prevention law in nearly 30 years. Year-over-year comparisons show that 2023 had the single largest homicide rate drop in recent history.After two and a half years of significant progress, President Biden and Vice President Harriss next step was to establish a White House office dedicated to coordinating across the federal government and partnering with gun violence survivors, law enforcement, state and local officials, and community leaders on our shared goal of reducing gun violence.  After championing this issue for decades, President Biden asked Vice President Harris to oversee the White House Office of Gun Violence because he knows that she has a proven record as a leader for gun violence prevention.The past year, the reduction in homicide has only accelerated, with the Department of Justice reporting that, from January to June, homicides dropped 17% compared to the same time last year. In addition, data from the Gun Violence Archive indicates that the number of mass shootings to date in 2024 has decreased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year.**Today [September 23rd], the White House is releasing a report on progress made by the Biden-Harris Administration to reduce gun violence in the one year since President Biden created the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.** The report provides a summary, but not an exhaustive list, of how the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to fulfill the four objectives President Biden gave the office:1. Expedite implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and already-announced executive actions;\\n2. Coordinate more support for survivors of gun violence;\\n3. Identify new executive actions; and\\n4. Expand our coalition of partners in states and cities across the country.For President Biden, this work is the culmination of well over 30 years of national leadership to reduce gun violence and save lives. He played a critical role in securing passage of the Brady Bill in 1993 and the assault weapons ban in 1994. In the early 2000s, when the National Rifle Association was experiencing growing power in Washington and claiming to work out of [the Presidents] office, then-Senator Biden was a key voice taking votes opposing their dangerous agenda. From 2012 to 2013, then-Vice President Biden led the Obama-Biden Administrations efforts to develop and implement over two dozen executive actions after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He has continued this work throughout his own presidency by actually establishing an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and forcefully calling on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban and repeal PLCAA.As President Biden emphasized during his State of the Union address earlier this year, Vice President Harris continues to lead the Administrations work to address the epidemic of gun violence and keep communities safe while overseeing the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Since taking office, there have been more than 80 instances where the Vice President has put a focus on gun violence prevention. This includes mourning with families and consoling communities that have been directly impacted by gun violence across the nation C from Buffalo and Highland Park to Nashville, Monterey Park, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and Parkland.This dedicated work is a continuation of the Vice Presidents decades-long record of taking on gun violence and advancing gun safety policies. As District Attorney of San Francisco, she prosecuted homicide cases and saw first-hand the devastation of gun violence. She also invested in community violence intervention efforts by championing Community Response Networks. While overseeing the second largest Department of Justice in America as Attorney General of California, Vice President Harris worked to get illegal firearms off the street and to prosecute gun trafficking. And as Senator, she co-sponsored several pieces of gun safety legislation, including an assault weapons ban.Statement from the President: Ive spent countless hours meeting with families impacted by gun violence as they mourn their loved ones. Theyve all had the same simple message for their elected officials: do something. Vice President Harris and I responded to their call: I signed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and we announced dozens of executive actions to reduce gun violence. But we knew more was needed. Thats why I established the first-ever White Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by the Vice President. In just one year, it has accelerated my Administrations efforts to reduce gun violence and save lives.Statement from the Vice President:President Biden and I have worked to address the epidemic of gun violence with the urgency it demands by enacting the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act C the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years C and launching the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. In the year since President Biden asked me to oversee this Office, our administration has improved and expanded background checks, announced the single largest investment in youth mental health in history, and been an unprecedented resource to states, cities, and local communities. We have also supported, convened, and worked alongside gun violence survivors, the families of those who have lost loved ones to shootings, and other impacted individuals to tackle the trauma caused by gun violence. I am committed to continuing this urgent work to ensure that every person in our nation has the freedom to live safe from gun violence.","title":"Fact Sheet: President Biden And Vice President Harris Issue Report On Progress Made To Reduce Gun Violence One Year After Creating White House Office Of Gun Violence Prevention"},{"text":"RIP Joan Rivers!?","title":"Barack Obama told ex, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination."},{"text":"I was about to say the same thing ??","title":"Barack Obama told ex, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination."},{"text":"I demand to see the long-form paper tray liner.","title":"Trump's McDonald's trutherism: Why Kamala Harris' work history triggers MAGA"},{"text":"Now selling watches.

The divide between the top and the bottom is engineered through tax system. The top designs a system that sucks up taxes from the bottom, allowing the top to spend freely without needing to work or exchange their time for resources. The top can accumulate wealth while the bottom works harder just to get by.2. From the top's perspective, the imbalance is not a problem, it is the solution. The top benefits from the imbalance because the top take the lion's share of resource produced by the bottom. This allows the top to live comfortably without contributing labor, as the system is set up to ensure the top's financial dominance.3. The top doesn't view this imbalance as natural, they maintain it through distraction. To prevent the bottom from realizing this, the top constantly pushes propaganda and media narratives that encourage the bottom to fight over left vs. right, keeping the bottom focused on each other instead of looking up at the real source of inequality.The top camouflages themselves and positions themselves within the left and right spectrum, so that the top can project an image that appeals to various groups, even gaining supporters. This lets the top maintain control while hiding their true interests.","title":"The Left vs. Right Conspiracy: A Distraction from the Real Divide"},{"text":"Is this ex in the room with us right now?","title":"Barack Obama told ex, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination."},{"text":"Correct 48 - 4.4 &lt; 42 + 4.4","title":"Donald Trump holds lead over Kamala Harris in Arizona, exclusive poll finds"},{"text":"SNL is definitely taking this idea.","title":"Trump's McDonald's trutherism: Why Kamala Harris' work history triggers MAGA"},{"text":"What are you talking about, exclusive?

Palestinian is swapping land they didn't choose while Israel gets what they want and achieve their expansionist goals with the settlements.But regardless, how do you permanently evacuate over 700k civilians from their homes without that becoming an ethnic cleansing? It's not ethnic cleansing, they are evacuated due to the illegality of their presence not because of their ethnicity. international law has not once suggested before that settlers in a territory must be expelled from the territory they occupy.You can look at the recent ICJ ruling on the issue. Israel is under the obligation of evacuating all settlements and restore all unmovable property in the occupied territories to ther legal or natural persons concerned. This next point is slightly tangential, but consider too that literally every single last Jewish person was ethnically cleansed out of the West Bank in 1948. Do the Palestinians which took their land have a right of keep living where they do today?This is irrelevant. But the Jewish persons concerned should receive some form of compensation, the Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from Israel and owned 1/5th of all Israeli land (illegally confiscated and sold to the JNF) should receive compensation too.","title":"US officials weighing steps Biden could take to preserve two-states after election"},{"text":"That Foundation ain't gonna fund itself, you know . . . . . .
