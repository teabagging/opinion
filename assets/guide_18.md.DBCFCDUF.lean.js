We expanded and modernized the Canal on our own, under Panamanian leadership, in a process that is considered a case study in excellence.This is about our independence and the Canals vital role in international commerce, not some nostalgia-fueled fantasy.

Reddit keeps the flames on the internet and not people going after each other in real life, which is important.Generally libertarians are highly in favor of the 2nd Amendment because we don't trust the government. But you need to be aware of how and when you use that right since it's the LAST option. Health care costs in America are blown up mainly by government policies like licensing laws and malpractice insurance (imagine if the government required you to only eat at gourmet restaurants with 10-year trained chefs?) as well as IIRC the government paying for the medical bills instead of the consumer which distorts the dynamics that keep prices under control. It's not \\"Greedy CEO's\\" and cheering that is foolish.Vigilantism doesn't violate the NAP because you can use force against people who are initiating force on others. But as said, force is the last resort, as opposed to discussion and debate, protesting, voting, boycotting, moving to other areas, and many other ways to counter bad government. But if you are reasonably certain that someone is posing an imminent threat to yourself and others or using force on others, you can use a reasonable amount of force to stop them. Note that using a bomb will kill the person as well as other innocent people so guns and targeted items are proper for self-defense and not explosives.Also, the right is generally considered more of the \\"anti-government\\" party, though they traditionally have favored government intervention overseas, likely so that the government buys weapons from the companies that pay those politicians.A few more things, a baby doesn't ask to be born, the parents action causes that, so it's reasonable to expect the parents to be required to take care of the baby, otherwise their own actions caused someone to come to harm. And you can't plant flags on places and charge rent, you own the product of your own labor (as well as yourself and things given to you by their owner), so you'd have to get some land that no one was laboring on and do work to make it useful, then you could sell the product and charge rent to other people using it. As long as you are laboring on it to maintain it.In regards to intellectual property, it's fair I think to have requirements to share an idea with someone, and you can have requirements with platforms to not platform things that rip off your own product or idea if they want to sell or use your own, that's a fair way to do that.That's a bunch of info, answers, and general points about my point of view as a libertarian and perhaps other's points of view too.","title":"I have some questions."},{"text":"Lol I guess I kinda walked into that one.

The resignation was timed to obstruct the ethics committee, since they traditionally only practice oversight on current members of their current congress.  He hasnt formally withdrawn from the next congress.  He has loosely said he wont be taking his seat.  At first this was a show of confidence that hed be appointed Attorney General.  When that blew up, it was intercepted that skipping out on congress was freeing himself up to be a lucrative right wing media grifter.  It appeared there was a bit of an unspoken detente between Gaetz and the house ethics committee: if he stayed away, theyd bury the report.A technical point for political wonks is that because the old/current committee doesnt have purview over the next one, it would be up to a newly formed committee, which could different membership, to decide if they wanted to pursue an investigation into Gaetz or not.  If they did decide to do so, by default that could mean starting over.  In theory they could table the old committees report and use portions of it.  But they cant just change the date and call it theirs because the committee will presumably have changed.From Gaetzs perspective, the main event he tried to block sounds like its happening, and hes already debased himself with his odd public denial.  So in a proxy deal context, hes already paid a lot of the price he would have should have just stayed in Congress.

This means private security companies to protect individual rights and private arbitrators to settle disputes. Laws (within the confines of the NAP) would be made by property owners and would only apply to their own property. Market forces and spontaneous order would allow the best incentives for people to voluntarily form societies.\\\\I always thought anarchism is traditionally left-wing?I suppose you could say that, but given that anarchism is a group of individualist philosophies it's difficult to call it left or right wing. There are many kinds of anarchy. For example, the relationship between nations with respect to each other is anarchic (i.e. there is no higher government that nations must obey except for the occasional empire, which most are against). I think anarcho-capitalism is the newest kid on the block, but it draws on a number of ideas from earlier anarchist thinkers.","title":"I have some questions."},{"text":"But what did President elect Elonia say?","title":"Team Trump pushes back on President Musk talk amid spending bill negotiations The billionaire is flexing his influence over the Republican Party  and Team Trump is irked by all the attention hes getting."},{"text":"The enemy from within ","title":"Team Trump pushes back on President Musk talk amid spending bill negotiations The billionaire is flexing his influence over the Republican Party  and Team Trump is irked by all the attention hes getting."},{"text":"Honestly if any politician would ever get rid of the Jones Act, I have a sneaking suspicion it may be Trump.

Not sure why you've decided it's the police's fault somehow.When police located Routh, they shut the highway down because they didn't know if his car had explosives or not.  The girl died when her crashed as a part of the slowdown in traffic approaching the closure.  DeSantis ordered an investigation into state charges.  Investigators believed that Routh's attempt on Trump amounted to domestic terrorism.  It is their position that the girl would not have died if it hadn't been for his crime, and have laid it at his feet.  I dealt with something similar (in terms of delayed/extended fault) locally here earlier this year.  We had a bad fatal crash on the interstate that shut the whole thing down for hours.  About 20-30 minutes after the crash we had another fatal crash, followed by another near-fatal one with a tanker that exploded.  The driver in the first crash was charged with the deaths in the later crashes under the belief that those crashes wouldn't have happened had it not been for the  first one.Personally, I think it's a stretch.  While they might not have cleared his vehicle yet, Routh had been in custody for more than half an hour before the crash occurred.  It also hinges on their belief that what he did was terrorism, and I'm not sure how they reached that decision.  Most articles about the attempt on Trump from right leaning sources say that the Feds have told Florida not to file any of their own charges, and have refused to give them any help.  Trump being a politician doesn't automatically make this terrorism, which is a specific crime, not just a label.  It may very well be terrorism, but to make that determination when you're specifically denied access to evidence is a tough sell.","title":"Girl unresponsive 3 months after crash caused by suspect in Trump assassination attempt"},{"text":"He got reelected recently at age 89","title":"These 20 GOP senators voted against the Social Security bill"},{"text":"The countries these people are dispatched to can just declare them personae non grata and send them back to the Mar-a-Lago swamp.","title":"Trumps stunningly unqualified diplomatic team shapes up at breakneck speed"},{"text":"Don't you mean he'll get a raise?","title":"Lara Trump says she's removed her name from contention to be Florida's senator"},{"text":"Ideally, dems in congress will offer a compromise, then move the goalposts.

But with that said, like a lot of people who might be considered left of center, I'm not opposed to property tax in concept. But, I do think that the current concept of it, as it exists in the United States at least, is not ideal. It makes little sense to me that people like you who use their houses to live in (and not to live extravagantly, become a landlord, etc, just to be a regular ol' homeowner) pay property tax. I think that property tax has two primary useful purposes: to disincentivize using housing, farmland, or other property as a passive investment; and to be a method that the wealthy contribute financially to society. The first is important, because if property tax were to not exist, then there would be little to no risk in investors buying up every home and, by reducing supply, forcing housing prices up, as well as pulling off similar stunts with farmland at the expense of the livelihoods of farmers and of agricultural production. The second is important under a conservative worldview, because those who are successful are supposed to be successful due to their financial contributions to society. Contributions can be anything really - investing in profitable companies to help them succeed, designing a successful line of clothes - doesn't matter what, but it should be something. Relative to their wealth, the living costs of a wealthy person are often incredibly low - an extravagantly wealthy family with a 'measly' $20 billion in wealth may have each member going through $10 million in their lifetime of the cash reserve, making it last 200 family members' worth of expenses. So, without a significant tax on inheritance, stock ownership or on wealth itself, what's the best way to force wealthy families to continue to contribute to society, even if minimally? I say a property tax.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"I thought most deaths were due to malaria from mosquitoes.

I.e. if this guy's family business was passed down to his son, and his son sold his family business and invested 90% in Tesla and 10% in hookers and blow, that'd be considered a \\"failure\\" even though the family wealth is virtually the same.Now tbh, I don't know who Jim Grubman is, and I haven't seen the purported origin of the 70% statistic myself - but *even if it was true*, do we really want 30% of society to grow progressively richer over generations, because their grandparent's grandparents made the first spork?I should add the guy you're replying to also added the line about the 30% retaining their family's wealth due to being \\"productive\\" - there is no source for that.

But we generally oppose the idea that the government issues IDs. We'd be glad to use alternative methods for identification, such as private bank statements, friend referrals, or McDonald's VIP cards if that's a thing.2. We are sad to witness a murderous event being cherished, but it doesn't mean we like the CEO who benefits from the system that we severely condemn. That is: the government's interference in healthcare. When Obama's policy subsidizes citizens and companies into contracting involuntary health insurance, people sign on things without evaluating the risks. Insurance providers are not clear about who joins their program, and individuals are not certain about the conditions on which their health is covered, since the state dictates those terms. The result is companies rejecting coverages to stay profitable.And most certainly, Luigi violates NAP.3. I'd say libertarians are anti-government. The two branches are miniarchists and anarchists. Miniarchists acknowledge the government's function in preserving the right to property, life, and liberty. Anything beyond that is evil. So they are only anti-government to that degree. If mercenaries can perform such functions, the state should not keep a standing army. Anarchists think the government can be fully replaced by commercial services, such as police companies, law companies, currency companies, etc. The society will operate in harmony under a private law society, and there is no notion of public.Living in this big state era, minarchists and anarchists share the same trench, so it's pretty safe to say all libertarians are anti-government.Personally, I associate anti-government with the right, being aware that many libertarians identify themselves as centrists and think Republicans are right-leaning. In my mind, the political spectrum is a single axis from aggression to self-defense. So commies are extreme left, Hitler is far left, American Democrats are left, and American Republicans are centrists, Milei is right, anarchism is undefined. I combine the economic axis with the freedom axis because the two things are not strictly independent. But again, this is just my personal view, I may be wrong.4. Whether vigilantism will work is a huge debate within the libertarian circle because we don't see many examples in history. While I can't give a definite answer, judging from vigilantism's definition:\\"law enforcement undertaken without legal authority by a self-appointed group of people\\"I would argue it does not work. Because we need legal authority. Even if we despise public authority, private authority is needed. We should trust private authority as a result of the free market; we trust it less with the decay of the free market.","title":"I have some questions."},{"text":"Safe","title":"Americans, does it scare you that people have the right to bear arms, or is it making you feel safe?

Harris policies were not distilled enough for the low information voter. This is what those people meant when theyd say they just heard word salad come out of her. For those of us in this sub, were probably taking the time to understand the nuance of what her policies entailed, but the low information voter needed the information spoon fed to them.

If you do spend that money on fancy cars and vacations - that's a **success**. Your wealth's just been redistributed to the car dealers' employees, aircraft personnel, hotel attendants etc., rather than being passed down to your kids for work they didn't earn. Not to mention, the OP specifically mentioned designing this tax to target multimillionaires, not owners of small family businesses. Let's say he arbitrarily sets the inheritance tax to only kick in for every dollar after $50 million - your whole argument falls apart, unless you really think the extra $50,000,001th dollar is better in the hands of an already well-off descendant rather than either the government or workers across the economy.The current system doesn't create shit.

And well to do people of course often embrace tribalism and racism as well, but I find the current trend in younger generations is to reject diversity and community when your life becomes more socially isolated and stressful as a whole. I think this specifically plays into why we've seen struggles among previously Dem leaning voters.I also realize there are those on the opposite end of the spectrum, who see a Dem party that went too right and did 'not' take race/gender issues seriously. Again, I'm not suggesting those issues should be ignored. Rather I truly believe tackling the wider inequality makes it easier to get people to stop giving into the fears that enable such common modern prejudices.Again, I realize not all here will agree with me, but it's not supposed to be an either/or message. It's supposed to simply put the most universally relatable message front and center, to re-frame the fight of our time.Having a shared common cause to agree with, one people from many walks of life can agree with, can break down barriers that enables such prejudices in the first place. Can weaken the propaganda that lets prejudice thrive, and can show the humanity of different kinds of people.I've lived and worked in communities that were genuinely diverse and where people supported one another, listened to one another without overt prejudices. Sure, systemic problems still existed, but people willingly worked together to offset those problems once they found common ground. I want a country that brings back those values again, and to some extent having a common cause to work towards will be a huge part of that goal. I think we need messaging towards that end.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 21, 2024"},{"text":"\\"that the government is simply a functionary for the people\\"\\nThen why would you reward people that tried to use violence to invalidate the will of the people.?","title":"CMV: Biden should pardon the January 6th attackers on his last day in office"},{"text":"Something something if you can convince the lowest white man hes better than the best colored man, he wont notice youre picking his pocket.

Efficient.Musk also pushed misinformation about the bill, while lamenting government spending, despite his companies being subsidized to the teeth.This is also the guy who recently stated that the government should be run exclusively by \\"high status males\\"This is not someone who should be taken seriously, regardless of how much money he invested in becoming one of America's most intolerable political agitators.Yet all of a sudden, Musk is qualified to dictate spending policy before stepping foot into a made up director position?Trump is also making demands of congress, along with his billionaire backers. He proposed raising the debt limit so his next administration can spend recklessly on implementing a far right agenda and whatever crackbrained policies come to mind, not to mention all of the special interest players, corporate cronies, rich MAGA loyalists, social climbers and finance \\"bros\\" that Trump is appointing to his administration.Inauguration is still a month away, and we're already getting a sense of the corruption, cronyism and conflicts of interest in store for us come next term.While one of the richest men on the planet has literally paid his way into Trump's administration, not only contributing hundreds of millions towards his presidential campaign, but also turning Twitter into a bastion of far-right propaganda and misinformation, essentially running election interference for Trump, and in a way that's far more subversive than anything Trump has ever *accused* Democrats of doing.This MAGA coalition is more emboldened than ever, empowered by Trump's rise to power again, and the fact that Republicans will have a majority in both houses and a SCOTUS packed with kowtowing conservatives.And maybe the worst part is that Trump doesn't have a handle on things. Republicans are going to take advantage of his ego, his mental instability, the transactional nature of his relationships, among other things, to enact a far right agenda through him.But first, they'll try to establish a unitary executive with broad, unchecked powers, privileges and immunities, an executive branch ruled by a king more or less. From there, they'll seek to cripple the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of this executive. At the same time, there will be an effort to cleanse these agencies of civil servants whose jobs didn't previously rely on their level of loyalty to the president and the MAGA agenda. Executive actions like Schedule F will help them fill whatever positions are left with staff whose fealty lies first with Trump, not with the American people.We're already looking at a total restructuring of the government that fills the needs of the few at the expense of the many. A plutocratic, oligarchical, kleptocraticwhatever you want to call itregime, whose main goal will be to consolidate power and create what can only be conceived of as a one party system or state. If it can be achieved, Republicans won't hesitate to try and achieve it.We're encroaching on some familiar territory. This is *not* populism, which is one of my main gripes with this whole thing. Republicans have the audacity to run on some kind of populist platform, when in reality, they better represent a modern age of the robber baron with corrupt ties to politicians. And it's baffling just how much of the American electorate believes otherwise.","title":"Team Trump pushes back on President Musk talk amid spending bill negotiations The billionaire is flexing his influence over the Republican Party  and Team Trump is irked by all the attention hes getting."},{"text":"He's not willing to appoint anyone who is more intelligent than he is.

So they believe in a very limited role of government. Typically to protect property rights, enforce contracts, and court system. Libertarians are highly critical of police but as far as being anti-police depends on the libertarian for the previously mentioned reasons. Libertarians are anti-war.

All that I own has been earned and accumulated honestly and it  has all been taxed. When I spend it, it gets taxed again. Real property is taxed annually, even when there has been no transaction or transfer of any kind. If I understand correctly, if I choose to leave a child up to $999,999, you would not tax that. One dollar more would allow the government permission to forcibly take a percentage of that money. First, the arbitrary amount is bothersome. Who gets to decide where to stay that line and why? Wealthy often means has more than I do and is very subjective. Furthermore, $999,999 is worth considerably less in Southern California than in rural Nebraska. How can any law like this be applied fairly?If a millionaire or billionaire opens a joint investment account with a child while still alive, doesnt it legally already belong to the child?  The same could be said for real estate or any number of assets. Income tax in the U.S. is treated similarly and it is not a fair or just system. Everyone pays x% up to a certain amount of income and then the next dollar is taxed at (x+y)%. Why does the government get to take more of that next dollar?  What did they do to deserve more?A flat consumption tax (with exemptions for groceries and medical expenses) is the most fair system available. People who make a lot of money tend to spend a lot of money. They will naturally pay more in taxes. If they dont spend it, they will be investing it somewhere and it will typically be used in ways to stimulate the economy. Why tax that and reduce that incentive?With the flat consumption tax, the child who receives a fat inheritance will be taxed in every dollar they spend, so they dont escape taxes. In fact, they will very likely pay more than most people.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"Hes been unqualified 4-years agoz","title":"Trumps stunningly unqualified diplomatic team shapes up at breakneck speed"},{"text":"I am a democrat that grew up in Missouri.

This is what we have to offer. Its what our system produces. Garbage ingarbage out.\\nIf you have selfish, ignorant citizensif you have selfish, ignorant citizens, youre gunna get selfish, ignorant leaders. And term limits aint gunna do ya any good.

Yeah, the public sucks! Thats a nice campaign slogan for somebody: The public sucks! Fuck hope!

Where are all the bright, honest, intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way? \\nWe dont have people like that in this country.

This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago. This shit they shuffle around every four years? Pfft! Pfft!

They say, Well, if you dont vote you have no right to complain.

You caused the problem. You voted them in. You have no right to complain.\\nI, on the other handwho did not votewho did not votewho, in fact, did not even leave the house on Election Day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with.So, I know that a little later on this year youre gunna have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so  much [Bill Clinton v. Bob Dole]. You enjoy yourselves; itll be a lot of fun. Im sure as soon as the election is over your country will improve immediately.\\nAs for me, Ill be home on that day, doing essentially the same thing as you.

One thing I learned - or thought I did - is that the constitution created a republic that has 3 'co-equal' branches of government. Now if that is correct, a lot of the disfunction we have been seeing lately is due to the fact that some in congress seem to be forgetting that. To be exact, congress should never dream of taking direction from any president (or president-elect).When a president (or even just a president-elect) tries to tell congress what to do while making threats to punish lawmakers who don't obey, the republic starts to break. On the other hand, if the president doesn't like any law congress passes, all the president can do is veto it. Going further is unconstitutional as it breaches the 3 co-equal branches construct.It's not just the funding bill and the demand to eliminate the debt ceiling. The most onerous episode recently was the president-elect demanding that his nominees be given recess appointments, which would effectively take the senate out of its advice and consent role. If the senate was to cave on that, the republic is in serious trouble as senior positions would be filled with empty suits and the senate would have lost its relevance.However, there is hope, as the funding bill passed despite the threats. So if our congressmen and senators now realize they need to grow a pair and ignore the noise coming from the president elect and his toadies then we might be okay for the next few years - but not otherwise.","title":"Congress avoids a shutdown but leaves 'a big mess' for Trump and Republicans in 2025 | Another funding bill.

Even in the House special elections this year, Democrats outperformed Bidens 2020 numbers in all of them, yet when in the general election this same year, Democrats did 5-10 points worse than the special election. Like the last special election this year was NJ-10th, which Biden won with 78%. Democrats won the special election in September with 81%, but in the House election just two months later they got 74%.

There were some peaks and valleys, and then in 2021 it literally just went straight up and we don't really have to guess where the money went. Covid lasted way too long, illegal immigration, the green new \\"inflation reduction\\" act, and frankly, things just are more expensive. I have never seen inflation this sharp. The border was completely flooded with illegals on our dime. I live in a city affected by it. People all of a sudden sleeping in camps outside along the street. They filled police stations.

He was a prolific plagiarist, lied about his schooling, lied and STILL lies about being arrested with Nelson Mandela.

Reagan tripled the debt and raised taxes five of his eight years in office. Bush Jr. and Trump both exploded the deficit and no conservatives complained.

George Bush? Iran contra? Beirut? Grenada? Iraq? Supplying weapons to our enemies/Al Qaeda? The people instrumental in facilitating wars in the middle east? Are you serious? and I shouldn't have to keep asking you to recognize how a number of different factors play into this situation. Chiefly among them, a modern far right regime in Israel led by a cold, corrupt, warmonger with a record of disregarding diplomacy and a current Republican coalition of staunch and uncompromising, pro Israel islamophobes.This is not some alternative reality, it is history... Your reality however, seems to be clouded by your own prejudices and desperate need to lay the blame at the feet of one person in particular, while disregarding the multitude of factors and other players at work here. That is the lack of nuance and perspective here. Joe Biden did not start this conflict, he did not facilitate October 7th, he has not officially acknowledged internationally condemned settlements, he did not formerly recognize the annexation of the Golan Heights, he did not heighten provocations in the region by caving into Netanyahu's political pressures like Trump did, he did not exacerbate tensions by rerouting The US embassy in Israel, and subsequently, US diplomacy. Joe Biden, unlike his Republican counterparts belonging to Trump's MAGA coalition, has not repeatedly supported annexing the West Bank. Joe Biden has not supported military occupation and the dispossession of Palestinian land. Joe Biden *has* recognized however, that this is a humanitarian catastrophe and has, at the very least, sympathized with innocent Palestinian civilians while trying to grapple with a messy and complicated situation that the US has been involved in for decades. Joe Biden has also not repeatedly condemned Palestinians, he has not continuously promoted anti-muslim policies or rhetoric, he has not threatened the Palestinian community nor has he threatened to deport all pro-Palestinian demonstrators... In fact, it was while Joe Biden was vice president when The Obama administration began pushing back against Netanyahu, and in case you forgot, or you're uninformed on the matter, the response nearly tarnished the U.S's relationship with its allies.Joe Biden also did not tie his hands behind his back... He, at the very least has called for diplomacy and has recognized that the Palestinian people have rights and are undergoing a humanitarian crisis of their own. Instead of, you know, the course that a Trump administration has already taken/will take, which has/will be staunchly pro Israel in all matters. I shouldn't have to keep asking you to recognize how complicated this situation is, how foreign wars aren't just dictated by one man, how a number of different considerations have influenced the US.'s foreign policy after October 7th.And what were you expecting? October 7th was always going to be the impetus for a bold Israeli offensive, you can at least recognize that this goes both ways. And no matter who was president, the U.S. was never going to remain unresponsive to Israel's and especially Netanyahu's demands.","title":"Netanyahu says he spoke with Trump about need for victory, as Israeli government approves plan for Golan expansion"},{"text":"At least hes consistent.","title":"Trumps stunningly unqualified diplomatic team shapes up at breakneck speed"},{"text":"Its not theory.

There are all kinds systemic environmental barriers that keep people trapped in generational poverty and keep them from reaching their full potential. And being born into poverty and being born into wealth are just two sides of a coin that un-level the playing field. The idea that the state should have social services and robust welfare programs like WIC and Head Start and Pell Grants to level the playing field is not conservative. Conservatives believe that role should be filled by churches and private charities and benevolent philanthropists, or just with personal perseverance and grit. If they believe its a problem at all. So why would the other side of the coin, a tax to ensure people dont start with an unfair advantage be conservative? If you believe in bootstraps, yeah that means you dont believe in state programs to lift children out of poverty and give them a head start, but it also means you dont believe in state intervention to push children out of wealth and give them a handicap, because those two are effectively the same thing.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"She did, but she fucked it up.

It is, IMO, an obvious oversight to address the unique limitations on freedoms some populations face in an analysis on freedoms. Further, while Cato does have some (very paltry, mind you) articles about the \\"Don't say Gay\\" extravaganza, none of them decry this bill as a limitation to freedom, rather using it as an excuse to promote school choice and oppose government limitations on Disney's speech, respectively.

Bibi Netanyahu has been blamed by many for inciting this violence due to his inflammatory, ultra-nationalistic speeches he delivered during that time.That should have been the end of his career, but it wasn't.When he returned, he established himself as a strong man for the Israeli people, and since then, has spent years building a far-right coalition of flag waving war dogs who see no end to this conflict. In fact, their very careers rely on perpetuating conflict, while Bibi and his allies have made it clear that a two-state solution is no solution at all.October 7th and the aftermath was not just a continuation of this kind of *policy*, but also a continuation of heightened, violent conflicts that have been occurring over the course of the last 100 years. Joe Biden did not start this conflict, he did not facilitate October 7th, he has not officially acknowledged internationally condemned settlements, he did not formerly recognize the annexation of the Golan Heights, he did not heighten provocations in the region by caving into Netanyahu's political pressures like Trump did, he did not exacerbate tensions by rerouting The US embassy in Israel, and subsequently, US diplomacy.Joe Biden, unlike his Republican counterparts belonging to Trump's MAGA coalition, has not repeatedly supported annexing the West Bank. Joe Biden has not supported military occupation and the dispossession of Palestinian land.Joe Biden *has* recognized however, that this is a humanitarian catastrophe and has, at the very least, sympathized with innocent Palestinian civilians while trying to grapple with a messy and complicated situation that the US has been involved in for decades.Joe Biden has also not repeatedly condemned Palestinians, he has not continuously promoted anti-muslim policies or rhetoric, he has not threatened the Palestinian community nor has he threatened to deport all pro-Palestinian demonstrators...In fact, it was while Joe Biden was vice president when The Obama administration began pushing back against Netanyahu, and in case you forgot, or you're uninformed on the matter, the response nearly tarnished the U.S's relationship with its allies.And when Trump came along, Netanyahu was more than delighted to have an ally with a penchant for cozying up to violent autocrats, and a useful idiot that would provide uncompromising support in exchange for some flattery.This has never been a winning issue for Democrats. And as made clear by the countless examples I've tried to provide, an issue for president Biden that was made all the more complicated by not just a previous administration's foreign policies, but by this history of violence and Netanyahu's far right regime of warmongers who don't take kindly to any criticism whatsoever, and who disregard any diplomatic efforts that aren't in full support of increased provocations, military intervention and occupation, more settlements, etcetera...Joe Biden's position is naturally one of mediator, not instigator. He did not instigate October 7th, he did not instigate the Trump administration's contentious and interventionist actions, he did not instigate Netanyahu's pigheaded and warmongering agenda.And AGAIN, because of the history I've laid out, and because of the U.S.'s involvement in this war for half a century, any efforts from Biden to diplomatically intervene in a way that oversteps Netanyahu, or cuts across decades of policy, would not just be unheeded and unpopular, but shunned by Americans and international allies. A lot like Obama was.

Biden's role as a mediator during this stage of the war was made more challenging by not only the U.S's involvement in this conflict for over a half century, but also by the previous admin's position and its relationship with Netanyahu's coalition of far right jingoists.And I shouldn't have to explain why blaming Joe Biden for a recurring conflict that's part of a war that started after the signing of the Balfour Declaration in 1917 is a bit short sightedWhen Biden stepped into office, he was stuck in between a rock and a hard place. His role as peace broker was made more challenging by the U.S.'s complicity and involvement in this war for over half a century, while his position as a mediator was undermined by both the last administration's foreign policy and Netanyahu's appetite for conflict.This war was not carried out by the Biden administration. If you want to criticize the U.S.'s long standing, geopolitical partnership with Israel, that's fine, but if you take issue with Biden's \\"complicity\\" in that partnership, which was on some level, obligatory, consider that the alternative would have been far worse. You have the audacity to read my commentary, fail to understand how Trump and the last administration's policy was/is far less sympathetic towards Palestinians and peace, and then claim that going forward, everything will be Biden's fault, but you place no responsibility whatsoever on Trump/the previous administration, nor the far right coalition of aggressors actually overseeing the conflict, do you understand how contradictory this is?In other words, Biden is at fault for every problem or every escalation that preceded him, and he's also at fault for every conceivable problem that the *next* administration might also have a hand in?And precisely due to the US.'s long standing alliance with Israel, If Biden had, at any point refused aid, the backlash would have been much more severe than some indignant finger pointer on reddit hurling very broad and misplaced criticisms.","title":"Netanyahu says he spoke with Trump about need for victory, as Israeli government approves plan for Golan expansion"},{"text":"And yall will blame Biden for what Trump does in his presidency.

Let's look at some you examples.I don't endorse removing women from combat roles in the military if they meet the prerequisites outlined in the fitness examinations that are required for them. If a woman can meet those requirements then that is consistent with my view of meritocracy. I DO support the idea that women having children should be a cultural value. I would assert that women being valued as mothers is not a hierarchical juxtaposition that places women as subservient to men. Quite the opposite, I would say mothers should be revered as providing a uniquely valuable role and regarded as noble for their place in society as equal with a man or woman who contributes in the labor market, if not slightly more so.From a strictly utilitarian perspective, the average person produces a significant surplus of material value in their lifetime by performing basic tasks relative to the cost of providing fundamental material needs such as food and shelter. This is just a mathematical fact. People add surplus economic value by simply existing and having a job.While I am not a Christian, I DO think the push to abandon Christian values, particularly where it pertains to family values, is a mistake. If we REALLY want Equality, it is well documented that there is a much stronger correlation with scholastic achievement and parental support than there is with ethnicity, and by extension, the role that scholastic achievement plays in job opportunities. Rather than DEI initiatives, I would much rather see a return to supporting traditional family structures since they are PROVEN to generate the most scholastic success. The overwhelming majority of the failure of minorities in school systems can be attributed to the prevalence of absent fathers and broken families in their communities.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"The kind of talk from people who have lived in an absurd bubble of privilege their entire lives.","title":"Donald Trump Jr. calls for MAGA followers to make Republicans feel the pain until they fall in line"},{"text":"They are so dumb.
