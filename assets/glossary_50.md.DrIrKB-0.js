It's cracking beneath the weight of its hubristic, though good, intentions.  And it's cracking because of pure greed by the managers of it.  The U.S. can't stop it from falling even if it wanted to, and given our choice in leadership over the past dozen years, it doesn't want to.  There are two questions that remain:A.  How do we manage the collapse?B.  What replaces it?  What's the next world order?Biden tried a \\"Rip the band-aid slowly\\" method.  He also hoped to create a next world order where America's friends remain its friends, and receive all the benefits of friendship with America, and America slowly decouples economically from countries that are not America's friends.  It was working, but it was a process that Biden unfortunately doesn't get to carry out to the end.Trump, or probably more realistically, the people behind Trump, have different answers to those questions.  They see the next world order being a lot like the world order that existed before globalism and the international rules based order existed.  High tariffs breed high retaliatory tariffs, and make trade between countries, even friendly ones, difficult, so it becomes imperative that countries have access, within their borders, to all necessary economic resources.  They either need to own access to the resources directly, or through puppets.  This is nothing new for the world.  It's what we had before globalism.  We called it the colonialist era.  The Trump administration could be trying to bring back the colonialist era as their answer to what comes after globalism fails?If you look at Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal through that prism, that they're potential colonialist acquisitions in a world of high tariffs, the \\"Economic Security\\" reasoning for Trump's make much more sense, but also become much more frightening.It should be pretty self-explanatory as to why a colonialist American President would want the Panama Canal.  You just have to look at why the colonialist Presidents who built the canal took the land in the first place.  Greenland and the Canadian Shield have trillions of dollars in minerals and metals.  It's not economical to extract them because of the climate.  Here's where climate change enters the picture.  These places are going to be literal gold mines in 50 years or so as the global temperatures keep rising.  Also, they'll be iron mines.  And copper mines.  The countries that own those territories will be among the few winners of climate change.  So, when Trump talks about \\"Economic Security,\\" maybe it's just ridiculous bluster to distract us, I hope it is, but maybe, just maybe, he might be talking about that.","title":"Seth Meyers Dares Coward Trump to Make Good on Wild Threat"},{"text":"She sort of did.

It has been a large complaint over? all In the Americas that they have a history of pushing left leaning articles upon search first and other acts that seem to point to a left leaning political bias, whether this aligns as more right wing than Europe I guess is up to europeans but their is something to be waid about right wing individuals possibly not speaking up as much out of fear of being ostracized or having legal implications. You just consider that if laws have to be put in place against what your opposition can say you may be in a political echo chamber as well Americans maybe in a more propaganda pushes political echo chamber to the right?\\nTwitter famously had censoring issues in the past and was seen by both left and right wing Americans as suppressing alot of narratives they didn't agree with, this undoubtedly sparked musks interest in buying the company to appear as a social pariah to many Americans, probably not the best thing for American politics especially because he has somewhat backtracked with censorship of his own something that has agreeably been looked down upon by most people in the country, theirs a conspiracy argument to the Twitter files and something to be said about him being able to rid half the work force of the company upon acquiring ownership and it basically serving a similar function with much less censorship over all that kinda points to the censorship as a whole being largely true. Theirs another argument that the u.s government actively uses it to suppress narratives to their own people and censor key information sensitive to joe bidens election. It's largely in agreed on but it could be held in the same regard as trump paying a sex worker not to talk about her experience with him which he was tried with election interference for, either way you look at it both certainly committed these crimes to some extent, whether or not the federal government supported one is up to an individuals own determination based on sources and their own beliefs, the judiciary committee has at least confirmed the CIA helped suppress information regarding the laptop story in recent months so it's not that big of a stretch that they used Twitter as a tool in pushing left wing canidates??","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"Trump's like a character in my early teens' MAD Magazine.

That's not how trade works, moron. I'm not \\"losing\\" 100 a week to my local supermarket, just as a bakery isn't \\"losing\\" 1000 a month to the flour producer.

An 8 year old would understand this.\\n2. The reason the USA has more trade deficits than trade surpluses is because you're the largest advanced economy in the world, and your citizens have vast purchasing power. The only way for you to reverse this would be to become like China and get millions of citizens on slave wages. But funnily enough, you just ran a campaign promising to deport the millions of people that *are* working for low enough wages for those industries to be globally competitive.\\n3.

Ultimately if the ideas are so bad or our right nonsensical it should t be hard for you to prove these ideas wrong or garner support with your ideas in the long run, if you have general faith in humanity and don't believe a select few should control the narrative of the majority this is the only solution you really have , open discourse that allows fools to show how foolish they are and to trust humanity and it's good ideas to ultimately prevail and I think that's why their was such an explosion of enlightenment after the formation of the first Republics.

If Europeans don't like or agree with the ideals of twitter they can ultimately vote by not using it and maybe if everyone stops supporting it gradually it will die, in the meantime theirs much more neutral social platforms for you to spread the counter ideas without said moderation like this one and if your ideals ring true to people you will flourish, you should t have to censor the enemy of ideas because that only breeds resentment that festers into something far worse and drives people who were in the verge to siding with the censored side inherently.

We have steadily frittered away our human rights in order to keep conservatives from driving 330 million people into a chasm of flaming shit. The only progress made over that time has been made grudgingly through backdoor routes like budget reconciliation or the occasional court win. Those changes are fleeting, as SCOTUS has recently shown us. Much of the progress we thought we had made has been walked back, and what remains is on the chopping block.

Of course everyone would stop saving for a pension, which means that there would be even less capital available for investment.Finally, are you really serious about your proposal? The reason I ask is that it has zero probability of ever getting politically accepted. It's not like the elderly are some separate population that nobody cares about, but most of them are parents and grandparents that younger people do not want to see killed just because they are old. And of course everyone knows that they also will be old one day and don't really look forward to be killed (assuming that they are still living a healthy life, euthanasia for demented or terminally I'll is a different matter).

It took me 1 meeting of 5 min to get those pills (there was no heartbeat yet I discovered it very early) and I got supported/ validated / affirmed by at least 15 people there in one hour. Not ONE person ever told me I had a choice and I could also find support if I wanted to keep it; I was damn scared and felt ashamed. No one around (apart from my boyfriend at the time; now husband) supported me to keep it not even my family I had zero resources my parents were paying for my whole student life at the time and were threatening me to cut me off if I did not go ahead with it; there was so many conditions I felt the easy way was this. WORST decision of my damn life Im still in therapy 15 years later for what I did I regret it everyday and feel so damn shameful.That part is the part I wish pro choicer would talk about; the damn regret most women get after doing this is real almost every women I talked about told me they regretted it and still think about it.Bottoms line is I dont regret having a choice at the time and its true as weird as it seems HOWEVER I wished the system was different there.

Im seriously lost in between my past action and my (now) conservative views as a mother of 3 children. I wished I had been surrounded by people who encouraged me to keep my baby at the time. It was my decision after all and I made the wrong one. It will be on my mind until the day I die.Thanks for reading I dont get to talk a lot about this very personal topic since Im very ashamed of my past actions but sometimes its good to talk about controversial topics and see different views thats how the world progresses.","title":"Im a Canadian conservative but Im also pro choice."},{"text":"Can the French ask for the Statue of Liberty back?","title":"France warns Donald Trump against threatening EU sovereign borders"},{"text":"Nope.

While the US does pride itself on having such an advanced military, at the end of the day it comes down to having service members who are able to actually able to fight effectively with such hardware, and in some cases some of the things the US proudly highlights is also in use and known to their allies, the F-35 for instance.  As it stands right now, the IS military has been having recruitment issues for years now.  Issues that Republican and Trump's intentions will make vastly worse, as well as making the quality of said military vastly worse.  Purging the military of \\"undesireable\\" individuals and scaring off any potential new recruits.  Purging actually competent leadership who refuse to obey him, in favor of \\"generals like Hitlers\\", those who aren't actually competent and are only loyal to the party and especially to one man.  It would be to the point that any invasion of Greenland and subsequent conflict would mimic the later years Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as the US would very much need to start conscription to get bodies into uniforms to throw into the fight a wildly unpopular war.  And we've seen with Vietnam how drafting men to fight a war that the people very much did not believe the US should be fighting went.  Unwilling conscripts don't make good soldiers after all.  Advanced military hardware can only do so much to help an unwilling or incompetent soldier.  The only true concern would be the nuclear weapons, something major European nations are similarly equipped with, albeit to a lesser extent.  Of course they don't need the size of the US or Russia's arsenal to actually destroy the US population in the event of a nuclear war.  The main concern would of course be if the yesmen Trump would want filling the ranks of military leadership would actually follow through with their authorization of nukes, or if they would have enough of spine to not do the one action that would be a death sentence for the US (and you know, the world, but lets be real, the US would be the world to that type of person).","title":"France to Trump: EU wont let you invade Greenland"},{"text":"Who was the last politician who discussed annexing sovereign states?

Can anyone in the US verify if this congresswomans accident occurred? How about the recent mysterious death of congresswoman Jackie Walorskie, and two of her young staffers in a crazy car accident? Jackie &amp; Anne Hesch were working on a documentary together that was going to expose names of people involved child sex trafficking. \\nJackie and two staffers were driving on a highway when suddenly, their car mysteriously accelerated and crossed over the center median at a high rate of speed, crashing head on into another vehicle, killing that driver as well. Witnesses said that the car suddenly accelerated before crossing over &amp; crashing into a ball of flames.  Both accidents were about two weeks apart. There was also another high-profile government person involved in this documentary who also died in a mysterious car accident around this time. I forget his name though.\\nRumor has it that the control systems in their cars were hacked and taken over by assassins who didnt want this documentary released, which explains why their cars all suddenly accelerated before the crashes, with no signs of breaks being engaged, because the drivers no longer had control of their vehicles. The CIA &amp; others who use this tactic call this an undetectable assassination. The documentary was also going to cover the mysterious death of Isaac Kappy, who famously outed his best friend Seth Green, Tom Hanks and others in Hollywood as pedophiles.

The section of the [1977 Panama Canal Treaty](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm) regarding the permanent neutrality of the canal includes the following clause under Article V: After the termination of the Panama Canal Treaty, only the Republic of Panama shall operate the Canal and maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory. The US would be within it's rights to retake control of the Panama canal, by force if necessary, if the accusations of Chinese military presence near the canal are true.

This included the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic downturn, a nationwide reckoning on race, the outgoing presidents unwillingness to accept the election results and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.The United States ultimately upheld its long tradition of the peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20, 2021, and Biden began governing immediately with a substantial foundation of planning and personnel in place. This was in large measure due to months of preparation taken well in advance of the election, including contingency planning and the tireless efforts of many career agency executives, dedicated public servants within the Trump White House, and a Biden-Harris transition team that succeeded in building an impressive, well-resourced and organized transition\\nNonetheless, the events of 2020C21 revealed longstanding areas of fragility in the presidential transition process.Trumps refusal to concede the election led to a delay in ascertainmentthe formal decision that initiates the governments post-election financial and substantive support for the winning candidate. In addition to delaying funding and access to federal agencies, some members of the Trump administration were not fully cooperative with the incoming Biden team, further complicating matters.In previous transitions, some practices have been determined by law. Other major elements have been governed by norms and traditions. Sitting administrations helped a new administration prepare to take office regardless of party. While the Trump White House and federal agencies worked hard to meet the statutory transition planning requirements during the preelection period, Trumps doubts about the integrity of the election and, in some instances, the lack of cooperation from his administration after the election exposed areas where norms and precedents were not enough to ensure a seamless transfer of power.Trump did the same my dude.","title":"Trump: Biden doing everything possible to make transition difficult"},{"text":"Unless it just effects millenials","title":"Johnson says no cuts to Social Security and Medicare to fund Trump's agenda"},{"text":"It doesn't.

This could incur a massive nuclear buildup - which is dangerous for reasons beyond the increased potential for a nuclear exchange.

In that limited frame, it matters if a US-Europe conflict is as threatening or likely as future US-China conflicts. Despite what Trump may say for attention and flooding the zone with shit, potential US-Europe conflicts in the next 4 or more years are much less severe.Second, selected measures to restrict some social media usages are possible. The first laws to put age-limits on certain social media usages have been passed recently. If Musk on Twitter truly has such destructive influence, there are other ways. But are European liberals really unable to battle the bullshit? The victor in the battle of ideas cannot be legislated, it has to be settled through argument, concrete benefits, and outstanding memes. Third, I agree that the degree of US-centric thinking in Europe is annoying. For example, when George Floyd protests took place in Europe too many revealed they lived in the land of memes, not in the tangible world. But this is much broader than social media and would apply to NY Times or MCU movies too, or for that matter, it would raise doubts about the quality of civics education in Europe. It is therefore a different issue. Fourth, social media has benefits. It is an efficient way to spread information, which includes many useful and pleasurable things as well. A social media ban comes with a loss of opportunity and certain raised costs. Downsides of policies have to be considered as well.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"A lot of racist people have proudly come out of the closet in the last decade, it's very sad to see.

Cements the original impression that hes not a politician and lacks diplomacy to lead the nation with dignity and respect.

They value their autonomy and independence.As for the entertainment factor, hes not a clown in a circus.

And if hes serious, he needs to realize hes making more enemies than friends and ridiculing our nation. Just read any news outlet or forum from Greenland, Canada, and Panama. They want to be left alone.I obviously didnt vote for him, but I really do want to give him a chance to improve our situation here. I want the same thing as most people in the country: to be able to put food on the table, to be able to have a job that pays my bills, to feel safe in my community, for my children to have a world-class education, to be able to take care of my health without worrying about being indebted.

I'll just leave this here. First off, once a life is conceived, birth control has failed, and abortion can not be categorized as a form of birth control. In the US, allowing abortion is currently left up to each of the 50 states. There's some liability issues with physicians in pro-life states who are allowed to terminate an infants life in the case of a \\"medical emergency,\\" such as an ectopic or abnormal pregnancy. However, attempting to define a medical emergency is murky at best. Your abortion day idea is just ?. Have you even considered a gestation cut-off? At what point in gestation do you feel a life should end? Should a mother carrying a perfectly healthy child at 42 weeks be allowed to kill off the child before it is born? When the child could have been born as early as 32 weeks and survive without much assistance? Do you count viability when the first heartbeat is detected or when the first breath is drawn? Bipartisan efforts I wish the US would get behind:1. Extended paid maternity and paternity leave. \\n2. Tax credit of $1500 to $4000 during pregnancy, for citizens making under 150k. This would also help families pay for funeral expenses if a child is miscarried or stillborn. This could also cover post partum midwives and fertility specialists. \\n3. Tax credit for one of two parents (or a family member)  living together who stay home full-time to raise their children or care for a disabled or aging relative.\\n4. Reducing the cost of adoptions....\\n5.  Greater supports for mothers returning to work or college after extended leave to raise their children.As a mother to a child with ASD-ADHD, I can say that although autism is a wide spectrum, I believe MANY Americans and Canadians could fall into it if properly diagnosed.

The courts new majority obliged, handing down a controversial opinion in late spring that abruptly abandoned any role for state courts in policing gerrymandering, declaring that gerrymandering claims were non-justiciable political questions off limits to the judiciary.
