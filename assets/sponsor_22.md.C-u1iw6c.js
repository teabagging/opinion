The only reason the battle ground states are battle grounds, is because in those states, the cities and the rural areas populations are divided almost equally.  For every other state, either the cities represent the majority of the population, or the rural areas make up the majority of the population. The reason democrats would win every time if popular vote was counted, is because theres way more fucking people living in cities than there are people living rural. Its not like if every vote counted, a bunch of rural people would start voting. Statistically, republicans are far more likely to vote than democrats. By far.

Thats not a logic I agree with, but if you do, I think it makes more sense just to have a wealth tax than an income tax. (An income tax can be thought of as a consumption tax plus a tax on the proceeds of wealth.)Very high marginal income tax rates, like in the mid-20th century, I think it can be understood as a compromise between socialistic redistribution and the interests of old money.

That people have to be figuratively dragged to polls by the parties shows that people aren't particularly interested in their will being known.

It starts with a distrust of the \\"official story\\" of any topic because of a very real track record from the government in the past of lying, but then that fact gets latched on to by people with their own agendas. I remember seeing on foxnews that an argument of why you should be angry about something was the alegation that only republicans are talking about a topic and democrats wanted to keep the truth from you. Often times these were things not being talked about by \\"mainstream media\\" because they simply weren't true, or were massively misrepresented. The seperating of the right wing narrative from reality grew more and more over the years to the point where if people are still following them and believing its true, they are so deep in the web of lies that it seems almost impossible to pull them back out. You would have to unwind years and years of false narratives while at the same time exposing them to the realities of the right that was kept from them while they were being distracted by the latest lie or scary buzzword.

Donald Trump is a power hungry wannabe dictator and those who foolishly support him will once again find themselves thrown under the bus until it suites him. Just like last time.If he fails to win, he will declare himself the victor the minute the initial results start coming in.  In fact, he's already declaring himself the winner, despite the reality that his crowd sizes are smaller and he lacks the enthusiasm that he had in both 2016 and even in 2020.   After declaring himself the victor he will attempt to undermine the election even further, he will claim that the will of the people wasn't served because he didn't win.  Donald Trump has never admitted anything if it didn't serve himself.  He is incapable of empathy, and he is incapable of admitting a mistake. Never once has he accepted responsibility for anything in his entire life and he absolutely will not start doing it now at the ripe old age of 78.Anyone who pretends that man has a shred of decency in him hasn't watched him in action.  When 9/11 was still on everyone's screens he took to twitter to brag that now he had the tallest building... People were dying and all he cared about was building sizes.  That is the type of person Trump is, and the only person he cares about is himself.  He's a coward, so if he loses and he thinks he might go to jail he will run.  But not before trying to cause as much damage as he possibly can.  He learned for Cohn after all and he learned that if you can't win, claim the other guy cheated, while doing the cheating.  Most importantly never admit you've lost even when it's obvious because if you repeat a lie enough times people will start to believe it.","title":"Biden sets off a firestorm with his response to Trump rally comedian's Puerto Rico comments"},{"text":"Right lol getting downvoted cuz it doesnt fit their narrative.

You openly support facism because you live in some dream state that is somehow going to cause a revolution to begin, you would condemn our fighting brothers and sisters in the LGBT community or the immigrate population because you have a hairbrained scheme that no theory supports, all the while criticising someone from the comfort of your own house for trying to reduce harm. Fuck you.Fact 1: Donald Trump will make the situation in Palestine worse, far worse than Kammala, making it harder for anyone in the region to fight back against oppression. A vote for Trump or to sit this vote out is to hand a strategic advnatage to the enemy. Your decision will result in more death, more destruction. Make no mistake, it is a decision.Fact 2: Donald Trump will increase the suffering of people at home, comrades who have stood up to the situation in the middle east who are members of the targeted marginalized communities will be targeted even further meaning that their capacity to resist will be greatly demisioned, this is handing another stratigic advantage to our enemy. If anyone cannot see the problem with harm coming to the LGBT and immigrate classes under trump then you are not my ally, you are my enemyYou are falling for the same exact counter revolutionary propaganda that the Nazis distributed in WWII to divide the left so you are my enemy. A vote for Kamala, is does not have to be a vote for Kamala, It means that if you sit in your underwear at home and do nothing to protest after the vote, but if you actually go out, stop writing stupid shit from behind your computer screen you can make it what it's supposed to be.It can be a vote against Trump, it is to give our comrades a better chance to survive to fight another day, it is buying time. The vote is not about change it is about preventing comrades brothers and sisters from being condemned, If you, from your cusioned lifestyle, with not a care in the world, think that isn't worth it because you won't suffer the consquence, I hope they come for you next because they will eventually come for you, but by that point, all of us will be dead or if we're lucky will have fled successfully, and you won't have a voice to speak out against your treatment.Fact 3: Anyone who disagrees with this position is only in this movement for athestics and you should weed them out and kick them out of your group. They are corrupted individuals who care more about how they'll look voting for a horrible person than the lives they will potential save by voting against the Trump Facist regieme. If you care more about your looks, you have no place in any left wing movement, you are a neo-liberal, only here to make yourself look good because the left in trendy.If you are given the choice to reduce harm and choose to do nothing, you are a facist, period, there is no saving your soulFact 4: You are stupid if you think not voting for democrats is going to somehow get them to change their mind. You're even stupider if you think that the voting system FPTP isn't mathematically proven to suppress change, if you think about voting third party, just don't vote at all, you'll save yourself some time and at least be at home when you find out you've played yourself. You two are going to lead this country to a facist dictatorship, meanwhile all the real, good people are dead, enjoy living in such a distopia, I hope it hurts. I hope that as all the dead rest you live in fear, I hope that is your future.For those who actually want to change things, call these fucking liberals out.

Like I said, there are good reasons to believe that, if anything, the popular vote under the current system is under-counting democratic support. For example when you look at polls regarding certain policies like abortion, guns, and drugs the difference is even greater towards the type of policies that democrats typically run on. But of course polls and other ways of counting support are even less perfect. You're suggesting the popular vote is a bad indicator but you don't really have any reasons or methodology to suggest a different conclusion. It may not be perfectly accurate but it's not totally inaccurate either. The popular vote is not a perfect indicator but it's better than most. In fact, as far as polls go it's pretty good, where else are you going to get a 50-60% sample size? That's really frickin good. So really the issue isn't the sample size it's that it might not be randomized enough. But I'm sure a smart statistician could come up with a methodology or margin of error to correct for the bias that the current system induces. But at the end of the day they are still going to be using the popular vote data and it's probably going to about as close to the \\"true\\" support as you can get.","title":"CMV: The popular vote is not the best indicator of which candidate would win if the election was decided by the popular vote."},{"text":"I have daughters just old enough now to vote.

Your *best* case is we somehow don't end up sparking a global nuclear war, and a fascist America ushers in a new global status quo that is charitably described as \\"dystopian\\". Think \\"16th -19th century diplomacy and commerce but with nuclear weapons and drones this time\\".Also on the topic of civil war ...anyone that says a hypothetical pro-democracy movement can't fight the American MIC co-opted by a hypothetical fascist government has not payed attention to the fact that we *are* the American MIC and also, that other places that aren't the American MIC have won against it in sustained protracted engagements. American military doctrine is cripplingly over specialized on the assumption it will close out conflicts quickly, under a few years.Every single time that the USA has ever been forced to fight a protracted engagement, it has *failed*. Case in point: American involvement in WW1 was 19 months, American involvement in WW2 was four years. Compare this to what we did in places like Afghanistan(20 years), Vietnam (8 years),  or the the Korean War (Four Years). There's also the argument the American military was pretty ineffective against the protracted resistance of Native American groups across its history.By the end of WW2 the American military was significantly exhausted; there's a reason why there was such hasty expediency to use nuclear weapons in the first place, the American military was powerful and large, but that crushing weight of it was being felt back on the domestic economics and the American public at the time was very war weary.Basically: the American military is beatable. Its just going to look a lot more like the British \\"Troubles\\" than it is the 1st American civil war.Also I am to be clear, not advocating for violence, not advocating for the harm of others, not advocating in any way for civil war or for any form of armed conflict, nor wishing in any way for the harm of others. I am merely stating that... in short: dark times lie ahead, this is one of the possible futures, and that is a winnable future for a pro-democracy coalition, if it were to happen, due to the doctrinal inflexibility of the modern US military making it highly vulnerable to prolonged, low intensity conflicts.","title":"Democrats are beating Republicans in voter enthusiasm, even as swing-state polls show tight race"},{"text":"He looks like a republican to me... not!","title":"Pennsylvania man arrested after making bomb threat | Do you smell the Leftist desperation yet?"},{"text":"I haven't downvoted you (or upvoted anyone for that matter).I think we are using the same facts to make slightly different points.

California is a bit different because you don't just get one candidate from each party, you get the top two from the primaries, which can leave no republican on the ballot, and thus fewer republican voters who have no reason to even show up.

I have had several conversations going on this topic so I don't know what I said to who but I think advocacy is necessary and listening and learning is necessary. I just think much of the discussion is often centered on middle class politics. Workplace dynamics, gender and racial pay gaps, student debt relief, etc. The effect is that there is very little conversation going on about programs to help the poor and when there is the programs are ineffective and/or inefficient and firmly rooted in capitalist programs that largely just benefit the rich. Kamala Harris'  platform is good and it is strongest when it is universal programs. Universal pre-school, Minimum paid family leave, increased minimum wage, etc. Making space to discuss issues that only effect marginalized groups is important. With that said, I think much of is specific to spaces outside of politics. Not all of it but much of it. I think most of that needs to be done in workplaces, unions, neighborhoods, etc. Consider that offering robust public housing would allow for people to move into a far more inclusive setting. European style pay what you can afford buildings in highly desirable locations could generate income to maintain high quality and potentially hold events for residents. This would go a lot further than laws that complicate people's jobs or shoveling money and tax cuts into housing developers pockets like we do now while getting little success other than a bandaid on an inherent problem.

As soon as Biden expresses frustration or disappointment at the way the right behaves, they claim that he is a criminal or is losing his mind. It would be wonderful to see the law, and even public opinion applied in the same way to everyone. A couple points worth mentioning: Biden did not call all Trump voters 'garbage', he said that the only garbage he sees floating around are his supporters. Harris didn't call him Hitler, but many on the left have pointed out that he uses much of the same language as Hitler, down to the MSG event. The projection from the right is only surpassed by their inability to see that when it is the exact same from their side that it is fine, and nobody should worry about it. It appears that the right can form a line from speech to an action, ie. Biden says garbage and they all lose their minds as though he said it directly at each of them.

J6 claims are still that Trump didn't say exactly what the left are quoting and that he used the words 'peacefully and patriotically' as though that means that months of stirring up the base and telling them lies, inviting them to the capitol and then saying that they needed to fight like hell was all misconstrued and to only pay attention to the words peacefully and patriotically.","title":"Trump pounces on Biden's 'garbage' comment.

You would pay taxes on income minus contributions plus withdrawals.And while (almost) everyone recognizes that e.g. a 90% top marginal income tax rate is insane and counterproductive, there isnt the same kind of bound on a progressive consumption tax. Its not even bounded at 100%. Im not exactly advocating for it, but you could have a 300% tax on consumption over $10 million per year, for example.A consumption tax is also much fairer for people who have a highly variable income and make large amounts in one year and small amounts in others, or who have high incomes early in life (such as professional athletes, actors, FIRE people, etc.) but lower incomes later. As long as they keep their consumption low, they can smooth out the tax incidence over their lifetimes.Moreover, while some raise the point that all income is spent eventually, this is not necessarily true, or eventually can be a very long way off. To the extent that the rich earn and invest money, but dont spend it on their personal consumption (and give it to their heirs, who dont spend it on personal consumption), it essentially works to the benefit of everyone (not equally, of course, but in proportion to their share of consumption  but still!). So to the extent that you can discourage frivolous consumption without undermining the incentive to work, its a pretty good thing.Sometimes people get confused about this, because they are thinking in a misguided way about Keynesian demand stimulus. But the point of that is to act in a counter-cyclical manner, not to endorse naively Bastiats broken window fallacy (and from the perspective of everyone else, the money a billionaire spends on a yacht, etc., he might as well spend breaking windows).","title":"The Economist endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/voter-turnout-substantially-higher-battleground-states-spectator-statesVoting is significantly higher in battleground states.

The larger the enthusiasm gap is, the more the likely voter models will be off.

This phenomenon is known as \\"voter apathy,\\" and it leads to lower turnout rates among those who might otherwise support the alternative candidate who has no shot at winning the state. Consequently, this reduced turnout can skew the popular vote (not to mention a third-party candidate could really affect the numbers if given a chance.That's not what voter apathy is, no.I don't know why you're assuming that the voters not turning out would vote for what is the opposition party in that state.Why not assume they're people who would also vote for the popular candidate but feel safe in that they don't need to bother?Or who have some minor issue with the popular candidate but would vote for them if it were closer?The popular vote tends to be well reflected in national polling of registered voters -- which suggests it IS what the outcome would be if more registered voters turned out.","title":"CMV: The popular vote is not the best indicator of which candidate would win if the election was decided by the popular vote."},{"text":"They will claim its in alphabetical order","title":"Cali adds insurance to Dem ballot"},{"text":"Yup.

Any Republican president would have made similar judicial appointments.. not to mention that the Democrats had ample opportunity to codify abortion rights but chose to use it as a fundraising tool instead. 3. If the Democrats cared about Palestine, then they would insist that their candidates stop providing weapons and unwavering support to state sponsored terror. 4. If enough voters choose a third party over the Democrat candidate and thats enough to sway the election, a more reasonable conclusion would be for the Democrats to change their policies/platform/ candidates to win voter support. Shaming third party candidates and voters is anti-democratic and reeks of facism. 5. If Trump or Harris win, the US will still give unwavering support and weapons to a state sponsor of terror. 6. Trumps SC justices have ruled against him a few times, and again- if you understood original jurisdiction and the constitution, youd see the legal reason behind their rulings. If Democrats disagree with Republican judicial nominees then they should put up a candidate/platform to win over voters. Realistically, yeah either Trump or Harris will win this election.. but the two party duopoly didnt start overnight and cant be changed overnight. Short of a bloody revolution, itll take incremental changes decided on by voters who reject the two party system.

Unused land, consumption, and yes, even income. Europe's lower median work hours is partially caused by high income taxes making the marginal value of more work lower. Not everyone has the luxury of choosing to work fewer hours, but those that do, will, when income taxes are so high that the income they earn after tax from the extra work isn't worth it. It can mean promotions look less appealing if they promise more responsibilities and the additional pay isn't as attractive. Etc etc.Strictly speaking while consumption does stimulate and direct the economy in the short term, production defines its capacity to grow over the long term. So generally we want to tax consumption and not production.Moreover, consumption taxes are much easier to administer. In a hypothetical country with no income tax and only consumption tax, all tax reporting only has to be done by shop fronts. Much easier to audit, authenticate, which means less labor at the IRS, than having every single citizen's income streams tracked by the bureaucracy. Many of which are harder to track especially if done in cash.The problem of course is that this runs against most people's idea of fairness. Even though the rich do consume more than the rest of us and would pay more in tax, it would be directly proportional to their higher consumption, rather than to their ability to bear the burden of the state's operations.Some people actually do see consumption tax as naturally fair, and will smear notions to the contrary as simple jealousy of the rich rooted in emotion rather than logic, as well as naivety to the reality that the middle class absolutely needs to be taxed considerably to fund a welfare state. But while it may feel simple and intuitive to claim the burden of taxation should fall proportionally or equally onto all of us, it is equally valid to argue that the burden of maintaining the state's services should fall on those who can most afford to pay it. That is the moral argument for graduated taxation, that higher effective tax rates hurt the rich less.Income tax is appealing to tax graudators because it's a directly intuitive way to graduate the tax code, and they generally do not trust the \\"prebates\\" that consumption tax boosters promise can re-graduate the tax system. Even though it could theoretically work the political economy is too dangerous: people would rather have both the tax and welfare be graduated, than only one, even if the end result is still a graudated system, because it means even if one is attacked the other remains. That's valid, but there's an administrative cost we do accept in order to maintain that security and fairness about our tax system, that people who are less sympathetic to our view find wasteful and frivolous.Also, soapbox: income tax cliffs can easily be avoided by making the tax rate a continuous function: Your taxes are a(e^bx ) where x is your total income and a and b are balancing constants used to create the desired level of graduation.","title":"The Economist endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Was Willie Brown during this?","title":"How Kamalas career began: in her mid 20s, she dated Willie Brown, a California politician 30 years her senior"},{"text":" Until someone complains that they need the QR code generating softwareThat should be public open source so anyone can verify that the QR code does indeed reflect what they filled on their ballot.

If these rules are finalized as proposed, the Secretary of Education could waive up to the entire outstanding balance of a student loan when the Department determines a hardship is likely to impair the borrowers ability to fully repay the loan or render the costs of continued collection of the loan unjustified.These proposed regulations would reach borrowers with persistent financial burdens that prevent them from repaying their student loans and who do not sufficiently benefit from other currently available forgiveness options. Such financial burdens could include unexpected medical bills, high child care costs, significant expenses related to caring for loved ones with chronic illnesses, or devastating economic circumstances from the impacts of a natural disaster.  Forbearances and other assistance programs can help student loan borrowers cope with unanticipated expenses, job loss, and income disruptions in the short run. However, larger-scale disruptions can have persistent negative impacts for individuals. For example, natural disasters can have lasting consequences that may cause unexpected and long-term disruptions in a borrowers financial circumstances, even when the borrower may benefit from a forbearance or other support in the short term. Though many borrowers can and do recover, others can suffer from enduring challenges with delinquency and bankruptcy if they face limited access to options that help them recover from disasters.  Some student loan borrowers are likely to continue to feel the effects of these disasters in the following years as they rebuild their homes and lives - and those who were previously just getting by are much more likely to experience long-term hardship.*Two Pathways to Relief Under the Proposed Rules*If these rules, which were prepared following the Departments negotiated rulemaking session in February 2024, are finalized as proposed, millions of borrowers could access relief if they met the criteria specified through two different pathways for relief. The rulemaking committee reached consensus on the regulatory text in these proposed rules. The first pathway would recognize the Secretarys authority to grant individualized, automatic relief without an application. The Secretary could provide relief on a one-time basis to borrowers who the Department determines, based on a predictive assessment using existing borrower data, have at least an 80% chance of being in default within the next two years. The 17 non-exclusive factors that could be used for determining whether a borrower who is suffering hardship can qualify for relief include household income, assets, types and balances of student loans, debt balances and required payments relative to household income, Pell Grant recipient information, and more. The Secretary could then waive those loans to address hardships and prevent the severe consequences of default.  The second pathway would allow current and future cohorts of borrowers to receive relief based on a holistic assessment of the borrowers hardship and would be primarily application-based. The Department would holistically assess whether a borrower is highly likely to be in default or experience similarly severe negative and persistent circumstances. If no other payment relief option exists to sufficiently address the borrowers persistent hardship, the Secretary could waive the loan. The Secretary would stand up an application to begin to holistically assess borrower circumstances. Some factors that may be considered when holistically assessing borrower circumstances are also included in the proposed regulations.  By specifying pathways that authorize both automatic relief for millions of borrowers experiencing a qualifying hardship and a primarily application-based process for borrowers to obtain relief in the future, this proposal would support student loan borrowers for generations to come. Further, this action would authorize relief for many of the most at-risk borrowers.  For example, approximately two-thirds of borrowers eligible for individualized, automatic relief under the first pathway would be Pell Grant recipients.*Next steps*The proposed regulations will be published in the Federal Register in the upcoming weeks.  After the proposed regulations are published, the public may submit comments?through the Regulations.gov website for 30 days. The Department expects to finalize the regulations in 2025.*A Significant Track Record of Borrower Assistance*The Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant awardthe largest increase in a decadeand finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings.  In addition to the achievements listed above, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved debt relief for nearly 5 million borrowers through various actions, including: * $74 billion for over one million borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. By contrast, at the start of this Administration only 7,000 borrowers had been approved for PSLF. \\n* $56.5 billion for more than 1.4 million borrowers through Income-Driven Repayment. This includes administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment that brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding problems due to past inaccuracies and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. \\n* $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements.? \\n* $16.2 billion for almost 572,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:For far too long, our broken student loan system has made it too hard for borrowers experiencing heartbreaking and financially devastating hardships to access relief, and its not right, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The rules proposed by the Biden-Harris Administration today would provide hope to millions of struggling Americans whose challenges may make them eligible for student debt relief. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I will not stop fighting to deliver student debt relief and create a fairer, more just, and more affordable student loan system for all borrowers.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Releases Proposed Rules to Authorize Debt Relief to Nearly Eight Million Borrowers Experiencing Hardship"},{"text":"I'm an anti war, tree hugging, conservative.

It pisses them off and drives them to vote. To [pull up Hillary words once again](https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/): [...] I know there are only 60 days left to make our case  and dont get complacent, dont see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well hes done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment. You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? [Laughter/applause] **The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic  you name it.** And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people  now how 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks  they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America. But the other basket  and I know this because I see friends from all over America here  I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas  as well as, you know, New York and California  but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and theyre just desperate for change. It doesnt really even matter where it comes from. They dont buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They wont wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroine, feel like theyre in a dead-end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well. [...]The racists, xenophobes, etc are the ones in the basket. That's not elitism. The people that take it and twist it into \\"she said people that support him are either inherently deplorable because of their circumstances or deplorable simply for supporting him\\" is where that goes wrong. To be clear, she never should have said it, precisely because of how twistable it is and the inevitability that that would happen, but without the twisting it isn't elitism.Democrats are supposed to be the inclusive, nice team. If theyre assholes it normalizes the assholitry of the right. If you wrestle with a pig in the mud the pig has fun and you end up filthy.The reasonable interpretation is obviously, as he made clear by restating mid-sentence, that his supporter's (apostrophe s) demonization of those such as Puerto Ricans is garbage.

New ERA was made possible by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, which makes the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.New ERA program funding is available to member-owned rural electric cooperatives, which have been the backbone of Americas rural power delivery for nearly a century. Todays investment in rural co-ops will create good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for families in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.  \\n...  \\nToday in Westminster, Colorado, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Torres Small joined the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to highlight the benefits of the nearly $2.5 billion in financing, made possible by a combination of grants and loans through the program. Tri-States award is expected to reduce electricity rates 10 percent for cooperative members by 2034, amassing $430 million in rural consumer benefits over ten years. New ERA funds will finance the purchase of 1,040 megawatts of renewable energy and more than 200 megawatts of energy storage. New ERA funds will also help Tri-State refinance the retirement of 1,100 megawatts of previously and newly announced coal-fired energy generation. The investments will provide affordable, reliable, and resilient energy to Tri-State's cooperative members across Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This investment will reduce climate pollution by nearly 5.8 million tons annually. This transformative investment is expected to create more than 2,000 jobs.USDA also announced six electric cooperatives to move forward in the New ERA process. The six cooperatives are:* Connexus Energy, serving rural communities in Minnesota and South Dakota,\\n* Central Electric Power Cooperative Inc, serving rural communities in South Carolina,\\n* Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association Inc., serving rural communities in Colorado,\\n* Nebraska Electric Generation, serving rural communities in Nebraska,\\n* Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative serving rural communities in Texas, and\\n* Yampa Valley Electric Association, serving rural communities in ColoradoUSDA will be investing nearly $1 billion in grants and loans for these six new selectees, which will leverage investments of $6.4 billion for 1.75 gigawatts of clean energy for rural communities across the country. The selectees announced today will reduce and avoid at least 6.4 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.Including todays announcements, USDA has announced over $8.3 billion in funding as part of the New ERA program to benefit rural electric cooperatives and their members through the New ERA program. USDA expects this over $8.3 billion to result in over $13 billion in New ERA financed grants and loans. These projects will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for rural communities, significantly reduce pollution, enhance the resiliency of the nations electric grid, and advance the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative. One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments.*Farmer Benefit Plan*USDA also announced the release of a Farmer Benefit Plan as an innovative way for New ERA awardees to demonstrate ways for agricultural producers to benefit from clean energy projects. USDA encourages each award recipient to collaborate with local stakeholders to develop a Community Benefit Plan. During the first year of the award, applicants will collaborate with their communities and local farm associations to codevelop a plan. Based on the New ERA applications received so far, coops are collaborating with 154 local community groups, including 50 farm organizations, to explore local priorities.As part of their New ERA award, Tri-State will develop a Farmer Benefit Plan that aims to lower electricity costs for farmers who voluntarily participate in a smart irrigation program. The goal of the program is to reduce pumping load at the times of peak demand. This will help reduce future energy needs and offset the need to build new transmission and generation, saving cooperative members from future costs. Tri-State will work with farmers to execute additional energy programs to encourage the most efficient use of electricity and water and will provide no-cost technical support to enable participation in these opportunities. Tri-State will engage local farm associations for additional ideas as they move through the Community Benefits Plan process.*Investments from USDA Rural Development*USDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and healthcare; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.These investments made through the Inflation Reduction Act are powering the Biden-Harris Administrations efforts to make USDA programs more inclusive, accessible and available to more people than ever before so that these benefits are felt for generations to come. Many of these programs are also part of the Biden-Harris Administrations Justice40 Initiative, which is advancing environmental justice by ensuring that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments reach disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.   \\n...Statement from Secretary Vilsack:Since day one of his administration, President Biden has remained committed to ensuring rural communities are directly benefitting from a clean energy economy, Secretary Vilsack said. Through todays announcement, USDA is delivering on this commitment with critical funding from the Presidents historic Inflation Reduction Act. These projects will strengthen Americas energy security while increasing access to affordable and reliable clean energy for people across the nation.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Invests in Clean, More Affordable Energy for Seven Rural Electric Cooperatives from South Carolina to Colorado as Part of Investing in America Agenda | More Than $3 Billion in Clean Energy Financing Will Help Lower Energy Costs and Reduce Pollution for Rural Americans"},{"text":" Early vote has been disproportionately female, Charlie Kirk, head of Turning Point USA and helping to lead the Trump campaigns get-out-the-vote effort, posted on social media.

It can still have a chilling effect and harm international trade for Cuba, especially for smaller companies that don't know how to deal with the legal complexities and would rather just exclude that market than face potential punishments from the US.What legal complexities would a foreign company face in regard to **American law**? The legal complexities would primarily apply to American companies, some small company in China is not petrified at trading with Cuba because they fear of breaking the legal complexities of **American law**.?I never said it did. You're strawmanning. The inability to buy and sell other goods from the US still harms Cuba's ability to purchase food and medicine. That's basic economics.No, not quite. This is tantamount to saying that higher taxes on wealthy people must be causing them to be poor. After all you are taking their money!!! It?is true to assert that the lack of the ability to generate additional profit off trade in America limits the total absolute possible wealth Cuba could generate. But thats where it starts and ends, because it is exactly that, **additional profit**. It is wrong to assert that their destitution must literally be caused by the Embargo of a single nation, or even meaningful exacerbated by it.?The Venetians built a rich and advanced society on literal marshland, all without American support. Youre?telling me that Cuba is literally forced into destitution because it lacks *some* American trade when it has literally all of South America, and the world to trade with? That is incredulous.If the embargo isn't substantial for Cuba, why have it? Let me go smoke cigars and lay on the Cuban beaches if it doesn't affect Cuba.To further enrich an authoritarian regime?

Do you think an actual police state would let you make this post without punishment? And how is she responsible for the repeal of Roe? It was accomplished by the Republican Supreme Court majority that formed before she was elected Vice President; she could have done nothing to stop it. The only thing that *might* have saved Roe is enough people like you understanding who your real enemies are, and voting for Clinton back in 2016. One of the clearest lessons of that election was that if you sincerely care about abortion rights, you should always vote Democrat.The true lesson of the Nazi era is not the liberals are the true enemy. It is that *fascism must be stopped at any cost*.  The Nazis rose to power largely because a fractious left failed to unite against them. When a politician like Trump threatens democracy itself, you have to decide whether you value the preservation of democracy above your ideological differences with pro-democracy opposition.

Moreover, I think what she's trying to say in that interview is that she wants a  cure for whatever the cause is that leads people to feel disassociated from their sex (i.e. eliminating the need to transition).  Basically something like a pill that would remove the incongruity between one's sex and one's perceived sex, rather than an attempt to change one's sex.I don't really think that's feasible, and even if it was and readily available, trans people certainly deserve to be treated with human dignity.  But the idea itself is, even if misguided, not particularly far off from a standard reductionist approach to disease treatment (treat the symptoms when necessary but prevent the cause if possible).  The gender affirming modality prefers instead to treat the symptoms through affirmation, but does not hold that the cause needs to be addressed, for reasons that probably don't need elucidation.Taking the dignity part out of the equation because it is non-negotiable, I don't know what the correct medical approach to trans issues is.  It's not an easy question, despite the fact that everyone with any strong position is convinced of their righteousness.  Certainly though, exploring the topic from multiple mainstream medical perspectives is not the same thing as being anti trans.That being said, Joyce in that interview does seem somewhat obsessed with trans people in a way that I don't totally comprehend.

His top allies are increasingly boasting about sweeping new initiatives in politically perilous territory in the elections final days, even as they have a knifes-edge race to complete before they have a chance to enact any of them.Elon Musk is suddenly going into more detail about his planned position in a government efficiency commission for Trump, with talk of reducing annual spending by $2 trillion  a figure that would almost certainly require deep cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, even before trying to reconcile it with Trumps multi-trillion dollar tax promises. Not only that, hes been warning that the economy will suffer temporary hardship before voters see the benefits of a Trump/Musk agenda. That included a prediction that markets will tumble at first, he said on X, not something the Dow-obsessed Trump typically wants to hear.Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, reopened a simmering debate over the Affordable Care Act that other Republicans have been wary to discuss when he told a voter in Pennsylvania that overhauling health care would be a big part of the agenda next year. When the same voter followed up No Obamacare? Johnson replied: No Obamacare. The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and weve got a lot of ideas on how to do that.Finally, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  a critical Trump endorsement for voters on the margins of party politics  has been boasting about a massive promised role in the next Trump administration. On Monday, he said in a livestream that he would have control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH and a few others, and then also the USDA.Howard Lutnick, Trumps transition co-chair, told CNN Wednesday night that Kennedy would not lead the HHS while echoing Kennedys view that vaccines cause autism after a 2.5-hour meeting with him. The alleged link between vaccines and autism has been extensively studied and never proven.In each case, Democrats highlighted the remarks to feed existing attacks that a Trump campaign would slash social spending and empower unqualified or extreme loyalists. A DNC spokeswoman warned Trump would hand critical offices to an anti-science conspiracy theorist in Kennedy. The Harris campaign shared Musks temporary hardship quotes on social media, which fit into recent ads allied groups have run highlighting the billionaires influence on Trump. The campaign, which has attacked Trump for promising only vague concepts of a plan on health care, accused Johnson of revealing plans to take away health care benefits and protections for pre-existing conditions. Spokespersons for Trump and Johnson both denied to NBC News that either had committed to repealing the law.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/30/2024/donald-trumps-friends-are-making-big-plans-democrats-are-taking-notice?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Donald Trumps friends are making big plans.

The FT has a lot of high quality reporting, editorials, and analysis, but it also has more bad articles; I think the Economist is more consistent. Some of that could be attributed to the fact that FT is daily, while the Economist is weekly, meaning the latter more frequently goes into greater depth and tends to have more evergreen content (though the FT still has good long in-depth reads too). The Economist is a bit more international, the FT often has a UK or European-focused lens. I think the FT's comparative strength is in the novel scoops they get, and their analysis of business and technology-related things, so if thats what youre looking for you might get more out of the FT.FP and FA are quite different. Their focus is narrower, they're essentially specialist geopolitics &amp; international relations publications that generally reflect orthodox western foreign policy establishment thinking (I think FP probably has more hot takes in the name of ideological diversity). Sometimes they get opinion articles written by foreign policy officials themselves - FA had an essay by Blinken last month for instance. You won't find certain types of news that the Economist or FT cover (e.g business news, localised political news). They're dominated by global conflicts, diplomacy, political systems, and trade. They're not updating to report on current events as frequently, they tend to talk on the scale of countries rather than individuals, and in broader patterns rather than individual events.FA is more geopolitical analysis than news. Their content is long-form, in-depth, more academic and theoretical than the Economist. It's possibly in more depth than those without an intense interest in international affairs will appreciate. FP is less academic and more accessible in the sense it gives you a lot of digestible geopolitics news and opinion pieces. It has more breadth than FA but the shorter article length means it's often comparatively superficial.","title":"The Economist endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"If only romney was running this time","title":"Just a little reminder about what the polls looked like in 2012 right before Obama's 2nd landslide victory"},{"text":"As a non-American Im confused as to how this is allowed to happen.

I have a hypothesis that 1969 was the peak of progressivism/socialism in the United States, then the U.S. establishment (ie - the capitalists) were infuriated that they lost the youth, so around 1970 or so they moved on the offensive and have been gaining ground since.Things like the Powell Memo from 1971 prove there was an effort to turn universities around.Cornell West, before he sold out this election, used to talk around a decade ago about \\"The Counter-Revolution\\" that the establishment waged after the many leftist/progessive/socialist victories of the 1960's. He doesn't talk about that very much anymore, btw. But I think he was on to something.Then Reagan actually got elected, demonstrating the success of the counter-revolution. And we can all see that the capitalists have strengthened since then, and the number of billionaires has been accelerating as the working class gets bombarded with opiods.I believe there's been another such counter-revolution effort after the glorious uprisings of 2020. Notice that in early 2021 the \\"ESG\\" (Environmental, Social, corporate Governance) movement arose, explaining to us that capitalist corporations can be environmentally and socially responsible without the need for government regulations or democratic pressure. And this was in tandem with media bombardment of \\"copaganda\\", showing us herioc police officers doing all kinds of good works throughout every American community. I've talked to hippies who were part of movements in the 60's and 70's and they've told me about how after 9/11, some of their old protest buddies were driving around in SUV's with American flags on the antenna's. It can seem hopeless and demoralizing at times knowing that the American people just keep falling in line with their capitalist overlords.But I think being aware of the counter-revolutions of 1970 and 2021, both coming after massive protest and uprising periods, can show people that this movement to the right politically was not natural or organic in any way, but actually centrally planned by billionaires sitting around a table scheming about how they're going to conquer the people.We have a \\"truth matters\\" movement now, and many people claiming to be for \\"critical thinking\\". This is hilarious to me because there are so many lies from the capitalists that if they actually facilitate a culture of using logic to arrive at the truth, and a populace actually capable of critical thinking, this is armageddon for capitalism.We have some good vectors of attack right now. I may be just another starry-eyed hopeful who will get ruined, but living without hope to defeat this evil is no way to live.We can win against these guys. We have what we need.

Cubas primary issue, is the Cuban regime. The American embargo may put a small cap on the total wealth the regime can generate, but it is ridiculous to assert that it is a major or even main cause for the regimes destitution. The regime itself is the problem. Anything else is just cope.If the embargo isn't substantial for Cuba, why have it?

The only time I had strayed from the straight dem ticket was carrying petitions to get Anderson on the ballot in '80. But 2016 very decisively ended that, and was a bit of an agonizing eye-opener about the party and its machinations. It certainly reinforced Hunter S.

Who is going to explain in 1976 that all the people who felt they got burned in '72 should \\"try again\\" for another bogus challenger? Four years from now there will be two entire generations - between the ages of twenty-two and forty - who will not give a hoot in hell about *any* election, and their apathy will be rooted in personal experience. Four years from now it will be very difficult to convince anybody who has gone from Johnson/Goldwater to Humphrey/Nixon to Nixon/Muskie that there is any possible reason for getting involved in another *bullshit* election...Credulity is the only reason the dems get any votes from progressives, at this point: the fact that they only dust off \\"progressive\\" talking points as part of their cynical pandering-for-vote strategies can no longer be denied, or ignored.

Id go as far as to say that that is a class of workers.The law excludes certain food service workers first off. So even if we changed the definition of the word class to suit your point it doesn't apply. But because theyre mostly women of colour its a bad thing?No, it's unnecessarily derisive. The effort went in to helping one group who deserves a better standard of living but left out other people who deserve better standards of living. Also, it doesn't even really specifically target the group the legislators were attempting to target. There are plenty of people who don't fall into that group and the wage increase could potentially have the effect of drawing more qualified white male workers into those positions, thus locking out women of color in the future.My point in bringing it up is that whenever people talk about class based policy, the response (which the person saying it is always just assuming) is always, there is no reason why they can't do both support identity based and class based policies. Well this is an example of a state government going out of it's way to not do both. The law that includes all workers is far more simple to write and takes less work. They went out of their way to exclude people. They had to define things and categorize certain types of businesses. I think this is the future of America's Democratic policy and it's just silly.","title":"CMV: Anyone who demands allyship from others is incredibly naive or a  narcissist."},{"text":"Agree.

Im not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and dont trust most politicians, Schwarzenegger wrote Wednesday in a lengthy post on the social platform X.I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor, the Terminator star continued. Schwarzenegger served as California governor from 2003-11.Let me be honest with you: I dont like either party right now. My Republicans have forgotten the beauty of the free market, driven up deficits, and rejected election results. Democrats arent any better at dealing with deficits, and I worry about their local policies hurting our cities with increased crime, Schwarzenegger, 77, said.It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isnt addicted to this crap, you probably understand. I want to tune out. But I cant, he added.Without naming Trump, Schwarzenegger took aim at the former president, telling his 5 million followers that rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets.To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America  a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious, he said.And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. Thats why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, Schwarzenegger said.Im sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do. You dont recognize our country. And you are right to be furious, he went on, adding that Washington does nothing about issues, including the national debt and immigration reform.The only people that benefit from this crap are the politicians who prefer having talking points to win elections to the public service that will make Americans lives better. It is a just game to them. But it is life for my fellow Americans. We should be pissed! Schwarzenegger said.Offering a blistering condemnation of Trump and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, Schwarzenegger said, But a candidate who wont respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  that wont solve our problems.It will just be four more years of bulls with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful, the ex-bodybuilder, who was born in Austria and became a U.S. citizen in 1983, said.Schwarzenegger has been a vocal critic of Trump over the years.The 45th president and Schwarzenegger engaged in a war of words in 2017, when the former action movie star replaced Trump as host of the reality TV competition The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump repeatedly mocked Schwarzeneggers ratings as the new face of the NBC series.We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump wont do that, Schwarzenegger said in his social media post Wednesday.He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and Walz, Schwarzenegger said.Urging Americans to vote this week, Schwarzenegger urged them to, Turn the page and put this junk behind us.

Some will dismiss this as alarmism. It is true that our worst fears about Mr Trumps first term did not come to pass.Really? Their worst fears must have been really bad because I don't think I had \\"would attempt a coup\\" among my fears when Trump was elected. He was absolutely more dangerous than expected. At home, he cut taxes and deregulated the economy, which has grown faster than any of its rich-world counterparts.Which had little to do with his policies. Growth between 2017-2019 was basically indistinguishable from growth between 2014-2016. The US economy has continued to outpace it's peers with Democrats in charge. His tax cuts had minor positive growth effects. His tariffs had minor negative growth effects. Abroad, he projected strength, shifting the consensus towards a confrontational posture on China.The pivot to asia pre-dated Trump. He only 'projected' strength in that he shouted like an unruly toddler a lot. Like most Trump policies, his foreign policy in Asia was completely incoherent and ineffective. - He provoked a diplomatic crisis with NK because he got bored on Twitter. Then held a direct summit with Kim, a major prestige win for Kim. He undermined our regional allies by temporarily ordering the evacuation of US troops from SK as part of the negotiation. Then, as usual, he accomplished nothing, declared victory and went home - the crisis resolved by Trump agreeing to stop being an idiot and the opposition conceding nothing meaningful. Trump still gushes about Kim and his love letters.- He started a trade war with China. After China retaliated, he held a meeting with Xi, accomplished nothing and declared victory. He agreed to end the trade war and China agreed to a bunch of promises that they were never going to keep (and didn't).Trump was legitimately one of the weakest Presidents we've ever had. Our opposition learned they just need to wait for him to get bored or call him a good boy and then he'll roll over for you. He prodded some of Americas allies to increase their defence spending.Whatever prodding he may have done, he didn't actually get meaningful spending increases. The only meaningful spending increases we've seen were in response to the war in Ukraine. Trump had less effect on increasing NATO spending that Biden did (by admitting Norway and Sweden) or Obama did (formalizing the 2% target). As usual Trump gets credit for yelling loudly about something regardless of actual results. Even when Mr Trump behaved abominably by fomenting an attack on the Capitol to try to stop the transfer of power on January 6th 2021, Americas institutions held firm.Just wanted to circle back around to re-emphasize that apparently 'fomenting an attack on the Capitol to try to stop the transfer of power' didn't constitute The Economist's worst fears for a Trump term.","title":"The Economist endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Its a disaster for the entire world to have an American President who believes that climate change is a hoax","title":"Its not just Democrats who fear a Trump victory C it would be a disaster for Europe too"},{"text":"Why is calling for more regulation forcing people to live a certain way?","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"I'll dead name Twitter as long as Elon dead names his daughter.","title":"Elon Musk-backed group posting fake Kamala Harris ads on Facebook"},{"text":"How can we have a foreign billionaire interfering with an election and so nothing.","title":"Elon Musk-backed group posting fake Kamala Harris ads on Facebook"},{"text":"...sounds like you gotta keeper!","title":"Wife is voting Trump.. this is a bigger deal than it appears."},{"text":"The same people complaining about Taylor Swift using a personal jet to fly for performances are the same group of idiots who cheer on driving around a Diesel fueled truck going nowhere","title":"Dementia Don's GOP"},{"text":"Gramps is likely to be of the Woodstock generation and at least as familiar with weed (and other products of the tune in, turn on, drop out era) as you are, sonny.","title":"To my U.S. audience: whoever you vote for DON'T vote for Kamala Harris!

Sensationalism is what sells and the media is only in the business of selling anymore. To your ideas:Transparent pricing - Im with you (Im in healthcare too) but its not enough. As you know the total cost of healthcare  is rarely known at the start and patients are not the best decision makers (or given the case may not be even able to weigh in on the decision). For an elective sure it pays to be transparent, but for anything else its pretty hard. Transparency would help. Normalization around procedures between practices also help in making apple to apple comparisons.Deficit - interesting idea tying deficit to eligibility. The problem is we run a deficit economy and were unwilling to make trade offs. Politicians sell cutting social services all the time (especially ones that hurt others) but almost never talk about cutbacks in military spending. Id suggest that public government certified audits of every dollar spent becomes federal law. That experts (not politicans nor courts) decide the budget spend. For example many a military decision maker has suggested cutting spending (or redirecting) from wasteful programs to more efficient or just straight eliminated, yet we have politicians who order extra ships/planes/tanks the military doesnt need or wont matter in a future war. Term limits - yes. Also should ban owning direct stocks by a poltician or any immediate family member, full and accurate financial disclosures for immediate family, no direct business interests, mandatory retirement age, must vote in 80% of all bills, no pay raise without adjusting the federal minimum wage, full audit of all expenses, no back door political loans to their own campaigns, and banned from being a lobbyist or serving on corporate board for 7 years after leaving office.","title":"Steve Rattner: Trump says U.S. economy is in the toilet but it grew faster under Biden than under Trump"},{"text":"They cant.

It's only neutrality if you focus on the law and not party. If you are afraid of coming down on one party more than the others simply because they commit more crimes you are not being neutral. You are actually being biased because you let one party off the hook for the sake of **appearing** neutral, rather than actually being neutral. For example if the people on the east side of a town commit 60% of the crime, you might appear to be arresting twice as many Easterners as you do Westerners. But if you are only doing so because of the crimes they committed you're still being neutral, it just appears that way because times are inordinately more common in that area. If you decide to not arrest half the crimes committed by people from the east side so it creates an appearance of neutrality, you're actually creating a bias because you're letting more people off the hook depending on where they live. You're actually creating a bias by worrying about the idea of looking biased.","title":"Elon Musk-backed group posting fake Kamala Harris ads on Facebook"},{"text":"I honestly don't understand the actual argument.I can sorta understand the idea that a person placing a huge bet \\"must be really sure\\" or \\"they must know something I don't\\" but that only gets you so far.

Why are men's issues only important when men try to victimize themselves against feminazis? If anything, Harris's economic policies are helping men, men are falling behind in college, harris and the democrats are more likely to pass legislation forgiving student loans. Trump plans to deport millions of immigrants which would leave a hole in the labor force, causing inflation, will men run in droves to work in the fields for low pay? Trump wants to impose high tariffs on imported goods, again causing inflation. Those same countries will put tariffs on our goods, elevating the prices and making the end of the month harder to pass. There are women out there who would prefer being at home wives, but the economic situation makes it impossible to survive in one income, with a lack of education, inflation, and high tariffs I doubt these dreams men hold for a traditional family will ever come true. People like to complain about taxes now, even though we're still under trumps tax code, well imagine these same taxes with added inflation and economic/social disturbance. The democrats are also more likely than republicans to pass childcare legislation to help build families, they're more likely to legislate maternity and paternity leave. If you want democrats to force women to have babies and get married, they won't. If you want democrats to assign each man a woman, they wont. Women are people who should be free to make their own choices on who they choose to love. If anything, feminism is good for men, they destroy the notion that sex = your worth as a man, which so many toxic podcasts in the manosphere try to brand men as, herding them around with hatred of women.

The bets, placed on prediction platform Polymarket, appear to have skewed the odds massively in Trumps favour on the site, with the total figure representing roughly 2 per cent of all bets placed on the 2024 elections.Polymarket, which is backed by billionaire Trump-supporter Peter Thiel, allows people to bet on the outcome of future events using cryptocurrency. Currently only users outside the US are able to use it to bet on the US elections, though the semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, combined with technologies like virtual private networks (VPNs), make it possible to bypass the platforms terms of service.Online betting markets have already placed TV ads during Trump rallies, with Kalshi offering viewers of Right Side Broadcasting Network $175 from a $100 bet on a victory for the Republican candidate.

If you are a moral relativist, you must admit that democracy isn't?*inherently*?any more moral than monarchy or dictatorship, and it's in fact a matter of personal preference and subjective moral codes.I'm not sure how the morality of the whims of a monarchy or dictatorship, where most citizens have no say over the laws being made, compares to a democracy, where people have say over who writes and enforces the laws.In he case of a monarchy or dictatorship, the laws are clearly being written by the controlling faction to their own benefit (not to defend the system of government but to keep themselves in power personally), with very little regard for the wellbeing of the citizens. In the case where the ruler is a bad actor, this will inevitably lead to government violence against any sort of citizen protest, again not to defend a government or way of life but to keep a specific person in power.  The only option for dissent in such a system is to take out the monarchy and declare a new one, and the whole thing starts again.In a democracy, we've purposefully set up a nonviolent means for citizens to change their leaders and lawmakers, severely cutting down on the number of violent uprisings and revolutions that are necessary.  The government is still the ultimate enforcer and violence is still necessary to suppress government overthrow, but if the system is healthy you don't have to have a violent revolution every time there's a deranged lunatic that manages to capture the office.  This is also where checks and balances to come in to keep that damage contained so that the bad actor can be voted out.In practice this isn't perfect.  There are still ways that bad actors can manipulate such a system, and with enough accumulated damage the democracy can be compromised.  But the issues are not inherent to the system to the same degree that they are in a monarchy or a dictatorship.","title":"CMV: The world runs on 'might is right' and most people support it"},{"text":"Maybe we all could have benefited from abortion if HER MOTHER would have had one. ??","title":"Michelle Obama: Without abortion, men won't go to college and women will 'die during childbirth'"},{"text":"Wonder why zuckerfuck is allowing it.....","title":"Elon Musk-backed group posting fake Kamala Harris ads on Facebook"},{"text":"These self proclaimed \\"alpha males\\" are truly some of the biggest snowflakes I've ever seen.

I know I've said this in other posts, but it needs to be said more often: after every U.S. election the talking heads declare that \\"the people have spoken\\" and \\"there's a popular mandate\\" that we must all obey, lest we act against America's democracy.The mainstream media and our politicians absolutely do not acknowledge any of our protest votes. We have what's called \\"winner-take-all\\" elections, and our \\"leaders\\" are always happy to grab it all if their side happens to get more votes.I have a long and established history of voting Democrat and have had a local Democrat party operative tell me what their database says is my probability of voting the next election, and it's very high.The Democrats have treated us like absolute garbage, especially after losing to Trump in 2016. Bernie Sander sold out and surrendered quickly and easily to Hillary with no protest. We have no \\"protest vote\\". Then in 2017 Democrats teamed up with Google to remove all alternative left websites from fair rankings in Google search results, and they suffered around 70% decline in donations that year, yes that's right, in less than a year democrats demolished traffick and revenue to alternative left websites, all in the name of \\"protecting us from Russian disinformation\\".Then the Democrats rampaged across the Internet and conquered every substinally-sized place people can discuss politics, aside from anything already under the control of Republicans (who conquered their spheres of influence 23 years ago after 9/11 and became especially tyrannical after invading and occupying Iraq in 2003). All of Russiagate, the pandemic lies, then supporting literal Nazis in Ukraine, all 3 nonstop misinformation/disinformation whatever you want to call it.Massive redistribution of wealth during the pandemic. Inflation for us and more cash for the rich. The increased cost of living for us while the wealth of corporations climbs and their \\"cash in hand\\" climbs.The ridiculousness of gender identity and rest of identity politics. Forcing DEI in all movies and tv shows, ridiculous female heroes all over the place that aren't even convincing or believable. The Pentagon lying to us about UFO's that they now call \\"flying tic-tacs\\" just to probe the media to see what kind of bullshit they can get away with to our faces, seeing how gullible the American public is, then after verifying yup Americans are hilariously gullible, backing literal Nazis in Ukraine, saying in Feb 2022 in the New York Times to ignore any videos of Ukrainian soldiers committing genocide on Russians in the Donbas because their intelligence indicates the Russians are about to pay actors to put red paint on themselves and pretend to be suffering, and that we can just laugh off these genocide videos because it's all fake news.This is total tyranny by Democrats.Too much shit to mention. I'm not voting Democrat anymore.If the Republicans win with a minority of votes, they cannot be said to have \\"a popular mandate\\".

And now I can sit back and watch the fun as the Dem footsoldiers do their usual and expected voter-shaming dance in the last few days. As Simplicius notes, the dems with the money would appear to have pretty much given up at this point, and I assume that they are simply dividing up what remains of the donated war chest loot among themselves (administrative costs, you know). The only remaining activity seems to be the footsoldiers, who by and large appear to be just carrying out the last orders they were issued before the management absconded.That's right, dems- I did not vote for your candidate. And you might be amazed to hear that there was not a single mark on my ballot anywhere near the Trump box (or any other repub ballot line, for that matter). The dems are once again standing on the dizzying precipice that awaits those who snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, by the simple expedient of running yet another unelectable candidate. Again. Hear this: If the dems lose to the convicted-felon carnival sideshow barker, again, it will be entirely because they ran an unelectable candidate. Again. And the book Harris will undoubtedly have ghostwritten for her afterwards will be entitled \\"What Happened- Again\\". She can probably get a volume discount from HRC's ghostwriters- all they will need to do is change a few sentences here and there. Perhaps, just perhaps, it might be time for you dems to stop haranguing people who voted for someone that they found matched their values more closely, and *start haranguing the management of your own party*. You would think that said management would have noticed, by now, that people simply are no longer buying what they are selling. They are apparently quite uneducable, so that is likely to take a great deal of effort on your part. Best start now.Or, perhaps you could put the haranguing on the shelf entirely, and try to reach out to the roughly 50% of eligible voters who *don't bother to vote at all*. One would think that a party with Big Populist Ideas would be able to motivate some of them to get out and vote. Wouldn't that be novel: a political party that actually does something *positive* for the electorate, instead of repeatedly shrieking about the world ending if their favored empty suit doesn't win?Many of us were very concerned when Harris was picked to run as Biden's VP in '20, because we thought that she was the last possible person they should have picked to be \\"a heartbeat from the presidency\\". The party and their media stenographers have been doing all they can to make sure that the horror many of us felt about her in '20 is pushed down the memory hole as fast as possible. But many of us **remember**, especially those of us who lived in California during her ascendence.She apparently was picked in '20 to marginally tick a few culture-war/IDPol boxes, but primarily to be an insurance policy to prevent political attacks against Biden. Because *who in their right mind* would want her as a president? The thought is amazingly laughable: she's clearly dumber than Dan Quayle, and has no apparent policy positions. The only thing that she emits when she opens her mouth are gobbets of half-digested word-salad that are utterly meaningless at best, and stunningly stupid at worst. And throw in the odd psychotic cackle to make a real dog's breakfast, of course.Many of us were never going to vote for her under any circumstances, and we told whoever would listen exactly that at the time. And we have continued to do so, repeatedly, ever since. This should have been an easily-winnable election for the dems, again. Just like last time. All they had to do was run an electable candidate. Can't *wait* to see what sort of *dreck* they drag out of the party's gutters to run against some utterly horrible repub, next cycle; and how they contrive to lose.

The inflation and the border and economy is what is killing us.  When Trump was president he put a stop to illegals crossing the border.  I watch Fox News quite a bit and when Harris speaks its like she \\"needs\\" a teleprompter whereas Trump speaks from the heart. He has a mission and a plan that is going to make America Great Again. He has proven that.  Heck, the man had attempts on his life and he is still going strong.  Countries like Russia and other ones he kept them at bay. When \\"Sleepy Joe\\" came into office that is where you see them going after Ukraine and Israel.  They deemed our country as weak.  Makes me sad that most Americans don't seem to care that our country is going into the Stone Age.  I've been a Republican my whole life and I voted last week here in TN.

The state has a monopoly on violence, yes, but not all state violence is considered right - many oppose the death penalty, for instance. Many view any war except a war of defence illegitimate.

The world can only fit a certain number of tech giants, and with advancements, they can continue to automate and downsize their staff.

If they dont certify by 12/11 then speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, can choose to extend the deadline or not allow that state to be included in the electoral college, therefore lowering the number of electoral college votes needed to win. If Trump wins the right states and gets the others to not certify then he could win with less than 270 electoral college votes. Notice how hes not hanging out much in Arizona? I think he knows they are gone but thinks he can manipulate the state to not certify. Wisconsin is another one, though he spent a fair amount of time there recently, that he could lose but the state officials are loony enough to not certify. Hes crying foul in Pennsylvania now not because he thinks he can run the same scheme there but to set the tone in those other states on what the messaging is going to be on why they cant certify if Trump loses their state. Everything will get tossed around in courts and Trumps plan is to get it escalated to the Supreme Court where he has the advantage. It would be interesting to see if that happens though as election matters are state issues so he would also need to exert influence on the states judicial system to kick it to the Supreme Court in the states that choose not to certify. It sucks to say but they are trying to cheat at the chess game of our democracy by finding every loophole in our system of checks and balances to subvert the will of the people. We could be living in a time where the system fails and democracy falls to just an illusion. Or we could prove the hypothesis that our founders set forth for our democracy that it can withstand attacks on the system and its people, and come out stronger in the end.","title":"Why Kamala Harriss chances of victory just jumped"},{"text":"Considering the women who dont have access to it are dead, maybe you should reevaluate.

Admittedly, the Q phenomenon is something that has continued to intrigue me because there are provable elements that correlate to reality we can see but they are wrapped in an incredible cloud of complete bunk.  If you look back to the very first Q drops, the original claim was that Q is a US military operation to take down a highly organized world-wide human trafficking and pedophilia ring that tied into the highest levels of government, international finance and the Entertainment Industry. That was it. Now, what can we see in verifiable reality and current events over the past couple of years that suggest there could be some truth to it? - Q is a very real, high-level clearance used by the US Military.  - The arrest and definitely not suicide of Jeffery Epstein and G. Maxwell, Which caused fall out to people like Prince Andrew being ousted from the Royal family and Melinda Gates stating that a primary reason for divorcing Bill was his very close friendship with Epstein. Plus, theres the whole list of famous names who visited his sicko island. - The arrest and pending charges for P Diddy that looks like it is also likely to take down a bunch of celebrities.  - The quiet deaths of two prominent central bankers, one in England and one in France who just so happen to share that now infamous last name thats whispered about in conspiracy corners all over the web almost exclusively associated with Banking.

But in the dead-heat election of 2024, that may no longer be true. The distinctive dynamics of the 2024 campaign could allow Kamala Harris to eke out an Electoral College win even if Donald Trump runs better in the national popular vote this time than during his previous two campaigns.The belief that Democrats need a big popular-vote win to prevail in the electoral vote hardened in the course of those two previous Trump campaigns. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump by a resounding 4.5 percentage points in the popular vote but still only squeezed past him by relatively small margins in the three Rust Belt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that decided the race. In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump by two points in the national popular vote but narrowly lost those same three states, and with them the presidency.That history has weighed heavily on Democrats as a procession of recent polls has shown Trump shrinking or even erasing Harriss national lead. But the pattern of differences among white, Black, and Latino voters found in most of those national surveys show how Harris could still potentially capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victoryeven if she wins the nationwide popular vote by much less than Biden did in 2020, and possibly by only about the same margin that Clinton got in 2016.The principal reason is that these recent polls show Trump making most of his gains in national support by performing better among Black and, especially, Latino voters than he did in either of those previous elections. Even the most favorable surveys for Trump consistently find Harris polling very close to Bidens level of support in 2020 among white voters, which had improved over Clintons performance with that group by several points. In other words, Harris will likely rely a bit more on white voters than her partys past two nominees did.That subtle shift is the crucial distinction from the earlier contests. It could allow Harris to scrape a win by sweeping the predominantly white, former Blue Wall battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, even if Trump improves over his prior popular-vote results by gaining among Black and Latino voters (and Black and Latino men in particular).Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/o8MNBtDs](https://theatln.tc/o8MNBtDs)?","title":"The Democratic Theory of Winning With Less"},{"text":" but he doesnt deserve to be tossed into the back of a garbage truck and set on fire.He deserves *worse*?I mean, that seems a *little* extreme to me.","title":"Dementia Don's GOP"},{"text":"It's not like Trump would listen to any sort of reason.

Netanyahu wants Biden to betray Israel before the election so that Trump will win. Then Trump can continue supporting Israel into 2025 and beyond.

It's the difference between whatever casualties Netanyahu inflicts between now and the election vs. the actual, more thorough genocide that will take place if Trump wins and proceeds to let Netanyahu off the leash to level what's left of Gaza and kill any hopes remaining for a two state solution.And at any rate, Israel is buying US military equipment. If we stop providing that equipment, they start buying from Russia. And not only that, they then take the equipment they have and share it with their new supplier to ensure proper integration. Betraying Israel would be way more devastating to US national security than people seem to realize.

Do you really think LGBT activism undermine patriarchal families? One of the central fights of the movement for several decades has been the right to adopt children. Also, people can and do pass wealth to their siblings kids very regularly.... also,  people accumulate insane amounts of wealth in a single life time. So it doesn't really even eliminate capital accumulation at all.Meanwhile the universalist class based approach can support LGBT adoption. The goal can be making  adoption more affordable or all INCLUDING LGBT people. f you want to raise class conciousness, you won't do it by resenting people fighting against things enabling class based society.The thing enabling our class based society is capitalism and competition.
