It does make one worry about the future of politics, but eh, *whatever it takes to win should be the takeaway this election* for Dems. If that devolves into a constant see-saw of essentially non-progress? Well, it's what we deserve, I guess.I also agree that we should not take for granted that it's only oppressed minorities who have identities or that it's only Dems playing identity politics.

I feel like this is one of those moments in history where the iron is hot and now's a good time to try and reshape our politics, so good faith is in order.The biggest stumbling block liberals have in talking material policy to their base is their idea of 'the economy'.There is no 'economy'. There is AN economy for international capital markets, national capital markets, small bourgeois petite capitalist, and of course the workers. There are a lot of little discrete 'economies' that come directly at each other's expense. Propping up this monolithic misconception that there is one big 'economy' is disastrously blinding. Biden ripped his own base to shreds with his own messaging because it was 'the economy is great! Look at these graphs' while the people he was talking to were suffering under neoliberal austerity worse than ever.High rent is GREAT for 'the economy' because everyone who invests in real estate gets paid. It's radicalizingly bad for the worker's economy. Same for high corporate earnings, and all the other typical signs that clueless liberals bandy about as signs of a 'good economy'. The workers are dying out there, sometimes literally. And the single biggest contradiction in the Democrats messaging is that 'the economy is great actually' which, when it hits the ears of these workers, reads as 'your suffering is intentional, the system is working as we want it to, stop whining'.This is why American liberals need to move left or else. You NEED this sort of class conscious analysis to be able to read the moment. The bourgeois economy is doing fantastic, which means the proletarian economy is absolutely languishing. Working two jobs to support one kid while renting. It's not good, and as long as that's the case the Democrats will be eating shit.","title":"Maybe Joe Biden was right: he could've beaten Donald Trump"},{"text":"Lina Khan.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan","title":"Who could Dems run for President in 2028 that would appeal to voters like Bernie did?"},{"text":"No, they did not.

Trump is smart and knows the power that Russian disinformation has on those who have given up trusting anything and everything in America. If an asteroid were about to hit earth and Biden came out to warn people, people would blame him for some religious reason or not doing enough to catch it earlier. If a suicide bomber killed a bunch of Americans, Trumps supporters would say it was an inside job or it was because of Democrats. Even without evidence.Trump has a pull on Americans. He spent his whole life getting laughed at and made rural and poor believe he will make sure they are never laughed at or looked down on again. Theyll be in charge. But Trump had so much dark money from corporations and billionaires put into his re-election this year. The oil lobby alone promised $1 billion. Insurance companies, for profit hospitals, and big ag. Imagine if a Democrat got this same kind of financial support from the same companies and billionaires? Conspiracy theories.Biden and other congress people were misled before they voted for the Iraq invasion. And then Ukraine has been a commitment after we signed a treaty with them and Russia that they wouldnt be invaded IN EXCHANGE for them giving up their nuclear weapons. Worst decision ever. Russia will invade Ukraine again and will be emboldened to invade further into Europe. Trump will not be a savior. He is a vehicle for radicals and corporations to take over the country. He is the exact opposite of a Russian communist. There no longer exists any balance to confront far-right ideologies.I am a centrist so I can see the extremes and hypocrisy on both sides. Im not partisan in any way about anything other than billionaires should not be able to spent $100+ million on a senate race to get any politician elected. I want moderates back in the GOP. We need a New Deal that FDR gave us. A ton of people in Tennessee have electricity because of him. All those dams. Social Security and unemployment. Now even these programs are under threat. These are important programs that keep people out of total poverty. If you went back to the 60s, people actually had money. But now we expect jobs that pay so little despite the skills required today being so much more complex.","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Fell $20 Million in Debt in Final Week"},{"text":"Biden is the biggest loser.

Americans want someone to acknowledge that the system is broken and millions of people are getting fucked in the ass, and then to give them a solution. Trump does the first part, but then uses racism, xenophobia, and culture-war bullshit as a false solution. Democrats don't even do the first part: they insist the system is fundamentally fine, and the some small incremental changes will guide things to returning to normal. Biden (in)famously said of his future presidency: \\"nothing will fundamentally change\\". Harris said in an interview that she couldnt think of anything shed have done differently than President Joe Biden during the last four years, aside from having a Republican in her Cabinet (!!!). The lesson Democratic leaders in 2016 should have learned is that Bernie Sanders had been right, that the party had betrayed working-class voters and would be doomed if it could not effectively counter Trumps pseudo-populist appeal with a visionary alternative.

Thats quite significant, and the rest of the world has taken notice. Whether you agree or not, the United Statess democracy is based on identities. Usually split along gender or racial lines thanks to a concerted effort by republicans called the Southern Strategy. 47% of white women voted for Trump, 44% overall, which boggles my mind. 7% black women for Trump. 59% of white men voted for Trump, 20% black men for Trump. All other races were basically split 50/50. Consider this: the last time white voters voted at least 50% for democrats was in the 1964, and it took a massive civil rights movement to get to just 59% of white voters for dems! Black voters have never voted at least 50% republican since that time. Whether its the economy, immigration, etc. These policies come and go and are often just buzzwords and scare tactics. For example, the white uneducated low-income household who is struggling likely voted for Trump, but theyll be the first to feel the negative pressures of his economic policies because its not them Trump wants to keep rich.

As humanity we are responsible of our demands if they lead unethical results. For example diamond production is very unethical in most cases. I would never buy a diamond. Is it necessity? No. Will I lose anything if I don't buy it? No. Same applies to buying real fur.

I cannot work, earn money and survive without a phone or computer.Phones and computer aren't a necessity, if your only argument to why you support an unethical practice is \\"I suffer a massive loss if I don't\\" then you are literally same as the unethical cat breeder you are talking about.\\\\Not buying a unethically produced purebreed cat won't cost you anything and it won't have any consequences.But said cat still suffer from hands of said unethical breeders.\\\\The result will be decreased suffering due to decreased demand. Buyer is responsible too whether you like it or not.You not buying then will literally not even count as a drop, the amount of money in breeder's pocket at the end of the day remains the same regardless of weather you brought it or not, hell it won't cost said breeder even a single second of income in his entire life.","title":"CMV: Buying a purebreed cat when you are surrounded by homeless cats is unethical"},{"text":"Exactly,  and now since the Blue team thinks 15m votes went missing,  I can see how people will start looking into people's voting status and call them out on it.

And \\"almost starting a war\\" is a nothing burger statement.Crimea happened in 2014 and he took office in 2016. At the time the Crimean conflict was frozen there was no further will from Europe, NATO, or UN to try poking a \\"dormant conflict\\". You won't find a international law/political scientist giving their seal of approval to 100% that the independence referendum was faked because it's impossible to verify due to Russia distrust of international organizations to make sure the voting was done fairly. NATO reinforced the defence to the east of the alliance with the Forward Presence initiative but that wasn't enough due to the unwillingness of members to contribute significantly in terms of defence spending, as well as countries in the Northern Europe and Southern Europe having other more important issues at the time such as attacks on their soil and illegal immigration from the south.I think Donald Trump aided indirectly Ukraine by calling out NATO members not meeting the 2% defence spending. He wasn't the first to call out the members (Obama did) but he was the first to actually make it a public issue internationally and nationally constantly talking about it in rallies or speeches.NATO and Europe had genuine concerns when Trump threatened them to pull out from NATO if \\"members dont pay their share\\". Trump placed this issue on their minds 2-3 years before Russia full scale invasion. When Russia invasion happened we've seen a massive surge in defence spending and more countries now meet the 2% (albeit 1/3 of them still don't). This is a massive win for Trump and the secretary general of NATO Jens Stoltenberg pointed it out that he's glad these talks were in before the invasion actually occured or else the mobilization wouldn't of been so rapid and Europe so united. Europe realized how dependent they are on US for defence. They want to create their own defence iniatiative. And that is good for everyone specially for Europe since they have the largest and strongest alliance on earth. Trump shook the international order in a good way for Ukraine. And not many people give him credit. To assume that the president of United States has a duty to prevent Ukraine conflict in 2014 is a naive point of view considering the entire Europe including the international organisations did not want to go in a direct conflict with Russia. And here we are again 2 years later still dragging onto the war because no-one wants to participate in a hot war with Russia and we'd rather fund a proxy war when all the Western stockpiles are declining rapidly and weakening the West to other potential future issues like Taiwan for example.","title":"Trump is going to be a dictator"},{"text":"He'd still have to ask the flight attendant for help tbh.","title":"Is this the election that, once and for all, unequivocally proves that endorsements from A-list celebrities doesn't mean shit?"},{"text":"Inflation went down under Biden which doesnt magically erase past inflation.

He wants to be treated like a king, he admires dictators etc. its his shtick and it comes from his enormous ego and sociopathic self aggrandisement.If trump dies, or is removed for some other reason - you have a bunch of otherwise fairly normal politicians. If one of them tries to pull a Jan 6th, I just dont think it will get anywhere. People wont buy the crap.Trump has the advantage of just being an unstoppable behemoth of NOISE that everyone will report on, people hang on his every word either as a god-like figure, or as the most revolting figure ever to walk the earth. The media publish absolutely everything which guarantees them clicks and viewers etc.Trump is utterly unique, I think we can all agree that it is just extraordinary, unprecedented and something just unique to Trump.I dont think a Vance or anyone else will ever have that media sway. Come another election and it will just be expected that its a pretty normal election, and any election shenanigans will be absolutely jumped on by media as massive, inappropriate news; unlike Trump where no matter what he does its all just part of the circus.So Im not really worried about that.The bigger threat is probably Trump actually finding ways to change the rules, change the laws, change the constitution whilst he is in power.

Global economic competition has increased, compared to the post-WW2 boom.This is a socio-economic issue, on which policy decisions within the US have unfortunately limited influence, compared to the effect of having international competitors in the open market.Ironically, the most effective way to combat that is by having a progressive taxation system and robust social services. Things which Republican voters generally do not want.That is a message which is failing or landing on deaf ears.Women getting more autonomy, with regards to reproductive options and being much stronger represented in higher education fields also presents an encroachment on areas where white men used to dominate.However that represents and equalization across demographics, not a repression of men.Yet another message which is difficult to sell, but is the truth.","title":"Why were Straight Men Left Out on the Democratic Party's 'Who We Serve' Page?"},{"text":"You think someone who spent 50 yrs in Washington like Joe Biden has no connections and influence ie, \\"power\\"?\\nDo you think he was going to lend it to Kamala after she and her backers cut his throat??","title":"15 million Democrats didn't show up for Harris because they don't exist"},{"text":"How do you propose to filibuster with a minority in house and senate?

Clinton and Harris weren't respected by the public and lost. The biden presidency was also very milquetoast and the last 4 years weren't great overall. There was a lot of inflation and difficulty obtaining certain consumer goods, like cars, because of supply chain shortages from Covid. Obviously, these problems aren't Biden's fault exclusively, but I only mention them because these problems are the reality of life that people lived in. A lot of the inflation improved during 2023 but maybe that wasn't enough time? I don't know.There was certainly a perception issue from how people remember living during Trump's first term and how things were under Biden. But the dem's still pushed Harris even though she was directly attached to Biden who wasn't popular at all during his last couple of years.Dems need to run on perceptions rather than facts. Yeah it sounds bad, but you can worry about substance after winning. To get elected, the candidate has to tap into the psychology of the voters.

Just and efficient structures that would genuinely replace this without merely becoming the same thing cannot flourish until the capital-nanny-state complex is abolished. The formation of an alliance that is ruthlessly, manifestly and narrowly focused on ending the capital-nanny-state alliance is the goal.  The ruthlessness required will be shocking, and we cannot afford to miss historically contingent targets of opportunity. Example: The police are about to be automated out of existence, but they have extraordinary labor power at this moment. If (and its a big if) their leadership can be trusted to merely act in their own strategic self interest, they can be enticed to join with the rest of whats left of labor and the state would lose the ability to stop sit-down strikes.  That's end-game level stuff. There was an attempt to do this in 1911, and the capital-nanny-state complex saw it for the threat it was and stamped it out harder than you can believe. But that would not be possible today because the police actually have power. It's a real opportunity, but overcoming the collective action barriers, like short term self interest, is almost insurmountable.

Credit to conservatives, on a local level, they actually do help out those towns and listen to their constituents on things like drug rehabilitation programs and such.The people have spent decades electing conservatives into local governments and created an actual grassroots movement that's deeply rooted there.

None of us have met them where they're at or even hear why they would vote for someone like Trump. They aren't all racist bigots, they have very bad actors among them but the average small town republican just sees their towns become poorer and people moving into liberal cities and they feel left behind and unheard.

It really just depends on a subjective relative judgment. Even if someone could show that most people are very concerned with collective benefits or costs, you can simply say they should be more concerned about them.

They're specific to that individual. The only way a person can really be wrong about what they value is if they seriously misjudge their own desires or motivations. If I don't like the idea of having a nuclear power plant next door to me, I'm not strictly wrong unless I'd actually like having one there.Collective values, in the sense you mean, don't work like this. The collective values you describe depend on applying a subjective judgment about what society should want to everyone. It isn't an objective statement to say that there should be a nuclear power plant next door to me, because it's good for air quality. You're making an implicit value judgment based on what's important to you and deciding that it's more important than what I want.

This time, there can be no excuses. No Russian disinformation to blame, no fake news scandal to hide behind, no murkily funded social media advertising that you can tell yourself made all the difference. No bogeyman of Cambridge Analytica, nor even a popular vote that went the other way, betrayed by the electoral college. Nor even a hand-wringing, horrified, these fools dont know what theyre getting! By now, how could they not? America saw Donald Trump, heard him, and knew him. Just like you did. More so, even. And voted for him anyway. And really, thats it. Thats all there is.In 2016, you could tell yourself that some or all of these things were the real reason Trump won andHillary Clinton didnt. Was it ever true? Maybe. Partially. And all these things were still worth worrying about even if it wasnt. Back then, Russia did, indeed, hack away  there were indictments, arrests, convictions. Social media was a whirlwind of lucrative, divisive falsehood, far beyond anything Elon Musk would enable in 2024.\\nWhat you cannot believe this time around, though, is that anything like this made all the difference. Much as it might be comforting if you could.Trumps critics are largely not wrong. Even if youre on the right yourself, this you simply must concede. Whether or not he will govern like a fascist, he certainly campaigned like one. He is, indeed, a convicted felon, declared liable by a court for sexual abuse, and accused of rape in a court deposition by his late first wife. He did, indisputably, accuse immigrants of eating cats and dogs. He fomented an uprising at the Capitol by refusing to concede an election he had clearly lost. He has routinely demanded the jailing of his opponents. Sometimes, as last week when he said Liz Cheney should face down a bunch of rifles, he has joked about seeing them killed.He fails to comprehend the difference between his countrys interests and his own. Hes transparently in awe of dictators, and he did say: In many cases, our allies are worse than our so-called enemies. He will imperil Nato. Less gravely, but perhaps no less frighteningly, he has promised a job to RFK Jnr, who once had a worm in his brain and doesnt believe in vaccines. And he did, absolutely, spend a long part of a long speech talking about the size of a golfers penis. All of this, indisputably, is true.What if, though, 72 million Americans simply didnt care? What if, in making these things the focus of their fightback, the Democrats were actively setting up store in a part of the political shopping mall that the voters they needed werent particularly minded to even visit? Among Trumps voters, no doubt, there will be a decent number of misogynistic, authoritarian Bitcoin fans who thrill to hear an orange old man ramble about sharks. But 72 million of them? I doubt it.Americas anti-Trumpers  and those of us elsewhere  are not unique in their refusal to accept hard truths that stare them in the face. Trumps biggest fans have been doing exactly that since 2020, with their insistence that Joe Biden stole his victory. (Although why, you wonder, do they imagine Kamala opted not to steal this one too? Just lazy?) For liberals today, though, the hardest truth of all is that America saw not nearly enough in Trump to put them off.Liberal denial wears many cloaks. Today, Democrats are wracked with angst about what they got wrong. Perhaps the candidate shouldnt have been a woman, perhaps she shouldnt have been black. Perhaps, if she was going to be both of those things she shouldnt have been so annoying. Perhaps she should have been less woke, or at least differently woke, or more aggressive, or perhaps less so.Masquerading as humility, all this stuff is actually the exact opposite. This  politics through the liberal prism  recognises absolutely no autonomy behind the votes they didnt win. Such liberals will never understand Trumps success because they literally dont see it. All they see is the ways in which they, themselves, have failed. Because it must, really, be about them. Because everything is. Because it cant possibly just be about people thinking him to be a better bet for a bit less immigration, and a decent job, and perhaps slightly cheaper eggs.From an international perspective, understanding the sheer retail mundanity of the Trump vote is even harder. But Ukraine! we think. But Nato! But global security and the Middle East and the special relationship! As if it were unimaginable that a commuter in, say, Nevada, would not have these thoughts at the top of their minds, too. It makes me think of that bit in Mad Men when the sacked copywriter tries to patronise Don Draper by saying he feels sorry for him. I dont think of you at all, says that other Don.To truly understand why they failed, in other words, the real thing Americas left needs to understand is something theyre apt to struggle with far more, which is why Trump didnt fail. Because, if you dont believe that an American majority truly wants all the ugliness, sexism, oligarchy and dysfunction that his candidacy gleefully embodied, then whats the thing, that germ of popular neglected truth, that made so many millions of utterly normal people cheerfully look past it all? No longer can any of us tell ourselves they were all fooled, or deluded, or just plain ignorant. They knew what they were doing, and they did it. Time to swallow that bitter pill. Good luck in keeping it down.","title":"Face it, liberals, this is what millions wanted"},{"text":"Im sure theyd feel free under a Kamala presidency.","title":"In Dearborn, Rashida Tlaib Did Nearly Twice as Well as Kamala Harris"},{"text":"There is a lot of work to do, and things might not work out considering the times we live in.

Certain infrastructural decisions can make it nearly impossible to go by individual choice alone. Even your option would not solve it at some point. Long story short: We have to take into account that certain macro decision do influence how much individuals can really choose. A certain degree of alternatives is needed to give individual choice their efficiency. Else its jsut like voting for the lesser evil: No one benefits and everyone suffers until change.Lets look at USA and EU. IN som parts in the USA its a big disadvantage to not drive by car. I am not talking about countryside. I am talking about infrastructure. To keep this short i will only mention grocery stores. If you only have one big store in the for all people, then for some it will be a long walk/ride without car. In EU its more common to have many smaller stores. We can easily buy on a daily basis while walking home or riding the bike. If now for some global reason, cars can't be procuded anymore, then the US (in my simple example) would suffer much longer until it would be cost efficient to renew the infrastructure to make it fit for short distance traveling. They would hold to cars much longer.

I think there were a number of reasons that conflated together and brought about a stunning loss for the Democrats.1. Yes, Joe Biden not stepping down in January and allowing a full Democratic primary process is a big reason. (A) It didnt seem democratic when in the middle of summer he said Heres Kamala. (B) It didnt give Kamala more time to prepare. (C) It doesnt allow Kamala to distance herself from Biden.2. Inflation. While no administration can control the economy, they are blamed or praised for it. Inflation has been really gnarly and people really felt it during this administration. Inflation rates: 2020 - 1.2%, 2021 - 4.7%, 2022 - 8.0%, 2023 - 4.1%, 2024 so far - about 2.4%. 3. Gaza. Its really hard, especially for Gen Z and younger millennials, to look at the images and videos coming out of Gaza, and then hear of Bidens backing of Israel and no calls for a ceasefire or measures to protect civilians. Ok, this ties to #1 because its how Biden handled Israel.4. Being a woman of Black and South Asian descent - Obama dealt with racism, but he won. Hillary dealt with sexism (ok she had baggage too), but she won the popular vote. Kamala deals with both, and shes most likely going to lose the popular vote too when every vote is counted.5. So that sit down with the View where they asked her if shed do anything differently from Biden, to which she said, no, I wouldnt do much differently other than have a Republican in my cabinet, was a huge blunder. How is that Forward? Shes a little too loyal and for someone whos been in politics as long as she has, did not show astuteness. This was a time to voice how she would handle Israel differently at the very least.I voted for Kamala Harris. Im disappointed she did not win. Change is coming under the second Trump administration.

Theyve been weakened already. P2025 calls for unitary administrative powers, meaning the dissolution of checks and balances and the weakening of the 3 parts of government. The legislature will do Trumps bidding. He outperformed almost all Republican reps and senators and from a power perspective, they would be stupid to vote against him. John McCain is dead and so is his party. P2025 wishes to integrate the DOJ into presidential authority, resulting in a partisan justice apparatus. The Supreme Court is cooked - Alito and Thomas probably will do what Bader Ginsburg was incapable of: Step down so Trump can choose 2 more justices. So there will be an absolute partisan SC as well.They will install the loyalists with changing rules inside the administration, they have the plan for it. They dont need a lot of deliberation for their own policy agenda - they already have finished laws to put to Congress due to the heritage foundations diligence. The only bottleneck here are procedural challenges in Congress itself. Congress has about 200 or so legislative days up until the midterms, so that sparks the smallest hope. But Im not really confident that they cant push the shit through either way.That being said, Im going off what Trump said he wanted to do: 20% tariffs will wreck lower and middle income households, tax cuts for the wealthy and the 2 trillion budget cut proposed by Musk will cripple the administration either way, since  they will have no money in the first place to do anything. Taking 2 trillion out of the economy each year will not only push the US into never seen depression, it will cripple the world economy (especially that relying on the dollar) and push other currencies like Yuan to the world stage. Economically the US will be fucked by that. Also, by killing the department of education, it will cripple chances for people to rise above poverty and make the US education even worse. And for those being jubilant about tax cuts: we have seen what happened with Trumps taxcuts for the rich the first time. Rich people and corps bought back stocks and increased their wealth, instead of investing it back into the economy. Taxcuts for lower and middle income had been so minimal that theyve not helped to alleviate the risen prides by regular inflation, since wages stagnated as well. And it gets even worse. Biden did what corporations failed to do: he pushed extraordinary investments forward and created the biggest job growth since the Great Depression. Again: Musks want to take money out of the budget. So the government takes 2 trillion it spends out of the economy.These certainly will happen. What is less feasible might be the deportation. But they will try and they told you already how to do that with the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, destroying the foundations of America even further. So I wouldnt hold my horses if they actually do exactly that. And some honorable mentions, which arent really small things but this post is already too long: the end of ACA, the end of vaccinations, the end of Medicare, the end of regulation (including price caps), the end of the EPA and so much more bullshit that will make the life of 90% of the people much much worse. And again, thats things they said they will do.","title":"'This is a realignment': Shattered Democrats grapple with Harris' loss"},{"text":"The weird thing is they keep trying to run the Clinton campaign every four years then being shocked that it doesnt work.","title":"Bernie Sanders blasts Harris' \\"disastrous campaign\\" for \\"abandoning\\" working class"},{"text":"We are still dealing with Reagans bullshit.","title":"'This is a realignment': Shattered Democrats grapple with Harris' loss"},{"text":"Whitmer is pretty good.

Add that to Russia, who is a historic master of propaganda, helping out in a coordinated way with misinformation through social media. both of those things are REALLY hard to overcome for any non-Obama/non-JFK/non-FDR type figure to combat that. and even then, brainwashing is incredibly powerful.   \\n(2) there is a non-MAGA non-cult section that valued a $3 discount off eggs (very understandably) more than they do American democracy and most of these people are willing to give up a few rights for a coupon discount that they will never get. they esp. dont care if the rights being taken away are someone else's (or so they think). this is another indictment on the American education system. a vast majority of Americans don't know what the Federal Reserve is and how they control inflation and interest rates, don't understand supply/demand economics, don't understand monoplies, don't understand how tariffs work.","title":"Democratic Party Elites Brought Us This Disaster"},{"text":"People tolerate strongman leaders when they feel economically insecure.

She would stand there and watch the musicians playing instruments and the medics leaving the lab, the students laughing together. That was the beauty of Howard, she wrote in her memoir. Every signal told students that we could be anything C we were young, gifted, and black C and we shouldnt let anything get in the way of our success. Forty years later, the Yard was where Harris hoped to declare her ascension to the American presidency.But it was not to be. There, yesterday afternoon (6 November), in front of a small crowd of supporters, staffers and Howard students, she conceded defeat. Her uplifting tone was unbowed. She delivered a message of defiant hope. My heart is full today C full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve, she said. She sought to inspire her supporters to continue the fight against the type of politics which Trump represents, a politics she left undefined. While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign C the fight for freedom, she said. Dont ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power.It was surreal. Her positivity created the impression that Harris hadnt really lost, that the entire reason for everyone being there was not now redundant, that the Republicans hadnt (almost certainly) won the popular vote for the first time since 2004. She had no contrition for the loss, nor did she try to wrestle with the reasons behind her defeat. The message was the opposite: keep calm and carry on, stay the course, keep going. She spoke as if nothing had gone wrong and the strategy had delivered. Her finale was characteristic of her campaign: I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars. It was at this point that people around me started giggling.Minutes before Harris mounted the stage, a statement from Senator Bernie Sanders began pinging onto attendees phones. It was a stinging rebuke of everything she was about to say. It read: It should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And theyre right, he said. Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Probably not.This was a furious indictment of the Democratic Party. It echoed David Axelrods comment on CNN that the party treated the working class like natives who needed to be civilised. Despite his opposition to the administrations supplying of weapons to Israel, Sanders endorsed Harris. But his statement yesterday marked the first shot in the fight over why the party lost, the conclusion of which will dictate its direction over the next four years. Dissenters are already criticising Harris for cosying up to Republicans like Liz Cheney, for diluting Bidens economic populism and for relying on shallow and incoherent messaging. Expect a reckoning on Gaza, while some quiet voices are raising concerns about the partys failure to stop illegal migrant crossings.On the opposite side, Harriss staffers are already briefing that the blame?should fall on Joe Bidens refusal to stand down in good time. But the Democrats are in trouble if the focus remains on the timing of Bidens exit. If Harris had more time, would she have won? Isnt there a risk that the more the public got to know her, the worse the result would have been?Her concession speech was a sign that the party elite will plough on as before, unreflective about the distance between themselves and large swathes of the electorate. After the crowds started streaming out of the gates back towards the centre of Washington, one man cheerily remarked to a friend, you know, I remember that Hillary also gave an?awesome?concession speech in 2016.?","title":"Bernie Sanders crashes Kamala Harriss stubborn farewell speech"},{"text":"No because the average voter doesn't trust the MSM for shit.

By Freddie Hayward Kamala Harriss favourite spot when she studied at Howard University in the 1980s was a large, grass-covered area in the middle of campus called the Yard. She would stand there and watch the musicians playing instruments and the medics leaving the lab, the students laughing together. That was the beauty of Howard, she wrote in her memoir. Every signal told students that we could be anything C we were young, gifted, and black C and we shouldnt let anything get in the way of our success. Forty years later, the Yard was where Harris hoped to declare her ascension to the American presidency.But it was not to be. There, yesterday afternoon (6 November), in front of a small crowd of supporters, staffers and Howard students, she conceded defeat. Her uplifting tone was unbowed. She delivered a message of defiant hope. My heart is full today C full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve, she said. She sought to inspire her supporters to continue the fight against the type of politics which Trump represents, a politics she left undefined. While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign C the fight for freedom, she said. Dont ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power.It was surreal. Her positivity created the impression that Harris hadnt really lost, that the entire reason for everyone being there was not now redundant, that the Republicans hadnt (almost certainly) won the popular vote for the first time since 2004. She had no contrition for the loss, nor did she try to wrestle with the reasons behind her defeat. The message was the opposite: keep calm and carry on, stay the course, keep going. She spoke as if nothing had gone wrong and the strategy had delivered. Her finale was characteristic of her campaign: I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars. It was at this point that people around me started giggling. Minutes before Harris mounted the stage, a statement from Senator Bernie Sanders began pinging onto attendees phones. It was a stinging rebuke of everything she was about to say. It read: It should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And theyre right, he said. Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Probably not.This was a furious indictment of the Democratic Party. It echoed David Axelrods comment on CNN that the party treated the working class like natives who needed to be civilised. Despite his opposition to the administrations supplying of weapons to Israel, Sanders endorsed Harris. But his statement yesterday marked the first shot in the fight over why the party lost, the conclusion of which will dictate its direction over the next four years. Dissenters are already criticising Harris for cosying up to Republicans like Liz Cheney, for diluting Bidens economic populism and for relying on shallow and incoherent messaging. Expect a reckoning on Gaza, while some quiet voices are raising concerns about the partys failure to stop illegal migrant crossings.On the opposite side, Harriss staffers are already briefing that the blame?should fall on Joe Bidens refusal to stand down in good time. But the Democrats are in trouble if the focus remains on the timing of Bidens exit. If Harris had more time, would she have won? Isnt there a risk that the more the public got to know her, the worse the result would have been?Her concession speech was a sign that the party elite will plough on as before, unreflective about the distance between themselves and large swathes of the electorate. After the crowds started streaming out of the gates back towards the centre of Washington, one man cheerily remarked to a friend, you know, I remember that Hillary also gave an?awesome?concession speech in 2016.?","title":"Bernie Sanders crashes Kamala Harriss stubborn farewell speech"},{"text":"Harris underperformed Biden by 6 Points nationally, but only by 3 points in the swing states.?\\nSo the campaigning and ground game was actually very effective.","title":"Once Again, Democratic Leadership Has Failed Us All"},{"text":"What vision would you have hoped for?

Our allies started criticizing us despite us subsidizing their defense and global trade with our military. We allowed our jobs to go overseas with virtually zero vision on how to replace them. We stagnated the safety nets at the expense of the rich. We gutted the Midwest and Blue Wall at the expense of the working white and black communities. We bailed out the bankers who collapsed the economy, then allowed them to give huge bonuses while tens of millions were jobless, merely collecting pennies in comparison. We allowed social media companies and corporations to be reckless and careless with their harmful content. We failed to tackle foreign intervention from propagandizing our electorate on all sides.We turned a country of proud, economically aspirational, and heard people into an ocean of depressed, angry, and nihilistic voters, who were voiceless and economically desperate.And now we will watch as an oligarchic bastion of degradation swallows the country whole.

Tim walz really could have appealed to these people if they tried, but alas they had other priorities. Though at least Harris did try at appealing to women with abortion, but that really didn't resonate. And this has sadly been the game plan the Dems have been running since Bill Clinton. It worked then since the Republican establishment base was smaller than the democratic establishment (and probably would've kept working if not for al gore in Florida), but now that the GOP has fully embraced maga and GOP establishment returned to the fold bc maga was normalized, that strategy will no longer work. Their new core voting base is too large. Biden managed to win bc the primaries satisfied the progressive voters and covid/quarantine inflated turnout. They need to branch out and make the dem adjacent voting blocks that would vote dem but don't care enough to bother, to actually care.","title":"Why Did Kamala Lose?

The plan to cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is also seen as an attempt to silence media that may critique government actions, resembling efforts in authoritarian states to suppress press freedom?.\\n2. Judicial System Influence: Project 2025 outlines efforts to reshape the federal judiciary to reflect conservative ideology. This approach is controversial because it would seek to entrench certain interpretations of law that may restrict civil liberties, such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ protections.

This is not just a chance to smugly say 'prove it' to the Republicans, because their attempts to prove it will claim the lives and well-being of millions. Their attempts will destroy democracy and the planet. They very well could bring about a new dark age of humanity.To see this as a petty game where you get to say \\"told ya so\\" at the end is, to me, nasty and vengeful. Sure, use it all as a cudgel in the midterms, if we have fair midterms, but the focus right now should be on the suffering this will all cause, and on how to mitigate -- rather than exploit -- it.","title":"Thrilled about a trump presidency, with a republican senate, and likely house.

The progressives were taking gigantic shits all over the constitution in the \\"Progressive era\\" (1901C1929).  There is reason why the technical name for the current form of government is The Wilsonian Administrative State. https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-birth-the-administrative-state-where-it-came-and-what-it-means-limitedYou know how there exists over 400 different Federal administrative agencies?   That there are so many and it is so mismanaged and out of control that nobody actually knows exactly how many there are? https://www.usa.gov/agency-index/b#BJust like how people have no idea what happens to billions of dollars after the Pentagon gets its hands on it?  Or nobody can document or even count the laws that exist on the Federal law and despite that they pass thousands of new ones every year?  They tried counting them. It is impossible.Well none of that shit existed prior to the 20th century. That isn't how things are supposed to happen under the USA constitution. And if you are a \\"strict constitutionalist\\" you'd realize pretty quickly that almost all of it is illegal. Hell we even had our own Corporatist Dictator in the form of Franklin D. Roosevelt? https://www.britannica.com/topic/corporatismThe guy came into power about 3 months after Hitler became Chancellor, he lasted 3 terms and probably would of lasted to 4 or 5 if he didn't die in office.  It was during his administration that figured out that he could manipulate the Supreme Court to force the USA public to accept whatever he wanted after spending the first part of his administration getting most of the things he tried to do struck down as unconstitutional.The guy threw Americans in concentration camps and refused to release them because he was worried how their votes could impact his chances of being re-elected.  Now, theres no way to turn back the clock on the Overton window on any of it.That cat left the bag about 70-90 years before most of us were born. To make it worse, it boggles my mind that we have notions of conservative and liberal judges. They shouldnt be political.They always were political.  They are picked by Congress and ratified by the President.  How could this be anything but political? The Supreme Court isn't there to limit the government.  It isn't even there to be the \\"Supreme authority on the constitution\\".  It is every bit a part of the Federal government as the President or IRS. It is all politics. Always has been. Always will be.   Politics is ultimately the practice and application of violence.  That is what the government does.  That is what it is for.The supreme authority isn't suppose to be a court or the Federal government.  It is supposed to be the American people.","title":"We made the presidency too powerful"},{"text":"I wouldn't say it's civil here but it's one of the few subs where you can say what you want without an instant ban for committing wrong think.

GOP manufactured controversies such as drag story hours, LGBTQ book banning, or trans kids in school sports serve to create the wrong impression that somehow \\"the Democrats are focused on this.\\" Same for the GOP demonizing immigrants and claiming that Biden had some sort of \\"open door policy.\\" While these fearmongering issues are almost abstract to rural voters, the GOP is consistent with their cries of \\"This has to stop!\\" Again, this creates the impression that if the GOP is against something, the Dems must be on the opposite side actively promoting such issues. When rural voters end up feeling ignored, they believe that the Dems must have other priorities.","title":"Why Did Kamala Lose?

Yet as soon as she ran a threat to the DNC's chosen kamala, Hillary Clinton came out of the woodwork to label tulsi a fricken putin agent, just like her BS russiagate. Immediately the left turned on her and completely ostracized her from the party.?\\nTulsi was a rising star that was honestly the best shot for a female president. She's someone who deserved it. An American patriot corporal. A medic. A truly strong woman. A representative. A religious and ethnic minority. She's a true leader and the left completely eviscerated her for performing well. That's what's so gross, they try to force kamala as an empty suit for the dnc, under the guise of being for a woman of color, while they colure against the woman of color voters actually wanted by creating a disgusting hoax. All to circumvent the will of their own voters, having so little respect as to brainwash them against a fellow Democrat.\\nAnd overnight once given the memo left wing reddit turned on her so fast. The so called anti war party, massacring their rising stars reputation, labeling her a Russian agent, for daring to do nothing but not want a fucking war with Syria. A combat medic didn't want to see her brothers die for a foreign war and she was turned a pariah for it. Only because she dared to perform well.?\\nThey too thought they could gaslight their own voters on kamala Harris after installing her. Reddit hated her in 2020, and constantly hated on her as VP. Then boom she's the best thing ever. And they get deluded by their own propaganda where most thought she sucked for years, labeling her a DEI hire and a horrible VP that fails upwards, yet now have the audacity to assume over half the country is mysognist and racist for not voting her president.?I used to be a bleeding heart dem until the party clouded against bernie. Then what they did to tulsi and bernie again proved they didn't even respect the will of their own voter. Between that and the insane gaslighting they've done through the media and bots, I am now proudly on the right.? They've literally installed the primary winner of the past 3 elections with proven collusion for Hillary, collusion against bernie to get all of the party to back biden, and now kamala's coronation. As they scream that they're the party of democracy.?\\nPoliticians have always lied and overpromised stuff. What's truly terrifying about the modern left is that it doesn't just embelish shit, instead they ran their entire campaign on fucking gaslighting. I honestly feel they made tons of redditors trump voters with how they annihilated every apolitical sub with propaganda. They genuinely thought they could just gaslight their way to the youth vote via bots and the most pathetically pretentious smug hateful astroturfers. Hell eogan chose to officially endorse trump specifically because of seeing Obama continue to gaslight the fine people hoax.?\\nLike look at the whole identity politics platform. Look at all these lbgt, female, and minority left wing redditors genuinely believing they will be genocided having mental breakdowns. They're not freaking out because of any specific thing the right has done to hurt them, they're freaking out because the left wing apparatus has continuously brainwashed them nonstop that trump will genocide them. All their terror and fear, it's all because the left wing chose to divide America amongst race and gender, while terrorizing each group that the other will genocide them. So many well meaning emotional people who only care about everyone being kind to each other, have been radicalized into absolute hateful lunatics out of this belief they're stopping facism.\\nI honestly believe this past decade or so will be looked back at as an extreme hysteric era on par with mccarthyism, but lead by the left through the media. The astrotufing, the bots, the hysteria, the hate, the emotional extremism. This election was a tipping point, where now the mainstream left wing media echochamber is completely falling apart, and so many people are seeing the propaganda for what it is.\\nAll this division. All this hatred. All this fear. All this hysteria. All of this negative energy was intentionally created, harnessed, and multiplied, by the modern left, just for votes. I hope the lefties on reddit wake up, because they are the biggest victims here, sure it sucks to be a conservative on reddit, but atleast I have free will and am not brainwashed into this constant state of a hateful panic attack. Just because they were told to by Hilary Clinton, suddenly the whole left turned into Salem accusing tulsi of being a witch, even though they loved her the day before. That's terrifying, the behavior of the modern left is the one thing that got me to to truly understand and see how so many hateful and horrible historical movements were able to brainwash the masses into insanity and hatred they believed virtuous.?\\nThe lefts entire platform for the past 4 years has been dividing Americans and gaslighting them, and is why they've alienated any sensible adult that's not a left wing tribalist.

She selected a likeable, ineffectual candidate as VP because she was too insecure to go with anyone with more substance and she spent most of the campaign eithet hiding from the media or doing truly awful, grating, incoherent interviews that reminded everyone why she was hiding from the media. If there had been an open primary she would have bombed hard because simply put, she's a dreadul politician and middle america can't stand her. And regardless of her shortcomings as a candidatw the Democratic Party establishment ran the exact same failed campaign they've ran time and time again, based on the same, repeatedly busted myths that celebrity endorsements matter, that minorities and women care more about identity politics than economics or safety, and that appealing to educated conservatives who dislike trump is somehow of more value than the white working class vote that has flocked to him. Probably the single cringiest line of the campaign, which both Biden and Harris said repeatedly when asked about anything related to the economy was that their economic plan had been supported by multiple experts including Nobel prize winning economists. Like seriously? That's it? That's how you'll convince people who feel life has gotten harder and they're struggling financially to vote for you?! That's your only response to what polls have repeatedly shown is the crucial issue in every election since time immenorial?

You are smart enough to see that things were much better under Trump vs Biden/Harris, and Trump had a pandemic on his hands. Just imagine how much worse thing would be if Clinton was dealing with the pandemic. For reference Im 27 and had to move back in with my dad because my rent went up 40% in the last 3 years, so I have seen just how bad things have gotten. And somehow everyone who voted for Kamala would say things are fine. Its ridiculous. Things WILL get better in the next 4 years. Well only get 4 years of Trump, but hopefully Vance will take office after to continue his work. It will take longer than 4 years to fix everything, but Trump will get the ball rolling. Im sorry to hear that your family has cut ties with you, and said that you no longer have rights as a woman. But if theyre talking about abortion rights, ALL TRUMP DID WAS GIVE THE POWER TO THE STATES. Which is what the founding fathers wanted all along, more power to the states!

But yea, all these doomers are saying this is the end and yet democracy still stands. Nothing has changed in the government since he first took office 8 years ago, and things were undeniably better when Trump was in office.
