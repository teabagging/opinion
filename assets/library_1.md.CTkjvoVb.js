Left-wingers blame AG as Trump charges dropped"},{"text":"From the article:The price of patriotism:\\nAmerican veterans now receive absurdly generous benefits.Nov 28, 2024Donald Trump delights in projecting strength, meaning he loves Americas armed forces. During his first term, the president-elect signed legislation to spend more on defence, before proclaiming that he had accomplished the military. On the campaign trail, he doubled down, vowing further increases in defence spending and promising to tackle a recruitment shortfall. Yet he also wants to cut government waste, and has hired Elon Musk to lead a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\\nWhen it comes to the Department of Veterans Affairs, these two instincts may be in tension. The departments budget has surged over the past two decades, rising from $86bn in todays dollars (then equivalent to 2.6% of the federal budget) in 2000 to $336bn (5% of todays budget) this year. It now receives almost three times as much as the Department of Transportation. Remarkably, this boom has occurred despite a nearly one-third decline in the veteran population, which has fallen from 26m to 18m. Annual spending per veteran, as a consequence, has risen six-fold.Mr Musk is zeroing in on discretionary spending, which includes programmes such as the departments medical services. But the main driver of its spending surge is mandatory outlays for disability compensation. Between 2000 and 2024, such payments ballooned from $26bn, in todays prices, to $159bn. Last year alone saw a 17% jump. And the departments latest budget request forecasts that compensation will soar to $185bn over the next two years.The current system was introduced during the first world war. It provides tax-free monthly payments to soldiers who are injured or sick owing to their service. From 1960 to 2000, roughly 9% of veterans qualified for payments, typically for ailments such as hearing loss or burns. The department assigns a rating from zero to 100% based on the severity of disabilities. In 2000 the average rating was 30%; monthly payments averaged the equivalent of $975 today. Few qualified for the top tier.The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form. This year 6m veteransor a third of the totalqualified for payments, with an average monthly benefit of $2,200. Veterans may file claims for an unlimited number of disabilities and appeal against decisions as often as they wish. The average rating has climbed above 60%, and one in four disabled veterans now receives the once-rare 100% rating. Such a designation ensures a generous $4,000 monthly payment for life, with no conditions attached. Starting at the age of 25, a former soldier could earn well over $2m in present-value terms.Why has this happened? From 2001 the department began to broaden its list of presumptive conditionswhere officials automatically assume the problem is service-relatedto include ailments such as type-2 diabetes, allowing any veteran with the disease to qualify for compensation. The reasoning for such expansion is not always robust. For instance, a department-funded study found only limited evidence linking herbicide exposure in Vietnam to type-2 diabetes. In 2022 President Joe Bidens PACT Act expanded eligibility further, with illnesses such as asthma and chronic rhinitis gaining approval, as some soldiers had picked up the conditions from burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq.Once on the payroll, veterans usually remain beneficiaries for life. The stigma around collecting payments has faded in recent decades. Online videos with tips about how to boost your disability rating are widespread. It is common for veterans to start on the programme at a 50% disability rating for, say, sleep apnea linked to service stress, only to then add more disabilities and have the rating increase to 100% within a few years. Its a programme that helps a lot of people who deserve it, but getting on the programme becomes an escalator to higher disability ratings and compensation, says Mark Duggan of Stanford University. Once you qualify you have an incentive not to get better.It is unclear if the spending is even benefiting veterans. Research by Mr Duggan and co-authors finds that disability compensation has reduced employment, with one in five new recipients leaving the workforce after the change in 2001. As nearly 2m additional working-age men have gone on the rolls since then, this implies 400,000 may have been discouraged from work. A study in 2022 by David Silver, then of Princeton University, and Jonathan Zhang, then of McMaster University, found that extra compensation had failed to boost veterans mental and physical health. Indeed, suicide rates have increased relative to comparable non-veterans.To rein in costs and focus the departments mission, policymakers could take a page from the Congressional Budget Offices recommendations. The non-partisan scorekeeper advises narrowing eligibility for disability compensation to veterans with severe service-connected conditions, lowering benefits for some veterans and introducing a means test. Reducing payments to former soldiers will never be popular, but it would be wise. Americas veteran obsession has gone too far.","title":"Trump doesnt have to run again.

Democrats consider themselves smart and smart people dont vote for losers. In other words, once anyone gains momentum, voters immediately start voting for that person (see: Biden in 2020) instead of voting for their favorite candidate. Republicans, on the other hand, vote for whom they want which is how Trump rose despite the Republican establishment trying so hard to keep him from winning in 2016. Despite the media doing everything they could to make him feel unserious. And thats why its so easy for Democrats to manufacture consent: Bernie was crushing Biden in 2020, so the establishment cut deals with 5 candidates after Biden won South Carolina, a state a Democrat will never win in the general, to ensure Biden gained traction. And, once he pulled ahead, voters didnt want to vote with their hearts anymore, they wanted to vote for who they thought was more electable.Until that type of thinking changes, Democrats will be losers.

You really think you know all the worlds secrets and every thing you think is correct and everyone else in the world is wrong if they dont agree with you.  It was such a neutral and unbiased post with no political siding. I dont have a side I just observe and do my research. I dont subject myself to any programming, I dont have cable, I dont let people leak info into my head without doing my due diligence. I have books, I study papers, and I have full access to the every corner of the web. The ONLY reason youre saying Im liberal, cause if its against what you believe it has to be liberal, is because i gave Trump just a little bit of criticism and you didnt like me doing that. In fact you immediately saw a post about the first year of Covid and my opinion, which is based on way more facts than what your brain worms are feeding you, and you couldnt help yourself to flip it into democrats. If you cant see your bias is showing Einstein, then youre in way too deep. You are clearly pro Trump and I can tell you love Elon so much, you do know his dark secrets right? Of course you know that little tid bit mentioning them was really telling.Its also so Noble of you to abstain from voting, let everyone do the dirty work for you cause you dont have a spine to make a difference and fight for what you believe. Also nice story you got there The classic case of I have a black friend so I cant be racist. shut your racist ass up, its clear ass day racism is a problem and youre belittling it. When you say sub-culture you probably mean SUB culture because you think black people are beneath you. Champ, everything you say is a regurgitated smorgasbord of conspiracies you read online based off zero research. Youre living in an echo chamber of Reddit comments, do actual research. But you wont, youll just continue to believe everything people tell you so long as its not liberal. Too lazy to do the work and read, you even admitted to only reading a little bit of what I wrote. Sounds Ike from your story your from the South, mixed with the almost unreadable English you write, your IQ is decently low and your education level is lower. Honestly it all makes sense, but if you CAN read you should do some real research. Maybe stop hanging around those Alternate history subreddits, they might be altering your perception of the reality we actually live in.So, thank you for letting me have the last word. Or maybe you cant resist replying back with another pretentious comment pretending like you know anything. Kemosabe If you do message back youll probably just make up some bullshit, cause youre a fake and a fraud, and you wont ever provide any sources or back up what youre saying. Well.. champ it was cute watching you struggle to put words together.

No. So when we impose tariffs on goods coming into the USA, we are making the product more expensive and therefore less likely to be consumed at the same rate as it was at its lowest price. Consumers don't have endless money to spend and will have to make spending changes. Increasing tariffs on imports from both Mexico and Canada means most of our basic goods and materials (petroleum, steel, meat, vegetable oil, machinery, appliances, vehicles and their parts, and so much more).  Why is the Trump campaign pushing for this besides just strong arm tactics, not really sure. What I gather the hope is, is for American companies to start producing these products. However, they currently aren't capable of doing that and make a profit, which is why we import these goods to begin with. The other part of this is, if the mass deportation of illegal immigrants happens, America loses the job force that would make all of that production possible. I think the belief is that Americans would pick up those jobs that these immigrants currently do, working in factories, slaughterhouses, construction companies, etc, but the companies are going to have to pay more to American citizens and illegal immigrants so again that cuts into their profit. This is why everybody is saying this doesn't make sense, because you don't make these choices in a void and they have other ramifications and affect other areas.","title":"Trudeau in Florida to meet with Donald Trump in wake of tariff threat"},{"text":"The only thing we have to inform our opinion is all the evidence pointing towards female candidates having a disadvantage right now.

Supporters of the monarchy were seated on the right side, and supporters of the revolution were seated on the left. Newspapers started using \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" to refer to these two groups, or more generally to describe progressive and conservative politics, and then French political parties started using the terms to describe themselves. By the late 1800s this terminology had spread to other parts of the world.We can draw a pretty clear scale here. On the right is hierarchy and inequality; toward the center you have some people with more wealth or status than others, and as you move right you get larger wealth divisions, class stratification, feudalism, and at the very far end is totalitarianism. On the left you get more equality: popular democracy, labor movements and unions, popular ownership of capital, that kind of thing. The far left end is anarchism, with no government or private property.Social equality fits on the right/left scale as well. Less equality goes rightward, so there's your women who can't own property, black drinking fountains, chattel slavery. More equality goes left, so you've got civil rights, feminism (the ideal, not the female-chauvinist reality), equity for handicapped people, etc.I call this the _political_ left and right.#BUT#There's a whole other _cultural_ aspect that doesn't have a lot to do with the political philosophy, and this is what gets almost all the attention.The cultural left thinks they're educated, enlightened, wise, perceptive, compassionate, cultured, classy, civilized, clean, beautiful, and noble. But they think the cultural right is stupid, ignorant, hidebound, anti-intellectual, superstitious, uncultured, backward, dirty, ugly, diseased, intolerant, violent, and dangerous.The cultural right thinks they're practical, hard-working, sensible, strong, community-minded, clever, and moral. They see the cultural left as shallow, hypocritical, smug, arrogant, elitist, pretentious, foolish, weak, effete, narrow-minded, disruptive, dishonest, corrupt, and morally bankrupt.In other words, the divide between the cultural left and the cultural right is very much like the cultural divide that has always existed between rich and poor.Of course, it's not as simple as rich vs. poor with a coat of political whitewash, because we're talking about two different cultures that have grown and evolved over the years until they're loaded down with enormous amounts of baggage.The funny thing about the cultural left is that it's not particularly politically left. Liberals will cry about civil rights, labor, poverty, the environment, etc. but their positions are usually so moderate that they're practically conservatives, they have a cult-like dedication to a corrupt center-right party, and they are not nearly as tolerant as they pretend to be.The actual political left in this country is socialists, communists, anarchists, and a variety of committed activists (labor, civil rights, etc) who work by grassroots organizing. This left is very small, mostly disorganized, kept away from getting any real power or mainstream recognition, and they tend to dislike liberals almost as much as the cultural right does, but for different reasons.","title":"What does the ACTUAL left represent for you?"},{"text":"In the conclusion of the original post, you said that there is no such thing as right and wrong.

So it would seem that right and wrong do exist. Society is imperfect, but that doesn't mean everything it deems against the rules is really just OK, and the rules are arbitrary.

Building cities around cars suck. Cars are terrible when it comes to short distant transportation inside a city. If your only pedestrian infrastructure is the 8-lane city highway, your city sucks ass. You cant do anything withouth a car, and anything you want to do with a car takes forever.What you do instead is provide lots of pedestrian spaces, cheap and effective public transportations with subway, trams or busses and you try to get rid of private cars inside the city as much as you can. Its very hard to fix the stereotypical us city design, since they were planed around giant roads and cars.   \\nSo whats the solition proposed here: build new cities, but use flying cars that are a hundred times louder, have eben less troughput, eat way more energy and give you nothing in return. If you want a reasonable approach you build cities centered around people (pedestrians). You connect parts of the city with subways and trams and you interconnect the cities with high speed rail. If you go grocery shopping, you walk, take the bike or take your bike inside the subway. If you want to travel to another city, you take the train. If you are living in a suburb, you take the tram to get inside the city.

There was just as much racist rhetoric floating around about Obama in 2008 as there was misogynist talk about Kamala this year, but Obama got elected anyway.The reason both Clinton and Harris failed to be elected president is purely a matter of timing. In the ENTIRE HISTORY of the United States, the Democratic Party has _never_ had a candidate win the presidential race when the incumbent was a (different) Democrat. Never. Not even LBJ or Truman - they were both already incumbent due to the death of their predecessor.The last time anyone was elected president with an incumbent of the same party was Bush Sr, and thats a special circumstance given Reagans enormous 60-plus approval rating.So it has nothing to do with sex or gender. No Democrat could have won in 2016. No Democrat could have won in 2024. On the other hand _any_ Democrat could have won in 2020. Literally, anyone we nominated would have won. So if you wanted to see the first female president, that was the best opportunity. Assuming we have a free election in 2028, literally any Democrat we nominate _will_ win the election, because Trumps approval rating is likely to be record-breakingly low. So if we nominate another woman in 2028, she _will_ win unless the GOP commits blatant fraud or overturns the election (which is likely).","title":"Ex-Trump Official Warns: Do Not Underestimate AOC in 2028"},{"text":"Now make tuition payments tax deductible.","title":"Trump could save a bus full of children and they still would find a reason to critize him."},{"text":"Unfortunately hell kill a LOT of people and appoint a LOT of judges along the way.","title":"The anti-Trump movement is in tatters.

National Science Foundation grants and National Endowment for the Arts grants have always been rage bait for conservatives because some of the grants inevitably end up going to things that sound silly.   I wouldn't be shocked if there was some effort to cut back on things like that but those efforts have always failed in Congress because there are a lot of republicans in Congress that have powerful universities and companies that rely on those grants as constituents.

This is a special right that the priest has that others don't which breaks your view.

Priests don't just give a series of prayers to absolve a person of their sin, a major part of it when it comes to serious crimes includes admitting to said crimes to authorities. To have the positions priests do in confessions, they absolutely can not admit what they learn in confessions to others which allows for admitting to anything and everything to a priest unlike what one can do with a therapist where a real tangible risk exists for confessing to crimes. So while they can not do anything active outside the confessional, the very act of binding themselves in this way allows the confessional to exist in the first place giving the priest this opportunity to get the criminals to confess additionally to authorities and get justice for those crimes.","title":"CMV: Freedom of religion should be a way narrower right."},{"text":"The union vote is flipping.

Expecting people that are for the most part the slightly less grubby side of the same medal to do it makes it worse, because they might just end up getting a taste for it. There is simply nobody I trust with the execution of this such that it does not end up a net negative on top of being mostly negative anyway.And that does not even factor in that the general environment we're in is hostile to the idea as well, and very good at sowing discord and uncertainty.

She had all but stopped talking about her child and small business tax credits. She had policies that would have helped the middle/working class, but she didn't run on them. She didn't stump on them. She increasingly ran on conservative compromise policies like the border and refocused on abortion rights. The result was abortion right succeeded in places she failed to win the vote.

A murderer could confess their sins to a priest, and it wouldn't matter whether or not the police or prosecutors genuinely have good reason to believe the priest is aware of the confession of a major crime, they have priest-penitent privileges and won't be compelled to give testimony regarding it. This doesn't fall under exception (2) you gave, since refusing to testify does affect others. The rest of (1), (3), and (4) simply have nothing to do with the case given.Priests within religions that have confessions are bound by their church and faith to NEVER reveal what was said to them in confession. Attempting to compel testimony from priests under the threat of imprisonment for refusal would simply anger and outrage those of the same religion, form an active hostility between the church and law enforcement, and have a chilling effect resulting in criminals being less likely to confess anyway. The last part is a very big deal, since generally priests as part of the confessions will compel the confessing criminals to admit to their guilt as part of their penance in order to make right their sins. It helps more to have priests be able to listen to confessions and try to push for the confessor to admit to their crimes rather than antagonize a number of priests to potentially get a few bits of evidence and lose out on this entirely afterwards.(Note, this does not prevent priests from testifying in general, just in cases where the testimony is in regards to an officially done confession. If a priest witnesses a crime, they can report it, and the criminal can not try to weasel out of it by going up to the witnessing priest and admitting everything to them. Blabbing about your crimes to a priest willy nilly outside of the proper location and procedure does not bound the priest to silence)","title":"CMV: Freedom of religion should be a way narrower right."},{"text":"No. Her parents moved to the US and helped raise him in the US not in Slovenia.?","title":"Former Democratic megadonor says Barron Trump is smarter than Harris campaign"},{"text":"They won't learn a thing.

His problem was, most primary voters were basing their votes on their perception of who could beat Trump.  If you're a Democratic voter in South Carolina, for example, maybe you like progressives on the issues, but surrounded by MAGA, it's hard to imagine those issues winning nationally.  Also, from South Carolina, how do you know what voters in Iowa, or Kentucky, or New Hampshire are thinking?  You trust the mainstream corporate media to tell you that, and the media will tell you frequently that progressives will lose 49 states, that it'll be a Mondale level wipe out, and that only a neoliberal moderate stands a chance.  So, instead of voting for who and what you want, you believe you have to make a pragmatic choice just to try and stop the Republicans from winning.Until progressives clear that hurdle, they'll never win a national primary, especially not after the Democrats front-loaded the primary calendar with southern states (Which they did explicitly for the purpose of stifling progressive challangers.)","title":"Former Trump Treasury official: Do not underestimate Ocasio Cortez in 2028"},{"text":"The kids didnt just become Republican overnight.

Besides, I got the fuck out to another country. If the majority of Americans can't figure out that the stove is hot without touching it, I guess I get to watch them burn their hand on the stove from a safe distance.I'd hope that they would learn a valuable lesson, but considering that after Nixon resigned in utter disgrace it only took a bit over 6 years to elect another Republican. And then even though that Republican and his Vice President engaged in high treason by selling arms to Iran to fund Nicaraguan death squads, 8 years after the first Bush left office, his literal son got elected. And then W committed the double sin of lying America into war and then fucking up actually doing that war so hard that it also fucked the *other* war started under his watch, but he still served two terms. And then 8 years later America said \\"hey, let's trust another Republican, even though he's famous for being a liar and asshole\\". And then it's 4 years of chaos with the last year having a plague that killed over a million people. And 4 years after he gets voted out, he gets voted right back in because he promised to... I have no fucking idea, because he had fuck all actual plans. Other than tariffs, which people think will lower inflation, even though a 5 minute Google search will show literally the exact opposite will happen. So I guess I'm saying that I have zero hope for America to ever figure out that Republicans are the goddamn worst.

You might be doing the thing where because we know how it worked out (Trump was a viable candidate) that you're using present known information as justification for past circumstances.Anyways,  when DeSantis was revving up his run,  one thing that *was not clear* was that Trump's considerable downside risk from post J6 and post presidency made Trump a political risk. The NY case was the smallest and the most inconsequential.   In this Trumpian world, campaign fraud and porn stars is inconsequential.  *Sigh*.  The GA case, the DC case, the FL case (classified docs), if not supremely well handled, would have likely shaved off enough voters to make him viable.  He definitely got lucky with the FL judge.Anyways,  what I'm saying is,  if any of the 3 big cases landed hard, even if he was tied up in the courts with a lot of public discovery and discourse, Trump might have been non viable. Enter DeSantis!  He's pretty Trumpy in a lot of ways.   But he's not Trump.   His likely intended trick was to be Trumpy enough to keep the MAGA hardcore in the reservation while also appealing to the Trump reluctant voters.  Should Trump have gone down in a legal or political trashfire, a real risk, DeSantis could have credibly positioned himself as mostly more of the same but less grab em by the baggage. One problem though with DeSantis is he isn't as charismatic.   He's smarter, better at policy, more disciplined, capable,  but he can't work a crowd.  He wasn't able to pull off being Trump because he's too much of a nerd. DeSantis' campaign was pretty iffy too.  Some questionable moves, and generally unable to gain traction.   It might have been interesting if he actually went after Trump, he might have gotten more respect, but he dithered,  he ducked, which comes off weak.(Consider Christie.  Not remotely viable.  But at least he made a mark. )Anyways,  as it turned out, DeSantis' campaign sputtered, Trump finangled very very low damage from his adventures, the Rs coagulated behind Trump.  Haley got a little,  too little too late.   And here we are. ...As for this CMV, I whole heartedly agree that Trump is a mix of hyperbole and true messaging. And the interesting part is what parts are hyperbole and what parts are true messaging,  well, that depends on who you ask. Trump has \\"clarified\\" that he likes parts of P2025.

The state of Georgia could issue a pardon but their pardon power is not left to the Governor to simply just pardon and goes through a pardon board.Hypothetically, lets say Trump gets convicted in GA. Trump has no ability to wiggle out of that conviction and there is nothing in the constitution to point to for the argument that a state can not convict a sitting president of a state level crime.  This current SCOTUS could read in something (like they did in the immunity case) but as of right now there is no justification or reason to believe that a state does not have the ability to convict a sitting President.BUT...Georgia is never going to attempt to arrest Trump to try and get him to start serving the sentence while he is President.Two issues, one pragmatic, one a constitutional issue.The first, how does Georgia expect to be able to arrest Trump. How does Georgia make Trump comply without trying to detain him by force while he is President?  If they try this and Trump tells GA to pound sand, it is not like GA has any remedy to force Trump to comply. They can then attempt to use force (officers) to arrest Trump but if Georgia state police attempt to carry that out, it is a nightmare because it either leads to them getting no where or getting into a literal engagement with federal officers.  The second (and this is going to sound ridiculous but would likely keep Trump out of jail, even if convicted in GA, at least until he is no longer President) is that the take care clause requires that the President \\"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\\".  A US President can not faithfully execute the laws while sitting in Prison.  The US constitution is the supreme law and no state is going to be able to put a sitting US president in jail (and as a principle, this is a good principle to have because states could start weaponizing this).  The SCOTUS would hold, probably 9-0 that the Take Care Clause does not allow a state to put a sitting US President in prison. In this hypothetical, the SCOTUS would hold that Georgia could not even attempt to put Trump in prison until after his term. It doesn't get Trump off the conviction or out of serving the time for the conviction (if he doesn't run just before he leaves office) but Trump will be 82 by then - how many fat, McDonalds eating, non-exercise believing 82 year old people are out there?  Yes, it sounds ridiculous that someone can keep themselves out of prison for breaking the law, so that they can faithfully execute the law, but the founders drafting the constitution did not think a criminal game show host would become President, they assumed \\"only men of the highest character\\" would come into office and a lot of the US constitution is built on that premise....","title":"Fani Williss Case Against Trump Is Nearly Unpardonable  Raising Possibility of a State Prosecution of a Sitting President"},{"text":"Yep.

Yeah, support is essential, but at some point you start to have too many supporters and not enough doers for those supporters to even be doing any actual supporting. If that makes any sense?That said, if he did federalize the guard soldiers, they would actually be from blue states. States like Texas would actually leave troops in title 32 or SAD status because they can be used as direct law enforcement at that point. You can provide a token ICE agent to act as the head of the operation and then the remainder of the operation can take place using state law enforcement and the national guard in title 32 status. At that point there is no posse comitatus issue and they can redirect a lot more ICE agents towards uncooperative blue states. They can federalize those guard soldiers and/or use active duty troops to provide support to the ICE agents there and thats how they can best divide up resources.In summary, they use title 10 troops and ICE for blue states and they use title 32 troops and state law enforcement for red states.","title":"Full List Of Cities Promising To Shield Immigrants From Trump's Mass Deportation"},{"text":"The fourteenth amendment goes hard.

It is proven to exist and every credible health org states that it was in fact real, I even tried to a quick search to see what you are talking about and i honestly couldnt find anything, Im open to reading that if you send me a link. It is covid-19. Originally called N-cov or Novel Coronavirus, which basically just means a new coronavirus, which coronavirus is just another name for a common illness or cold. It then became known as a more genetic descriptor SARS-Cov-2, which SARS is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Obviously the CoV-2 just means coronavirus 2 which is its mutation. Its all names for the same thing. They learned that it was never seen in humans, therefore they mostly believe it was spread between animal and human, they also discovered how it spreads and that we havent developed an immunity to it. So YES it is researched and documented as being a thing that actually exists.Viruses mutate and have variants, they mutate more when its breeding in a host with no natural immunity to it. Thats what vaccines are for too, but then when people dont get those its harder to control and leads to more variants, your body gets introduced to just enough of the virus to help your immune system build immunity. This is all common sense though and has been proven to work and humans have actually been able to eradicate diseases with these. With the testing YES they are pretty accurate. When the tests came out they knew what it was, thanks to science and research and I really hope you believe in science, they knew the genetics of the virus and could test certain markers to see if you had it.My family members died FROM COVID-19. An aggressive virus, that our bodies never seen before, that would attack weak points in your immunity system. They were a few among millions who died from something that is definitely stronger than the flu, which our bodies have developed a natural immunity to. Did you know the first influenza case could be traced back to 412 BC, Hippocrates actually describes a contagious disease with flu like symptoms in one of his books. In 1918 a thing called the spanish flu existed, a virus that killed 50 million people because their bodies had never been exposed to something like that. It sounds a little familiar right? In 1957 H2N2 or Asian influenza developed, the first pandemic in the era of modern medicine, killing upwards of 4 million people. In 1968 The Hong Kong flu, same thing 4 million casualties. You can even add HIV, that ones probably a bad add due to the conspiracies behind that. Swine flu, Ebola, Let alone all the plagues in history. Do you not believe in any virus? Like none of this happened and those mortality numbers are greatly exaggerated? Covid reports 4 million casualties, if you adjust for population growth since 1968, not a bad as the Hong Kong flu but still pretty high. Why is this one so hard to believe? Pandemics just dont go away, its a natural occurrence, we were definitely due for one.","title":"In response to COVID posts, were over it."},{"text":"Are all the direct quotes from African leaders who are celebrating Trumps win opinion?","title":"Trump administration is set to abandon LGBTQ Africans"},{"text":"Like staging a coup?

The ideas of right and wrong (morality) were made by society to keep it functioning; Correct ideas of right and wrong are necessary for man to live, including creating a society where men can live together.

When Trump says his net worth varies depending on how he feels, he's not bullshitting: he genuinely doesn't comprehend that his wealth exists in the world independent of his emotions. If he loses an election, it must be fraud, because there's no way a winner like him could lose an election fair and square. Any evidence to the contrary is fake news. For Trump, there is nothing beyond his self-image - the only durable concept in his mind - and whatever impulse is striking him at the moment. It's an extreme form of solipsism, the kind that can exist only in a man who has valued his ego above all else since he was a child and reaped endless rewards for it.Trump's movement endures because this is irresistible to many people. Don't think anything through, just speak from your gut. Don't try to explain how exactly the 2020 election was stolen, just mumble something about insecure drop boxes and absentee ballots and hint at a vast conspiracy.

You don't have to go to the trouble of developing a belief system; just match your instincts to the right Trumpian slogans and you're good to go. You don't even have to agree with any of Trump's policies; a desire to own the libs and MAGA is all that's needed. It's an attitude, not an ideology.

Of course Russia would invade Ukraine to get them back at the time. Why would they simply hand over their nukes to a now independent country right next to Russia? There was really no option but to give them back at that time.The only reason Ukraine kept them was because they were worried they needed them to keep Russia out after voting 92% to leave the Soviet Union.They had no right to keep them anyways though which is my point. They weren't Ukraine's, and like I said there's no way Russia would simply hand over part of their nuclear arsenal to an independent country right next to Russia. The US would demand their nukes and military assets back as well if Nevada seceded from the US. They wouldn't magically belong to the state of Nevada now just because they're located there. They belong to the US government.\\nIf the US breaks it's word on this matter then you will get a lot more small states getting nukes so as not to be invaded just like Ukraine has threatened.A peace deal would still result in the sovereignty of Ukraine.

Take an object like shipping containers. Americans don't make them. Americans don't have the machines to make them better than other countries. Our shipping containers will probably cost 25-50% more, with the tariffs Americans might want to buy them, but who else? America imposed the tariff, so it's not like other countries would see the American product as more cost effective. And this would take some time to ramp up. Might be upwards of a decade before the first finished container is out.

During his first term, the president-elect signed legislation to spend more on defence, before proclaiming that he had accomplished the military. On the campaign trail, he doubled down, vowing further increases in defence spending and promising to tackle a recruitment shortfall. Yet he also wants to cut government waste, and has hired Elon Musk to lead a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).When it comes to the Department of Veterans Affairs, these two instincts may be in tension. The departments budget has surged over the past two decades, rising from $86bn in todays dollars (then equivalent to 2.6% of the federal budget) in 2000 to $336bn (5% of todays budget) this year. It now receives almost three times as much as the Department of Transportation. Remarkably, this boom has occurred despite a nearly one-third decline in the veteran population, which has fallen from 26m to 18m. Annual spending per veteran, as a consequence, has risen six-fold.Mr Musk is zeroing in on discretionary spending, which includes programmes such as the departments medical services. But the main driver of its spending surge is mandatory outlays for disability compensation. Between 2000 and 2024, such payments ballooned from $26bn, in todays prices, to $159bn. Last year alone saw a 17% jump. And the departments latest budget request forecasts that compensation will soar to $185bn over the next two years.The current system was introduced during the first world war. It provides tax-free monthly payments to soldiers who are injured or sick owing to their service. From 1960 to 2000, roughly 9% of veterans qualified for payments, typically for ailments such as hearing loss or burns. The department assigns a rating from zero to 100% based on the severity of disabilities. In 2000 the average rating was 30%; monthly payments averaged the equivalent of $975 today. Few qualified for the top tier.The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form. This year 6m veteransor a third of the totalqualified for payments, with an average monthly benefit of $2,200. Veterans may file claims for an unlimited number of disabilities and appeal against decisions as often as they wish. The average rating has climbed above 60%, and one in four disabled veterans now receives the once-rare 100% rating. Such a designation ensures a generous $4,000 monthly payment for life, with no conditions attached. Starting at the age of 25, a former soldier could earn well over $2m in present-value terms.\\nWhy has this happened? From 2001 the department began to broaden its list of presumptive conditionswhere officials automatically assume the problem is service-relatedto include ailments such as type-2 diabetes, allowing any veteran with the disease to qualify for compensation. The reasoning for such expansion is not always robust. For instance, a department-funded study found only limited evidence linking herbicide exposure in Vietnam to type-2 diabetes. In 2022 President Joe Bidens PACT Act expanded eligibility further, with illnesses such as asthma and chronic rhinitis gaining approval, as some soldiers had picked up the conditions from burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq.\\nOnce on the payroll, veterans usually remain beneficiaries for life. The stigma around collecting payments has faded in recent decades. Online videos with tips about how to boost your disability rating are widespread. It is common for veterans to start on the programme at a 50% disability rating for, say, sleep apnea linked to service stress, only to then add more disabilities and have the rating increase to 100% within a few years. Its a programme that helps a lot of people who deserve it, but getting on the programme becomes an escalator to higher disability ratings and compensation, says Mark Duggan of Stanford University. Once you qualify you have an incentive not to get better.It is unclear if the spending is even benefiting veterans. Research by Mr Duggan and co-authors finds that disability compensation has reduced employment, with one in five new recipients leaving the workforce after the change in 2001. As nearly 2m additional working-age men have gone on the rolls since then, this implies 400,000 may have been discouraged from work. A study in 2022 by David Silver, then of Princeton University, and Jonathan Zhang, then of McMaster University, found that extra compensation had failed to boost veterans mental and physical health. Indeed, suicide rates have increased relative to comparable non-veterans.To rein in costs and focus the departments mission, policymakers could take a page from the Congressional Budget Offices recommendations. The non-partisan scorekeeper advises narrowing eligibility for disability compensation to veterans with severe service-connected conditions, lowering benefits for some veterans and introducing a means test. Reducing payments to former soldiers will never be popular, but it would be wise. Americas veteran obsession has gone too far.","title":"Trump doesnt have to run again.

The wronged partner does not have an obligation to objectively justify to you that they were hurt by someone cheating on them, it's enough that they themselves feel like they were wronged. That's how I feel reading your argument. Do you objectively, rationally know for 100% certainty that the murderer committed a wrong? No. Does any one have to justify that to you? Also no.

I reject that.Your claims are false. You are wrong. I will call out out on being wrong, because even if I can't move you, I can at least hopefully prevent some bystander from reading your false statements and thinking they have even a modicum of merit. I really dont care that much to be honest and I dont really want to be defending him on the 2020 nonsense. It seems redundant at this point and a waste of time. Bottom line is, I believed he would have lost even if all 4 of his cases were examined.

But much like white people, you have to be advocates for people who are naturally seen as lesser due to shit like skin color or gender, it's the bare minimum of being a good person. I don't think the men who skewed right want to do that and are just way more worried about themselves before others :/Ofc that isn't the only issue young men face, lots to do with gender roles placed on them and status in the economy, and we're animals who will definitely default to self-preservation, but the threshold for that preservation shouldn't be \\"I was told I'm able to go through life without being seen as just sex on legs\\". Men also have to do the hard work of being resilient and finding ways to love themselves when others won't, or they'll feel miserable. Just.... sorta being mad it isn't given to you, for any person, is a you problem. Men particularly have to force that change with other men, women can help teach our boys to be accepting and loving of one another but we aren't seen as an authority when it comes to other men giving advice, sadly.

I'm not exactly sure why it panned out that way. To get a real answer on how this election would have changed without gerrymandering, you'd need access to something like 538's Gerrymandering Project (updated for 2024) and compare results to one of the algorithms. But that's a pretty tricky process. I found an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice which claims Republicans basically got like 8 extra seats, but I found their methodology questionable, especially in an election where there were significant shifts to Republicans nationwide. The whole thing is hard to quantify because what is a non-gerrymandered map? Under the VRA, minority-majority districts are required by law, and those are essentially gerrymandered (for a good reason). Democrats \\"naturally\\" gerrmander themselves by being packed into cities. A simpler way might be to just go state by state comparing the vote percentage to the number of seats one.

Counting votes in an Irish election is often a lengthy process, but Ireland's STV system means votes aren't wasted and, its supporters say, delivers a parliament that properly reflects voters' choices. At its heart is a method of preferential voting, where electors rank candidates in order, 1, 2, 3, and so on, rather than a simple 'X'. Voters are free to vote only for a single candidate for their choice to count towards the result. Ireland uses constituencies that select between three and five members to ensure the outcome is broadly proportional. Basically, it's a form of ranked choice voting where multiple candidates are elected per district to ensure that the elected legislature reflects the overall distribution of support. I'm a fan of the system (and I think *any* proportional representation system is better than the first-past-the-post we have), but my overall preference is mixed-member proportional representation (MMPR), like the system used in Germany or New Zealand.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 29, 2024"},{"text":"A Large proportion of NYS residents voted for trump so her dumbass comments are not representative of the voters wishes.

And again, they tabulated all the contested votes especially in the Texas case against Pennsylvania. I actually looked at the document online back in 2020 when all of this craziness were going on. There was like 60 pages of every single ballot they were contesting. But it didnt get to the point where the evidence they presented were examined. The State of Texass motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.

If you ask Trump, this was the time, and the democrats fucked it up. Why can't we go after the billionaires? They're the ones destroying our nation. Now we're being run essentially as an oligarchy coming up, but the because the democrats get their money from the billionaires too, they don't want to rock the boat too hard, so they'll let the country burn.Imagine how well a populist candidate backed by the DNC that went after the capital class would do. That message would catch on. Every day Americans are tired of seeing everything their parents be able to afford slip out of their grasp as the ultra wealthy siphon up all the money they used to be distributed amongst everyone even 40 years ago when wealth distribution was still fucked. Now we're just mega ultra-royally fucked. Until the DNC changes course, this will keep happening until fascism wins. If democracy holds on until 2026, democrats will likely win the house and senate break because trump and his cronies will fuck things up so bad. If it holds on until 2028, there will likely be a democrat president again, and democrats will learn the wrong fucking lesson again, just like they did with Biden. Biden didn't win because he was a good candidate, or he had a good message. He won because trump did such a bad, horrible job. 1 million Americans died of Covid. The economy was teetering on a recession. We were all locked inside and fearful, with our leader telling us to maybe inject bleach.But the democrats thought they did such a good job that they muzzled Harris the second after the convention - made anything that was resonating with the voters off the table (like the weird line) and told her they knew best, and the Clintonites and other people who ran losing campaigns took over. They decided to cozy up to republicans like Liz Chaney, to tell Harris to go to the middle on all issues, to not speak on anything controversial. They destroyed her campaign, and destroyed all momentum she had going into the convention.Anyway, back to the point. The average voter doesn't care  what trump had done, what he will do. They only care that he says he will fix things - policy doesn't matter anymore. In groups and out groups matter. 20% credit for first time house buyers etc etc does not matter. The voters are too stupid to care - 50% are functionally illiterate past the 6th grade level. You can't reason your way out of that. You can only make simple promises at them and stay in power long enough to rebuild our education system long enough to  hopefully make a new electorate and more informed society.","title":"These loyal aides stuck by Trump.

Virus was clearly planned and nothing Trump was going to do or say would be good enough for Democrats, majority of MSM, nor the target of their propaganda. They literally went from saying theyd refuse the orange man shot to after the election saying it was necessary and that anyone that resisted were traitors to humanity deserved to lose their jobs and life.\\nRemember when Trump talked about closing borders and masking? Democrats, MSM and liberals: Trump is an overreacting racist. Remember Pelosi down in crowded Chinatown with no mask saying people should get out of the house, and come down to Chinatown. After the election? We all know how that flip flopped.\\nDrug addict Floyd ODing and all the paid agitators protesting, starting fires, etc were icing on the cake.\\nIt would be very interesting to go to an alrernate reality where Trump was allowed in and see where we ended up a year into his term. Covid still a thing? Liberals screaming dictator for being forced to take a shot or risk losing your job or travel rights? Liberals screaming \\"My body my choice\\"?? It almost makes you think the show was supposed to go down like it did with Trump initiating vaccines and lockdowns, Trump given a rest, let the two inept and compromised clowns in to be the pillows (objects you can hit and feel no satisfaction) then bring Trump in again for...who knows what..It will all become clear later.\\nI say never forget, but we will forget and if it happens again ( virus or some other event requiring the masses to comply) there's probably going to be a FAFO reaction from governments.","title":"In response to COVID posts, were over it."},{"text":"This is the dumbest fucking idea Ive ever heard","title":"Top New York Lawmaker Urges Liberal States to Secede from US, Join Canada in Response to Trump Mass Deportation Threat"},{"text":"oh right, we get another 4 years of Trump is about to pay for what he did! articles being posted every day.The system on both sides protected Trump","title":"Fani Williss Case Against Trump Is Nearly Unpardonable  Raising Possibility of a State Prosecution of a Sitting President"},{"text":"They had a shitty job assignment and they sucked at their jobs.","title":"The GOP Barely Won the House"},{"text":"They can always do the struggle sessions.

Also, another dumb thing I've been seeing, is that they keep saying the tariffs will only be temporary damage, because it'll leverage companies and make them start manufacturing in the states. Completely ignoring anyone who tells them that the companies aren't going to start manufacturing in the states all of a sudden. They're just going to raise prices to offset the cost of the tariffs.

There is very much a sort of cultural sense of \\"assuredness\\" when someone goes through a process, even if they don't understand or participate in that process. So long as it is viisble.

They don't give a shit about democracy. All they want is power.Ohio issue one wording on the ballot established by Republicans: To create an appointed redistricting commission not elected by or subject to removal by the voters of the state. And the second bullet point in the ballot said it would \\"establish a new taxpayer-funded commission of appointees required to gerrymander the boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts\\"Republicans literally tried to argue an antigerrymandering amendment was going to REQUIRE gerrymandering. Somehow Republicans think removing elected politicians from the district drawing process who will do anything to get an advantage is forcing gerrymandering because the amendment would have gotten rid of the previously approved language to make gerrymandering for party advantage illegal, which, I shit you not, Republicans literally ignored when the Ohio Supreme Court said their maps were unconstitutional. These people are literally just evil people at this point. The fact the voters of Ohio support them is so sad. This country and this state are so fucked.

Without making a big show of it, Joe Biden and members of his administration in the Transportation and Labor departments have been working continuously to get guaranteed paid sick days for all railroad workers.  We know that many of our members werent happy with our original agreement, Russo said, but through it all, we had faith that our friends in the White House and Congress would keep up the pressure on our railroad employers to get us the sick day benefits we deserve. Until we negotiated these new individual agreements with these carriers, an IBEW member who called out sick was not compensated.  While President Joe Biden was calling on Congress in November to pass legislation to implement the agreement, he stressed that he would continue to encourage the railroads to guarantee paid sick time for their employees.  I share workers concern about the inability to take leave to recover from illness or care for a sick family member, Biden said.

When asked about it, what he said was:  \\"I feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you'll see,\\" Biden said. \\"It doesn't mean I would run a second term. I'm not going to make that judgment at this moment.\\"That's as clear a signal as possible that he didn't intend to run again.

The Truth is despite Trump winning the GOP has been changed forever, who was #2 in the minds of MAGA voters but another even more radical person more willing to use the arms of government to punish political foes, and attack diffrent ideology.With an Electoral college system that continues to deny the majority of voters every cycle, combined with a senate that favors rural conservative Americans which has allowed a radical minority to sweep through power in the courts.I have a justifiable fear if the next election will be overturned, even if its not remotely close, Trump and his voters had ZERO issues with attempting to overturn an election where the other guy won 8 million more votes, THINK ABOUT THAT.
