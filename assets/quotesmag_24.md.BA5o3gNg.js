Acceptance of refugees?You know, marginalized peoples, like I said?Of course not. Republicans are virulently against all of those things, and dissatisfaction with Democrats doesn't suddenly turn reality upside down so that Republicans actually supported them. Republicans have hated gay people as long as they've believed anything. They think black communities are somehow cheating when they vote, and believe black history is racist against white people. They despise immigrants (increasingly legal ones as well as illegal ones), and claim that virtually all refugees are illegitimate at best, and criminals at worst, despite the fact that the vast majority of Republicans come from white immigrant families (many of whom basically arrived in America as refugees).People know whose side the two parties are on.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures - Politicians and pundits are stoking a backlash to trans rights in the wake of the election.

If they only ever played this game once. A should propose they get 99 and B get 1 and B should accept that offer. Since B's options are 1 or 0. But that's not what we observe people doing, A tends towards fairer offers, and B rejects offers they don't judge to be fair even though that means B gets less money.The reasoning is that your actions are also going to influence how other people act, being an A who is fair encourages other people to be fair when they're A and you're B. Even if being violent to people hurting you is the 'correct move' in the moment it contributes to a culture where violence is more acceptable and so people are more likely to be violent against you later.

But we'd be selling this topic short if we didn't zoom out and look at how sexism crops up in every corner of politics.  Even where women have gained power.  In some cases, *especially* where women have gained power.  The big things you're going to notice are:1. It took a ridiculously long time for women to gain political power, even when they weren't barred from doing so.2. There were a ton of efforts that came up short along the way.3. Every step of the process was met with disgusting attacks that were specifically based on the womanhood of these candidates and leaders.4. These effects were multiplied for nonwhite, LGBT+, or other women belonging to another group that gets shit on regularly.**The long, halting history**I'm going to ask you to [read over this excellent timeline of women in US politics.](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/milestones-women-american-politics)  There are some pretty incredible stories in there, but it's a very sad list overall when you consider what's missing:* It was 21 years between the first female candidacy for anything (Elizabeth Cady Stanton's 1866 Congressional run) and a woman being elected to anything (Susanna Salter's successful Mayoral run in 1887).* Most early women in power only lasted a single term before being defeated.  * More powerful elected positions took even longer.  We didn't see a female Governor until 1925, or a female Senator until 1931 - and both were originally appointed to serve the rest of their late husbands' terms.  Voters seemed to need that 'seal of approval' from a man to let them have power.  The first woman to arrive in the Senate without originally filling her husband's seat at some point was Nancy Kassenbaum in *1978.** Even today, there are [12 female Governors out of 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_governors_in_the_United_States) and [25 female Senators out of 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_United_States_Senate#Currently_serving_female_U.S._senators) (not including the 2024 elections).  Remember, women are about half the US population, and a slight majority of voters.* The stats for women of colour are even more ridiculous.  [Four Black women have been elected to the US Senate in history, and two of them were elected in 2024!](https://19thnews.org/2024/11/us-senate-history-black-women-angela-alsobrooks-lisa-blunt-rochester/)  Catherine Cortez Masto [is the only Latina Senator in US history.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Catherine-Cortez-Masto)  At the state level, [three women of color have been elected Governor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_governors_in_the_United_States#Demographics) and not a single Black woman.The general rule: The more powerful the office, the longer it took for any woman to get elected to it, and the less likely they are to be there today.  This helps explain why we haven't had a female President yet.  (We'll come back to that point, too).**It's not just the numbers**So, how can I blame this inequality on sexism?  By looking at the stories those women tell during and after their careers.* Susanna Salter's historic Mayoral election in 1887?  [It was a prank by men to humiliate women that backfired because her politically connected family intervened.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_M._Salter#Mayor)* [Women in politics have historically faced gendered attacks](https://www.vox.com/culture/23671498/don-lemon-nikki-haley-sexism-politics-women).  Whether it's Jeannette Rankin (the first female House Rep) being accused of crying and called a 'schoolgirl' for voting not to go to war, or Carol Moseley Braun (the first Black female Senator) having her appearance mocked on a magazine cover, women faced very specific insults when they tried to gain power.  And let's not forget [the rape threats and the kidnapping plot Gretchen Whitmer - but not male Governors who implemented the same COVID restrictions - faced in 2020.](https://theweek.com/articles/942682/gretchen-whitmer-abduction-plot-window-into-american-misogyny)* Think it doesn't happen today?  [Let's hear from elected women themselves,](https://beatty.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/19-women-in-congress-reveal-the-subtle-and-overt-sexism-they-ve-dealt-with-on-capitol-hill) who deal from everything from being mistaken for waitstaff to people thinking their husbands are the Representative or Senator.  And that's before we get to the subtle stuff (the clothing expectations, being expected to manage their kids' lives as well) and the scary stuff (the death threats).  [The problems are even more insane at the lower levels of politics.](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a60568936/women-in-politics-challenges/)**OK, now it's making more sense...**So if women still face ridiculous bullshit when they run for lower offices, you can only imagine what happens when they run for President.  Actually, you don't have to imagine, I'll tell you.* Go back to that original timeline.  Women ran for President from early on, but they were usually relegated to third parties with no chance of success.  [It wasn't until 1964 that a woman got any serious support for President in a major party,](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/federal-executive/women-presidential-and-vice-presidential-candidates-selected) and Hillary Clinton was the first female candidate to win a state in a major Presidential primary in 2008.  Other women ran, but their campaigns died due to lack of popular support, even if they were as qualified as their male contenders.* Both [Hillary Clinton](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/03/hillary-clinton-faced-constant-sexism-in-2016-campaign-says-ex-aide) and [Kamala Harris](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/1108/harris-trump-election-women) faced overt and subtle sexism in their campaigns.  We've discussed the overt stuff at length, and I'll have lots to say about the more subtle sexism in upcoming posts.**The big picture**This post paints a pretty sad view of women's history in US politics.  But there are obvious signs of hope, too.We may have only 12 female Governors and 25 female Senators - but compare those numbers to a generation ago.  We may have taken far too long to elect women of color to prominent roles - but finally, that's starting to change.  And while it may be unthinkable to many voters to have a female President, history will remember Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris as the ones who first set the path.History bends towards progress because a lot of people keep fighting for it.  And we can't let one election - even one that results in Donald Trump - throw us off that course.  While women have had to wait far too long, and work far too hard, for the right to lead, they've kept it up and changed things dramatically.  Together, we can keep it going if we don't give up.  That's the biggest lesson history teaches us.**Questions to consider**1. Did anything about the sexism faced by female candidates and officeholders surprise you?  What do you think goes through peoples' minds when they treat women in power like this?2. Some of the articles in this post talked about how elected women help each other out.  What can we do, as voters and activists, to support women who step up and run?3. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 21, 2024"},{"text":"Did you get the Rona?

The \\"greed is good\\" era is a nice line that hammers home the essence of early neoliberal thought. to establish a new order  but the era of tinkering around the edges is over.Fully agree.Our philosophy must make clear that the real threat to democracy is widening economic inequality and the colossal power of big money in politicsI disagree with this. I find this statement far too economically reductive, and far too much of a return to 1930s labor movements.Yes, I fully agree that the economic grievances of the working class have been neglected by politicians. Yes, I agree that we focus too much on cultural issues that are abstracted from the class dimension. Yes, I fully agree that socialist economic reform is required to viably move the country forward.However, it is absolutely not the only threat to the nation and to democracy. We need to resist privileging one dimension of a multifaceted crisis over other dimensions. To me, if the Democrats want to successful move forward, yes, they absolutely need to embrace working class struggle, but we need to develop a discourse that is informed by a conceptual framework that brings together class, environment, race, sexuality and gender, religions and atheism, etc., because all of these dimensions are important. Climate change is an existential threat; racism is far from over as Blacks, Indigenous, Latinos and other continue to face discrimination; homophobia and abortion rights are still fought about issues; religious fundamentalisms of all sorts are growing in intensity, including atheist fundamentalism; and capital continues its ruthless exploitation of labor.

It was pretty shocking to some of us to learn that so many of our fellow Americans are as racist and misogynistic as they evidently are. But I have also noticed that this kind of politics isn't *quite* popular enough to win reliably. Think about it. Trump got an enormous boost from James Comey and Vladimir Putin in 2016 and he won. There wasn't an equivalent boost in 2020 and he lost. In 2024 the boost took the form of post-pandemic inflation. I think this is important to keep in mind. Everyone is in a rush to blame the loss on Palestine or Joe Rogan or not channeling Bernie Sanders or whatever else. But it was inflation. It wasn't messaging or policy.

According to The Global Peace Index, \\"peacefulness\\" was declining around the world during Trump's time in office.Trump escalated our country's wars in multiple theaters, leading to massive casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially increased the number of airstrikes. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the violent Saudi-led war against the Houthis. Trump dropped more drone strikes than Obama within his first two years alone.What's more, Trump reversed the Obama-era policy that required reporting on drone strike deaths, transparency my ass. Trump cozied up to dictators, Putin in particular, glorifying the world's autocrats and oppressors.Trump sought to veto Russian sanctions, aided Russian proxy wars, considered returning spy bases to Russia, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, repeated Kremlin propaganda, particularly about NATO, the annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine. He has proposed abandoning our western alliances, and even sided with Putin over our own intelligence agencies.Trump supported one of Putin's greatest goalsweakening NATO. Senior administration officials revealed that multiple times during his presidency, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from NATO.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Then there's the time Trump almost tweeted us into a nuclear war with NK.And how he made close allies with the Saudi crown Prince, Muhammad bin Salman.Trump practically defended Salman after the grotesque murder of Jamal khashoggi, and enabled the bombings of thousands of innocent civilians in Yemen. he also tried cold selling weapons to Salman in the White House and right in front of cameras mind you.Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but two historic war powers resolutions to end his support for the Yemen war and to mitigate the possibility of a potential war with Iran after he approved the assassination of Iranian Qassem SoleimaniTrump also abandoned the Kurds, America's middle east allies that have fought in more wars alongside U.S. troops than Donald \\"bone spurs\\" Trump ever did. And this move only heightened conflict in the Middle East while airing Russian proxies.During the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran scaling up its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year.Trump, who has also cozied up with Netanyahu, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the American embassy there, he also formally acknowledged Israel's annexation of Golan heights, only exacerbating tensions in the region.His \\"middle east peace deal\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, laughably brief and insincere, and actually did the opposite of what it suggests, compromising our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump didn't even conceive of it himself. In fact, It was more of a political stunt than anything as it happened to coincide with his re-election campaign.Trump literally negotiated with terrorists and ordered direct talks with the Taliban without consulting with our allies and partners or allowing the Afghan government at the negotiating tableTrump emboldened the Taliban by publicly considering inviting them to Camp David on the anniversary of 9/11.As part of the withdrawal deal, Trump also pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison, including senior war commanders, without securing the release of the only American hostage known to be held by the Taliban.During the transition from the Trump to Biden, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.There's also Trump's disastrous tariff policies.Donald Trump started a trade war with China that hurt Americans BIGLY. Nearly every economist agrees that Trump's tariff policies did more harm than good. And there's an even greater consensus around the fact that Trump's latest tariff proposals will be far more damaging for most Americans. Implementing tariff policies requires complex negotiations. Trump never bothered with this delicate process.His policies passed costs down to the consumer, while American industries, small businesses and lower income Americans were hurt by his tariffs.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse consequences for the economyTrump's tariffs will generate world wide economic tensions and raise prices.  In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.Trump criticizes Biden for the \\"trade deficit,\\" but in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.I would continue, but when it comes to Trump's foreign policy, there aren't enough characters in a reddit post to lay out all of his failures. But go on, blame Democrats for Putin's inevitable invasion of Ukraine, and the continuation of a century's long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.","title":"The Democratic War Party and Its Loss of Legitimacy"},{"text":"In a similar issue myself.

According to political scientist Matt Grossmann, college-educated white voters this year became a plurality of the Democratic coalition for the first time ever, surpassing both non-college whites as well as voters of color.On a more practical note, this new coalition also risks putting the Democrats on electorally unsound footing. Although college graduates are more reliable voters than their non-college peers, they also constitute a much smaller portion of the population. Without a meaningful share of working-class voters in the mix, the party will struggle to be competitive.The fundamental problem is that the Democrats are going to be unable to deliver because they are in bed with the rich.They can't hide what they are to the working class anymore.","title":"The Democrats Long Goodbye to the Working Class | This years realignment was decades in the making."},{"text":"The felony was a bullshit charge that doesnt make legal sense.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"to be fair, Trump is a lifelong criminal who simply got charged for the crimes he committed.  war crimes never stick to presidents/leaders of the greatest war corporation on earth","title":"a little hint at the truth for the most faithful citizens, the non democracy-practicists."},{"text":"Russia was also promised that NATO will not expand beyond east Germanythis is false btw https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/115204.htmhttps://hls.harvard.edu/today/there-was-no-promise-not-to-enlarge-nato/","title":"The Democratic War Party and Its Loss of Legitimacy"},{"text":"Whats libertarian about the US even having a say in how another sovereign country chooses to engage in warfare?","title":"Its not War its Democratic War /s"},{"text":"Even in WW2, the biggest casualties - around 23 million were from the Soviet side while the USA only lost 400K people.

It isn't just commoners being mad.French Revolution is the perfect example - in 1786, Louis XVI's controller general asked for the three estates general to convene to approve a financial reform package. First time it was done since 1614. The idea was to make the aristocratic classes pay taxes. The meeting was scheduled for 1789 in the meantime the 3 estates would be giving the king their story.The \\"middle class\\" estate - I put this in quotes because although it would generally be all the commoners, it's going to have the mercantile and richer of the non-nobility to be chief representatives - created its own assembly. What required this assembly to have power is that *47 nobles joined them*. It was extensively organized by the Jacobin political club, which comprised a lot of the rich but not aristocratic French. Everyone was on edge and Parisian citizens stormed a fortress (military arms were centrally stored back then since gun powder is dangerous) to secure the guns. In response, the noble estates fled because they thought there would be riots. So when the national assembly met, it had few if any nobles, so they passed the end of feudalism.Where it turns radical is the debate between constitutional monarchy or something else gets violent. By now, the elites were exiled. By 1793, the king and his wife is killed, and that sort of solves the debate. All the nobles in the military had defected with the monarchy. So the ones in the military were members of the third estate and would follow orders. **What requires the \\"heads on a pike\\" is for the wealthy to lose de facto military control, something that isn't possible in contemporary government**And what you're missing is what happened in the aftermath of all this instability?

But in other ways we don't... we still have to work a majority of our waking hours, there is still massive social, economic, and political inequality, and there is still scarcity and war. Part of it is the hedonistic treadmill...the more humans create the more they consume. The other part of it is that capitalism or not, there are people that will always seek to have more power/resources/influence over others.Unfortunately the view you presented doesn't help anyone alive now, so it probably shouldn't be surprising that they wouldn't support it. Perhaps there is a *chance* that a socialist revolution that shifts the economic paradigm in a way so that automation this time allows us to live in a work-less utopia. But not until after decades of conflict. It's not really an issue that billionaires or people are evil, it's that people in general are just really bad at prioritizing the distant future over their current needs and wants...which coincidentally is why meaningful climate change efforts are so elusive.","title":"CMV: Automation can only be a good thing."},{"text":"Holy.

The problem is that we do not live in that world nor are we anywhere close to it.  Without a job or somebody who provides for them (in the case of kids, spouses, etc), the majority of people would not be able to eat, pay bills, or afford healthcare, never mind doing any of the things that might be considered a \\"hobby\\".  When people express concern that automation will replace their jobs they are rightfully worried that they will be essentially edged out of the economy and cast aside, being unable to provide for themselves or their family.  This concern is legitimate because that has happened to countless people during prior waves of automation.Now even if you don't care about the well being or happiness of people edged out of the economy (or their families) by automation, you should absolutely care about what can happen when you get enough disgruntled unemployed people with little left to lose.

For example, an expansionist nature is pretty well baked into the original idea of fascism, and Trump very much isn't that. Depends what you mean by \\"well baked into\\". Of the three well realized fascist states (depending how you'd like to count them, I'm open to arguing about this), two were expansionist to some degree, with Nazi Germany being particularly aggressive, and one wasn't.

The whole point of my original post was that rand is saying we must act as policemen to make them stop fighting. Who the fuck are we to tell people to give up? If anything we should be condeming Russia and putting even more financial restrictions on them while giving a level of aid to an ally who is being attacked by a foreign aggressor. Same example as earlier.. NAP doesn't prevent me from punching someone mugging a friend. Now how aggressive we want to be in That punch (or level of support) is what is up for debate... Which is what i stated earlier that you said wasnt. There are many who support financial restrictions.. Which is a level of intervention and isn't Isolationist and would thus be debated. A large portion of LP members also aren't opposed to sending weapons. What they don't want is billions of dollars and the army sent ensuring loss of American lives. And again.. We're an open borders party.. We literally cannot be that AND an Isolationist party. I'm also curious where you've been around thousands of LP members, conventions highest attendance has only been 1k total, and there hasn't been an LP event larger than that in living memory or are you referencing your online engagement after calling a vet a keyboard warrior?

It combines elements of nationalism, militarism, economic self-sufficiency, and totalitarianism.Same thing with the US. Trump wants to pull war money out of Ukraine. He spoke about pulling US troops out of Afghanistan, and he's not bearing on sending troops into any conflicts any time soon.In fact, the US under Trump is less totalitarian than other parliamentarian countries like the UK, Japan, France, etc. where the executive branch has more power than the US executive branch.I'll give you that Trump is nationalistic (immigration), but ultranationalism needs a strong, active military, which isn't strictly true under Trump. He does not have the backing of the armed forces like any other Fascist leader in history nor any different from previous POTUSes. Before mentioning any regulation on women's bodies which is a sore subject, Trump is not keen on making a federal rule on this subject, rather allowing US states to choose their own rules and regulations on this subject. He could sign a national abortion bill if it passed his desk and has mentioned he was open to it.I understand that Trump acts like a firebrand which seems to be a strong authoritarian leader, but he is less of one than a president like FDR who was probably the closest president to being a true dictator, albeit beloved by many.This should sway you to change your mind about Trump being a totalitarian with the definition you've given and the examples I've provided.

I was also upset when Trump was up 16 mil votes on the day after election Day, but California's voting laws mean that votes are still coming in. As it stands right now, in terms of the popular vote, was the closest election since Bush/Gore in '00. That's far from a mandate from the people.Third, there are checks and balances. All of his cabinet picks still need to be confirmed which may be hard for some of his extreme picks. Matt Geatz just withdrew as AG due to his ethics investigation, I wonder how many others that have been in the news won't make it across the finish line.Last, Trump is only a would-be fascist insofar as it serves his narcissism. For example, on Jan 3, 2021, DOJ officials threatened a mass exodus over a memo written by a low level DOJ agent named Jeffrey Clark. Trump was about to do it anyway until he was convinced it would be a bad look for him. Someone who's committed to fascism as an ideology would've done it anyway, but Trump just uses fascist methods to serve himself.","title":"CMV: America is Fascist and either doesn't know or care."},{"text":"Thats already how it is","title":"Liberals on IG and TikTok be like..."},{"text":"Firstly, the goal of the changes in the deptartment of education is to make education better, based on the idea that federalizing of standards and testing approaches and the likes of \\"no child left behind\\" resulted in the dumbing down of america and that we should return to more state level control which seemed to work better than the status quo.

Processed foods, such as chips, fall much lower on the food pyramid. We also offer programs to help providers ensure understanding and monitoring of the importance of eating healthy foods. In fact, the very regulations that Gluesenkamp Perez says prohibit serving fruit actually require it. In the section on menus, state regulations say that an early learning provider must serve a fruit or vegetable during at least one snack per day. I cant find any evidence that Gluesenkamp Perez is right that in Washington state, regulations make it easier for childcare providers to open a pre-packaged, often ultra-processed snack than to peel a banana or cut up an apple. Her Banana Act appears to be based on a situation that does not happen, and she seems to have unfairly maligned her own state government. The only thing Gluesenkamp Perezs office could point me to that even faintly resembled what she describes was a rule in effect in Austin, Texas, which required that childcare providers serve prepackaged foods unless they had a food permit. But she had made a specific claim that regulators in her own state were essentially gaslighting her constituents, and it doesnt appear that she can justify that claim. I am not claiming that all daycare providers across America are free of regulatory burdens that inhibit serving nutritious meals. There may well be some badly-written regulations.

For instance, Boris Johnson made his name in part by exaggerating stories about the supposedly loopy regulations promulgated by the E.U. One of those was even about bananas. He said the E.U. was dictating what shape bananas had to be. This wasnt entirely wrong, in that there was a quality control standard requiring bananas put on sale not to be malformed, but there are good reasons why you should want the quality of your produce guaranteed. Instead of explaining those reasons, and then giving thoughtful arguments on why a different policy is needed, anti-regulation demagogues use whatever hyperbole they can to try to convince you that the government is crazy. (See Gluesenkamp Perezs like six sinks, when the regulation in question requires two sinks. Gutierrez told me that while these rules around sinks are [a] bit more stringent than family home rules [...] DCYF works with providers on different ways to use sinks for multiple tasks, if sinks are cleaned and sanitized between uses.)This matters because there is currently a major debate about what direction the Democratic Party should take, and Gluesenkamp Perez is touted by some as the correct model. But her politics are pro-business centrism with a working-class rhetorical affect. She makes a lot of showy tributes to Real America. She has a chainsaw in her office. She hired her legislative director, in part, because the woman drove a Toyota Camry with 200,000 miles on it. She confronted Kamala Harris over the White Houses use of plastic Christmas garlands, implying to the vice president that it was an affront to western pine tree farmers. (Gluesenkamp Perez says that Harris appeared to roll her eyes, which she took as further evidence of the Democratic Partys elitist disdain for good workin folks.) But Gluesenkamp Perezs politics are not progressive, and she is trying to rebuild the centrist Blue Dog Coalition. There was sort of this idea that I was this undercover AOC, she said, but she has very different conclusions from Ocasio-Cortez. Indeed, Gluesenkamp Perez is a staunch supporter of Israel who has received tens of thousands of dollars from AIPAC and voted to censure Rashida Tlaib. She has blamed the fentanyl crisis on lax immigration enforcement, despite the fact that undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers are typically not the people bringing fentanyl into the country. (I was talking to a woman who runs one of the largest labor and delivery wards. She said 40 percent of the babies there have at least one parent addicted to fentanyl. What is empatheticto tell them thats their problem, or to take border security seriously?) She was also one of the first to signal shed vote to protect Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson in a motion to vacate. Gluesenkamp Perez insists this makes her a maverick. I think that the binary of politics on a lateral spectrum from left to right is absolutely bullshit. Like politics is three dimensional, its maybe a nautilus even.

You can also find things that don't fit the mold.  For example, an expansionist nature is pretty well baked into the original idea of fascism, and Trump very much isn't that.

I remember seeing Austin Peterson (who ended up working with the GOP later in his career) at convention explicitly state that we need to help our allies. Gary Johnson, John McAfee (rip?) and Mark Feldman (rip) then echoed this statement. Was an incredible convention to be at. Fun fact, my conversion to the LP started because of my time in the military. Side note, as crazy as McAfee was, he was a brilliant orator and his charisma was incredible to see.

Broadly, I'd say something like:* MiamiMiami -- Dade County, reaching into the upper keys to fill out its quota. If it needs to shed a few voters, stick Aventura into the adjacent NotMiami superdistrict.\\n* NotMiami -- Broward + Palm Beach County. Includes rural Palm Beach County, and a gerrymandered strip to scoop up most of the Seminole Tribe. Seminoles are a very urban Indian tribe &amp; most live in the Fort Lauderdale metro area, but a big chunk of the \\"rural\\" part are cattle ranchers in Hendry County.\\n* SWFL -- Naples (Collier county), Fort Myers (Lee county), Port Charlotte (Charlotte County), plus whatever part of the Keys are \\"left over\\" and unallocated, and a sufficiently large chunk of rural south-central Florida to account for approximately 60-70% of the quota assigned to one of its representatives (so it COULD actually elect a rural-minded rep if voters there overwhelmingly agreed on one). \\n* Sarasota-Bradenton, plus the rural area eastward. Probably includes Venice area, unless it has to be stuck in SWFL to quota it out.\\n* DefinitelyNotMiami -- Martin (Stuart), St. Lucie (PSL), Indian River (Fort Pierce), Brevard (Melbourne/Titusville), plus the remaining chunk of rural south-central Florida not allocated to SWFL. Probably includes St. Cloud county, unless Orlando or UnCoast needs to cannibalize it.\\n* UnCoast -- Lakeland to Winterhaven, south to Lake Placid. The blatantly visible urban strip along US-27. If it's not big enough to merit 3 representatives, I guess the southern end could be agglomerated into SWFL or Sarasota-Bradenton\\n* Tampa-St. Pete -- self-explanatory, the only question is \\"how far north and east does it go\\". I personally think Lakeland most appropriately belongs in the UnCoast, but otherwise probably ought to be lumped in with Spring Hill &amp; Ocala/Gainesville's superdistrict.That's about as far north as my opinion goes, besides thinking that Jacksonville's superdistrict would more appropriately extend southward to include Palatka &amp; St. Augustine than westward into ultra-ruralness. But then again, half of literal *Jacksonville* is primordial wilderness that could rightfully be lumped into a superdistrict consisting of \\"everything north of Gainesville, east of Tallahassee, south of Georgia, and west of Jacksonville\\").I might even suggest that if it made boundaries neater, they could allow variance of up to a few thousand, with a rule that voters in an adjacent over-apportioned superdistrict (with more voters than it strictly should) could then file a petition asking to be reassigned to an adjacent under-apportioned superdistrict. Likewise, once two districts have been equalized by individual voter-transfers, they could maintain a secondary queue that allows voters to petition to swap places with voters in an adjacent county. In other words, voluntary voter swaps could only *reduce* otherwise-allowed small amounts of malapportionment, then maintain it once achieved. Nevertheless, I don't think strict apportionment equality is even necessarily good if it forces stupid situations like dumping a few neighborhoods of Broward or Miami-Dade into the adjacent county just for the sake of strict-but-ephemeral numerical equality that will be blown to pieces over the next 10 years as people move in and out *anyway*. Or, if it would stick Key Largo and 17 houses on Upper Matacumbe Key into MiamiMiami, but leave the rest of UMK in a different superdistrict. JFC, pick an island that gets reasonably close to the target, and if one superdistrict ends up with a few hundred too many or too few... well, as long as you're respecting perceived urban boundaries, *so be it*.","title":"The surprising idea from two conservative Democrats that could fix the House"},{"text":"Are they able to do anything that won't be reversed in a month and a half?

Agreed.I do think the warrant for Deif (hey Pope Formosus!) and the timing show a strong indication of a certain prejudicial bias though.I dont believe so. ICC was contemplating an arrest warrant for Sinwar, but by the time they issued the warrants officially, Sinwar was dead. Same for the second in command. Issuing a warrant for Deif, the heir apparent for Hamas, is the logical next step. If hes confirmed dead and another leader rises from the headless chicken that is Hamas right now, an arrest warrant will be considered - and probably granted - for them too.As for the sexual harassment allegation for Khan, indeed the timing can be suspect, but I think you have cause and effect reversed. The internationals courts - both the ICJ at state level and the ICC at individual level - have been investigating Israel and its leaderships actions in Gaza for quite some time. It is now known that since May, Israeli (and US) officials have been threatening the ICC and its judges, trying to influence its decisions in Favour of Israel.[[Source 1]](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/israelgaza-threats-against-icc-promote-culture-impunity-say-un-experts) [[Source 2]](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/05/29/israel-s-shadow-war-against-the-icc-between-threats-and-surveillance_6673015_4.html) [[Source 3]](https://www.scottishlegal.com/articles/us-and-israel-criticised-for-threatening-international-criminal-court)The ICC didnt budge to the threats, quite the opposite: publicised and exposed them.Then, some months later while ICC is readying to rule on the warrants - with all indications pointing that the warrants will be issued - we have some sexual harassment allegations unearth about ICCs chief prosecutor, Khan. If one were to see ill intent in the suspicious timing, then suspicions point to the exact opposite direction than what youre implying: its suspicious that those sexual misconduct allegations unearth now, as the ICC is finalisons its decision on the warrants, after failed - and documented beyond any reasonable doubt - attempts to influence the court.","title":"Tlaib: Blinken Must Resign Over Lies About Israel Blocking Humanitarian Aid | The Biden administration cannot pick and choose when they comply with our own laws, Tlaib said."},{"text":"Because he got over eighty million votes.","title":"Why is biden still the president!"},{"text":"Israel hasn't done war crimes.

We need that data  to go start looking for people, the source said.Ed Cuccia, a Manhattan-based immigration lawyer, said several of his clients had already been given the app when it was piloted, with the instructions to check-in up to once a week.Its a little glitchy, he told The Telegraph.I had people that it didnt work properly for, they had to keep pushing the buttons, he added.But Mr Cuccia, of Cuccia Law Firm, said he does not think the system change will make much difference as the in-person checks are already a bit of a joke.Theres not much difference between this app thing and in-person reporting.

With the sheer number of late deciders who broke for Harris, it seems like her biggest issues were the short campaign time and the massive propaganda machine she was up against.

Can't believe in the NAP and then not defend it when it's violated on large scales. Advocating for only defense isnt an LP belief it's an isolationist belief that the party moved away from. This is where minarchy vs classical liberalism (not American liberalism) comes into play. The LP as a party has stances in both areas but vast majority support varying levels of intervention when mass killings are happening by governments. The level of intervention is what is really ip for debate.. Ie do we send troops, money, weapons, or do nothing? Do we let the dictator commit genocide, or take over other countries that we are allied with? When wars between countries are happening we as a country are impacted and there are things we can do to provide assistance to our allies. If we truly only helped when we were attacked we'd have no friends globally. You can't live in a global community entirely with your head in the sand, especially as a first world leader.

Society, the economy, technology, have all just become too complex.

The author addresses the definition of a C19 \\"case\\" and problematic \\"death from COVID-19\\":Now, I am pointedly not claiming that the epidemiological definitions of case and death were wrong per se (note that, snark aside, everything that I have so far said is compatible with the belief that these definitions were, and perhaps remain, the most appropriate ones given the circumstances). Instead I aim to illustrate how these definitions, on which were based the main numerical indicators of pandemicity, were not self-evident or given, but rather hinged on a series of value-judgements made by particular people with particular disciplinary and political priorities. On these terms, then, insofar as its existence depends on these local value-judgements, a pandemic cannot truly be wholly described as a natural phenomenonindeed, had sober clinicians, medical anthropologists, or certain lockdown-hating youths been allowed to influence the relevant definitions, the pandemic would have had a very different shape. Given the levels of spending, coercion, and general terror that pandemics are taken to justify, it is critical thatalongside asking whether they should justify all of these thingswe ask who gets to make the value-judgements that bring into being a pandemic event. Who, in other words, gets to set the cycle threshold, or choose the death-attribution rubric, or even determine what the unusual in unusual preponderance of cases of and deaths means? In as much as it obscures these crucial questions and reifies a biological understanding of pandemics, the debate over COVID-19s origin is a distraction and presents no real challenge to the international gaggle of pandemic preparedness professionals currently dominating the post-Covid lesson-learning process and taking the primacy of their own value-judgements for granted.","title":"No Pandemic is a Natural Phenomenon | The pandemic is not primarily a biological phenomenon but a social one, ... born of ... a series of value-judgements and pragmatic decisions."},{"text":"Yup.

Post Helene, I spent as much time talking FEMA assistance and organizing donated goods as I did ballots and politics.From what we saw here, the traditional efforts from the party apparatuses have dropped off significantly.  Lots of retired folks and underpaid volunteers didn't come back to those efforts after COVID, and unaffiliated orgs like mine are showing up with PAC money.I do think we might be seeing the beginning of a trend of some of our rural areas becoming less blood red politically. The people that don't have ghastly politics are getting tired of Republicans freaking out over things like trans people and being generally out of touch, though I also think part of the issue this election was that too much energy was spent in rural/less blue areas like mine and the base work in the cities was somewhat ignored.We're doing *something* right, the overperformance downballot has to mean something, IMO.

Dems have too many people with the vibe of an MBA from the private equity company who reassures you not to worry about job security on Wednesday and then lays everyone off on Friday.But the media problem is a confounding factor to all of it, yeah. One problem is that the Dems have always been more wary of the media. I remember complaining *decades* ago about their reluctance to simply go on TV and defend Dem policy and principles. You'd end up with panel shows that had two Republicans, a reporter from the WSJ, and a reporter from some other media outlet who was the only \\"liberal\\" voice.

If Kamala herself was anti-trans, the Republicans would just look at more minor Democratic politicians who are pro-trans, or even celebrities who are pro-trans ,and use them to declare that the Dems are hopelessly beholden to trans people.You keep thinking that the debate will proceed in good faith if we made a little adjustment here and there, but it won't. The Republicans are bad faith actors, and the truth of this stuff literally doesn't matter to them at all.Then there's the fact that you still can't square the circle even with a more anti-trans Democratic Party: many Americans don't like trans people, okay, and believe them to somehow threaten women and children (disgusting BS, but we're talking what people believe here), and so elected... a rapist and pedophile to defend those women and children? Okay? How will the party deal with that?

Minority rights are civil rights. Gay rights are civil rights. Women's rights are civil rights. And we're interested in improving the lot of White people and Males as well. We all thrive when everyone is given an equal shot at prosperity.\\"If you concentrate on any group of people, other people feel left out. The end result of that will be felt here in about 60 days, when the consequences of our actions at the polls manifests at the White House. Berating people who felt the Dems didn't care about them won't help. The Democrats need to make it clear that they stand for everyone through actions as well as words.

She taught me how to dress and behave in an interview and at work. I was working in offices by 18. I learned from those around me, but there was very little acceptance of regular mistakes made (such as transposing a number when entering data), but I did get suggestions on how to better check my work etc. I had also worked retail before and my managers were big on courtesy and custom service. It helped greatly. But I dont see the younger generations getting these same opportunities. A lot of younger people arent being taught these things and arent being told they are important skills to use while at work. These managers throw up their hands and huff and puff, but where is the training and education?? The older folks are just lazy and its affecting gen z. I see it with the younger kids too. My kids all say please and thank you and clear their plates and do basic chores. I have had parents be shocked by this. Teach your kids to be self sufficient and they will be.

If everyone complaining lives in Europe I would understand because Europe has basically been the one keeping the Ukrainian government afloat with funding.Ukraine is nothing but a \\"win\\" from the US's perspective. We are clearing out old gear for a fraction of the cost it would have cost us to decommission it. We are getting paid back for some of that. The cleared out stores are being refilled by money spent on defense contractors which comes back in tax revenue. The US gets to watch a country 1/3 the size dismantle an openly hostile adversary and set it's economy back decades and set it self up for a long term demographic collapse. We get to do this without setting a single US soldier in danger. It would've been better if the US had just opened up all the toy chests from day 1 rather than this drip feed BS we have been doing.Guess what! We can even spend domestically like we did on the Chips act and the IRA.

This is an immensely broad subject and deeply connected to the overall health care economy of the U.S.And if you are unaware, the health care economy of the U.S. is fractured due to over a century of government intervention. This is like asking how do libertarians intend to deal with cancer. The answer is not political. Libertarians want people with mental health problems or cancer or any other problem, to be able to obtain the care they need.But we must recognize how that century+ of intervention has made obtaining that care more expensive and made us all more reliant upon third-party payers like insurance or government.Ultimately, what the government has done through its intervention is made people more dependent upon additional government intervention (I would assert this is always a goal of government) while also limiting access to care which enriches a smaller number of providers who benefit from the regulatory state.When these happen together, we have higher costs and the need for more resources to be expended by government to maintain more dependent people and those increased costs.So if you seek a solution to mental health and to health care in general, the answer is always to start removing the layers of intervention like layers of an onion.

Some of the biggest symptoms of depression are loneliness, meaninglessness, and helplessness. Joining a volunteer fire department, taking part in a religious organization, helping your neighbor build a barn or tending to aging people can make you feel better about yourself and more connected to your community. And if you need therapy, you can find or start a community organization to hire a therapist to help people in the community.  Government programs in the US have a history of being public relations showpieces for whoever is being elected - but the real work of mental health is done in communities, schools, and daycares. If you do want to be involved in government in a libertarian and constitutional way, get involved in your school board and support your daycare workers and teachers by making sure they have good wages and good working environments.","title":"how should we as Libertarian, handling the mentally health our people?"},{"text":"Not that we need that money domestically for anything.","title":"Biden Administration Seeks to Cancel $4.6 Billion of Ukraines Debt"},{"text":"So you speak for all minorities?","title":"How Democrats could win back Latino men"},{"text":"Welp, Don should not be that president.

She became a rock star in the education world and her system took the entire anglosphere by storm.Weirdly George W. Bush (stuck clock right twice a day) was almost the hero as he tried to oppose it. His family had a ton of experience in early reading education and he preferred the old phonics system. In fact, he was in a classroom observing a phonics lesson when 9/11 happened.But the companies selling three-cuing in the US had great marketing and lobbyists. They made Bush seem like an idiot, and phonics seem old-fashioned. Since most teachers leaned left and hated W anyway, three-cuing caught on.The problem is, that it doesn't work well. It teaches kids to never sound out a word, to guess at the words based on context, and to skip ones they don't understand.

At the same time, they have more limited resources so as not to have a $ advantage in meeting the people they represent over the 'Capitol' reps (they obviously have a time advantage).  There are enough 'Home' reps such that for any given State, State population/(senators+capitol reps+home reps) ~= population of least populous State/4.  The 'Home' reps are selected, largely from losing candidates, based on the proportion of first choice votes.  The House delegations, if 6 or more reps total, or Congressionsl delegations, if fewer than 6 House reps, shall mirror as close as possible the vote shares for all representatives.Ie, Wyoming's home rep would likely be a Democrat, unless Rs get over 87.5%.Whereas California or Texas might get some Green or Libertarian home reps.This would move the EC to be closer to the national.popular vote, but could also make electors more responsive to local populations. Senator-electors go to.the Statewide popular vote winner.Capitol-electors go to the candidate who carried that district Home-electors go proportional based on the votes not used to get 50%+1 in the districts. (Ie, Wyoming is 67-30-3 candidate A-candidate B-other candidates (so A gets 3 electors by winning both the State and the District) , then the Home elector is for B because B carries the remainder 30-16.99-3; in Cali, that 3% might get an elector or 2)","title":"The surprising idea from two conservative Democrats that could fix the House"},{"text":"Dude, they were confirmed 50-49.

Harris was a less than well-known figure and her step up did a lot for her identity as a potential charismatic leader.

Looking back at the mood around the switch, pre-assassination attempt, I feel like politically active Dems were lukewarm on her at best. I don't know if she's able to build that excitement with a cold open, but I could be wrong. One other thing to consider is that she inherited a \\"veteran\\" campaign team from Biden. There were a lot of more traditional voices like Jen OMalley Dillon and David Plouffe. Maybe Harris would have a campaign team that's able to generate excitement where she didn't get it in the general and penetrated non-traditional media circles. Hard to say, but I feel comfortable that the assassination fulcrum that Harris levered on had some bearing that only exists in those extreme circumstances.

We don't care that we have the most heavily financed military on the planet and could knock a couple hundred billion dollars off the military budget and create stable social safety nets all while still having the most heavily financed military on the planet. We also see any type of social safety nets as inherently evil. The thing is that 50 years ago social safety nets were commonly accepted by the average citizen as necessary. It wasn't until we left the social compact version of governing, around Reagan's administration, that the idea of a social compact form of governance became evil. It started with faux bogeymen like welfare queens and then we cut taxes on the wealthy shifting the burden from those who can afford it to those who shouldn't have to order can't. We ended unions, pension plans (which are massively different from a 401k), and implemented at will employment. These are some of the things that lead us here. Western Europe didn't implement these (or at least not as dramatically) and they have a better standard of living for it.","title":"Americans whove traveled to Western Europe: Have you noticed that Europe seems to operate better than the US?

Marine experts from Heriot-Watt University who have helped reintroduce about 30,000 European flat oysters to the estuary said divers and underwater cameras showed they were doing well. The Firth of Forth was once home to one of the largest native European oyster reefs in the north-east Atlantic, yielding up to 30 million oysters a year during the 1800s, but by the beginning of the 1900s they had been fished to local extinction. Those reintroduced through the Restoration Forth project, which is also planting 4 hectares of seagrass, have so far had an 85% survival rate. Naomi Arnold, the Restoration Forth project manager from WWF Scotland, said they were delighted by the early signs of success. This is down to the hard work of not only the staff involved but the hundreds of volunteers who have turned out in all weathers to help us prepare the oysters for deployment and to physically put them in the water, she said. This is a key milestone in our project. With this success and the amount we have learned, things are looking very positive for future restoration in the area. Since September last year, about 30,000 oysters have been reintroduced at four sites that are being monitored regularly. Edinburgh Shoreline, Fife Coast and Countryside Trust, the Marine Conservation Society, Project Seagrass and the WWF are among those involved in the project. It has been 100 years since oysters were last present in the estuary. Oysters from the Forth were once transported across the UK and Europe, both for consumption and to restock beds elsewhere. But the pressure of this activity led to the complete collapse of the reefs in the estuary, and the oysters disappeared. Naomi Kennon, a Heriot-Watt research associate for the project, said: Over the next year we hope to see these oysters continue to thrive and to start to enhance the biodiversity on the seabed. Oysters enhance water quality through filter feeding, store carbon and enhance biodiversity by creating a complex habitat providing homes and shelter for countless other organisms. Those involved hailed the mammoth community effort that had gone into getting the oysters released, with a community engagement and citizen science scheme helping to educate people about their importance. Anna Inman, a shellfish engagement officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said: The community support for oyster restoration has been incredible. This achievement is a testament to the dedication of all the volunteers who have generously given their time. The project not only aims to revive marine life but also highlights the cultural heritage of oysters and emphasises our collective responsibility to restore and protect our seas for future generations.!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I see an opening for Sarah McBride","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Climate change should be removed from the government by separation of church and state.

Exploiting tragedies for political gain is their M.O.According to actual data, immigrants are not committing crimes at a greater rate than native born Americans. That includes crimes like \\"rape and murder.\\"In fact, a study published based on data from the TEXAS Department of Public Safety found that people in the U.S. *illegally* had *\\"substantially lower crime rates than native-born citizens and legal immigrants across a range of felony offenses.*Also according to data, immigrants are not smuggling fentanyl into the U.S. on their backs. Most seizures are happening at ports of entryAuthorities also admit that nearly all of it is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border. In other words, US citizens are more likely, according to data, to bring fentanyl across the border. Virtually no fentanyl is seized from migrants seeking asylum.And keep in mind that the fentanyl scourge began well before Biden took office. In fact, the Biden administration has done an exponentially better job at detecting and seizing fentanyl at the border.And don't forget that, at the behest of Trump himself, who remarked that the recent bipartisan border deal would have been too politically advantageous for Biden, Republicans were ordered to shoot down one of the most stringent immigration reform bills in recent history. One that Democrats and Republicans negotiated on for months.Fearing damage to their political careers and reputations, while also taking into consideration how this piece of legislation would benefit Democrats politically, most Republicans toed the party line and thwarted the bill's passing, while many did without knowing its details, and even Republicans like Katie Britt, who actually worked on the bill, turned it down.Republicans would rather run on immigration as a wedge issue, stoking fears, than actually address it.It must also be said that Trump never followed through on building his border wall and Mexico did not pay for it. The problem with Republican immigration proposals is that they are often extreme and impractical, and whenever Democrats point this out or oppose these disingenuous policies, while instead offering more pragmatic, humane, workable and sensible solutions to the \\"border crisis,\\" Republicans respond with over the top accusations and political histrionics.And contrary to Trumps claims, by the end of his term, and after various funding fights in Washington, his admin had actually implemented roughly 450 miles of barriersa fraction of the total length required for a border wallwhile much of it was just upgrading barriers that already existed.

First of all, there is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants. Studies have found that native-born Americans are much more likely to commit crimes than the undocumented.Data also shows that there is no evidence of a terrorist attack committed by an undocumented migrant, nor is there evidence that the Biden administration is \\"allowing\\" terrorists to cross our borders.Also, and it should go without saying, \\"asylum seekers\\", are not, as Donald Trump seems to believe, foreigners who have escaped from mental asylums!Additionally, Republicans have continuously lied about the number of migrant crossings and encounters under Biden.In recent months, unauthorized border crossings have actually dropped to the lowest levels since prior to Biden taking office.","title":"Laken Riley suspect Jose Ibarra took free Biden admin flight to Georgia  where he hunted down student"},{"text":"Oddly, Trump did the exact same thing here, just from the Republican perspective.","title":"Where did Hillary Clinton outperform Kamala Harris and vice versa?"},{"text":"Exactly how many bombs did Trump drop?

It would be like bees not making honey anymore because theyre too stressed out.Or you turn it the other way around.In a modern society, we have the leisure of not needing to have kids.People in ye olden days didn't have kids because they liked having them - I'm sure women back then hated it as much as they do now, given the pain they go through. However, back then you needed to have as many kids as possible because they were essentially your retirement fund, and most of them didn't make it to adulthood. You can still see this in less developed countries - even if they're capitalist, like in India, people have kids because they need to because otherwise they'll just have nobody to take care of them in old age.Saying that people liked having kids just for the fuck of it is disingenuous, and disregards that people nowadays choose not to have kids for a huge *variety* of reasons.Can you substantiate this?

The wader has held mythical status in Western Palearctic birding terms. It has always been poorly understood and considered rare, with its breeding grounds little known. The last well-documented nest was found exactly 100 years ago, in 1924, near Tara in Omsk Oblast, Russia. Its breeding grounds since then remained unknown, despite several intensive searches. Isotope analysis suggested that a population bred in northern Kazakhstan steppes.  The species was migratory, wintering in shallow freshwater habitats around the Mediterranean, including famously in north Morocco, where the last widely accepted record occurred in 1995. \\n **Slender-billed Curlew extinction** Today, a paper published in Ibis documents and quantifies the extinction of Slender-billed Curlew. Widespread agricultural expansion and conversion, and to a lesser extent hunting, are cited as the driving factors behind this. Conducted by scientists from the RSPB, BirdLife International, Naturalis Biodiversity Center and Natural History Museum, the study used objective statistical analysis of threats to the species and a database of records, including museum specimens and sightings, to assess the likelihood of extinction. The analysis shows that there is a 99.6% chance that the bird no longer exists and went extinct about the time of the last record in 1995. As a result, Slender-billed Curlew becomes only the third bird species to spend a large part of its annual cycle in the Western Palaearctic to be known to have gone globally extinct since 1500, after Great Auk (last seen alive in 1844) and Canary Islands Oystercatcher (last collected in 1913 and reported as absent in the 1940s). The study also outlines that the last documented and unanimously accepted observation of Slender-billed Curlew was made in 1995, at Merja Zerga in Morocco, which had become a renowned site in the early 1990s at which to see the species. \\n **Druridge Pools curlew** Famously, a bird at Druridge Pools, Northumberland, from 4-7 May 1998 was accepted onto the BOU's British list, before being removed in 2013 following a review of the identification. Since the Northumberland report a number of claimed, but unverified, sightings of single birds from Italy and Greece, though none were documented with conclusive photographs. A flurry of claims were made in the Danube Delta in the early 2000s, including a count of six on 11 August 2004, and a single bird was reported from Albania in 2006. None were verified. Alex Berryman, Red List Officer at BirdLife International and a co-author of the study, said: \\"The devasting loss of Slender-billed Curlew sends a warning that no birds are immune from the threat of extinction. More than 150 bird species have become globally extinct since 1500. Invasive species have often been the culprit, with 90% of bird extinctions impacting island species. \\"However, while the wave of island extinctions may be slowing, the rate of continental extinctions is increasing. This is a result of habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation and other threats. Urgent conservation action is desperately needed to save birds; without it we must be braced for a much larger extinction wave washing over the continents.\\" \\n **Shorebird declines** Nicola Crockford, Principal Policy Officer for the RSPB, added: \\"This is one of the most fundamentally devastating stories to come out of nature conservation in a century and gets to the very heart of why the RSPB and BirdLife Partnership are doing what we do; that is, ultimately, to prevent extinction of species. \\"This is the first known global extinction of a bird from mainland Europe, North Africa and West Asia. It happened on our watch. How can we expect countries beyond Europe to step up for their species when we have failed here at home? \\"Extinction is forever. This news highlights that our work to save Eurasian Curlew and Black-tailed Godwit, as well as many other migratory shorebirds that are of conservation concern, is of utmost urgency to prevent more species following the Slender-billed Curlew into extinction.\\" \\n!ping EUROPE&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Europe is pseudo-socialist which on its face seems to be more efficient for social issues we struggle with here but then we find out that europes socialism is bankrolled and defended by the US in order to maintain the largest war profiteering cartel in the history of humankind and suddenly we think, why cant I have a cigarette and espresso for breakfast?","title":"Americans whove traveled to Western Europe: Have you noticed that Europe seems to operate better than the US?

It \\"stopped being a relevant polity\\" because Odoacer deposed the child emperor at the time and announced his own kingdom and the city of \\"Rome\\" had 20 years of relative peace before Odoacer was himself deposed by the Ostrogothics when they executed him at Ravenna (but this was standard politics at the time). Also both Odoacer and the Ostrogothics had nominal support from Zeno who was the *Eastern* Roman Emperor, so in a very real sense \\"Rome\\" was still kind of involved.edit: the Ostrogothics did go on to replace most of \\"Rome\\" the city's political institutions during their solidification of the first independent kingdom of Italy, and Justinian I did re-invade around 562 (over a century later!) in an attempt to reunify the eastern and western \\"empires\\", but it wasn't until AD 603 (150 years after the vandals!) that the Roman Senate as an institution with governance over \\"Rome\\" the city actually finally dissolved.---\\n Odoacer retained the Roman administrative system, cooperated actively with the Roman Senate, and his rule was efficient and successful.","title":"Young Democrats move to oust 'ossifying' party elders"},{"text":"Shes technically the last of the Baby Boomers.

Presidents like Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Kennedy, Reagan, and Obama were consistent in their hopeful messages, and their ground games were masterful, and they offered up visions of what could be, making it easy for folks to latch onto them. All of those men were/are imperfect and did things we should rightfully look at with a critical eye, but they knew how to move the needle. On the dark flip side of that, Americans also love their grievances. Characters like Huey Long, David Duke, Joseph McCarthy, and of course Donald Trump are master manipulators on playing on your sense of grievance. We want to naturally gravitate toward blaming someone for our issues and these people offer easy scapegoats in a charismatic and compelling way, and they often leave behind lasting damage when they're finally silenced, as the only way to deprogram people from their grievances is to counter offer them an even stronger, hopeful message, that resonates in their personal world. I think the Dems were onto something when the weird thing was taking off thanks to Walz. Republicans are a weird bunch. They obsess over people's genitalia on a daily basis, they look past obvious indiscretions with their leaders, and have a strange sense of humor coated in a casual cruelty. I think if that had remained at the core of Harris's campaign, making people laugh and see Trump and his ilk as small and petty people undeserving of leadership, she might have stood a better chance, but the campaign wasn't consistent. They took the bait too often with Trump's shenanigans, letting the focus shift back to him in a way that helped him. Most Americans can identify with working at McDonalds and despite it being an obvious stunt, they liked the visual of Trump working at one and driving around in a garbage truck. It's ghoulish and cynical watching him cosplay as a regular person, but people like their vibes and visuals and he played on the \\"elitist\\" grievance. The visual Harris was putting out in the last 1/3 of her campaign was sitting side by side with Liz Cheney. With the war going on in Gaza and Lebanon and the Cheney's being infamous war hawks thanks to Iraq, this was a miscalculation, compounded by the fact that she was increasingly dropping the fun and weird angle for darker rhetoric as we got closer to Election Day. This likely confused her early fans wishing for the more optimistic Harris. She needed a David Axelrod, really, keeping things consistent. Anyway, that's my take.","title":"Dems need to grow some balls and stop letting Republicans dictate the debate and the situation"},{"text":"I believe in you. Be better.
