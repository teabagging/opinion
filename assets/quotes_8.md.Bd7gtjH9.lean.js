I think you're looking at this divide with California's fires from the standpoint of media and not from the standpoint of appropriate action.

I may have my own personal opinions of the State of California but those personal opinions are going to have to be put aside until after it's over okay I am in North Carolina and I lived through Helene and I have opinions about my state not being prepared for such a thing when they knew about it. I also have opinions about the help we received which was not enough it really wasn't my entire hometown is gone and there's no way it's coming back and my government's not going to cut a check like they would California to fix it. but that doesn't mean I'm going to be injecting political divide into the event itself while it's going on. After Helene was over you better believe I talk shit about the federal government for saying we only needed $750 to get back on her feet and it was alone it wasn't even just a a stimulus type of thing like they could print money for whatever they want but they couldn't print money to fix my state and my town?

It's the word \\"always\\" I quibble with. The Democratic Party of the 1930's -- and from time to time for decades thereafter -- did much more than adopt the bare minimum of lefty-sounding talking points. Check out [this long list](https://livingnewdeal.org/history-of-the-new-deal/programs/) of mostly progressive New Deal Democratic reforms. And even before the Democrats' New Deal of the 1930's, the Progressive Movement of the early 1900's and into the 1920's passed substantive progressive reforms that still affect lives positively today. Some issues they addressed include direct primaries; campaign finance; civil service; anti-lobbying laws; state income and inheritance taxes; child labor restrictions; food quality; workers' compensation laws; the recall, referendum, and direct election of senators; government regulation of railroads, public utilities, factories, and banks; and female suffrage. \\"... [T]he Progressives were middle-class reformers who believed in the preservation of private property but opposed the laissez-faire policies of the past. They hoped to reduce government corruption and increase efficiency by appointing a new generation of college-educated experts to key government positions. In doing so, the Progressives were optimistic that government regulation could protect all members of society within the existing Capitalist system... Progressives rejected Socialism but also rejected the notion that the private sector could regulate itself or that existing charitable organizations were sufficient to provide for the needy.\\"Although the Progressive Movement definitely had its share of adherents in and from both major parties, Democrats and former Democrats were well-represented. In Minnesota, for example, the Democratic Party merged in 1944 with the Farmer-Labor Party, and to this day the Democratic Party in Minnesota is called the DFL (Democratic - Farmer - Labor). \\"The Minnesota FarmerCLabor Party (FLP) was a left-wing American political party in Minnesota between 1918 and 1944. The FLP largely dominated Minnesota politics during the Great Depression. It was one of the most successful statewide third party movements in United States history.\\" And before the Progressive Movement, the mostly agrarian [Populists of the 1890's](https://digital.lib.niu.edu/illinois/gildedage/populism) were able to get significant progressive reforms adopted at the state level with Democratic support, and in the cathartic election of 1896 the national Democratic Party apparatus allowed the Georgia Populist Tom Watson to run as its nominee for vice president on the national Democratic ticket with presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, even though Watson had left the Georgia Democratic Party in 1891 to join the Populist Party.  The Populists' base was in the West and South, where the Democrats were most prominent so few decades after the Civil War and Reconstruction.\\"Much of the Populist program was incorporated into the reform wings of both the Democratic and Republican Parties. The ensuing wave of Progressive legislation had a decidedly Populist stamp. The federal income tax and the Federal Reserve Bank, the National Weather Service, Rural Free Delivery, and the extension of agricultural education and research services, the new federal agencies to regulate and subsidize farm credit and marketing, and the direct election of senators and adoption of the referendum and the initiative by several states C all had Populist roots.\\"So it hasn't always been rhetoric and lefty-sounding talking points.","title":"Biden issues final warning to America, says an Oligarchy is forming - After half a century of prostituting himself to the oligarchy."},{"text":"Ha.

And because of the fact that he was funded by corporate donors, he did nothing to build toward campaign reform.That isn't how an oligarchy works. Putting people in positions based on these donations would be a sign of oligarchy. The President doesn't have the power to create laws... that would be the House and the Senate.He did nothing to curb the power of big tech. He could have decided to impose regulations on them, limiting their ability to absolutely dominate the market while paying next to nothing in taxes.Again, still not the responsibility of the president. Curbing power is the SEC. Taxing is the House and Senate. Despite him doing slightly more than Trump did for the working class, his economic policies still very much favoured the wealthy. The wealth gap continued to grow at the same rate it always has.His policies did no such thing. He was responsible for avoiding crushing inflation and stopping a clear crash. He brought in jobs, lowered the price of insulin, etc... the wealth gap is the result of corporations increasing in valuations. That isn't the result of the Presidents actions, but of public sentiment.Contributed to the growth of the military-industrial complex by providing very high amounts for defense spending.You wanted Russia to finish off Ukraine? Budgets are also not the responsibility of the President.Appointed many individuals with ties to large corporations into positions of power in his governmentThat would be the first example of an oligarchy. So there is that.Even though he proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, which is better than the current rate of 21%, the proposed 28% is still considerably lower than the tax rate of 35% that was present in 2017. And even 35% isnt high enough for large multinational corporations because they continue to find ways to evade paying taxes altogether lol.He doesn't propose tax laws. Republicans had control over the Senate and House the whole time. Dont get me wrong, he is the most progressive president in recent history. But that isnt saying much, because all the former presidents were absolutely garbage. Biden was still garbage, but slightly less garbage.That is factually wrong on so many levels. Biden was a great president and you are about to see by how many levels with Trump about to destroy everything.Thats my opinion anyway, we can agree to disagree.I agree, but I suggest you look into what the President actually is responsible for and what the House and Senate are responsible for.","title":"Joe Biden warns of \\"oligarchy\\" taking over US in farewell speech"},{"text":"repeating history","title":"Biden warns of dangerous threat of new age of robber barons in farewell presidential address"},{"text":"Spend 8 years as VP to a fake populistTIL we even hate Obama now.","title":"In farewell address, Biden warns 'oligarchy is taking shape in America'"},{"text":"That's the only reason I listened","title":"Joe Biden has lost his mind [Thread]"},{"text":"why didn't other world leaders like uk, france, germany assist in the cease fire with isreal?","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Farewell Address to the Nation"},{"text":"Not quite, the apathetic people that refused to vote in this election handed over the keys.","title":"President Joe Biden gives his final farewell address from the Resolute Desk of the Oval Office"},{"text":"I mean sure the people at schools are basically just useful idiots, however there is stuff all over YouTube about the policy of school boards in various states being captured by activists, leading to the adoption of basically secret policies encouraging transition and hiding it from parents, -actively subverting- efforts by parents to raise their children in accordance with their own values.

Unfortunately the red pill has turned in to a smorgasbord of 'toxic masculinity' (never thought I would genuinely use that word before). It used to be a movement about understanding female response queues to gain success in dating and have a successful relationship, then it turned in to a way to get laid, rack up numbers, and eventually became the opposite of what it believed in, hence it attracted a lot of toxic guys. It was meant for a tool for honest success for guys who didn't have any. Now it's full of women hating and bashing, the 'red pill rage' that many never overcame. I say throw Andrew is jail along with Tristan. They scammed their supporters multiple times with crypto rug pulls after saying they never would because it's a dishonest money making scheme.

Its not that they dont fully get it. Oh sure, theyll say nice things about Bernie  but only after the fact, and only after now that they have lost. Establishment Democrats would never say anything like this or have such an about turn like this during a primary or while they are in power. When it really counted, and it comes down to who the Democrat voters want as their candidate, the media, the corporations and the establishment Democrats all colluded to box him out. The only reason why they havent gotten rid of Bernie altogether from the party is because hes only one man, surrounded by a bunch of empty suits, collecting super pac money, serving special interests, while changing the laws and getting inside info to benefit their stock portfolios. They might pass a few frilly things on the side, then Trump (pun intended) them up like big changes. All that is is optics, so they can make it look like theyre fighting for us. Why do you think we have so many multi millionaire representatives in Congress?  No other country in the world has this level of legalized open bribery and open collusion with special interest in their government. All in plain sight. Its a pretty corrupt system for the so-called leader of democracy around the world.Heres just one little fun fact that speaks to all of it:  It was 6 Democrats who blocked the bill put forward by Bernie Sanders to import cheaper drugs from Canada. The exact same FDA approved drugs that they distribute in the USA. The Democrats who oppose the bill, were receiving money from big Pharma companies. Ted fucking Cruz even supported Bernies bill. Not because hes a good guy, though, but because he gets a lot of money from insurance companies who can make more profit by covering less costs for cheaper drugs. It was also a few of these so-called blue Dog Democrats that prevented Obamas public option from ever being implemented, despite it being a huge component of what Obama was pitching when he was campaigning. Obama wasnt all that terrible but he certainly wasnt going to make any big changes in healthcare. All he did was make it in to law that everyone must purchase health insurance or face penalties. Therefore, guaranteeing the health insurance industry billions of dollars for years to come, by law.Poll after poll showed that Bernie Sanders was the only candidate that could actually beat Trump in a federal election. But instead, they gave us uncle Joe.  There are a lot of issues that even the most insane right wing Republicans and super far left Democrat voters agree on. Things that affect every day lives. Legalizing marijuana, affordable healthcare, affordable, education, etcthese are all things that would make people of any political spectrum happy, and far less susceptible to being sucked in by the news media who want nothing more than for the peasants to be at each others throats. The working class has gotten so desperate that states that voted for Obama twice, have now overwhelmingly voted for the biggest con artist and criminal in history to ever be president of the United States. But ya, supporting Bernie Sanders just meant you were a Bernie bro, misogynist pig, or some na?ve kid  who had unrealistic dreams. Despite every other western Democratic nation, providing all of these things to their citizens. Not perfectly but better than what we have today. You wont find many conservative voters in those countries, begging the government to privatize their healthcare.","title":"Why the legacy media suddenly sound like Bernie Sanders"},{"text":"Listen I voted for guy.

I'll give credit where credit is due, to my knowledge Trump *did* have an envoy who aided in negations and likely contributed, but that's about it.  \\nOtherwise, the conservative narrative that Trump scared Hamas into an agreement is just laughable. Immediately - to my knowledge - it was Israel who needed final convincing, not Hamas. Regardless, I just don't believe Trump would *really* have been that much harsher on Hamas. He used much sharper and more repugnant language than Harris that gave many voters the impression he would have been, but thinking about it what would he actually threaten to do that could cause Hamas to cave. Given the already staggering amount of death and destruction in the Gaza strip I find it hard to believe Trump could have just bombed a ceasefire out of Israel the way conservatives think they could have. The Biden administration already unleashed so much terror on Hamas, I don't know what Trump could've done.  \\nAs a result I think this is just the Iranian hostage crisis again. Carter *actually* got the job done but because Reagan was the incoming president and people felt like he was tougher on the Iranians they irrationally deemed Reagan responsible.

What we should be doing is reaching out to the rural voter, creating party centers in small communities again so their voice can be heard. We have the policies they want, we have exactly what they need to be successful, but the framing and message we bring over the economic policies lead rural voters away from the party. Thats the main problem here. Democrats are no longer reaching out to those voters. Accusing them of voting for the felon, bigot, and swindler is exactly how we got here, even if its an entirely correct statement.We also need to stop acting so morally superior in general.

The paper described a change in the rules of the game that has broken the deadlock in the hostage negotiations.Paul, who left the State Departments Bureau of Political Military Affairs in the first month of the war, told The Independent it was clear that Trumps team played a role in brokering the agreement.How much of that was commission as opposed to Netanyahus desire to give Trump a win - a desire that has probably been a consideration for him since very early in this conflict - remains to be known, he said.The outgoing Biden administration took the unusual step of letting Trumps team take a lead role in negotiations, Haaretz reported.**The Washington Post also cited a diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations crediting the influence of Trumps team, saying it was the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.**AlsoA tense weekend meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and incoming Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff led to a breakthrough in the hostage negotiations, with the top aide to US President-elect Donald Trump doing more to sway the premier in a single sit-down than outgoing President Joe Biden did all year, two Arab officials told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.Witkoff has been in Doha for the past week to take part in the hostage negotiations, as mediators try to secure a deal before Trumps January 20 inauguration.

The paper described a change in the rules of the game that has broken the deadlock in the hostage negotiations.Paul, who left the State Departments Bureau of Political Military Affairs in the first month of the war, told The Independent it was clear that Trumps team played a role in brokering the agreement.How much of that was commission as opposed to Netanyahus desire to give Trump a win - a desire that has probably been a consideration for him since very early in this conflict - remains to be known, he said.The outgoing Biden administration took the unusual step of letting Trumps team take a lead role in negotiations, Haaretz reported.The Washington Post also cited a diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations crediting the influence of Trumps team, saying it was the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.AlsoA tense weekend meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and incoming Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff led to a breakthrough in the hostage negotiations, with the top aide to US President-elect Donald Trump doing more to sway the premier in a single sit-down than outgoing President Joe Biden did all year, two Arab officials told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.Witkoff has been in Doha for the past week to take part in the hostage negotiations, as mediators try to secure a deal before Trumps January 20 inauguration.

Biden was not eradicating covid on his own especially with how lax trump was with the lock downs in 2020. Eradicating COVID-19 was not a realistic goal for any government, including the Biden administration. The focus had been on controlling the virus, reducing its impact through vaccination and treatment, and transitioning to living with it as an endemic disease. While policy decisions influence outcomes, the fundamental characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 made eradication unachievable.We didnt land softly lol, homeless went up, disability went up, conditions got worse for people but yeah?**businesses**?did better.homelessness went up because of high interest rates. We needed high interest rates to decrease the inflation rate. Which brought the inflation rate down from 9% to 3%. Our currency recovered the quickest out of any nation. Biden has no control over that though that was more of the federal reserves job. I am sure there were other things he could have done to address that which I will say he failed to address the homeless issue. Something Biden did have control over was jobs as he added millions of jobs through the inflation reduction act, infrastructure act, and the chips and science act. The economy is at full employment(unemployment at 4%) and Jobs havn't been this plentiful since the 1950's.Blaming RFK for the deaths is truly just the most nonsensical bullshit on Earth. RFK wasnt in office, Joe Biden was and he set the policy and tone and he chose to deny covid like RFK denies the safety of vaccines, except Joe Biden is the president and his shit actually affects millions.Wow... this just ignores the antimasker movement and anti social distancing movement started by Trump in 2020 Also ignores Rfk and the antivax movement that slowed Covid Vaccine adoption. Biden can't force people to wear masks. There wasn't much he could do other than what he did social distancing measures, mask in public measures, vaccine mandates. That is about as much he could do and he did it.Reagan was worse than Trump &amp; basing whether or not they were fascist on the words of generals who were?**literally backing fascists in South America**?is just ridiculous.Fucking lol when did Reagan question the election results **before he was even elected**?when did Reagan have a rally outside of the US capital and have his supporters try to hang his vice president for doing what was constitutionally required of him?when did Reagan say the media was \\"the enemy of the people\\"-Trump??When did Reagan suggest shooting protesters in the legs with guns?Reagan was shit I agree with you hell I would even say that he was is the cause for the current fascist republican party but Trump is very different from Reagan. This is not your grandfathers republican party.The biden and the liberals were never going to stop fascism lol.

Though to be fair, it's not the role of the VP to be front and center, and the scuttlebutt was that they were unhappy with her for unspecified reasons, but at the end of the day that was just rumor and speculation. It did seem suspicious, though, that a candidate implied to be a one-termer was burying the logical next contender.Biden world refused to grasp that he was bad candidate and the party basically had to mutiny to dislodge him.Of course, as we can see from party leadership, any claims to handing off the reigns of power or building the next generation is just lip-service.

Technically, it's not a ban. TikTok US has until Jan 19 to find new owners who will sever its control from the Chinese parent company. ByteDance is controlled by Chinese nationals who are subject to several Chinese laws which make their cooperation with Chinese investigations mandatory, including against government officials and personel. For the record, the reason that TikTok is being forced to divest is because China has laws which can compel its nationals to fully cooperate with any investigation. This means that China could force ByteDance CEO (a Chinese citizen and resident of China) to compel his employees to exfiltrate data about Americans to the Chinese government, and this could include private information such as location, DMs, etc.The US government alleges that TikTok has done this in other countries. Despite being given the opportunity to deny such allegations, it did not.Further, the US government alleges that TikTok, at the behest of China, has manipulated feeds to sway public opinion in other countries. TikTok, despite having the opportunity to deny such allegations, does not do so.The fact that TikTok will let its US operations get banned and become worthless, rather than sell them for several billion dollars cash money, is really proof that TikTok's primary purpose is not to make money for its owners, contrary to how other social media companies operate.You should ask yourself very seriously: what could drive a company to allow its multibillion dollar asset to become worthless rather than selling it for as much as you can get?The ruling is not about whether social media is good or bad, or whether manipulating people is good or bad -- the point is that foreign adversarial countries should not be able to control the media discourse within the United States. The Appellate ruling even notes that, under new ownership, people would still be free to consume Chinese propaganda, if they so chose to do so. But China could not cause such propaganda to be fed to them, and that is the key difference.There's a great write-up on LawFare Blog about it: [https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-d.c.-circuit-court's-tiktok-ban-decision--explained](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-d.c.-circuit-court's-tiktok-ban-decision--explained)And, to be clear, Facebook is absolutely scum, and even though they (and Musk) would be the primary beneficiaries if TikTok were to be banned, it doesn't change whether TikTok having the attention of so many Americans, while being controlled by the Chinese Communist party, is a security risk to the United States.There's also this court ruling, which is the ruling right before SCOTUS.

Theres 43 million refugees in the world.  UNRWA and UNHCR have different definitions of a refugee. UNCR considers those who fled a country due to violence, war, and more refugees. But UnRWA considers Palestinians who have fled and the descendants of males who fled . That second part is part of the issue. Not only does it make refugee status generational despite the situation or citizenship of the person but it also is sexist as its only for descendants of men. So if a woman fled Palestine in 1948but didnt marry a Palestinian man  her grandchildren wouldnt be refugees but if it was a man it would. According to the UNRWA website there  are 5.9 million Palestinian refugees. That number does include Palestinian descendants who are citizens of countries.  2,000,000 Palestinians who live in Jordan, where by 2009 over 90% of UNWRA-registered Palestinian refugees had acquired full citizenship rights are counted in that number. Which to me if theyre citizens of a country would make them not refugees I think.And the current largest number of refugees is Syrian with 6.25 million over the past 10 years and 5 million internally displaced.  By 2023 UNHCRs budget was  10.9 billion and UNRWAs was 2.2 billion with the United States being the largest funder of both.UNRWA has over 30,000 employees, most of whom are Palestinian refugees. The UNHCR has 18,879 staff. So UNRWA deals with 1/10th the number of refugees in which includes people who are citizens of countries which makes the number more difficult, has about 1/5th of the funding of UNHCR , and almost double the number of workers. UNRWA handles less refugees by far,UNRWA gets almost twice the amount of money per refugee than UNHCR, and they hire almost twice the amount of staff despite handling far less people. Replacing UNRWA with UNHCR just makes logical sense based on the failures and corruption of UNRWA.All those are major issues and failings of UNRWA just based on funding and thats not even going into the issues Israel has with it.","title":"CMV: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka.

Rule By Law is born of entirely different intent. Laws become cudgels to enforce ideology and adherence.

She's a terrible candidate, running an incompetent campaign as an incumbent party during a bad economy and high inflation. Biden dropping out late, shortening the campaign time, hurted her too.

High inflation and poor economic numbers caused most Americans to struggle. Everything costs more, and people want a change. A huge disadvantage to Democrats.Next, her as a candidate. Unpopuar, low poll numbers, no accomplishments, word salad answers, and lack of charisma. There was a reason why she did so badly in 2020.Finally, her campaign seemed to be run by utter buffoons. I know she had only 100 days to run a campaign, a difficult task for anyone. But she failed to capitalize on the abortion issue, which is a big deal to her base. She failed to address the main issues people care about most. They spent millions on worthless celebrity endorsements.

Everybody knew something bad is going to happen due to the instability Israel was in before October 7th, just that they didn't know what's going to happen specifically.

Why does 20% of Israel consist of Arabs living in peace with equal rights?You mention people being displaced, but this isnt happening in Israel, its happening for various reasons in Palestine.Zionism is the idea that the Jewish people should have a safe place to live. Israel is surrounded by nations that would gladly see Israelis suffer and die. Its also a liberal bastion in the region. If youre gay, for example, you have to go about 1500 miles to find another nation that wont execute you.Its important to be accurate and specific with criticisms. You can believe Jews should have a safe country but also believe that everything about the current conflict is evil.Possibly, youre referring to the issue of what to do with Palestine in terms of a one or two state solution. This is tough, but why would Israel take in Palestinians as citizens? Theyd outnumber the Jews, and they genuinely want to kill Israelis, and the average Palestinian believes October 7 was justified. (Which in case youre wondering, the slaughter of innocents at a music festival as well as desecrating and parading the bodies around is a clearer war crime than anything Israel has done). The US wouldnt take in all of Mexico, or any other county for that matter.Palestine needs to adjust its expectations based on how the war progresses. They were offered a deal in 1967, which they turned down before attacking Israel. That deal is off the table, because of course it is. If I try to sell you something, and you not only reject it but attack me, then the deal is off the table. They were the aggressors in this case as well, yet they expect the 1967 deal. Its never going to happen, and anyone backing Palestine needs to tell them that.","title":"cmv: Zionism is violence"},{"text":" Ill also entertain the theory that Netanyahu deliberately withheld the deal to hurt Biden. This theory has too many holes. Accepting this deal puts Netanyahu government on crash course for a collapse. He has no incentive to end the war.Netenyahu was facing increasing political pressure to accept the ceasefire. Why would accepting it put his government on a crash course for a collapse?Let's not forget that Biden's administration was also applying heavy pressure against Netenyahu's government with regards to what they were doing in the West Bank. That pressure will be gone under Trump. Delaying the ceasefire to help Trump benefits Netenyahu. Accepting a ceasefire deal now to shift attention away from the OPT and what Israel is doing in the West Bank, especially since there will be a much looser leash (lest you've forgotten, Trump has been the only US administration to call the settlements legal) also benefits Netenyahu.","title":"Chris Hayes: Biden is leaving a disgraceful legacy on Gaza"},{"text":"Trump has tried to meddle in foreign affairs, but he's broken the law in doing so.","title":"Biden: Is that a joke?"},{"text":"Already did.https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5087195-trump-lauds-israel-hamas-ceasefire/","title":"Statement from President Joe Biden"},{"text":" California has over 1.2 million vacant housesAnd 39 million people. Most of those vacant homes are either in turnover, are vacation homes, or are in areas with population decline. Total number of vacant homes is irrelevant to discussions of housing affordability. What matters is vacancy rates in the areas where people want to live. A \\"healthy\\" vacancy rate is considered to be between 5-10% depending on population growth or decline. California's home vacancy rate is 0.7%, and its rental vacancy rate is 4.4%.In any case, this still misses the crux of the problem, which is that the only reason to hold onto a vacant home in the first place is because the price is going up so rapidly that the cost of maintenance and renting it out is outshone substantially by the appreciating gains. When the market is allowed to function properly and the supply isn't artificially constrained, this price escalation results in more housing being built to satisfy the rising demand, which in turn puts downward pressure on prices, stabilizing them in coincidence with demand, but when you prevent supply production, you create these opportunities for [economic rents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent).Nonetheless, there's a simple solution to incentivize vacant homes to be sold or rented out, and that's a vacancy tax. In any case, again, this problem is not a CEO pay issue, or a wage/salary issue. Housing prices have significantly outpaced inflation of other goods and services for decades now.  Would building 1 million more solve the problem?It would help, yeah. the issue is that housing, a necessity, is treated as a commodity.Commodities, when their supply is not restricted, and relatively free trade is allowed, become abundant and cheap. Cotton is a commodity. Wheat is a commodity. TVs are commodities. These things are abundant and affordable because we don't impose market distortions on their supply like we do with housing.No offense, but you are speaking from a place of economic ignorance on this issue. It is the overwhelming consensus amongst economists that the housing affordability crisis is caused by restrictions on housing development.","title":"CMV: We will look back in 50 years and think the CEO to pay ratio was really low in 2025, compared to 2075 in the US."},{"text":"I considered it a take on George Orwells 1984","title":"Biden on if Trump will get credit over him for ceasefire deal: Is that a joke?"},{"text":"It is actually very funny that the Democrats still haven't figure out why they lost the election.","title":"CNN Poll: Biden leaves office with his approval rating matching the lowest of his term"},{"text":"Yet again, time and time again, democrats are leaving their toxic party.

There's just a large majority who continue to vote democratic because that's what they've always done. They lost the popular vote in this election when there are so many anti-Trump people. I feel like there's no doubt in my mind we're going at least the next twelve years with a Republican president as they try to fix their party. It's just been exposed at this point.Why did she lose? 4 years ago, Joe Biden ran for office. The joke was that he was going to become president, and they were going to kill him and force her into office. 4 years ago people knew that she could never become president on her own. Why did they suddenly believe that wasn't going to be the case, and she could win an election? They've also pushed men away from the Democratic Party. The only male Democrats now are cucks that are brainwashed into doing what their wives want to. What would be the benefit to being a male Democrat? At least before, they used to try to make it about race. Oh, we treat black and latino males so good over here on this side. Now they don't even try to sell that. It's just fuck males all around. Well, take out half the population and combine them with the non-brainwashed women, you have no chance to win.","title":"What are the main reasons Kamala lost?"},{"text":"Take it outside only means go for a lovely coffee, or beer, maybe a candlelit dinner.","title":"Jasmine Crocketts office condemns Nancy Mace threatening physical violence during House hearing"},{"text":"No, the main reason Trump won is ignorance.","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Final Foreign Policy Address"},{"text":"Not  as big a joke of the upcoming administration","title":"Biden: Is that a joke?"},{"text":"so it's her fault we have trump v. 2","title":"Nonprofit Founded by Stacey Abrams Admits Secretly Aiding Her 2018 Campaign - The New York Times"},{"text":"I wonder if \\"YMCA\\" will be played, and all of Trump's brain dead cult followers will dance around like zombies","title":"Good for Michelle Obama on refusing to attend the Trump inaugural.
