I saw with my own eyes how the US military pumped up gallons of oil on the fields, day after day. I saw how they destroyed my elementary school searching for those weapons.

The real question is WHY the US invade Iraq, because the reason sure wasnt to free people from the worst dictator in 21 century.So, US did not mismanaged Iraq, your phrasing sounds like they went in to make peace and help people.

These are separate things.Godel is essentially arguing that the mechanistic application of math does not yield fact without acknowledging that the math mechanisms themselves are fact, and only the interpretation of the math is theory. This should encourage theory of math, not discourage it. Frankly, guys like Godel were rationalists who _hated_ intuition. They wanted to eliminate the human spirit from all conversation. This is part of a long, drawn-out conflict between esotericists and orthodoxy that spans literal millennia.On the other hand, I find that logical bias is an enormously important subject, particularly for rationalists who are prone to have them without realizing them. Everyone at least understands that intuition-led people have biases, but they generally form the lower class of whichever ideological group they are in (from crystal-chakra hippy left to the christ-is-king conservative right). Rationalists are a smaller percentage of the population, and they rise above the intuitionists, but they generally fail to see their place on this broader pyramid of consciousness. They think they are at the top when they are not. So quite simply, it's hubris, which I think is much more important to discuss than mere \\"hypocrisy\\", as you mentioned.What guys like Godel, Russell, and even ancients like Aristotle are really doing is creating a synthetic sort of science, where they can produce whatever truth they want and make it appear like fact. Why are they doing this? Well, for one, they are rationalists (not to be confused with scientists), and that is just how the rationalist mind works. For two, there is a great amount of crowd manipulation that you can do with this sort of argumentation. It's a logical basis for propaganda.","title":"How many people understand the fact/valid distinction, and how important is this to understanding the nature of society?"},{"text":"For all the dooming about Nevada, the VBM update was very, very good for a first batch.With that first batch, Dems have returned 7.2% of VBM.

Here in Australia who you vote, or plan to vote for is seen as a very private thing. Its not really something you discuss openly. I mean you can if you want. But youre not expected to. Celebrities dont tend to announce who they intend to vote for publicly. And to ask them would be a huge invasion of their privacy. Its crazy how different it is. And similarly, position like a Supreme Court judge, speaker of the house, governor general etc are supposed to be impartial and unbiased. The fact that Americans know the political leaning of each Supreme Court judge, and those judges consistently vote in line with their personal political preferences is so fucked up.

I think the way you write is confusing, so I've thought about it. I think that you've learnt something in the other replies too. You tend to use complex words that don't always fit, so I've guessing what you mean.You have a criteria of what makes a good representation, and how it can be positive and negative in storytelling. You say that accurate representation isn't needed as it is right now, because it is difficult, but we are actually mostly in agreement about storytelling. So, what was your point exactly?I get that you are saying people define other people wrongly. There is always an objective standard, and that objectivity is reached through research into people and culture. The goal is to use that information to effect the opinion of the audience that is watching, the method depends on what your market is, and your intentions.This question is also about how information works, and the use of knowledge. What definitions are used for and how they work. This is about philosophy. Are you asking how knowledge works and the way it is used? There is ambiguity to everything in life. Are you sure you are asking the right question?I think your point is: \\"people think diversity in entertainment is the end to the means, when it is really a means to an end\\". I feel that there are many addition questions like:  \\nHow common is this sentiment? Are you criticizing something specifically? Who thinks this way? Does this happen too much? What is the purpose of storytelling? How does the understanding and information of people's traits spread through our culture? What happens when this is done maliciously, or ignorantly? How does a media creator use this information? How do people react to this? Should people do this more or less?I personally think you need to make an argument that is more clearly defined, so that people can make an argument against it. Most of these responses are about how representation works.

The territorys largest power plant, a coal-fired station responsible for toxic ash and smoke that have long polluted the water and air, is located a roughly 15-minute drive east. Agrochemical facilities line Route 3, the two-lane thoroughfare that hems this part of the coast. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency found that Salinas, the municipality that includes El Coqu, had the highest levels of certain cancer-causing contaminants of any U.S. jurisdiction. Salinas has faced prolonged power outages and water shutoffs for years, including during this summers historic heat wave. From a hilltop north of the town, construction crews continued working on the Ciro One solar park in July. Built by the Arizona-based developer DEPcom Power, the facility is owned by Putnam Bridge Funding, a Connecticut-headquartered real estate firm controlled by the former hedge fund investors benefiting from Puerto Ricos controversial tax haven laws.Further off on the southwestern horizon, an even bigger project was sealing a major deal. That same week in mid-July, the Biden administration announced a loan worth nearly $1 billion to help Clean Flexible Energy, co-owned by the utility giant AES Corporation that operates the nearby coal plant, complete an array of solar panels and batteries more than double the size of Ciro One, called Project Marahu.Opponents who complain that large-scale solar plants take up too much land and damage the environment say equipping every rooftop in Puerto Rico with solar panels and batteries offers a better alternative. The community center in El Coqu has solar panels that kept the air conditioning cranked high on a hot July afternoon, and provided a place for residents to charge phones and cool down when the power went out for days during recent disasters, whether it was this summers heat wave or Hurricane Fiona. But a U.S. Department of Energy study published earlier this year examined how Puerto Rico could fulfill its legally enshrined mandate to generate all its electricity from renewables by 2050. The results were staggering. With limited land and a budget squeezed by billions of dollars in debt that Puerto Ricos state-owned power agency is still paying off to Wall Street creditors, federal researchers judged high-cost megaprojects like towering offshore wind turbines to be out of reach. Instead, the territory would need to cover virtually every available rooftop with panels  and still build giant utility-scale solar farms across thousands of acres. Even then, the island would need to back up its mostly solar-powered system by burning at least a little biodiesel or wood.Nestled between Puerto Ricos dramatic central mountain range and the azure waters of the Bay of Jobos, the plains here served for centuries as a hub for sugarcane plantations, irrigated with mineral-rich freshwater that flows downhill southward toward the sea. The same flat fields where rows of grassy stalks once converted the suns rays into sweetness are now lined with glinting gray panels harvesting light for electricity. The solar boom isnt slowing.","title":"Biden Harris Administration Announces More Than $860 Million Loan Guarantee to Support Construction of Utility-scale Solar and Battery Storage in Puerto Rico"},{"text":"MAGA is now officially the party of appeasement to dictators and war-mongers.","title":"Biden-Harris Policies Ignited Global Chaos: WW3 Fears Rise as 2024 Election Nears"},{"text":"And?","title":"Donald Trump Cant Shake Off Taylor Swifts Kamala Harris Endorsement"},{"text":"CRUCIAL WAUKESHA MENTIONED!!!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 20, 2024 - 16 days until election day!"},{"text":"I've seen tile roofing on strip malls in Kentucky, man...","title":"Unironically, the future Neoliberals want"},{"text":"Thats like saying youll never lose weight of you dont stick to Chris Christies nutrition plan","title":"\\"Kamala Harriss outreach to young black men is if you dont vote for her you wont get laid\\""},{"text":"The only change they have made is a move towards fascism.

Iranian politics was (is) a shit show, with many factions vying for power, rising and falling in popularity, etc., so the coup seems more like it was a catalyst or accelerator for what happened afterwards, but I'm not sure it would've been much better if it hadn't happened. It wasn't really a democracy beforehand either, and it's not like the population was secular and against an islamist government.This is just based on my understanding of what happened, might be wrong, but \\"US did it\\" kinda seems too simplistic for how complicated the topic is.

Just to be clear, the Iranians were only asking for 25% ownership, but were still refused. Compare this to the US Saudi deal that was a 50/50 split. A new agreement between the Uk oil company and Iran was signed where the oil company agreed to provide better pay and conditions to Iranian workers. They didnt. So then in the 1950s Iranian prime minister wanted to nationalise the oil industry. He also stipulated that the UK would be compensated for the seized assets. The US and UK then started secret operations to undermine the Iranian government, led by the CIA and MI6. Im pro west all the way, but British greed in this case seems to have caused many problems in the Middle East. Of course there are 2 sides to every story.

And no, threatening to shoot peaceful demonstrators, then descending upon them with riot police all for the sake of a photo op in front of a church doesn't count.Trump thinks he's God's gift to this world and his supporters often compare him to a God-like savior, sometimes literally worshipping and praying to him or his likeness in the form of [golden statue](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/trump-gold-statue-cpac-2021/index.html). I mean, c'mon, this is the epitome of blasphemy...And this is all in spite of the fact that Donald Trump is an example, for Christians everywhere, of what not to be.A serial grifter, liar, adulterer and cheater, a hate-fueled narcissist who antagonizes and belittles others, an entitled, self serving conman, a financial fraud, an imposter and hoaxer. A self victimizing political agitator who appeals to the worst impulses, fears, phobias, hatred and paranoid delusions of his followers. A conman who desecrates bibles and sells them for an excessive amount of money. A braggart, a criminal and a sexual deviant who incites violence and division wherever he goes. A chauvinist who caters to the interests of the rich at the expense of the poor, who is always looking for ways to enrich himself, who steals from charities and small businesses. A bigot who preaches intolerance and xenophobia, even though the Bible includes the message, treat foreigners and strangers as you would yourselves. And the list goes on and on...When Trump was asked about his favorite Bible verse, he couldn't even come up with a single one.When asked if he seeks God's forgiveness when he does something wrong, he said, \\"I don't bring God into that picture.\\"Even though Trump has the diehard support of the religious community, just 29% of U.S. adults say that Trump is very (4%) or somewhat (25%) religious, according to Pew Research Center.In 2020 Trump referred to himself as a \\"nondenominational Christian.\\"To call upon a passage from the Bible, Jesus turned the tables on the Donald Trump's of the world. Jesus spoke out against people like Donald Trump. But what does all this matter when the religious right worships the ground Trump walks on because, as he said to a crowd of Christian supporters, they \\"won't have to vote anymore\\" if he's elected.Despite Trump's obvious irreligious behavior, the Christian community sees him as their savior, someone who will protect them and their white, Christian hegemony, who will \\"Make America Great Again\\" by fighting for them in the battle between good versus evil, who will help institute a Christian Nationalist agenda, and by doing so, thwart the secular, radical left's efforts to undermine God and disempower the *true* Americans...","title":"Kamala Harris visits church on birthday as Trump repeats enemy within rhetoric"},{"text":"Its been very hot this summer.

This theory held that pro-Jackson congressmen, upset about the national governments attempts to impose a new tariff on imports, held secret meetings to discuss the dissolution of the Union. One pro-Jackson supporter declared that he should not be astonished to see Gen. Jackson, if not elected, placed in the Presidential Chair, at the point of fifty thousand bayonets!!!

WTF happened to progressives?When I was a kid way back in the 1900s, I was a liberal. I think I still am, despite favoring Trump. Hes just way better for America, the value of the dollar, the economy, and everyone with an American citizenship (but also people who are subject to Central American human-trafficking and Asian sweatshop labor).Kamala is weakening the dollar, the American economy, and serving a very small corporate group of constituents. Sadly, she will almost definitely win. Im sorry but power is money. I just cant see the 1% letting Trump win, unfortunately. But do vote. They cant stop a landslide.In any case, way back then, in the 1900s, hippie me had Republican friends. We would debate about things like gay rights, and then we would set it aside and ride our bikes and go to the library. In fact, we were the nerds. Both Republicans, Democrats, Green Party and independent. We all hung out. We were smarter for it. We would debate just to see where it went and then finally drop it and find things to get along over.You know why we didnt argue? Because we were the smartest kids in the school! We knew that this is a weird ass situation. We are on an orb in a void. We are all on death row! We are basically replicating leather bags that wandered out of the ocean full of spasming water-balloons tied to mineralized twigs (bones) that keep up upright.And of course once the internet and social media came, it became easier to become more hateful and selective. I get that. I fell for it. The first time I found a support group with my exact issue, I cried, I was so excited. Other people exist with this issue? But I didnt see what was coming: The toxicity and bullying and tribalism.At the end of the day, this election is not some existential event. Youre barely involved in selecting a single government job. Why are you getting worked up? You only have a few thousand days of this if youre lucky before you go back to something better (most likely).Anyway, Im just so disappointed in the young progressive left. Firstly, Im disappointed in them for not seeing through Kamalas bullshit. Secondly, Im disappointed in them for not seeing that Trump is one of our rare opportunities to save the beautiful experiment that is the United States of America.

It was before the companies got totally predatory and ballooned interest by steering students into the wrong repayment options in times of duress.

Mossaddegh was directly anointed by the shah in 1951, after which he nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company. This was pretty popular domestically with nationalists, but terrible economically (not relevant to our discussion though). Following this, he called elections to capitalise on his support. In this election, he stopped the count once enough seats had been called to form a government (79/136) to ensure he had a supermajority. This is effectively election rigging; not particularly democratic.Mosaddegh had the new parliament give him emergency powers immediately for 18 months, allowing him to rule as a dictator by decree. He lost pretty much all his support due to being seen as a dictator. Meanwhile, the Soviet-backed party Tudeh was fucking around and engaging in violence. After his loss of support he held a sham referendum to dissolve parliament which passed with pretty much 100% of the vote, and 3 days after the dissolution of parliament was declared on August 16 1953 the government was overthrown in a coup. Long story short, by the time the government was couped, mosaddegh was widely unpopular with literally every Iranian, had never truly been democratically elected and had ruled as a dictator by decree through abuse of emergency powers.This is why you cant rely on Wikipedia for your history. Its a great starting point, but it might have you believing horseshit like Iran was a flourishing democracy before the meanie Americans came along!!!.

So the actions of Nuri and the US/UK support for him culminated in the 1958 July 14th coup, which the US tried to sway in its favour but failed so they helped other officers to coup the new regime in 1963 and when those guys wanted to unite with Egypt, the US brought the Baathists to power in 1968 since they weren't very happy with Egypt so the whole plan faltered. Then, in 1979 the US supported Saddam Hussein to depose the same guy they brought in 1968 so Saddam being a hot-headed, racist, sectarian could fight the Iranian revolution.Even when the US turned against Saddam and tricked him into invading Kuwait in 1990, they ensured that they only target the Shia population of Iraq to weaken the 1991 uprising so Saddam's regime won't fall and they did the same thing again in 1996 which heavily impacted the opposition's uprising in 1999. And the US imposed sanctions only starved the population and let Saddam and his entire family live in luxury so Saddam could maintain his grip on power for year and even after the invasion in 2003, his daughters and wife were allowed to be free and to enjoy his billions to this day.And after the 2003 invasion, the US continued to exert control over Iraq in more destructive ways, first the US released all political prisoners regardless of background then they started turning Iraqi Sunni and Shia militias against themselves to minimize their attacks on the occupation forces causing the first civil war 2005-2007 and we all know that the US rigged the election to bring former-terrorist Nuri Al Maliki to power (Who bombed the Iraqi embassy in Beirut in the 1980s). And now American oil corporations like Halliburton, Exxon, Shell,and BP were given free contracts to operate in Iraq, without being held accountable for environmental or labor laws. This has poisoned Iraq's air and water, particularly in cities like Basra and Baghdad, which now smell of sulfur due to pollution. And American companies still refuse to process natural gas, opting instead to burn it because its cheaper and faster, further damaging the environment and causing cancer rates to increase.While Iran controls many militias and has significant influence in Iraq's parliament and political scene, the US has even deeper control over every aspect of the state, especially the treasury and the oil industry, crippling Iraq's plans to diversify the economy and accept Chinese investments which has proven to be a lot better and more efficient in reconstructing Iraq in the last 5 years than the US in 20 years. And Irans growing influence is just a direct side effect of the US policy in the Middle East since Project Ajax in 1953, the Iraq-Iran war and the 2003 invasion, which pushed Iraqs Shia population closer to Iran and turned them against the US, especially with the US not being shy in striking Iraqi cities in peacetime to assassinate Iranian militias leaders or generals.","title":"CMV: Iran and Russia Deserve More Moral Blame than the US for Iraq and Syria"},{"text":"No.","title":"As Harris turns 60, Democrats cast Trump as old and unhinged"},{"text":"They wanna get rid of your stoves!","title":"Yeah, but its different, Jake.

The people making these statements didn't have to work when they were younger, got jobs through connections when they were adults, and didn't ever have to actually sit down and compress their working history into a single-page document, with a chronological history of relevant employment starting with the most recent.

I wouldn't even know how to get verification of my employment in either of those places, and have never put either of them in a formal document like a resume. This is normal. Putting your stint at McDonald's on your resume while looking for employment after you've just come out of one of the country's more prestigious law schools would be downright bizarre.

This compares to 88% of the independents/other in the state being registered in those counties. Meaning the new/change in registrations yet again points to it being even more likely to be Dem leaning.Every single cycle people try to predict Nevada to flip, and every single cycle it stays Dem. By far the safest best is Harris will win Nevada by 1-3 points.

The implication is that the disorder causes lack of empathy and remorse, high impukdivity and excessive sensation-seeking among other antisocial traits, and lack of empathy or remorse increases the odds of gory violent behaviour. It's not so straghtforward, because actually violent acts in ASPD are a little rarer than they are made out to be in this case (in fact, the book possibly plays a little with this issue, especially because there are many other possible factors in play that could increase the odds of this character becoming a serial killer, such as desensitization to death and corpses, fixations on people, fixated interest in serial murder or abuse history. None of these are very straightforward in and on themselves either, but they could be significant when combined).Perhaps what's interesting about using that label here is precisely that it partially challenges the assumptions that the character can't *ever* understand morals nor relate to others without thinking \\"it's just for my own benefit\\". At the same time, you could drop the label and it could still make sense for the most part. It's different from, say, Eliseo's character in *The Boss*, which is likely a more clinically accurate and down-to-earth portrayal, at least according to what I know about ASPD.!delta The other thing is, I think the author might not have realised this character could have been diagnosed with Harm OCD as well, yet the word \\"compulsions\\" is mentioned few times. This might be a little more concerning, on second thought... I eventually did notice that the story likely says more about the author's moral system than about ASPD.","title":"CMV: \\"Accurate\\" representation in media isn't all it's cracked up to be"},{"text":"Yeah he drained the swamp, and now all the swamp people are just out in the open","title":"Yeah, but its different, Jake.

These institutions keep raising the bar for equity and excellence in higher education and our nations workforce, including by teaching, nurturing, and training the next generation of Latino leaders: scientists and scholars, innovators and educators, artists and entrepreneurs.  That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments in HSIs, providing over $16 billion in direct funding to HSIs, including through COVID relief funds and the Department of Educations federal grant program funds. This fact sheet provides a state-by-state breakdown of the funding.  \\n...  \\nMore than $13.2 billion in COVID relief funds allowed hundreds of HSIs across the country to keep students enrolled and on track to graduate during the COVID pandemic; these funds also helped make college more affordable by providing emergency grants for basic needs, discharging outstanding student debt or unpaid balances, and providing technology and internet access. Over $3.3 billion in Department of Education programmatic grant funds have supported a range of activities at HSIs including increasing the number of Latinos prepared for the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics workforce, improving the attainment of Latino students, and increasing the number of well-prepared teachers from diverse backgrounds in our nations underserved elementary and secondary schools. The Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to strengthening HSIs remains steadfast. In July, President Biden issued an Executive Order aimed at advancing equity in educational and economic opportunities at our nations HSIs, including by strengthening their capacity to provide a high-quality education to all students.The list of recipients is in the press release.

The Senate races in 2024 were always going to be tough for D. Several of the seats up for election were in purple to red states. In RealClearPolitics election averages, all toss up states for Senate are currently in the hands of D. So it was always going to be a defensive year. Remind yourself that in 2018 when they were elected, it was during the unpopular Trump mid-term election. In short, 2024 senate races would *no matter what* be tough for D.2. These things are cyclical. When D holds the White House voters blame D for the bad stuff. And there is always bad stuff. These last few years, high inflation and two deadly wars, especially, have made D generally unpopular. It is not a question if they deserve it or not, but that cyclical effects and mood matter.3. The question is what could *realistically * been done different. You list a few things, and I think they are relevant. But consider the 2022 Senate races when R really messed up with Trump candidates like Dr. Oz and Hershel Walker and Blake Masters, who failed to win highly winnable races. 2022 is a case where it is easy to imagine modestly different strategies by R and they would have had a Senate majority. Is the fumbled strategy of D in 2024 as extreme as Rs was in 2022? One can debate that, but I dont think so. For these three reasons I think you should at least moderate your view. There are limits to what any party can do given general events and trends, as well as, the mistakes that have been done are not quite as extreme as they could have been. This is *not* to say things are perfect, only that completely fumbled is a tad too harsh judgement.","title":"CMV: Democrats have completely fumbled their red state Senate races"},{"text":"Be very careful with overconfidence.

The facilities will be located in the municipalities of Guayama (Jobos) and Salinas and will help deliver clean, reliable, and affordable power to communities throughout Puerto Rico. The borrower is Clean Flexible Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of The AES Corporation (AES) and TotalEnergies Holdings USA, Inc. that is managed under a joint venture agreement between the two companies. Todays announcement underscores the President and Vice Presidents efforts to deliver clean energy solutions that benefit communities grappling with the persistent and lingering effects of climate change.  \\n...  \\nAs part of President Biden and Vice President Harris' Investing in America agenda to create good-paying, high-quality job opportunities, this project will support approximately 750 construction jobs and more than 50 full-time jobs once fully operational. The project also supports the Biden-Harris administrations?Justice40 Initiative, which established the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments, including LPO financing, flow to disadvantaged communities, which includes most of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican residents pay energy costs significantly higher than the U.S. average. According to the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, including the communities surrounding the Salinas and Jobos projects, faces some of the greatest energy burdens in the United States.Collectively, the projectknown as Project Marahucomprises 200 MW of solar PV and up to 285 MW (1,140 MWh) of stand-alone BESS capacity. Annually, the solar PV installations will produce approximately 460,000 MWh of energy, enough to power approximately 43,000 homes, and enhance Puerto Ricos grid reliability and energy security. The co-location of the new solar and battery resources will help maximize the projects energy production and improve grid stability. Battery storage will allow the project to continue to provide energy to residents even during adverse weather conditions. The operation of the solar and storage systems is expected to eventually replace existing fossil fuel-based generation and reduce emissions by nearly 2.7 million tons of CO2e per year, an amount roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of around 533,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.  As part of the Biden-Harris administrations efforts to build an equitable and inclusive clean energy future, LPO borrowers are also expected to develop and ultimately implement a comprehensive Community Benefits Plan (CBP) that ensures meaningful community and labor engagement, improves the well-being of residents and workers, and incorporates strong labor standards during construction, operations, and throughout the life of the loan guarantee. For the Marahu project, the CBP is being finalized and will be released to the public soon. The Project Marahu team includes two community relations managers who are from the Guayama community and a group of local community engagement advisors. Local labor leaders will be engaged for the construction and operations planning at both the Jobos and Salinas sites. AES, through existing facilities operating in Puerto Rico, has forged partnerships with community development non-profits and minority-serving educational institutions. AES has also worked with a variety of organizations to lead capacity-building and entrepreneurship programs for Guayama and Salinas community members and has formalized programs offering targeted training and career development opportunities for women.  This project is financed through the?Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment?(EIR) program under Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Section 1706. Created by President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, EIR can?finance projects that retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations or enable operating energy infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions. In support of President Bidens efforts to support economic revitalization in energy communities, Project Marahu will assist in replacing coal energy infrastructure with clean energy facilitiescreating new job opportunities while lowering harmful emissions. The Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (Act 17) requires Puerto Ricos utility to cease all coal-fired energy generation by 2028 and shift to a 100% renewable energy mix by 2050.  Todays announcement is one of many actions DOE has taken to help strengthen Puerto Ricos grid modernization and energy resiliency. In December 2022, President Biden authorized $1 billion for the establishment of the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF), which is administered by DOEs Grid Deployment Office. The PR-ERF is a separate federal funding source to drive key investments in renewable and resilient energy infrastructure in Puerto Rico. For more information on how Puerto Rico can attain a resilient, 100% renewable grid by 2050, read DOEs Puerto Rico Grid Resilience and Transitions to 100% Renewable Energy Study (PR100).  Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:President Biden and Vice President Harris understand that access to reliable energy is a matter of life or deathespecially in the face of climate-change fueled natural disasters that are increasing in intensity and frequency, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Todays announcement will help add up to 200 megawatts of solar generation and another 285 megawatts of reliable storage capacity to Puerto Ricos electric grid to improve the grids resilience and help reduce energy costs that have remained too high for too long for too many familiesall while enabling the Commonwealth to reach its ambitious climate goals.","title":"Biden Harris Administration Announces More Than $860 Million Loan Guarantee to Support Construction of Utility-scale Solar and Battery Storage in Puerto Rico"},{"text":"WowTapper just let him ramble about unrelated things.","title":"Yeah, but its different, Jake.

I'm a radiation physicist, though, so I'm very familiar with particle accelerators and regularly inspect smaller ones.  Why is your first reflex to ignore plain, logical evidence and misdirect to religious or occultist belief?  Religion has a place in society, but it shouldn't make you blind to the objective world around you.  Regardless of your beliefs in our origins, or the driving force behind people's motivations, there are things that are objectively true, things that can be reliably measured by people of any faith or motivation.  The strength of gravity, the temperature at which water changes states.  You don't have to look to any god for that. You can believe that your Christian God is responsible for it happening the way it does, but a Muslim or Buddhist or occultist will all observe the same values of these natural phenomena.  So why, when we know that collisions millions of times stronger than what CERN's LHC produces happen right above our heads thousands of times per day, do you feel the need to stick religion or superstition in it?  Do you go looking at the binary code on your hard drive for demonic faces? Are you sharing claims of people finding the face of the Virgin Mary in their spent car oil?  What is it about CERN or particle accelerators makes you do this? Is it merely because you don't understand how it works as well as how computers or cars work?

These include cabinet positions, executive level department heads, members of federal boards, commissions, and councils, as well as others. Approximately 1,100 of those positions require congressional approval. Within the final days of his administration former President Trump signed an [executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/) that created a new class of federal employees called Schedule F appointees. This involved removing federal job protections from career civil servants that were not previously political appointees and reassigning those positions as political appointees. These individuals were hired based upon a standard competitive hiring process that was non-political in nature. The estimate of the number of potential positions affected was 50,000 although its not clear whether that would be a ceiling or a floor. The purpose of Schedule F was to have the capability to replace these former non-political appointees with those directly under the control of the President and therefore loyal to him.Schedule F was an unprecedented reclassification of formerly non-political positions into political appointees.

Trends in one state tend to correlate somewhat strongly to trends in nearby states, and PA is nestled nicely between these two. We do know that Republican registrations are way WAY up, and I think it's fairly safe to assume that newly-registered Republicans are overwhelmingly voting Trump.Obviously all we know for sure in states that are publishing early turnout numbers is the party affiliation of the voter, and Democrats have convinced themselves that there will be vastly more registered Republicans voting Democrat than vice versa. I am bearish on that claim. The consensus of polls suggests that Democrats only have about a 1% advantage in this particular regard while Republicans are winning Independents by like 10 in most places. Some delusional lefties on Twitter have convinced themselves that Harris will pull in 25% of registered Republicans. This is cope in the highest degree. It'll most likely actually be 5% or less.Trump is already doing well in the polls in PA, but PA has one large, crucial demographic that is utterly invisible to polls: the Amish. Amish people don't tend to vote often (if at all) but many Amish are pissed over the Amos Miller situation and I'm seeing reports online that as many as 180,000 Amish people have been newly registered to vote and the overwhelming majority plan to vote Republican.Also, this notion I've seen around the internet that Republicans are just trading Election Day voters for Early voters is probably *somewhat* true, but definitely not 1:1, as many of these registered Republican early voters are either newly-registered or low-propensity and haven't voted in the last several elections.","title":"Poll: Donald Trump Leading Kamala Harris In 5 Swing States, 3 Points Nationally"},{"text":"Everythingtelevision, news, mainstream media, YouTube, podcastsoperates under a controlled narrative.\\nYou can criticize Biden or Trump, but questioning whether theyre working together is off-limits.\\nEvery channel supports the left vs right divide, revealing the manipulation at play.\\nNo matter the platform, they keep you trapped in their illusion, reinforcing the same false paradigm.","title":"How does FOX news exist?

Last week, the Democratic National Committee filed a petition for original action, which asked Wisconsins high court to take up the case. On Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which has a left-leaning majority, dismissed the case.*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAv3PBg_h74\\n*Jill Stein was removed from the ballot in Nevada. Courtesy of the DNC. Stein was able to hold back attempts to remove her from the ballot in Wisconsin. Again, the fulcrum of the attack came from the DNC.And it wasn't just Stein, the DNC also made moves to remove Dean Phillips, Marianne Williamson, RFK Jr and Cornell West off of other states ballots. Are they all going to be called Russian spies now? Are they all going to be called MAGA conspirators now? Going after candidates like this, wholesale, is going to drive many independent and uncommitted voters away from the Democratic Party forever. The current administration just sent a record amount of military funding to Israel in a one year period. Twice the current administration bypassed Congress to do it.  Then having Harris standing lockstep in public with warmongers Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney will send what message exactly to those who want a ceasefire.  Put it this way, I oppose anyone who is trying to remove candidates off the ballot. Because to me, that's as \\"communist\\" as it gets. That's just full blown banana republic territory.

At one point I stayed at a hotel and there were two girls from the UK who were nice to me and said that what happened to me in the USA would never happen in the UK. Alas, look at what has transpired in the past few years in the UK. I'd be more scared of being trans there than in the USA. It's become a common issue there where people on all sides have united to attack trans rights.If Democrats run candidates like Allred who will gleefully throw trans people under the bus with the language he used as well, it is only a matter of time until the UK position becomes the default among everyone.

The first to get attention weren't even about CERN, but Brookhaven National Lab's RHIC.  So you think colliding particles at high energies will summon a demon?  Create a portal to another dimension?  Create some new form of matter that will destroy the Earth?  Form a miniature black hole that starts sucking in everything?   Alright. If that's your prediction, let's consider it logically.  The RHIC can reach collision energies of 500 GeV.  The LHC can reach 13,000 GeV.  Those are big numbers, sure. We have found ways to create and observe truly spectacular phenomena.  But how do we little humans measure up to big ol' Mother Nature? Maybe she has some similar collisions going on that we can compare to. And, no, I don't mean something in the core of the sun or something light years away that we hypothesize about.  I mean observable collisions within our reach, collisions we're well-versed in and have used to make accurate scientific predictions and discoveries.  Mother Nature wins again, of course.  Look at the sky.  No, not the stars, not the moon or the sun, but the sky. Our atmosphere. Our big, spherical cloud chamber, full of particles.  That sky is protecting us, every second, from much, much more than we humans can create in a lab.  **Every second, every square meter** of our sky is bombarded with thousands of high energy cosmic rays as strong as the LHC can create, in the range of thousands of GeV.  No black holes yet. No demons, either.  And that's just the normal flow.  1,000,000 GeV collisions happen in our atmosphere regularly, as well. **Trillions** every year.  No portal to hell so far.  Maybe if we really crank up the energy, *then* we'll call Baalzebub up from the nether.  What if we were to try collisions of 100,000,000,000 GeV?   Surely that would be enough, right? Only *millions of times stronger than CERN** has ever achieved.  Sorry.  Already happens. Around 5,000,000 times a year, actually. Right above our heads.  Y'all need to quit looking for religion in science. Your holy books don't say shit about high energy particle physics.  Let the physicists handle the physics.  That's not to say just let them do whatever they want... just if you want to know the meaning of what they're doing, the risks, and the potential benefits, the answers aren't in the Book of Enoch or the Old Testament.

They egged on the looting, burning and rioting. And it wasn't just wealthy businesses that were hit. It was many small business owners. Many who didn't have the insurance to handle these losses. Many of the small business owners were minorities too. This is how the \\"left\\" loses support. They lose moderate, independent and undecided voters, particularly in the key battleground states. Kyrsten Sinema is a Democrat. She got followed into the bathroom at ASU by \\"protestors\\" One of the people following her was a male. How is that acceptable? They kept shouting at her when she was in a bathroom stall. Joe Biden was asked about it, already anger at her for not voting to end the filibuster rule in the Senate to his favor, and he said it was all just part of the \\"game\\"  Shit like that pushes people away. You cannot support incivility, up to and including violence and destruction, and hope to win support. And I'll say the same thing about J6. Those that breached into the Capitol Building, that was indefensible. But don't, not once, never ever, attempt to paint the staggering billions lost in 2019 and 2020 to only the wealthy elite. Lots of good honest working class Americans saw their businesses burned out, looted and totally destroyed. Responses like yours just push lots of working class voters away from Progressives. Do it again. Go on. Say again it was only rich people who lost \\"their shirts\\" here. Because that's not true. It's a lie. Good honest working class people of all races, religions, ages, gender, viewpoints, political affiliations and the like were just burned out. In multiple cities across America. Just regular people trying to get by and wanting to have a means to put food on the table for their children. Blind rationalization of the looting/burning/rioting in 2019/2020 only pushes out more people with the viewpoints of Ana Kasparian. She sure hates Trump. But she can't handle the non stop identity politics, pearl clutching and the way fellow Democrats seem to be OK with so much crime and destruction. A good way to lose elections is to run purity test on those left of center, and demand they fall in line to watching working class Americans get torched. Watch their livelihoods get torched and somehow rationalize that into some kind of ad-hoc justice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJJAse2Ip-A","title":"Liberals have lost the plot and will blame everyone but themselves if Trump is elected"},{"text":"I always thought people were too smart to believe the BS on mainstream media.

This is why, for basically the first time ever, the DNC is engaging in open media warfare with a \\"Third Party\\" candidate. The DNC is hoping the \\"Streisand Effect\\" is not triggered by their new ad campaign against Jill Stein. But they want to risk it because they are in a Lose/Lose situation. Many Democrats in elected office are financially funded with huge AIPAC money. The Party doesn't want to enrage that financial base, but it appears they already have. However to shift to appease AIPAC will only also enrage the Muslim voter base in this country. Those voters won't vote for Trump, but they will sit it out. Or vote Stein. This is an incredibly bad situation for Democrats now. This Cheney \\"warmonger/Military Industrial Complex shill\\" endorsement ( to absolutely be the final nail in the coffin for Muslim voters that a Harris administration will simply send as much military hardware to Israel for four to eight years to bomb the Gaza Strip into dust) and picking Walz over Josh Shapiro (Shapiro could have delivered those key Pennsylvania voters and key electoral votes) could sink Harris entirely in a matter of weeks now. How can Harris stand proudly next the Cheneys, take all that sweet defense contractor donor money and then try to convince Muslims in this country that a ceasefire is coming? If you had family in the Gaza Strip, would you want to bet their lives on it?If people don't want to vote for Trump, then don't vote for him. Someone who doesn't vote for Harris not automatically a vote for Trump. Many, as stated before, will sit it out or vote for Jill Stein. What is apparently so radical about my posts that says the Military Industrial Complex, and their shills like the Cheneys, would have no problem \\"removing\\" Trump or any other candidate who won't spend trillions on missiles and bombs to kick off Forever Wars all over the globe? Ana Kasparian of The Young Turks is a liberal. She calls herself an independent now. But the rest of the Overton Window moved so far left, that she's probably going to get spit on for having views that some would see as Conservative at this point. Krystal Ball and Tim Walz are \\"leftists\\" Harris, Pelosi, Schumer, Jeffries, Schiff, Waters, Newsom, Whitmer and the rest are leftists too. The pearl clutching over people on the left who want to run purity tests to assess if folks are left enough or pure enough to stay in the \\"in crowd\\" is just plain sad. Do I think Trump would be better on Israel/Palestine? I don't know yet. He's not a warmonger, that's for sure. Harris/Walz are cozying up to warmongers like the Cheneys, so the bombing will never stop if they win. What's so hard about seeing any of that?","title":"Liberals have lost the plot and will blame everyone but themselves if Trump is elected"},{"text":"Yes, but I'm wondering how long that holds true if Trump wins?

We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of population-level interventions for tackling dementia risk factors. Methods In this economic modelling study, we included recommended population-based interventions from a previously published review article for which there was consistent and robust evidence of effectiveness in tackling a dementia risk factor (tobacco smoking, excess alcohol use, hypertension, obesity, air pollution, and head injury). We only included interventions if they had not been introduced in England or were in place but could be extended. The interventions studied were increases in tobacco pricing, minimum pricing for alcohol, raising alcohol price, salt reduction policies, sugar reduction policies, low emission zones, and compulsory helmet use for cycling by children (aged 5C18 years). We used published intervention effect sizes and relative risks for each risk factor and a Markov model to estimate progression to dementia in populations with and without the intervention, looking at lifetime risk, in the population of England. Findings We estimated that reductions in excess alcohol use through minimum unit pricing would lead to cost-savings of 280 million and 4767 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained over an indefinite succession of age cohorts. Reformulation of food products to reduce salt would lead to cost-savings of 24 billion and 39?433 QALYs gained and reformulation to reduce sugar would lead to cost-savings of 1046 billion and 17?985 QALYs gained. Reducing dementia risk from air pollution by introducing low emission zones in English cities with a population of 100?000 or more (that do not already impose restrictions) would lead to 260 million cost-savings and 5119 QALYs gained. Raising cigarette prices by 10% to reduce dementia risk from smoking would lead to 2277 QALYs gained and cost-savings of 157 million. Making bicycle helmets compulsory for children (aged 5C18 years) to reduce dementia risk from head injury would lead to cost-savings of 91 million and 1554 QALYs gained.","title":"Benefits of population-level interventions for dementia risk factors: an economic modelling study for England"},{"text":"Not every liberal or democratic person is skilled enough to dodge the usual shit Fox would throw at them or even present their argument well.

No ones saying you cant have a nutritious lunch for cheaper than it would cost to pack. Its not one or the other.Ideally that's the case but the world isn't ideal. Even in paid services corners are cut and profits are emphasized. The capitalistic nature of the world pretty much guarantees that, even if you have the best intentions.In Denver they applied a tax to people making over 300k to fund the program when they did it. Thats running into its own problems but there are options and there are ways the burden can be lessened for those making lessThat's a decent solution, I had not heard about it. I personally think while it's a noble cause it shouldn't come at any burden to people living paycheck-to-paycheck.When you limit social programs like this to a select few then the program ends up getting shafted over time. The same happens for programs which aren't overwhelmingly popular. Feeding children should be but the implementation is so important that it eventually shouldn't cause any resentment in people who are contributing to it. If the balance can be achieved between providing nutritious food without overburdening the general public I'm all for it.I think people have different social causes which they are passionate about and many of them willingly contribute to them in different ways. For me it's sustainable farming and the environment for which I donate a decent part of my pay among other things.

He didn't answer the question, because he couldn't really. He knows it's racist and cruel, but the DNC ceded the issue to republican framing, and now they can't take the morally correct stance on it. Same thing happened with Harris in this interview. Her weakest moment was on immigration because she had to pretend that conservatives have a valid point on the issue when they really don't. The DNC needs to stop giving up good positions to republican framework in order to try to capture \\"moderate republicans\\" because there is no such thing anymore.","title":"Kamala Harris' Fox News appearance should be a lesson for Democrats"},{"text":"If the implication is that a personality disorder causes certain behavior then the book should at least be accurate enough to reality in that the disorder actually does cause said behavior. People with disorders have to live with the media's portrayal of them.  If you have a disorder you know what it is, how it affects your life, the problems and challenges you face, there is a lot that goes into it.  If you tell someone you have a disorder, or they find out some other way, it's impossible to efficiently give them all of that information in a way that they understand, so they fill in the gaps and assume things about you from the media they've consumed which means they probably have incorrect ideas.  That's why media depictions of disorders are so important.  I'm not saying they have to be 100% correct, because like you said different people with the same named disorder are different so it's impossible to have a 100% accurate depiction, but the problem is that disorders are typically portrayed not just inaccurately, but inaccurately in a negative way.  That's the problem.It also gets a bit annoying when the disorder becomes a trope and so lazy writers latch onto it as an easy way to make a character.  They always focus on the same narrow few characteristics of a disorder which leaves the public only knowing that.  If the writers were more interested in exploring different varied aspects of a disorder instead of just the lazy fallback into \\"character had ASPD therefore soulless killing machine\\" there would be more interesting stories.  Tropes get boring in addition to being damaging to all of the real life people with ASPD who aren't killers.","title":"CMV: \\"Accurate\\" representation in media isn't all it's cracked up to be"},{"text":"Dems are forced to prepare to defend the election against the spurious claims of Trump and Republicans.","title":"Republicans and Democrats are both preparing for long legal battles over the 2024 election results"},{"text":"How can anyone really be far as decided to use even go want to do look more like?","title":"With US elections looming, Bidens Berlin swan song was all talk, no action on Ukraine"},{"text":"They would have done this back in the 80s, or probably all of history, but they didnt NEED to until now.

I clearly stated in my post that the United States checks and balances limited these efforts, but those checks and balances are eroding, and its disturbing to look on as the Supreme Court bends to the will of one individual.I was pointing out that the January 6th riot was organized to keep Trump in power and for the purpose of coercing Mike Pence not to certify the election.That is not a conspiracy theory; there was an actual gallows erected and chants against Pence.That actually happened, and thats the whole point of my post.There has been so much misinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda disseminated by certain factions within Trumps GOP and other sources that events which truly occurred somehow become questioned, the lines are blurred.Using propaganda, misinformation, and conspiracy theories on ones own people will lead to their division and radicalization. This is exactly what an enemy nation would want for its foes, but its not what someone who wants to lead a united nation would ever desire.It does not work; if a political party indiscriminately spreads misinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda, the people will eventually turn on each other because that is the nature of that approach.This is why our political leaders have traditionally been very careful about opening the floodgates on this strategy, despite how effective it might be in generating political power.Conspiracy theories, misinformation, and propaganda arent new. There is a reason why no major political party has fully embraced them in the past: they only drive division and lead to chaos.There is no scenario that allows a free people to prosper in a nation where political parties use misinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda exclusively to stay in power. Eventually, those who lead will become rulers, and the free people will lose their freedom, that is a fact.You cannot have freedom when this approach is taken; at some point, those who oppose will need to be subjugated. (Trump rhetoric of bloodshed shows that intent). But, the next leader will just subjugate everyone, and we will all lose our freedom.Remember the five-year-old explanation in my original post?The immigrants who came to America left the subjugation of a monarchy to be a free people here. This betrays their intent, our intent.Do you agree? Change my mind if not; explain to me how this approach would lead to a free, united people.","title":"CMV: It's not ok to sacrifice our nation's sobriety to win elections"},{"text":"Nothing says \\"uniter\\" quite like when someone shouts Jesus's name the candidate shames them and tells them to get out, they don't belong.

What you have in this story is a character who becomes self-aware and eventually develops empathy throughout the series. I don't know how realistic that is with our current treatment. And he masks, like eg. autistic people do. Has research ever investigated what wouldhappen if a kid suddenly learned that animal torture is wrong and got obsessed with hiding it?Fiction is also a way to explore possibility beyond what we (believe we) know. If Weels had to fit his character to the diagnostic label perfectly, he would have a completely different character development. As much as this story reinforces some harmful ideas about ASPD and argues this character *must* change by all means, it also breaks with many others, such as that people with a PD are fundamentally flawed, incapable of learning \\"normal\\" moral skills and that they can't be helpful to society. This story is also a strong representation of  universal human inner conflict, an \\"accurate\\" portrayal couldn't capture that. Remember that statistics show what can be measured with our current tools. I think fiction should allow to explore what-ifs like that one. But it's also important to eductae people on media literacy and that we can distinguish speculation from science and facts.

At first the Democrats put on a brave show. Harris got a minor bounce from the Democratic convention. Despite emitting a cavalcade of lies, she more or less held her own in her one debate with Trump.But soon after Labor Day in early September, cracks began to appear. In 2020, just 44,000 votes in a handful of swing states won the presidency for Joe Biden. That was in the midst of the national panic over Covid. The Dems dont have a Chinese virus to help them this time. They know all this. Hence their panic. It is entirely justified.\\nArticle about Roger Kimball from 2009  \\nThe Meltdown Of The Conservative Mind  \\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/48253/the-meltdown-the-conservative-mind  \\nRoger Kimball has been a strident, highly polemical right-winger for a long time. But he's also very smart and highly literate. He writes with authority about art and philosophy, literature and politics. He knows a lot about history. And the quarterly he co-edits with Hilton Kramer (The New Criterion) has published erudite commentary and criticism on culture and the arts for more than a quarter century.What, then, are we supposed to make of this astonishing post? Not only does Kimball endorse the view, expressed repeatedly by right-wingers over the past couple of weeks, that Obama deserves the blame for a stock-market collapse that began and accelerated months before Election Day 2008. And Kimball does not merely suggest, like many other (so-called) conservatives, that we can already, fewer than six weeks (!) after Inauguration Day, judge Obama to be an incompetent president. No, Kimball goes much further than these comparatively level-headed expressions of dissent to suggest something far more sinister. Yes, it's true: Roger Kimball -- accomplished intellectual and cultural critic -- believes that Barack Obama is a Leninist.","title":"US election: Liberals are starting to panic: Donald Trump is going to win in a landslide"},{"text":"The Telegraph is conservative, but now seemingly moving more to the right.

Where his friends and contemporaries Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, while authors of substantial works, were best remembered for holding high office, Huntington was essentially an academic, a Harvard professor who worked incidentally as a consultant for the State Department, the National Security Council and the CIA under the Johnson and Carter administrationsHe was, after all, by the 1980s the most cited political scientist in America on international relations, and several universities made his works required reading.But would be a mistake to dismiss him as no more than an establishment mouthpiece. Even his most problematic ideas were usually balanced with a willingness to see other sides of a question...the far far left at Harvard did't like him one bit...The Harvard CrimsonA Return to Protest  \\nBy Jeff Mayersohn and Allan MuiSeptember 26, 1978The U.S. air war against Indochina ranks as one of this century's most horrible atrocities. More explosive power was rained upon the Vietnamese countryside than was used in all of World War II; anti-personnel weapons were designed solely for their ability to maim; carcinogenic, fetus-deforming chemical defoliants blanketed half of Vietnam's arable land.This concentrated, unrelenting application of mass terror by the United States was not the product of a temporary moral lapse--a theory which appears to be in vogue. On the contrary, it was a calculated effort to crush a decades-old struggle against colonialism, an attempt to keep Asia safe for imperialist plunder. Fortunately for the Vietnamese, it was not successful.This semester, Samuel P. Huntington, one of the principal apologists and theorists for the vicious air war against the villages of Vietnam is returning to the Government Department. An ad hoc committee of students has been formed by the Spartacus Youth League to protest Huntington's return to Harvard. We urge all students, faculty members and campus workers to join us.In the late 1960s, Huntington headed the Council on Vietnamese studies of the South East Asia Development Advisory Group, a body that helped to develop State Department policy.While much of the work of this committee was cloaked in secrecy, there is strong evidence of its repugnant nature. At the May 1969 meeting, for example, Huntington presented a paper entitled \\"Getting Ready for Political Competition in Vietnam.\\" In this document, he advocated electoral manipulation, control of the media and \\"inducements and coercions.\\"Huntington's preferred strategy for \\"political competition\\" was much more direct. In the July 1968 issue of Foreign Affairs, he wrote:If the \\"direct application of mechanical and conventional power\\" takes place on such a massive scale as to produce a massive migration from countryside to city, the basic assumptions underlying the Maoist doctrine of revolutionary warfare no longer operate...In an absent-minded way the United States may well have stumbled upon the answer to \\"wars of national liberation.\\" The effective response lies neither in the quest for conventional military victory nor in the esoteric doctrines of counter-insurgency warfare. It is instead forced-draft urbanization and modernization which rapidly bring the country in question out of the phase in which a rural revolutionary movement can hope to generate sufficient strength to come to power.The antiseptic pedantry of Huntington's prose is almost numbing, but its meaning is anything but benign. Earlier in the article, he maintains that \\"...the Viet Cong will remain a powerful force...so long as \\\\[its\\\\] constituency continues to exist.\\"Thus, in order to deprive the National Liberation Front of its rural base, Huntington is arguing that the U.S. must make the Vietnamese countryside uninhabitable by reducing it to embers and rubble. \\"Urbanization and modernization\\" meant napalm and fragmentation bombs, plague-ridden, overcrowded cities, and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands.For the last two years, Huntington has served the Carter administration as director of national security planning on the National Security Council. In this position, he has played a principal role in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy.Huntington is so strident in his anti-communism, in fact, that within the administration he was reportedly known as \\"Mad Dog.\\" It was Huntington who drafted the main Carter strategic assessment last year, Presidential Review Memorandum-10, which heralded the passing of \\"detente\\" and mandated a new generation of weapons of destruction.Ideally, Huntington should be sent to Vietnam to be tried by his victims.
