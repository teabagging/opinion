Reddit is a mouthpiece for the moderate, center-right, liberal Democrat Party.","title":"Can it be any more obvious that reddit is a propaganda mouthpiece for the left?"},{"text":"I actually agree with you to an extent, but for different reasons. I think the major things the Democratic party mismanaged were 1.) Biden deciding to run again (he should have said he would not run again as far back as after the midterms in 2022) and 2.) Bidens political advisors not ringing the alarm when they saw he was not going to be able to present himself as someone capable of running for president. Even using up the month of time they had between the debate with Trump and when he officially dropped out took too long. Had he dropped out sooner, the party could have had a more proper primary process and whether Harris won it or not, the winning candidate would have gathered useful information about the kind of message that would resonate with voters this year and had more time to introduce themself to the nation.That said, I think ultimately the Harris campaign had a tremendously tall mountain to climb given the worldwide anti-incumbent political climate (every incumbent party in a country with a major economy has lost re-election since 2022; the first time this has happened since 1905). And in fact, they almost did climb it; they closed a lot of the gap Trump had over Biden with the 107 days they had. Its an unpopular opinion, but once Harris took over, I actually dont think her campaign did a terrible job. Even though they lost all the swing states, the swing to the right seen nationally and across nearly all demographics was actually smallest in swing states where the campaign was most active, showing that their strategy did have some effect, but just not enough to actually win. We also dont even nearly have the full picture of what happened this election. It has been less than a month and no full reliable report on voter turnout will be available for months. It very well could be the case that no Democrat was ever going to win this election due to the national/worldwide desire for change sparked by covid-related inflation. I personally believe that the election was winnable because Trump actually was a pretty weak candidate, but Biden dropping out of the election at such a late point in time forced the party into running with Harris and it forced the Harris campaign into a position where they had no time to test strategies and messages to see what would work. They had to do the best they could with the data they had and they never should have been in that situation. And they still only lost narrowly.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"It's funny because i actually said that in my comment originally, then edited it out to give this guy a chance and not assume.

Almost a quarter of the territory is occupied by Russia and Russia actually already staged a fake election and claims that land belongs to Russia. It is an absolute blackout in that territory. Then there's millions of displaced ukrainians scattered throughout the world. Most of those people evacuated Ukraine with the full intention of returning when the ear ends. And to them, the war ending meant Ukraine winning the war. Not surrendering. The people are scared to fight because this is a deadly war. They're scared to die. But that doesn't mean they want to surrender. It just means they don't want to die. Theyve all lost somebody. Many have lost everything they ever knew. And to survive this far, only to go to war and die isn't a light matter. This is the deadliest war in a hundred years. America sent 20 million men to fight in ww2. 10 million of them were drafted. 600,000 of our men died in that war. And there's significant. However, that's a far lower ratio than Ukraines forces as a proportion of their population and the proportion of casualties is much higher as well. So when our men were drafted to go to ww2, it was likely scary, but the prospect of getting killed was much less than it is for ukrainians. \\nAlso, countries don't vote on wars. But if they could vote, they'd very likely vote to not surrender. \\nThey must be exhausted. It's been a very hard year. But they still do not want to surrender. Which is different than wanting 'to fight'. But their unwillingness to surrender is stronger. \\nThe 'military industrial complex' exists whether this war goes on or not. The weapons we're sending Ukraine aren't the profitable systems. If anything, this war is slowing then down from producing billion dollar weapons systems to sell to other countries.","title":"CMV: Ukraines \\"Mandatory Draft\\" Highlights That Many Dont Want to Fight, and Foreign Leaders &amp; Military-Industrial Complex Seem to Decide War Continuation More Than Ukrainians - This Undermines Democracy"},{"text":"Probably since the founding of US.

They seem to want to give a right answer, or at least a complete one, and the average voter doesn't have the patience to get much further than a headline in most cases.Second, some issues aren't actually even issues. There is so much talk about immigration problems in the U.S., but what are they? I have yet to see a concrete explanation of what immigration problem even *exists* that doesn't boil down to racist or xenophobic fearmongering.As for jobs and the economy, unemployment is relatively low, and the economy is actually steadily improving. But because people *feel* like it isn't, there isn't an easy way to course correct. Especially no way to do that without getting into the nuance of the reality. And no voter is going to respond well to something like \\"you're actually not quite right on this and you just need to have patience.\\"I could go on and on about this, but the crux of the problem is that Republicans always frame their solutions as simple because they don't engage with reality. Trickle down economics, deregulation, DEI crap - all these talking points paint a simple solution to a complex problem that people eat up, *because* they like the simplicity. These talking points are either misrepresenting the truth or complete, but the average voter hears someone confidently say \\"I have a simple solution to your problem\\" and they just want to believe it.

That certainly explains it for some of them. Right-wing media brainwashing and head-100-feet-deep-in-the-sand ignorance? It's hard for me to accept the ignorance argument if someone has heard him talk even once. Not bits chosen by someone in the media. Just anything he says. I can't find any way around it. I've tried. The only way someone can listen to this man talk and not see who he is...is stupidity.And if that's the case, or even if it isn't and we just accept that his methods work for whatever reason, how do you fight that?We'd need someone who has legitimate plans and policies but recognizes that the masses can't be won over with them. Some people just have to be manipulated (it feels so gross saying that). The person doesn't even need to be anywhere specific on the political spectrum; people seem to obsess about needing to go hard down the progressive path to resist Trump but we're talking about winning over a group that thinks this guy is actually a conservative.It might as well be talked about and planned in the open since that obviously doesn't stop this group from believing what they're told if it's said the right way.

Again. Back then, we had a lot of empires and wannabe empires. And then we had the mess thats the German bund which eventually evolved into the Kaiserreich. Germans at that time wanted first a unified identity, which they hadnt had for hundreds of years. And being a people so fragmented it doesnt even really deserve the name, historically speaking, they never had much of a chance to take part in that times world politics. Which basically just meant to conquer everything. To make a convoluted complex situation simple: Germans wanted to catch up. They wanted what everyone else already had. But they were hindered by their own lack of cohesion. Which eventually led to 1849/50. Fast forward a very few years. And it IS but a few- people didnt need history lessons, they REMEMBERED their history or were taught it by their parents who did live it. Of course they tried to grasp the bull by its horns. Just like everyone else would, just like everyone else DID when offered the opportunity. Did it bite them in the ass? You bet. Did they do questionable things? Also yes. Were they innocent ? THATS a far too loaded question; they did as they should, as in, they acted in their own best interest  which was defined by a person rather than its people as a whole. Weimar Republic began AFTER the war, and it was held responsible; legitimately, sure, but strictly speaking were condemning the successor for the mistakes of their predecessor.

If trump wasn't who he was, and he didn't have as large of an illusion of money as he's got, he'd be in a nursing home somewhere.

There are people among us who appear to be intelligent enough to carry jobs, mortgages/rent, and can drive that are among us, but are so slow that even with things like tariffs spelled out for them they still dont get it. Also, We are voting for the person who supports the policies we supportSo, you support mass deportation? If you do, did you know that illegal immigrants pay about 96 billion in taxes yearly but never see a dime of that back with tax returns or social security? When trump rounds up illegals like cattle and our society goes to shit and the social security officially runs out in 4 years, the loss of 96 billion in taxes because the illegal immigrants were persecuted is why. So, you also support the deconstruction of obamacare? Well, that's the affordable care act, buddy.. so when your gran no longer gets her social security or medicide insurance, just remember, you voted to support the policies our president supports. You voted to end that.So, you support the turning of reproductive care over to the states? By doing this not only did you codify the fact that many women will die, but you also made it possible for things like IVF, birth control, and care for things like stis to go right out the window. states are already coming after those things. Flordia and Texas are trying to end access to ivf. So all those embryos waiting for transplantation are just sitting there while families try frantically to get their embryos moved out of state for a safer chance at actually getting to use them. Texas and I believe Alabama is trying to limit or all out stop the access to things like birth control (pills, patches, IUD, nexplanon, and depo shot being the common methods.) They also have made it where doctors second guess themselves and thier care, so treatment for stis are about to end. So, you also support higher tariffs on products coming from other countries like China, Canada, and Mexico? First, let me ask, do you know what a tariff is and who has to pay that? If you dont, please go google it. Google is free. That being said, trump wants to implement higher tariffs. I dont know if you've seen the news or not, but companies like Walmart, Target, kroger (smiths), GMC, Chevrolet, and so many more have released statements about how they will be RAISING prices in response to trumps supposed tariffs. Now let me ask, do you know where the stuff around your home comes from? Obviously, you don't. Let me just break a few down for you. We get almost all our produce (fruits and vegetables) from Canada and Mexico. So those $1.50 tomatoes or $0.55/lb bananas you get? Yeah, have fun looking at $3 tomatoes and $1.55/lb bananas. Our oil? We get 52% of that from Canada, not Iraq. Textiles? Mostly Mexico and China. Car parts, medical supplies, home good items? All China. So, while you're complaining about $600/month in groceries, $60 oil change, and $2.69/gallon of gas.

From a group of ideas to increase their capability beyond the limits set by the treaty, a thing called Plan Z came about. The link below will give you the full story, but part of Plan Z was a great discussion about what would be more effective and less costly.

Upon close inspection you will see, [Pi(9) X Pi]. That math gives us the indicator needed to decode the plain letters to its left. The result of that is 88. In coding for many that 88 represents the letter H, the right letter of the alphabet twice which refers to the WWII German leaders salute.. HH. Using that as an indicator of code vs. a shock line, a cryptologist can now easily define P/Z/UB. It was a grand plan under Hitler to create a marine force using up to 1000 u-boats (submarines) to fan out and destroy the great British Fleet.

Even if not the best candidate, she made the effort. Heres my take: no other Democrat candidate (including men young and old) could have won the elections. It was an unbalanced race between the voter  groups: while the Trumpist crowd stood behind Trump under all circumstances, democrats had weakness inside their camp. Regardless of what Trump said and did his supporters never criticized him. Not a word. When I asked how can you support someone who does X or Y, they preferred not responding and detached themselves from the conversation. In contrast, democrats were always eager to find faults (and problems)  with their candidate. It started with Biden being hammered not by republicans, but by his friends inside the party. It took the form of  an avalanche: which party insider will be more critical: We need a younger candidate. Why old white men are always elected? A younger woman of color who appeals to women and minorities will seal the deal. So were insiders and media commentators telling voters day and night. (At the same time no Republican criticized Trump in any way). But the self bashing continued even after the woman of color replaced Biden. Nobody can win such race when insiders are the worst critics. When the candidate (any candidate) is put under the magnifying glass to see whats wrong with them. At 78 Trump is old. Nobody from inside the Republican party dared saying that a man at such age shouldnt run for president. Only Biden is old. After all even his peers are saying so.The a group of young voters came with a brilliant idea: I will not vote for Harris since there is no difference between the two partiesI didnt hear even once a Republican claiming there is no difference between Trump and Kamala Harris.

There are different indices that you can measure but consumer price index (CPI) is the usual one being cited when people are talking about inflation in everyday economics or politics.  It simply adds up the prices of a predetermined basket of goods and compares them to what that same basket of goods cost at previous times.  Even if some things go up and others go down the total basket might cost the same so just the price of eggs going up wouldnt mean there was inflation if the price of other things went down proportionally.Some versions like core price index will exclude certain things like oil/gas from the basket (theyre in normal CPI) because theyre volatile commodities that can move on their own despite overall trends in other things.So, inflation can be from increasing the money supply, like youre saying, but also from supply chain shocks, demand spikes, tariffs, low unemployment driving wages up, regulations, collusion between competing firms, or anything that makes the general prices of things go up.Youre thinking of currency devaluation, which is a part of but not exclusively the cause of inflation.  Print a bunch of money and the moneys worth less.  This was even more of an issue when countries were on the gold standard (or other physical store of value) that the money represented.  In the US, the treasury is in charge of this.That still affects modern markets but the money supply consists of a lot more than physical dollars.  Due to reserve ratios, checkable deposits, and debt instruments theres a lot of lent money that doesnt actually physically exist anywhere but is nonetheless part of the money supply.The Fed, FDIC, and office of the comptroller can all influence this to expand or contract how big the theoretical money supply is.  Some of our recent inflation was due to the Fed.But the money supply ALSO includes government debt instruments like T-bills.  When the US deficit spends, it issues these in exchange for currency and both the new debt and the money paid for it are now part of the money supply.Congress is in charge of that but Presidents have been messing around with it more and more by redirecting funds from one thing to another using emergency powers and then congress has to issue more debt to pay for what the money was SUPPOSED to be for in the first place.Tariffs can lead to increases that, too.  The government buys a lot of stuff.  If there are tariffs on that stuff and they have to buy it anyway, thats higher prices - more deficit spending - more government bonds - bigger money supply - currency devaluation (your original concern) - inflation.Ideally, a tariff would cause you to buy from a domestic firm rather than a foreign one but even if they can meet the new demand the domestic price must be higher than the old foreign price or youd have been buying domestic already without the tariff.Can also happen due to counter-tariffs, like we saw with China vs. US soybean farmers.  Now you have to prop them up with subsidies paid for by deficit spending (same chain as above) ending in inflation.Now, if the extra tax revenues you received from the tariffs exceeded the extra debt youd have to issue to ameliorate their effects, it would avoid all that.  Spoiler:  it virtually never does and theres generally a (usually small) net loss of GDP, stock market performance, and jobs, with an increase in CPI (inflation) and deficit spending.Is it worth it?  Maybe, if your goal is protecting certain domestic industries.  If were all willing to pitch in a tiny amount to support something like US electric vehicle production (one of the foreign industries the Trump/Biden tariffs targeted) there can be a case to make for it.But it WILL lead to inflation by any definition.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Austria sent serbia an ultimatum designed to be rejected as a pretense for war, with them only doing so with confidence granted by Germany's support.

The Kaiser gave Austria Hungary a blank cheque of support for offensive action against Russia. That went significantly beyond their basic responsibilities as an ally, and perpetuated the escalation of an otherwise-insignificant region crisis into a world war. Even if we said that was warranted however, none of that justifies Germany's unprovoked invasion of democratic neutral nations like Belgium whom they had sworn to protect in the treaty of London. Being at war with one country does not allow you to throw out all of international law for the sake of tactical convenience.Even if it did, nothing justifies the systemic atrocities committed by the German army against civilian populations in that invasion. The Rape of Belgium is not simply a unfortunate case of a few localised units losing discipline in getting out of hand, bad as that would be. Rather, the use of collective punishment, indiscriminate reprisals, rape as a weapon of war, mass hostage taking, looting, pillaging, and razing of unresistant cities, destruction of heritage artifacts, summary arrest and execution of anticipated 'troublemakers', etc were all officially sanctioned, orchestrated, and part of established German doctrine. Indiscriminate terror against civilians to prevent resistance was not merely tolerated, but expected.This was a clear violation of the most basic laws of war, but as with international law and their treaty obligations, Germany saw these as just more 'scraps of paper' which had no meaning, and couldn't see why everyone else was so fussed about them.Importantly, this is not a case of the war in general being terrible for humanity. Particularly on the Western front this behavior was entirely without comparison or equivalent on the allied side. The disdain and disregard for morals and laws was unique to Germany on the western front.It also established a pattern of lawbreaking that would persist throughout the conflict. Be it the initial use of poison gas, unrestricted submarine warfare against cruiser rules, or the execution of British POWs, the laws of war were things that only applied to other people.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"The amount of people working in Washington, in the numberless amount of roles that pass through there, and the nature of the jobs, and were surprised somebody found cocaine?

Serbia. Pan-Slavic nationalists from independent Serbia believed that assassinating Ferdinand would provoke an uprising in Croatia and Bosnia against Austria-Hungary (similar to Serbia's uprising that led to its independence from the Ottomans). That, of course, did not happen. When Croatia and Bosnia didn't revolt against the Hapsburgs, Serbia pled for military aid from Russia as a fellow Slavic nation, which led to the cascade of defensive pacts drawing the whole of Europe into a war. Serbia could *still* have avoided the whole conflict if they had just handed Princip over to Austria-Hungary (and probably made some concessions for assassinating the *crown prince*).2. Kaiser Wilhelm II. Wilhelm II was a largely incompetent ruler that wanted Germany to rapidly expand, to \\"enlarge Germany's place in the sun.\\" In 1890 he dismissed Otto von Bismarck (who was the person *responsible* for the tangled web of alliances that held the European powers in check, and probably the only person who could navigate them), and rapidly embarked on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" meant to solidify Germany as a superpower. It's thanks to *Wilhelm*, who alienated France by initiating a massive naval buildup and contesting French control of Morocco, and alienated England by building a railway through Baghdad to contest Britain's dominion of the Persian Gulf.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"There was, and is, a sector of the Democratic Party that got off on provoking this particular culture war as well.It wasnt just Were here to defend civil rights for all marginalized groups.

He is benefitting off of a cynicism about truth in politics that allows him to evade accountability for his actions, or even justifying what he says. His overarching proposition to the public, in a few words, is that he is going to bring America back to the golden age by turning back the clock on globalization.

There are many problems with this. One essential problem with your approach is that science is not fact. Science is constantly challenged and what was considered solid evidence or solid theory gets regularly replaced. The tests you are suggesting will likely be out of date. The candidates that you are suggesting will be legitimate, will not be likely to have adopted current scientific research findings. Candidates will be groomed to pass the tests rather than to be actually qualified. How will you ensure that once a candidate is elected that they will not be corrupt and make policies counter to what you consider to be facts? The test will be a charade and the candidates will not be any more likely to be qualified since passing a test is no guarantee of qualified leadership. In fact, this is a fundamental critique of modern education, that it is teaching to a test. You want the entire political system built around this failed approach. In fact, by creating this approach, you are likely to corrupt science even further. Scientific institutions will not be incentivized to arrive at truth so much as to be in the favor of those running the tests. This invites corruption and motivation to maintain the status quo. Who will fund the institutions who do science? The politicians of course. Which scientific institutions will receive funding? The ones that work in the interests of those with the most power and influence and have findings best aligned with the status quo. Of course, this is similar to how things currently work but your idea reduces the complexity down to just being able to put up a few candidates who have been trained to pass a test and then corruption can flow unimpeded under the guise of test-proven merit.","title":"CMV: Instead of democracy, we should have a form of government where only candidates with the best ability are able to become leaders"},{"text":"I promise to not waste weeks beating a joke to death upon hearing of this knowledge that democrats frabricated some new tech just to give me more ammo to trash them.","title":"The emergence of BlueSky is due to the liberals looking for an echo-chamber and their declining debate skills"},{"text":"broccoli does get you high if you are having a manic episode","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"this is just cat owning done properly","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Kamala Harris was a bigger embarrassment than Dementia Joe","title":"Dear Left"},{"text":"https://i.redd.it/jqg2ogr80e3e1.gifRed states in 2026: OMFG WERER STARVOMG!!!!Me:","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It felt.very cringe","title":"Kamala Harris Gives Message to Supporters in First Remarks Since Concession"},{"text":"4m more votes than peak Obama; 8m more votes than Clinton.??People didn't go out and voteYou had record numbers for any non-pandemic election.

Exactly this.","title":"Kamala Harris Gives Message to Supporters in First Remarks Since Concession"},{"text":"Inflation is simply the expansion of the money supply, This is my view.Your view is flawed, because your understanding of what inflation is is flawed.Here are some definitions of inflation:  *  Inflation is an increase in the level of prices of the goods and services that households buy. - Reserve bank of Australia*  Inflation can be defined as the overall general upward price movement of goods and services in an economy. - US Department of Labor*  a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. - Oxford dictionary *  In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. - Wikipedia \\nAn increase to the supply of money is a cause of inflation, as is the case with Venezuela's hyper inflation, where excessive money printing drove down the relative value of the currency. It is not however a complete picture of what inflation is, more is it the only cause. Far more commonly, inflation is caused by increasing prices. Tariffs will raise the price of consumer goods in America, by definition, raising inflation. \\nCertainly, an economy that starts booming would cause inflation. Is that the argument as to how tariffs will cause inflation?No. **Simply put, there are products that cannot be produced in America as cost effectively as they can be in other parts of the world.**America has worker and environmental protection laws that prevent extreme cost savings measures. America lacks the climate for some agricultural products, and the infrastructure for the manufacture of some products. Even for things that can grow in American climates, scaling up agriculture production of specific crops takes decades. Similarly, America CAN build more factories, scrap worker protections and environmental regulations in order to produce items more cost effectively, but again, such a transition takes years to decades to construct the facilities, acquisition and distribution networks and secure material suppliers. \\nIn the years and decades while these industries are being rebuilt in America, consumer demand remains high, but local supplies are low, forcing the American people to pay more to maintain the same quality of life, as imported goods are now more expensive. \\nAdd to that the uncertainty from an investor standpoint. Imagine you are considering investing in American manufacturing, as the tariffs will increase prices, you could make a solid return by being one of the earliest competitors on the market. But, do you take that risk? In 4 years, the Democrats have a good chance of winning the election, removing the tariffs, and now you are stuck with the bill from building a manufacturing plant that is now unable to compete with the old, tarrif free prices! **It's a huge risk to invest, since removing the tarrifs will like be a platform democrats will run on**. TLDR, it's a double whammy. Inflation is more than just the increased money supply, and if the tariffs are implemented, it will cause substantial price increases while America until local production and manufacturing can catch up.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"What's so amazing; given a fixed money supply prices are still determined by supply and demand.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"do british people pronounce qatar as kuh arr","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thanks manYou too","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The personality problem is a symptom of the underlying nihilism, lack of confidence, and influence of wealthy donors.

But if everyone is only spending $1 a day, everyone is only making $1 a day as well, so prices have to be lower, even though there is exactly the same amount of money in the economy, it just isn't moving around that much.

Ideally democracy could lessen that, but let's face it that's hardly the way it is, and it has become more of a way to make people believe shit happens with their consent.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Homework due during Thanksgiving weekend is a war crime.

Now that this is established lets consider how this could raise the prices of any given good.\\nA singular product like say steel would have x% tariff on it from its country of origin. Lets say the us company builders inc imported steel from elsewhere before the tariff would raise their costs by that x%, US suppliers could undercut that amount by some lesser percentage (x-competitive market)% to incentivize this building company to buy US steel but that new percentage increase in cost would be passed off to consumers anyways so thats strike one.The example above has a bunch of assumptions built in and is very crude in the business product development cycle for now common multinational companies. One example is that the US could match foreign production for the respective imports like Steel but what about other goods. Strike twoAlongside these supply chains products can weirdly go back and forth between multiple different countries factories because there is no real all in one manufacturing hubs for most goods that involve microchips nowadays so if that is the case you could see the tariff effect happen multiple times in the production process. Strike threeLastly tariffs do not exist in a vacuum countries impacted are not going to take it lightly and will enact policies against the US which will causes general global prices to rise since the US and China are the two biggest economies in the world.\\nNow your out","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Go for it.

As president I won't tolerate criminals, and we will deport them in a heartbeat. But for those seeking opportunity, whose only desire is to contribute to this great country, Or for those who are escaping great peril, we have to have a find a safe and legal path.\\"You mean like....\\"I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane,\\" Harris said. \\"We can and we must do both.\\"Harris pledged to bar undocumented border crossers from receiving asylum, as well as a promise to arrest, deport and impose a five-year ban on migrants who have crossed \\"between ports of entry.\\"\\n...\\n\\"The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously,\\" Harris said. \\"We are also a nation of immigrants  we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane.

Monetary expansion happens when central banks or financial institutions create new moneysuch as through quantitative easing, lower interest rates, or increased lending. This increases the money available in the economy, potentially leading to demand outpacing supply, which pushes prices up.But inflation isnt always about money supply. Tariffs can cause cost-push inflation, where prices rise due to higher production costs rather than increased demand. Here's how this works: Tariffs are a tax on imports, so when goods like steel, semiconductors, or machinery become more expensive, domestic producers pay more for these inputs. Those higher costs are passed on to consumers through higher prices for finished products, like cars or appliances. Unlike monetary expansion, cost-push inflation doesnt require more money circulatingits driven by supply-side pressures.Tariffs also disrupt comparative advantage, which keeps trade efficient. For example, instead of importing cheaper goods from abroad, tariffs incentivize domestic production in sectors where the U.S. might be less efficient. This means higher production costs, reduced competition, and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Retaliatory tariffs and disrupted global supply chains add to the problem, creating shortages and further inflating prices. So easy econ 101, less supply + similar demand = inflation.Finally, while you suggest tariffs might lead to a domestic economic boom and inflation through loan creation, the reality is different. Higher costs from tariffs reduce disposable income and profit margins, slowing growth rather than increasing demand. Inflation driven by tariffs isnt about monetary expansionits about inefficiencies, higher costs, and supply chain disruptions that make goods more expensive across the board.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"I am pretty sure that inflation is a measure of prices going up, and that increasing the money supply has inflationary effects, but it's not the only thing inflation is.

Inflation is the general rise of prices across an economy. To see this clearly, think about a concept known as the \\"velocity\\" of money. The same one dollar bill could be spent once a year or once a day. Even with a small money supply, a very high velocity of money could sustain higher prices than an economy with a low velocity of money, because (with the range money supply) there is more money moving around. Additionally, there is a concept called the \\"dead weight loss\\" of taxes. In general, as prices go up for a product, fewer people will buy the product. And as prices go down, fewer will be produced. The point where these meet is an \\"equilibrium\\" and the economy will produce as many as will be consumed at the optimal price. When you add a tax, the price to the consumer goes up (or the price received by the company goes down, or both, the outcome is the same in any case). This means that fewer people will buy that thing, and it means that fewer companies will produce it. And together there will be fewer sales of that good and they will happen at a higher price. So, regardless of what you call it, taxes and tariffs on goods do, necessarily, raise the price (and lower the availability) of the good. When people see rising prices they (correctly) call it inflation, but regardless of what you call it, prices do rise. But like I said, you should call it inflation because money supply and inflation are distinct things. While often connected, they are distinct concepts that are useful to keep separated.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Sure didIm on mobile so I didnt even notice.

He hasn't gone anywhere, he just can't run again. But do you remember who ran before him? Probably not, because John Kerry wasn't a particularly amazing orator. Or Al Gore? He was not a particularly rousing politician either. You have to go back to JFK for your next examplealthough I thought Bill Clinton was quite a charismatic politician. It's not so much that there's a dearth of interesting and engaging politicians on the leftjust as there wasn't when Kerry and Gore ranit's more that things have to line up juuuuuuust right for any one person to make it to the top of the ticket. And only one person can. And another shot doesn't come around for 4 years. So if circumstances don't line up perfectly, as they haven't in several of the last campaigns, it could be for so many other reasons. Things like there's an incumbent running (as was the case with this year's election until he dropped out), or one of their opponents has insanely high name recognition and is a well-known quantity (like Hillary Clinton in 2016), or perhaps people are just feeling like everything is too out of control and they long for something safe and familiar (which is what many believe was the overwhelming reason Democrats backed Biden in 2020). Ironically, had Biden dropped out of the 2024 race much earlier, there might have been a robust primary contest that would have tested Harris against otherssomething that would have informed people early if she had improved as a potential candidate since her previous attempt. Since that didn't happen, no other potential candidates even had a chance to take their shot this time. The good newsif there is good news in this situationis that for the next election, Democrats have no incumbent and no one with huge name recognition who's been waiting around to get his or her chance (although one could make the argument that Bernie Sanders fits that description, but I'd doubt very much he'd win the primaries due to his age). So the next election cycle might give us the chance to see some young, fresh, charismatic and articulate people step up. People more along the lines of Obama than of Biden or Harris.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"This is not an issue of what ballots are used or how they are processed, its's by design that the final count takes a while.

I agree with you that the Dem's would benefit from, or even need, a more iconoclastic candidate to meet the moment, but that's not all they need. I think the only thing that's going to prevent a coup in this country in the next 12 years is a mass movement on the left as an answer to the crypto-fascists on the right. Because all they need is a good 10-20% of the population + police and military firmly on their side to take power.TL;DR building out a movement is equally if not more important than finding the right candidate.

So they recalled all of them.  The feds told them they had to reset the warranty too, so I have a 8-year 100k mile battery warranty if it loses too much capacity.The best part is, they had stopped making the batteries when the recall happened, so they had to use upgraded batteries made for a newer model year, which added over 20 miles of range for free!It's pretty easy to find used Bolts around the country, and almost all of them will have a new battery.  They qualify for a $4k instant rebate courtesy of the IRS.  Oh, and did I mention that there's no maintenance needed on a Bolt?  No oil changes or anything. Just wiper blades and tires as needed, maybe new brake pads or shocks every 150k miles or whatever.  The only fluids it has is coolant (for the battery and stuff) and brake fluid, and the only way to lose those is having it slowly evaporate through the rubber hoses, which means don't worry about it (the car will also pop up a notification if they get low).You can also file for a tax credit of like 30% or so of the cost to install a home charging station (parts and labor both count).  I simply put a fence post in my driveway, mounted a charger on it, and buried conduit leading back to the meter panel on the side of my house. The electrical code says if you use metal conduit you only need to dig down 6 inches, which is very doable with just hand tools.  If you have a garage with an electrical panel it's even easier, knock a hole in the wall next to the panel and run some shielded cable to where you want the charger.  Or just plug the charger into a 240 volt clothes dryer socket if you have one handy.My Bolt can charge from empty in about 9 hours at home.  I basically never get below 50% though so it takes less than four.  I plug it in when I get home for the day and it's always charged by morning.tl;dr Chevy made a huge mistake: they accidentally built a good Chevy.","title":"Good dems need to do more of this"},{"text":"I actually hope she runs in 2028lol there is absolutely 0% chance","title":"Kamala Harris Gives Message to Supporters in First Remarks Since Concession"},{"text":"Didn't he say that he would be a dictator on day one?Also, I seem to remember a time when he actively encouraged a mob to try and stop the transition of power to his opponent.

Just because Kamala personally didnt center the issue in the last few months is not really relevant. The relevant issue is most people are fatigued by these topics. Most people dont care and havent cared when trans women used a womens bathroom. Republicans made it an issue, by highlighting the possibility of abuse of policies that allow trans people to use the bathroom aligning with their gender identity. That abuse wasnt happening, at least not in any significant way, but democrats responded by pretending it never happens, and never could possibly happen. And simultaneously they instituted policies in which the gender change could not be questioned whatsoever. Being dismissive isnt helpful. Either dont engage at all when Republicans bring something like this up or if you do engage, you have to validate concerns about risks and offer mitigating measures to quell those concerns. Chastising people for having the concern to begin with isnt helpful. Because even though abusing the whole bathroom choice thing isnt a large scale issue, all it takes is a few occurrences, after Dems pretend its not a risk at all, for republicans to show people Dems dont take concerns of average Americans seriously, and cover up things like this. We shouldnt abandon trans or any lgbtq rights, but it shouldnt be talked about as much as it is and that messaging needs to be consistent throughout the party, not just the individual candidate at the top of the ticket. Stop letting republicans control the narrative by responding to every comment they make about it, because when you do that, you keep drudging up the topic, just as republicans want, and thats what creates the fatigue people are feeling and the feeling of dems not prioritizing the most pressing issues, like economy, healthcare, etc. If you must engage with republicans on the topic, dont pretend the small risk they bring up isnt real at all, because it will only take one example to make it so real for everyone and for them to then distrust Dems.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures"},{"text":"please no, she is extremely unlikeable","title":"Kamala Harris keeping options open for possible political comeback"},{"text":"She should never show her face again once her term is up.

To be clear, I asked you to justify your deontological worldview *tout court*. I'm not even sure what justifying one ethical framework \\"inside of\\" another is even attempting to accomplish. Are you like, the second coming of Aristotle bro? ?? Clearly. But more seriously, you do know that Aristotelian ethical frameworks have been thoroughly enmeshed with Christian ethical ideas for like centuries, right? More to the point, when did Aristotle claim in the nichomachean ethics that polygamy is wrong without giving any argument *at all*? (I don't think he even talked about polygamy but again, prove me wrong if he did).Actually I don't see what your point is because I don't think that Aristotle argued for a deontological worldview within a utilitarianist framework. I actually have no idea what you are trying to argue now. Enlighten me. \\nThe taking of an innocent human life is wrong though irrespective of the consequences it may have due to the intrinsic value of human lifeI want to be charitable because I think I know what you are trying to say, but maybe try typing slower and more deliberately. Is the taking of a life itself not a relevant consequence? I really just don't understand your point and that's probably because it is too grammatically and substantively incomprehensible. The rule that human life is sacred needs no further justification beyond its existence as a first principle. A deontological system of obligations is formed on those these sort principles (ie. human life has value). The rest is entirely unnecessary babbleUmm... Okay.... Nobody put that idea into question. Quote me if I'm wrong. But do you really think a consequentialist or utilitarian ethical framework would deny the importance of human life itself? Maybe some but it seems like a fringe view. Anyways, the charge was always to prove things like that the claim that \\"polygamy\\" is universally wrong. You know, the claims that are material to your original argument.Listen, I think you are getting very triggered at this point and I would advise you to take a break, think about your response, and come back later... Nothing is happening here, you are not providing justification for your views, and you seem to be trying very hard to insult me.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"If they simply ran on a Youre getting ripped off message they would have won in a landslide","title":"The Democrats Will Keep Losing Until They Solve Their Plutocracy Problem"},{"text":"40 seats dream ??","title":"Mississippi Runoff Election Results Thread"},{"text":"A fair point, however her ideas are not popular with the corporate dems and their donors who run the party.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"I got a used Chevy Bolt with 60k miles and a brand new battery for $8500 after the tax rebate.","title":"Good dems need to do more of this"},{"text":"Great, release it all and fuck anyone involved.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures"},{"text":"It's not really the 1%..Everyone is doing what they do.

So complaining later that people use it or not, or change their arguments, isnt actually an inconsistency. Contingent arguments only sometimes apply. The issue then becomes one of justification - does abandoning the argument in the circumstances make sense. 2. Your argument is self-contradictory. If consent is not a valid justification for polygamy, or incest, then it also isnt valid for plain old sex between two consenting adults - unless you are also pleading special circumstances. So is all sex rape? On the flip side, if consent is invalid as a concept, so is lack of consent - the inverse. But that would mean no sex is ever rape - which is clearly an unacceptable position.

While I wouldn't rule it out entirely, all evidence thus far suggests that Hamas is either an irrational actor, or they're grossly misreading the room by thinking that they can get Israel to cave if they just hold out a bit longer.","title":"President Biden announces Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal"},{"text":"lolol","title":"The Abundance Agenda: Neoliberalisms Rebrand | The new centrist push to regain control of the Democratic Party, with corporate money"},{"text":"progressive outrage over her approach to the Israel-Hamas war\\"Wait - was she President?","title":"Kamala Harris Gives Message to Supporters in First Remarks Since Concession"},{"text":"Exactly why we need to stop helping people vilify the messenger.","title":"In First Post-Election Interview, Kamala Harriss Advisors Admit that Democrats Are Losing the Culture War"},{"text":"I don't think they are having fun googling what a tariff is","title":"Kamala Harris Campaigned on 'Joy.'

Set yourself up on a rocky hill surrounded by a treeless marsh and you can deflect any attack, basic Art of War stuff.

Trump's stated policy goals of kicking out transgender people from the military is just the latest example of this. At the same time though, there really needs to be a reassessment within liberal circles on the failures of what I would term \\"neoliberal\\" identity politics. And this cuts across the board when it comes to race, gender, sexuality, etc. When you go back to some of the original identity movements of the 60s and 70s, there was a recognition of the connection between identity issues and class politics. Someone like Martin Luther King Jr for example who was a civil rights leader was also pushing for the Poor People's Campaign. Fred Hampton as head of the Black Panther Party's Chicago headquarters was talking about a Rainbow Coalition where people of different identities whether race or gender were united on a class framework. What has happened with the rise of neoliberalism is the fact that certain strands of identity politics has been swept up with neoliberal modes of doing things. And we see this whether it is pinkwashing, rainbow capitalism, woke capitalism and other forms of these things. As a result, when there is a populist backlash against Neoliberalism like what we are seeing right now, that backlash ends up having as its collateral people from specific identity groups due to the fact that those groups are associated with a system that people hate. If I were to tie this back to Trans issues, imagine for a second if the majority of the public conversations on transgender rights were talking about the impact that poverty and youth homelessness have on the trans community, particularly trans youth. How that intersects with issues having to do with violence due to the fact that those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are more likely to face violence. It wouldn't fix everything due to the fear, stigma and prejudices that are still present. But it would go a long way to building bridges while at the same time addressing tangible issues that impact the transgender community in a Fred Hampton style manner. Instead what we have are these performative, pseodo moralistic and consumer driven approaches to identity politics that is just a failure for everyone.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures"},{"text":"Basically, you're just acknowledging that she had no chance of winning because Republicans convinced voters that Democrats were responsible for high prices.

Here, he's applying a true statistic: black people *do* commit more crimes \\"per capita\\", because due to the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and etc., they are more likely to live in areas of concentrated poverty and crime. But the result is behavior that, if all white people followed it, would mean that black people (the vast majority of whom are good, law-abiding people, same as with people of all races) couldn't work for Uber. That'd pretty clearly be awful.Now, personally, I think that most white people who actually refuse to take Ubers with black drivers do so because they believe falsely that there's a high risk of a black Uber driver being dangerous to them (i.e., they have false, racist beliefs). In other words, they're not deciding based on a statistical calculation, they're deciding based on actual hatred or fear of black people. In contrast, many more women make statistical decisions like this when avoiding putting themselves entirely in the power of strange men.Still, you might argue that the same is true for women who refuse to drive with male Uber drivers. It'd be unjust if, just because women want to feel a little more safe, they all refuse to drive in Ubers with men, and as a result men can't make a living driving Uber. I think there's merit to that argument; it wouldn't be fair for a woman to refuse to take Ubers with strange men based solely on statistics.I don't think this argument would apply to crossing the street, as I don't think there's any harm done there. If ALL woman ALWAYS crossed the street to avoid strange men at night, then... precisely nothing bad would happen.And I don't think this argument would apply to a woman who's experienced sexual assault and experiences high anxiety while in the power of strange men. If all such women avoided Ubers with men, men would still be able to make a living as Uber drivers.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Biden has been asleep at the wheel for a while now.

One question is when it's OK to make a decision about risks based on statistical facts (X group is more risky than Y group). You're making the argument that it basically never is. You should judge people based upon their individual character, not based upon their demographics.Totally agree. Maybe we disagree on what \\"judging\\" someone means?If a woman crosses the street to avoid me (a man) late at night, I don't feel judged. I don't believe that she thinks I'm a predator. I don't think she thinks anything bad about me, as an individual, at all. I would suspect she probably thinks I'm almost certainly a lovely person.

Good luck getting moderate Rs in close races on board with destroying the government.2. The Supreme Court, for its many flaws, has consistently said no to Trump being a dictator.  If they wanted that, they would've let him stay in office in 2020, or ruled that *Moore vs. Harper* allowed state legislatures to ignore the popular vote in 2023.

There's an election reporting results literally right now, and there'll be plenty more after January 20th.Trump winning is bad.  And it's anything but business as usual.  But the people screaming about how Trump can just do what he wants are some combination of misinformed, depressed, and trying to make you feel like resistance is useless.

Police arrested hundreds of polygamists and a superior court ordered the children to be returned as a result of the new ambiguity of cohabitation laws. Children were raped for decades because liberals wouldnt enforce those cohabitation laws. It was until the 2000s when these men were arrested for things like failure to pay child support led which to further investigations.The reason they marry kids is because the population is split 50/50 male to female. When a minority of men marry the majority of women, that cultures turns elsewhere when looking to court marriages. This is the core of the moral hazard.So yes, cohabitation should be illegal.

Then, Mr. Third Way Bill Clinton broke that streak. Centrism won.Burt centrism left many people disinterested in voting and the 1990s had the lowest turnout in living memory. Republicans took the Congress after forty years out of power and it has been back and forth ever since then with Republicans holding the upper hand.In 2018, Democrats won in a landslide. It was only *after* they won that they moved significantly to the progressive side. RULE: Democrats move more toward progress after they win elections. In 2021 and 2022 with the smallest Senate majority possible, former moderate Joe Biden continued on the progressive side and managed to accomplish more progress than anyone in generations.Since then there has been some slippage back to the right--partially because there were too many people claiming to progressive attacking Democrats in deep ways that indicated Democrats would never win their votes.

Demand is so high that the home will always end up sold. If there are 2 similar houses in an area and one person jacks their price by 25k they will lose out to the person that didn't.The correct answer is that both will jack up the price by 25k so as not to lose out on free money. This argument that a homebuyers credit in an economy where home buying is down would result in a corresponding spike in prices is ludicrousIt's not; that corresponding spike in prices happens literally every time a government offers a subsidy/rebate/cashback of some sort, because every seller just adds that subsidy/rebate/cashback into their price, because _that's how capitalism works_: you cannot solve a supply problem by trying to artificially tweak demand.The only solution to high demand is, as the parent comment noted, to increase supply, and that needs to be done by the government not the private sector, so that the new supply is priced at an actually affordable level. This would make the artificially high prices demanded by private sellers untenable, and so prices as a whole would drop to that affordable level. Once the market has cooled sufficiently then the government can leave things to the private sector again.But the Democrats refused do that. Why? It's the easiest policy slam-dunk in the world and they refused to do it.

Satan (or at least bible satan; most of our mythology around the devil is not from the bible) only became seen as the evil-doer when early Christians needed an enemy and someone to blame for society's problems. The word satan essentially meant advocate for an alternative view and this is what early bible satan was establised to be. You could think of it as meaning a person who speaks out against your ideas or position (what we'd now think of as a 'devil's advocate'... someone a bit like a lawyer or prosecutor).However, even from a historical context, it makes sense to demonise those who oppose you. Early Christians trying to convince people to join their movement had to sell those not belonging to or agreeing with it as evil, and the mythology grew from there, until \\"Satan\\" essentially merged with the more outlandish characters of the late bible - the beasts and destroyers and such. The dominant Roman religion at the time was rife with villainous gods responsible for all the world's ills; blaming \\"Satan\\" for disease, poverty etc made historical sense as a way to recruit new followers.But it's also useful to reflect that bible God, especially old-testament God, often behaves like an absolute psychopath. Satan in comparison did not kill the many *millions* of innocents God killed in the bible, did not kill babies constantly like God did, he did not demand anyone sacrifice their son, didn't unleash floods and famines and diseases on people to satisfy his ego... the \\"all loving God\\" of the bible seems to have an awful lot of blood on his hands. Does claiming to be \\"all loving\\" absolve him?Satan on the other hand fought for humans to have knowledge instead of blind faith... if you look at it that way, you could characterise God as a villain. As a diety he is renowed for inflicting thousands of years worth of unimaginably horrific acts on humanity, and his whole basis for claiming to love them is essentially an ultimatum: worship me alone or burn. Does that sound particularly \\"all loving\\"? Because honestly it sounds more like an abusive relationship to me.Another thing to think about is that if you believe God is omniscient and all powerful (as the bible specifically claims), then *he alone* is solely and entirely responsible *for* both creating and enabling Satan, and for literally every single thing Satan does. The biblical God is in full control of Satan; he allows Satan to inflict evil on the world. This is a central Christian doctrine (e.g. the Catechism of the Catholic Church is an example of a major doctrine that specifically says Satan exists because God allows him to). So essentially, this circles us back to God being evil as he is at all times aware of and solely responsible for both the existence of evil and evil's actions and powers. This concept was highlighted by Epicurus (Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?)Satan is also essentially a plagiaristic re-imagining of the Prometheus myth (the majority of biblical myths and parables are just ripped off versions of ancient Greek mythology). Prometheus gifted humans knowledge and this drew the wrath of Zeus, who was angered because he wanted to keep humanity ignorant and enslaved. And Prometheus, Satan's mythological building block, was in many ways more the champion of humanity than Zeus.So... if Satan did exist, he might not be the sort of guy to look down on a people standing up for what's right.","title":"Good dems need to do more of this"},{"text":"Democrats who put any blame whatsoever on trans people deserve to be primaried.","title":"Trans People Shouldnt Be Scapegoated for Democrats Failures"},{"text":"I have also thought benzos.","title":"Kamala Harris Appears To Be \\"Drunk\\" In First Video Since Election Loss"},{"text":"Dammit, I knew we sent the mules to the wrong address!","title":"Mississippi Runoff Election Results Thread"},{"text":"Why didnt Kamala just say no to being the nominee then?","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Aides Suggest Campaign Was Just Doomed.

Rather than removing Joe Biden and inserting Trump back in, like a lot of folks thought was going to happen because the election was stolen from him, Trump instead did NOTHING. Or at least it appears that way. Because this announcement that Pelosi and Obama didn't want kamala is just one more piece of evidence that the white hats / military / Trump administration have been forcing the hand of the Democrats. Why? For one, to awaken humanity by forcing the cabal to accelerate their NWO plans so it was noticeable by EVERYBODY. And second, to embarrass the fuck out of the Democrats and the elites... And that's exactly what we've seen. Them running dementia ridden Joe Biden for a second run was hilarious and embarrassing for everybody. Then they put Kamala Harris forward, the worst candidate in history ... Who received literally zero votes, and then if that wasn't bad enough, who does Kamala Harris voluntarily choose as the vp? Tim Walz. Who's that? He's not only a weirdo evil pedophile, he's a weirdo evil pedophile that nobody's ever heard of!! So I ask you, WHY would they KEEP making these horrendously awful decisions!? Because it's not their choice! They are being forced to do these things because they do NOT have ultimate control like they used to...  This all ties into exactly what Q was saying was going to happen, and here we are... This explains all the weird anomalys over the last 4 years.

And they're also false about people both in, and out of the stereotyped group.Whether their is support for the stereotype or not is irrelevant (I'd argue that if there was no support for it, it wouldn't be a stereotype).  Applying the stereotype to an individual based upon nothing but their membership in the stereotyped group is bigotry. Now, suppose it were true (which it isn't) that Jews were five times as likely to cheat their clients. Say one in five hundred Christian bankers cheated their clients, compared to one in one hundred Jewish bankers. At that point, in this made-up fantasy situation, it'd absolutely be rational for someone to be slightly warier of a Jewish banker.Full disagree.

I was put on Wegovy (basically the same med) after I was on prednisone (by a specialist) for a while due to asthma issues. It caused significant weight gain.That, combined with natural changes for women as they age, made getting the weight off extremely challenging. It worked very well for me. I lost a significant amount of weight, and about a year later, I started getting back pain. I thought it was nothing. Wrong. I had developed kidney stones. I had no idea what was going on, and the pain was significant. My GP sent me to the urologist. I had tests and scans, and I had gallstones. They caused the kidney stones. I had to get my gallbladder removed. I was sick for months. Even after it was removed and I healed, I still couldn't process vegetables. No salad, no green beans, no fresh tomatoes. Nothing. None of the specialists could figure out why. Had more tests. No answers. I went to see my GP. He then tells me that all of my issues are side effects from the Wegovy. He said if I didn't get off it, I would likely also get pancreatitis as one of his other patients had already gone through what I had, and she was now dealing with continued stomach issues. He told me to get off the Wegovy, and I did. Within 2 weeks, my digestive system was completely back on track. I no longer had issues with food, bathroom, or  body/body aches.But, my dr also said that people gain all of their weight back, plus 20% extra if they don't stay on the medicine. Forever. He was right. I gained, and it was when I was eating between 1200-1500 calories and exercising daily (running). It was the worst thing I have ever done in regard to my health.

Polyamory can be a very self-destructive lifestyle. You'll find a large contingent of people into that lifestyle who very vocally advise people against doing it. Grooming can also occur in polyamory, where a partner is forced into accepting situations they do not wish to be in. But it is entirely situational, and you'd be hard pressed to find any type of relationship where that doesn't occur. It is not inherent to the lifestyle, it is simply some people's nature to enjoy forcing others to do things they do not want to do.  Grooming in a sexual relationship between a father and daughter, however, is inherent to the dynamic. There are possibly a few situations where you could claim total ignorance on both parties but they realistically don't happen. There is an inherent power imbalance between a father and daughter, even accounting for neither party being aware of the relationship. There would be a large disparity in ages, and there is also an inherent power imbalance in those kinds of relationships. In short, polyamory *can* be abusive or involve grooming. Any relationship can be, and we should not automatically shun polyamory *as a society.* Personal opinion is always personal and we can have our own preferences, but unless you can explain how it is always abusive or involve grooming, personal opinion should not be enough to make it criminal. Incest between a father and daughter *always* involved abuse. There are hypothetical situations where it could be made morally clear, but realistically we have good reason to stop those relationships from happening.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"The problem is people aren't going to believe your statements about inflation (even if true) when they are still spending tons at the grocery store","title":"Ilhan Omar blasts Harris-Walz campaign for courting Liz Cheney: 'Huge misstep'"},{"text":"True.

Because for how awful the Presidential results were, we actually had some important firsts in downballot races.  There are two theories I have, and I'm not sure which one matters more, but I think they both play a role.1. Some of it is indeed people filling out the Presidential race and nothing else.  Thousands of people in the swing states did literally that.  Trump put a lot of work into targeting those voters.  I know it's not possible to see a demographic breakdown of people who voted for President and nothing else, but I suspect they're very much 'vibes voters' - they don't care about the process or the issues, they just like the vibe Trump gave off.  Which...is sort of an indictment of them.2. In my 4th post in the series, I laid out how women have progressed over time to winning higher offices, and more frequently.  It's no longer unusual to have a female Governor, or Senator, for example.  But the first few candidates to run faced a ton of direct sexism, or were elected with their deceased husbands' seal of approval.  The higher the office, the longer it took for women to win it.  And now it's unremarkable for a woman to be elected Governor, but President?  Well, lots of voters still openly question whether a woman *can* be President, so I think that's worth noting.And the solution is absolutely not to shut women out from running.  It's to help people be less sexist.

We all agree buying ice cream is fine, as long as the buyer and seller both consent to the transaction. It would be wrong for either party to be forced to buy or sell a good they don't wish to buy or sell, so consent is still required even though no one has an issue with the act itself.Now take a controversial act, like abortion. A pro-life person thinks abortion is murder, and should therefore never be allowed, even if a woman wants one (e.g. consents to the abortion). A pro-choice person believes abortion is a crucial part of reproductive care, and therefore should be allowed *if the woman consents to the abortion*. Very obviously, vanishingly few people would argue in favor of abortion if the pregnant woman doesn't want one.Therefore, the logical conclusion is that consent is not the moral argument you are framing it to be. Consent is a requirement for an act to be allowable, *as long as that act is already considered allowable by the person making the claim*. The moral judgment on a given action predates the consent argument, and a judgment that the action causes harm negates any discussion of consent since the act should not be allowed in any circumstance anyways.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Executive orders/memos this late in the game will just be reversed before any of it has the time it takes to matter.

You think the Oklahoma school board putting bibles in public schools doesn't know that's a clear violation of the constitution? Of course they do, but theyre doing it anyway, knowing it's illegal and the antithesis of ehat the US was founded on because they also know SCOTUS is corrupt and may let them have it...In which case they'll come up with another illegal thing a few steps past that to test the fences once more.When you're the only one playing by the rules  one has to question if the rules even matter.

I liken it to a twist on the non-aggression axiom -ie no issues with what people do other than any act that causes legitimate damage or harm to another. Within reason, of course.You've chosen two fairly contentious examples to use, which is great. However, the only issue is that they aren't really in the same ethical realm. The justifications for outlawing incest, in both a legal and ethical sense, are numerous and rock solid. Polygamy, not to so much, and there are plenty of reasonable arguments against its illegality.Starting with the obvious one...  For starters, the risks of a child born of incest are great and widely known. Knowing that, It's unethical to risk bringing a child into the world. Beyond the cruelty, the potential for the child to become a severe burden on the state is partial justification for why it's also illegal. On a more sinister note, many incestuous relationships are the result of coercion, grooming, or straight-up rape. Given the particularly insidious nature of the kind of crime being committed within the family unit, it's completely acceptable for such a crime to face a far harsher punishment than the already heinous act they're committing. I don't think any further explanation is required on the ethical side.Polygamy, on the other hand, other than an individual potentially having a moral opposition, I fail to see why this should be considered both a crime or indeed unethical. If all members are happy being in a committed, loving, albeit slightly unusual relationship, who is anyone object? Let alone the state? Legal issues could potentially arise in areas such as divorce, child maintenance, etc, but barely more than any regular relationship. What's especially ridiculous about polygamy laws is the fact that, for example, one man is forbidden from marrying and supporting two women. However, there's nothing illegal about that same man marrying one woman and having an affair with the other. Obviously, that situation would carry harsher ethical judgement from society, and rightly so. In the first scenario, all the consenting adults involved are happy. In the second, that's often not the case. So why the double standard? There was an episode of the fantastic Australian legal dark comedy, Rake, on this particular topic - [worth a watch lol](https://youtu.be/jvYLvvWyr-Y?si=dkkrFn7Za6bXe58H)\\"These are just examples to demonstrate the selective use of this logic. One could use indentured servitude or prostitution as examples and so forth. The point is, this a common theme in todays discourse and I find it problematic. In my opinion the entire premise is a red herring used to stop further discussion over polarizing issues that require real ethical examination.\\"On your closing point, your assertions contradict the true nature of the point you're arguing against. If you're suggesting the possibility a member of a polygamous relationship is, in fact, an indentured servant, then by definition, they're not a \\"consenting adult.\\" What you would have there is a legitimate crime and a horrific act. Prostitution is a little more grey. If they're being paid an agreed rate theres no issue. If they're not, then it falls into the former category and is again not applicable to this argument.You might be right about people looking to \\"shut down any further discussion\\" or \\"avoid real ethical examination.\\" But what right do you or anyone have to be probing in the first place? The fact that you may find the actions of two consenting adults \\"problematic\\" means absolutely nothing. Your objection carries zero weight. If you suspect a serious crime is being committed, call the police. Otherwise, respect their privacy and read between the lines. Their justification was simply a polite way of telling you to mind your own business.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Broken clock is right twice a day","title":"Ilhan Omar blasts Harris-Walz campaign for courting Liz Cheney: 'Huge misstep'"},{"text":"Praise be!!!Edit: Looks like that was the end of Merced county's votes, unless there's any remaining signature cures.

However, it's important that one's reaction should be commensurate with the risk. In this made-up case, if I refused to ever work with a Jewish banker, even one with stellar reviews from a wide range of clients - that'd suggest that I wasn't *really* basing my decision on this one in one hundred statistic.Interactions with police is another example like this. Only a tiny, tiny fraction of police officers have killed civilians - but I'm *more likely* to get killed by a police officer during a traffic stop than I am by a random person I briefly meet, because they're armed and trained to kill people they think are trying to kill them. So it's reasonable to be cautious during a traffic stop. But if I start telling all my friends we should \\"defund the police\\" because police are all murderers, one might argue I've lost the plot.But why specifically men? You see a woman approaching you on a dark night and you have no concerns? She could just as easily randomly attack you.?Men commit 80% of violent crimes and almost all violent sexual assaults by strangers, so it's reasonable to be more cautious around men. Though from my arguments above, that extra caution should be commensurate with the risk. A place where I strongly agree with your overall position is the way some men get treated around children. E.g., a man watching his daughter at a park gets accused of being a child molester, because why is this man taking photos of a little girl? Or, a male kindergarten teacher gets accused of improper behavior because he hugged a student.In that case, it *is* reasonable to be slightly more cautious about men (90% of convicted childhood sexual abuse offenders are men). But there are so few child sexual abuse offenders that treating a male kindergarten teacher like a monster just for hugging a student is ludicrously unwarranted. It'd be like a cop shooting a black kid for putting his hands in his pockets, just because black people are statistically more likely to commit gun crimes. You can't treat people horribly just on the off-chance they're a bad guy.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"She certainly doesnt look well in that photo.

Opponents say it is morally wrong and harms the fabric of society, and proponents say it is a private act that should not be legislated because it is not harmful or relevant to the public interest. In that context, a proponent saying, \\"This is ok if it's between consenting adults\\" is not using consent to refute harm. They're saying no harm is done to the wider social fabric. Therefore, the only consideration is interpersonal consent.Unless I misunderstand, your argument is that the consent principle is flawed because it is used to justify some acts that could be considered harmful, but not others, and this is based on the personal tastes of the one using the consent principle. But I would argue you're doing the exact same thing. You think polygamy is harmful, so it shouldn't be allowed. But I'm sure we could find some action that you would find non-harmful as long as the participants are consenting adults - sex between non-related adults, for instance. The only difference is which acts you consider harmful, and therefore not allowable regardless of consent.Edit: Either you edited your comment or I'm tired and didn't read the bit about special pleading. To be clear, I think my point is that the consent argument rests on a previous moral judgment by the person making said argument. There is no special pleading involved, because no one thinks that consent is a blank check to commit any act without regard to harm.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Dont necessarily need to go lower, but if republicans are going to constantly make up rules/precedent, and use legal loopholes to get their way  then Dems need to get smart and throw out the establishment rule book.For example, when turtlehead Mitch McConnell came up with the whole tHe NeXt PrEsIdeNt sHoUld ApPoInT tHe NeXt SuPrEmE cOuRT jUdGe  Obama could have just stated the Senate wasnt performing their duties, bypassed them, and appointed Garland anyway.

The actual problem with the examples listed is still consent, largely in that the concept of uncoerced consent doesn't really exist in the real world, and trying to make it causes other problems. Consider porn, how the actresses are effectively being paid to consent to abuse. The thing is, this is obviously predatory to those with few other options, but can't be banned because people have a right to agree to such things. Conversely, consider organ donation. There's a constant shortage of organs and a black market of them because people are banned from selling their organs, lest the poor become forced to, while the people who reasonably can donate them are constantly guilted to. While a weird example, this is what saying people can't consent to things leads to, and is wrong on the base level of infringing on base property rights, that your body is yours to do what you want with.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"According to what standard do you determine wrongful?","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Hoping someone has more specific info, but heres what I believe is outstanding for CA-13.Merced appears to be all inMadera is all inFresno (R+12) and San Joaquin (D+7) have 300-350 votes left apiece Stanislaus (D+8) has 1200ish left.Im making any calls, but the outlook of the race certainly is very different than a half hour ago.

In the samples you give, it isnt universally accepted that prostitution, polygamy, or even incest (think of cousin marriages in several Asian counties) causes harm. Thus the problem isnt that voluntarism is unreliable; its that its always balanced against other concerns including harm and disgust (in the case of incest). If you look into moral psychology youll see lots of research on how people balance these different ethical impulses.

It's that consent justifies freedom to engage in relatively non-harmful activities. Actually, I think your example precisely points out the principle in action. You believe that polygamy causes undue harm, so consent alone shouldn't justify allowing polygamy.

BTW the whole thread that it spawned with comments by Lotsagloom touching on how people pick up and then abandon candidates based on vibes, and how candidates we are sure dont have the right vibe (Katie Hobbs was an example) still win, is worth a read. Comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/comment/lyywogl/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/comment/lyywogl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)So I thought more about this coding and vibes and stuff, and it seems that this is more a presidential thing than other positions. For instance: our Democratic freshman senators include three women, two of whom are black, and an Asian-American man (Asian American men are often coded as less masculine than other races). Jacky Rosen squeaked to her re-election in Nevada. OTOH Bob Casey who I never thought would be at risk, turned out to lose - he and Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester are all impeccably white and masculine men. Elissa Slotkin beat a man (in the race, not physically!), Jacky Rosen won her race against a combat veteran, and both Slotkin and Rosen are utterly normie moderates. They dont vibe. I remember when people were saying Jacky Rosen could never win (back in 2018) because she was boring. Well, congratulations, Senator Boring, youve won a second term! Harry Reid knew what he was doing when he picked Rosen to run for that seat. Charisma really truly isnt always a necessary thing. I also remember Katie Hobbs and how she was boring (and worse, very misogynistic stuff which I wont repeat here) compared to the sleek and glamorous Kari Lake. Who now lost her SECOND race. Competence can win out over charisma, at least in non-POTUS positions.Delaware just sent our first out trans Representative to Congress. And Sarah McBride is getting far more shit from her fellow Congresspeople (the Republicans, at least) than she is from her constituents, who gladly elected her. McBride was, by all accounts, a great state Senator, and Delaware voters knew that, and respected her ability to do her job over her gender.Soare vibes mainly a Presidential thing? Aside from losing three states that seem to have swung hard right, we had Nevada, Arizona, and Michigan go red on the EC level but elect their Democratic Senators. Is it people using the Presidency as a catch all for good vibes or bad vibes andjust not filling out the rest of the ballot? Is POTUS the one elected office where charisma does beat competence? Charisma, weirdly, seems to be regarded as a male thing in mainstream discourse - women get to have charm. It almost makes me wish that we could do what some other countries like Ireland do, and have a President whose role is ceremonial and a Prime Minister who does all the hard work. I know we cant have that.I also do not think we have to run a white man in 2028 (and yes, I think there will be elections then, stfu arrpol). I think we can and we will have a woman POTUS, maybe not in my lifetime, but its not impossible. Look at the glass ceilings being broken in the Senate and Governorships.To wrap up this teal deer, POTUS seems to me to be the ultimate vibes catcher for good or ill. Maybe the coding for POTUS is something that is exceptional to that position and not any Senator or Governor.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 26, 2024"},{"text":"Thank you ??","title":"You can tap into your endorphins, to go beyond physical pain, whenever you want with this special skill."},{"text":"Alex BATTLES Antifa Protestors at TPUSA Event!

You could go on and ask the person should consensual incest between an adult father and daughter using contraception be a crime? and the vast majority of the people pushing the consent principle will protest and go on to explain how thats different because incest causes harm for XYZ reason.The vast majority of people \\"pushing\\" the consent principle will talk about grooming and power imbalances, which are well-known, well-established concepts that directly and negatively affect one's capacity to consent. You could ask someone for example whether polygamy should be a crime, and that person could respond as long as its between consenting adults I have no problem.Again, you leave out the phrasing for, and seem to ignore the question of factors that reduce, impair, or otherwise decrease the capacity to consent. And that's a pretty big omission, given that the overwhelming majority of polygamous unions are either founded in impaired consent (child brides and weddings arranged by parents) and/or maintained by significant power imbalances. (trad-wives suffering financial and spiritual abuse)\\nThat you chose to couch this in *legal* terms (\\"should this be a crime\\") instead of ethical terms (\\"is there something unethical/immoral going on here?\\") also seems like you're putting a thumb on the scale. Murder is illegal; it's a crime and we charge people with it all the time... but we also allow *affirmative defenses* in the court of law, meaning people can admit to murder but lessen or avoid liability for circumstances like, say, self-defense.  one could use indentured servitude or prostitution as examples and so forth.Tell me you don't understand consent without telling me you don't understand consent.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Yeah, because the \\"old way\\" of doing things results in a ton of \\"cost overages\\" that is really just contractors pocketing money.","title":"Senator Cruz Warns Biden-Harris NTIA: Big Changes Ahead For Multi-Billion-Dollar Broadband Boondoggle"},{"text":"All three things Trump doesnt believe in himself","title":"How Trump won over Hispanic Catholics: appealing to faith, family and community | 2020 seemed ripe for long-overdue immigration reform, a priority for Latino communities across the country.

I can see the historical negatives of the former, and I can imagine that the latter can just be a cover for the former. But in case it is included in what you are imagining when you say polygamy, I would like to advocate for group marriage.I'm in a relationship along with two other people, one that I legally married and the other who joined us. We all love each other and contribute to each other's lives. We have sex by two's, three's and more. We share ownership of four cats. We travel internationally together. We share financial responsibilities and decisions. We have been doing this for many years. In fact, I don't even remember any time we had a significant fight (at least more than a disagreement).Altogether, we would laugh if someone said we are causing harm to each other, or that we are causing harm by normalizing dangerous relationship formats. The only thing we would (possibly) envisage changing is to get married in a happy triangle. Though, we have no real reason to do this. Maybe adopting a child and giving them the probably amazing experience of having three dads. 1.5x the varied life experience, three different native languages, more chances of household economic ability even if one of us lost a job, highly diversified expertise and knowledge, I can't think of a downside except for the possibility of bullying from people who simply do not accept it.So, if your idea of polygamy includes group marriages, I would love to hear why this could not be practiced ethically. In fact, even if it doesn't, I would love to hear why a consentual polygamous relationship could not be practiced ethically. Like, I would want to know why a wife cannot send her husband to visit his girlfriend on the weekends because she likes her alone time (and the husband and girlfriend eventually marrying for whatever reason).

Does Cruz have any idea how many hoops a service provider has to jump through to get service connected to a new territory? There's years worth of planning, and permitting, and preparation work before a single shovel goes into the ground to get backbone cable ran.Initial install of backbone either copper or fiber is the most expensive part. During this phase of the project, you physically can't have any end users connected, so the ROI is zero. But, once the backbone is in place and you can start connecting end users, the ROI reaches break-even very quickly. My bachelor's degree is in IT operations management, and this is like... Super-basic stuff that, in a corporate setting, someone in the position of IT Operations Manager would be expected to be able to explain to the CFO in order to justify why investing in an expanded network is worth the investment.If you want to build off of existing fiber, you have to develop an access sharing agreement with the owner of the existing equipment.Then, you have to do one of two things:verify that the equipment you've already obtained is compatible with the equipment that the owner of the backbone is using, or;obtain compatible equipment, which may or may not already be end-of-lifeAfter that, you still have to go through pretty much all the same local requirements to build out your network, even if you're using an existing backbone.Then, you have to coordinate with the background owner to schedule a service outage so that you can tie your own network into the backbone. And if that existing backbone supports a \\"critical\\" service, that's an entire additional set of hoops you have to jump through to coordinate the service disruption. And if you're wanting to tie into, say, Lumen (aka CenturyLink) fiber? Well, that's almost exclusively ran along railroad tracks, which means also coordinating with the appropriate rail company if your install requires a dig job.And this is why it takes 5-10 years for a fiber job to start seeing delivery to its first customers.","title":"Senator Cruz Warns Biden-Harris NTIA: Big Changes Ahead For Multi-Billion-Dollar Broadband Boondoggle"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|3S4D7MydgPdTi92WYn)","title":"Project 2029?

The daughter likely did *not* consent to this act at all.  Consent towards incest itself does not inform us of a preference to have her preferences molded; rather, prima facie we believe grooming to be a harm that no rational person would consent to.

The reason why some people get confused is because harm reduction as a principle often requires you to balance degrees of harm against each other.  For example, two consenting adults might engage in sado-masochistic play that is physically harmful, but we could argue that the greater harm would be impeding on their freedom to explore their own sexuality in the manner they choose.  This is not a violation of the harm reduction principle.With the issue of incest, we might come to the opposite conclusion, i.e. that the psychological harm of incest outweighs the harm caused by restricting the freedom of the consenting participants in incest.  This would also not be a violation of principle, even though we come to a different conclusion on whether or not to protect consent.Likewise with polygamy, we could weigh the harm of polygamy as less than the harm of restricting people's freedom to enter into whatever relationship arrangements they choose, and this would not be a contradiction of principle.","title":"CMV: I believe within ethics and politics the consent principle/voluntarism is unreliable and times fallacious."},{"text":"Fuck this ass clown.

In the example of the father/daughter, I would assume you mean a father and daughter who know eachother as such - that is to say one raised the other. In this case, there is an obvious and blatant power dynamic which makes the consent of the daughter hard to ascertain. It's the same reason that a teacher sleeping with an (of age) student is also considered problematic, as even if both parties are enthusiastically consenting one DOES have power over the other.I think that using consent as a universal green light is both not how anybody actually thinks, and also demonstrably not a rule that can be applied universally. We don't allow kids to consent to a great number of activities, even if they are enthusiastic and have been explained what it means, potential consequences etc.I am curious to know how many people have actually used this argument regarding polygamy, as polygamy is something which is practiced universally in conservative circles, who otherwise don't care about consent as a founding principle.

It was an interesting discussion in which they offered reasons why they made some of the tactical (and strategic) decisions they did. I still disagree with some of these decisions but its useful to get their reasoning.Also, Plouffe laid out the data for why the campaign (and professional Democratic campaigns more broadly) ran to the center with the Liz Cheney/Trump is a fascist stuff.He cited polling data about the ideological composition of the electorate, noting that in a state like Pennsylvania, e.g., progressives are simply outnumbered and therefore have to win moderate Republicans.The obvious rejoinder is that if they move left theyll expand the base. I wont argue that assertion one way or another, but simply reiterate to third party voters or voters who stay at home or temporarily vote for the other side to punish a party over a particular issue: all that does is make you invisible to the professional class that runs campaigns  Democratic campaigns anyway.

As a christian I can tell you first hand that is whats known as the tip of the spear hand sign or otherwise known as the eye of horus aka the eye of lucifer which they worship and believe to be their god. However lucifer isnt an angel anymore like the occult sees him as, he was casted down (and his angels who followed him which are now known as demons) from heaven to this earth after sinning against God and wanting to be like God. Since he has been casted down he is not lucifer anymore but satan which he only seeks to steal, kill and destroy anyone he can. Satan has already been defeated by Jesus Christ though and will be thrown into the lake of fire along with his angels who fell with him on that great day of judgment.
