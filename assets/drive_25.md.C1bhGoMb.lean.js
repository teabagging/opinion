America is not communist and nor are our leaders.Capitalism is a system designed to concentrate wealth. There is no way around that. Yes in the past its been good for many people, but capitalism has no answer for corporatism except more corporatism. American Capitalism cannot police it's most sacred concept, or it risks admitting that there should be limits on personal wealth. I think we can agree that just isn't gonna happen when the true powers in this world are all ultra wealthy. Why would they ever police themselves?It's not like this shift happened in a vacuum, these are capitalists making capitalistic decisions to further their own wealth collection. It's the point of the system so there functionally cannot be any controls to stop this without recognizing that we shouldn't allow one person to accrue that kind of power - which directly contradicts the American ideal of \\"freedom\\"The USA is the most capitalist country in the world, bar none, and look at where that's gotten us: Reduced social support systems (expressly not communist, by definition) and the strengthening of entrenched capitalist power (capitalism, business as usual). How can this be communist? I think you're conflating cultural shifts with economic principles, which sure all the woke stuff is meant to be more inclusive so I guess you can throw the word communist at it and force an incorrect comparison, but that is not communist because it's not an economic systemIn my opinion what you're referencing is what happens when we give individuals too much wealth, in a system designed to concentrate wealth, led by people with too much wealth. And then expect these uber wealthy individuals, who got where they're at by being selfish, to suddenly have a come to Jesus moment and treat the peons gracefully? It ain't gonna happen, ever. This was an inevitability as soon as Reagan made corporations legally people.Any system in this circumstance will lead to corruption.

But unchecked wealth &amp; capitalism has gotten us to this point where now big companies can just buy whatever &amp; whoever they want &amp; then make their own rules.

Of course it was much different, but the American public can't really handle nuance like that. And even with hindsight, even knowing Franken got taken out by a very organized Republican attack because they saw him as a potential future leader of the party, it was still probably the right call.

While the remaining districts will be more suburban in nature and are located in the major metropolitan areas, today, we are still down in the Rio Grande Valley.Like HD-80, this is a majority Hispanic district. It is the one of the southernmost districts here in Texas. It consists of Cameron and Willacy counties. It includes parts of Brownsville.While this was made redder in redistricting, it was still a Biden +2.2 district under the current boundaries. Greg Abbott did win here by 3.4 points, with Paxton and Patrick performing worse. As a whole, it votes far to the left of Texas-statewide, which elected Republicans by low single digits. Ken Paxton only carried this district by .7% over Rochelle Garza.This district is 14.1% white non-Hispanic. I imagine that the aforementioned 14.1% is a high turnout group that can swing elections, as turnout is quite low down here. I believe that it only had 39% turnout.The incumbent is Republican, Janie Lopez. She won by 3.6 percentage points. How much of that was white non-Hispanic voters voting a straight Republican ticket, I couldnt tell you. Unlike HD-80 where the GOP nominated Don McLaughlin, Republicans did nominate a Latina Republican and at least tried to broaden their coalition.Theres not a lot I can attack Janie Lopez on, other than being a Republican. Shes pretty much a backbencher that votes with the GOP agenda. She doesnt make much noise. She did vote to impeach Ken Paxton, and I believe she supports Dade Phelans legislative priorities.However, she also supports some policies that dont really align with the needs of her district. She will not take a firm stand on Medicaid expansion, which her district desperately needs.She supports Greg Abbotts voucher scam, and in-turn, he supports her. It really seems to be the only thing he cares about nowadays.She coauthored House Bill 7, a border enforcement bill that would encourage racial profiling.While she is far from the worst Republican in the legislature, this district deserves better. And we have a great nominee on our side. She really never should have been elected in a narrow Biden district. You can't really blame gerrymandering for us losing this seat. This one falls on us.Jonathan Gracia is our nominee. He has held elected office before, as a former Cameron County Justice of the Peace. Before that, he served as an Assistant District Attorney, also for Cameron County.

It very efficiently weakens one of USA's main geopolitical rivals with minimal monetary cost and no American troops lost. Indeed, much of the aid has been just about giving Ukraine equipment that is going out of date and would have to be decommissioned soon. Any aid from new production isn't sacks of money sent to Ukraine, the money stays in USA and is spent on domestic military manufacturing, and acts like an economic stimulus. It will do far more to advance America's interests when actively used in Ukraine instead of passively sitting for decades in a warehouse somewhere.2. It lessens USA's need to spend on military spending related to Europe, allowing it to spend less on its military (at least in theory, if USA would ever do that) or focus its forces towards countering China.3. It shows that USA's commitment to ideals like democracy and self-determination are not just words but something many Americans genuinely believe in and will actively defend, and encourages other freedom-aligned movements around the world. It shows them that seeking to align with the West and its values comes with benefits and is something that a country will be aided in if threatened.4. It reassures USA's allies that USA will be there to help if something happens.5. It discourages other authoritarian regimes around the world eyeing to attack their neighbours or start conflicts, if they know that USA will aid the target of the aggression.6. It is the right thing to do. Defending a peaceful democratic nation, even a country as imperfect and troubled as Ukraine, against a brutal, unprovoked invasion by an authoritarian regime, is simply the objectively morally correct thing to do.There is literally no even remotely good reason for why USA shouldn't keep helping Ukraine. USA spent decades pouring trillions of dollars into countries like Afghanistan with hesitant populations who didn't really want Americans there, and who were not willing to fight for democracy or other western ideals or even for the sake of their own country, and where USA barely had anything to gain even in the most cynical geopolitical terms. Why would USA give up so soon and spend so little on Ukraine, a country willing to fight for it all, where USA has extremely clear interests, where the people are actively asking for American help?","title":"Discussion Thread: Vice President Harris Delivers Remarks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy"},{"text":"I thought he was briefly a Republican while in the state legislature.","title":"Redditors blame Republicans for Democratic NYC mayor Eric Adams being indicted on corruption charges.

And my answer is \\"no, probably not in the way you are thinking.\\"  it is human nature to be ignorant. i guess my point is where and how do people learn abt this?I am not sure I understand your question, could you rephrase?  My answer right now is \\"where and how does anyone learn about anything?  it depends, right?\\".i tried talking abt this with a couple of friends but they thought this was stupid and crazy. i need some type of clarity or resources to just learn abt this'this' is incredibly broad.  it seems like what you are asking for is to know about the truth.  and that simply takes a genuine desire to learn about the truth.  but it also takes time, and it takes pushing yourself and your character, because the truth takes sacrifice - you have to sacrifice your own ego to be able to let go of false reality.  in terms of actual resources in terms of information and knowledge, I would say read past threads on r/conspiracy, and learn accurate knowledge about the world - in every way possible(ie science, psychology, history, spirituality, etc).  And learn how to discern what is accurate or not.  And learn how to spot deception.It's a lonely journey with little immediate reward and thus requires a faith that the truth does matter in the end.\\nI'll end this post with a piece of advice about learning the truth in this world:  never trust anything blindly regardless of where it comes from.

Trump held up Ukraine funding in 2019 because he was nervous about losing re-election to Joe Biden and wanted to get any dirt he could against him. The easiest method to do so was through his son Hunter who had corrupt business dealings in Ukraine with an energy company called Burisma. Trump met with Zelenskyy and tried to condition military aid for dirt on Hunter Biden. When Reagan blundered on foreign policy it was at least done so with the best interests of America in mind, when Trump blundered on foreign policy (and even when he suceeded) it was always to benefit himself.

North Korea is still going, they have a huge ass army while their population is always seemingly on the brinck of starvation.The other factor can also be that Russia will focus more on exporting entropy everywhere, by providng weapons to all bad actors across the world and go back to proxy wars again to maintain markets for their war economy.Modern Russia has a fraction of the population and economy of the USSR.Yes, but they are also closely and increasingly allying with China, that has a bigger economy than the soviet union ever had.","title":"Discussion Thread: Vice President Harris Delivers Remarks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy"},{"text":"I remain shocked he didnt actually say Offense, Defense and Special Teams.","title":"Tommy Tuberville: First-ever AI presidential candidate Kamala Harris should drop out"},{"text":"Lets remember the alternative is Trump and he is more pro Israel so whats the plan??

In all seriousness, the trend towards urbanisation and consolidation of metropolitan areas means that a more populated Greater Madrid makes sense, especially since it's located in flat terrain and can therefore spread for hundreds of kilometers without any obstacles. I have family members living in a sleeper town in Madrid and when I visited them I was impressed by the large plots that have already been cleared for future construction work, so the plans and infrastructure for future expansion are clearly already there. I looked up these sleeper towns in street view and saw how when the first street view pictures were taken in 2008 the towns were basically just a couple of houses and meadows.Having said that, it's true that there's way too much media emphasis in Madrid. As a basque I often find it funny how Spanish media reports on what's going on in the Basque Country, and I assume it's similar for other Spanish regions.My biggest concern is that, as you stated, Madrid is by this point Ayuso's playground and as the region expands it will become more politically powerful, in turn making Ayuso more influential.

Those items are trust funds. They should be independent of any budget. When there isnt enough money, then thats the end. No more raiding SS trust fund to pay for things. Then, they need a soft cap on government spending. Say 18% of GDP, in line with the historical average. But with room in times of war and emergency. Then the allocators in Congress work on funding those programs within the confines of the soft cap. Any money above the 18% spending cap should require a two thirds majority every year to fund those projects.?Once, we have a spending cap in place, then we can work on tackling the national debt to bring it into a more reasonable level. But you cant ask people to sacrifice for the future good of America when we see how the political donors are fleecing the American taxpayers. I know no one likes to pay taxes, but I think people would voluntarily pay more if they knew it was going to tackle the national debt. I would accept a 1% national sales tax or increase gas tax if it were going to pay the national debt.??I would also do away with every single non-profit tax exemption even churches. Non profits represent almost $3.3t in untaxed income. We could add almost $50b in tax revenue by just removing tax exemption for hospitals. That would fill a lot of the gap between spending and revenues but there are a lot of downsides. So, it would need to be paired with a spending limit.I would also nibble around the edges of our current tax policy. ?Probably lower the limit of exemption for house sales, cut the low income housing tax credit in half, limit on the step up basis at death, do away with 1031 exchanges, employee reimbursement parking taxable, remove deduction for donations to higher education, tax interest on hospital bonds, ?tax private activity bonds,?","title":"Why Do People Loves Taxes Now?"},{"text":"fixed","title":"Biden announces $8 billion in military aid for Ukraine"},{"text":"Democrats and Republicans can come together on this one.

Mass shootings are big news and absolutely horrific, but they are also INCREDIBLY rare in a country with something like 340 million people.It's just politics and fear ramped up to 11 on both sides to distract from the fact that what really needs to be addressed are pistols, and mental health (normal pistols not hastily modified automatic one that are allready extremely illegal) pistols are overwhelmingly used in both suicide (2/3 of all gun deaths every year) and murder (the other 1/3), all crimes committed with long guns (all rifles and shotguns) is 1 to 3 percent depending on the year.The problem is that solutions to these actual problems are difficult, expensive, and politically unpopular(in a few ways on both sides).  Going after \\"assault weapons\\" and defending them or, at least appearing to, isn't.Make people afraid, and they won't think clearly. Fox News is this writ large, but the left is doing the same thing with this issue.  Is all this time energy and money truly being best spent on an issue that takes less than 200 lives a year?  In the face of a whole lot of much more serious problems, I really don't think so.","title":"Biden to sign Glock switch executive order after Birminghams 5 Points South mass shooting"},{"text":"After this war is over, russia will recouperate for 5 years and then find another country to invade.

Weve gone from people defending Bush in the late 2000's to actively having their very own good reasons to despise him (outside of the reasons democrats did in the early 2000's). Bush is seen as a political enemy the same as Obama or Harris or any other establishment dickhead. The party and their goals are far more closely aligned to the base's desires than to what the republican politicians told them they should want in the past. For instance - Bush started the GWOT. It was a complete failure that cost trillions and lost lives unnecessarily. However, his family/friends got rich from it and never faced any consequences. Also, Bush oversaw our personal liberties get absolutely obliterated with the growth of Intel agencies. domestic spying, DHS, TSA, Police force militarization, and the rest. Basically, he fucked us AFTER he lied to all of us.  Don't forget No Child Left Behind which was a disaster for education. Bush and the people who consider themselves \\"Old School Republicans\\" are actually the current enemy of the party.Things that would be supported by those who are on the side of Bush/Mccain/Romney and are less in line with Trumps brand of politics were supporting things like this - \\"Path to citizenship\\", Regime change, supporting the same in Libya and Syria, Aiding the Military Industrial complex with these initiatives, being very liberal on social issues like gay rights and w/e else, they support globalism ALOT and do not favor any kind of populism or nationalism (America First).  All of the former prominent Republicans are not supporters of Trump politics. People Like - John Bolton, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnel, Liz Cheney, Larry Hogan, etc...However, The majority of Trump supporters, which are people who voted republican in 200/2004/2008/2012 but were unsatisfied/furious with the party support things like - Anti any immigration, deportation, isolationism (no new wars), Protectionist trade policies, no compromising w/ democrats (we always lose), Fuck Free Trade, fuck globalism, and environmental climate change bullshit, Fuck Fox News and the media in general, and institutions that pander to left wing ideals such as colleges and big business.

Theyre not taking away anything. \\nIn fact, conservatives would argue that the left seeks to take away *their* rights, along with their way of life.Based on your reply, which only proves my point, I can already anticipate the threat to democracy line, the ignorant references to Roe V. Wade (which non-Americans seem to understand far better than most Americans do), white supremacy fear-mongering, Proud Boys nonsense, the Russia conspiracy theories Its all so predictable, how can you not see what your media is doing? Theyve convinced you to despise half of your own country, and on the basis of what? Hysterical lies and political propaganda?The big, bad conservatives youve been taught to hate are everyday people who wish to live in peace. They want to be able to feed their families, have the opportunity to own a home, fill their cars with petrol, have a say in their childrens education, be able to practice their religion freely, and uphold their perfectly normal and reasonable values without imposition.In both of our countries, most people are seriously struggling due to the cost of living. We both have federal governments that have imploded our respective economies, making it nearly impossible for millions of working-class and middle-class people fo get by. Worst of all, both of our federal governments consist of incompetent elitists, who pretend to give a damn about the struggles of everyday people to collect votes, only to do absolutely nothing to fix the economic disaster they created.Home ownership has become a pipe dream for almost everyone without wealthy parents. Financially responsible, working people are having to skip meals, forgo refilling vital medication scripts every month, and not use their air conditioning/heating just to survive.Millions of taxpayers dollars (or *billions*, for the US) are being funnelled overseas, when our own people are struggling with no end in sight.In Australia, we have a domestic violence epidemic. Both of our countries have a serious drug epidemic. Crime is out of control and nothing is being done about it. People are unable to find jobs or adequate housing. Our federal governments havent just enabled these crises, theyve taken steps to make them exponentially*worse*.These are just a few examples of the distress people are experiencing because of current left-wing federal governments. The Biden-Harris administration has been abysmal, theyve accomplished nothing positive in nearly 4 years and have increased the suffering of everyday Americans with their terrible policies that pander to the out of touch elite and screw over everyday people.The latest idiotic display put on by Kamala Harris and Oprah was a glaring display of the modern-day Democratic Partys elitist rhetoric. She refused to answer any questions on policy, instead lapping up praise from clueless Hollywood megastars, who have tens of millions of dollars, private security teams, live in gated communities, have the opportunity to send their children to private schools, and arent personally affected by the dangerous policies of the current administration.Again, this administration has had almost 4 years to improve the lives of the American people, but have failed to do anything positive. I can absolutely see why people would vote for Donald Trump. No, not because theyre racists (which is a ridiculous red herring), but because hes clear on policy, doesnt wish to start any wars (and vows to help end the current ones), is out speaking directly to everyday Americans at rallies (not being gushed over by Oprah and other Hollywood A-listers), has a practical plan to rectify the economic crisis (and a track record of creating economic prosperity), doesnt push agendas that serve only the elite, can answer questions in a genuine way (not in a rehearsed, word salad manner) the list goes on.If you cant understand why everyday people are turning away from the Democrats in favour of the Republicans, I honestly dont know what else to say to you.

The only election she has to win to get there is the election of her fellow Democratic senators.And I think she could be a good leader in that role. She has a proven record of putting together solid legislation, and even working with Republicans sometimes to increase the chances of a worthy bill getting passed.

The portfolio of selected projects, once fully contracted, are projected to support over 8,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 operating jobs. Batteries are critical to strengthening the U.S. grid, powering American homes and businesses, and supporting the electrification of the transportation sector. Administered by DOEs Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), the selected projects will retrofit, expand, and build new domestic facilities for battery-grade processed critical minerals, battery components, battery manufacturing, and recycling. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the private sector has made a historic $120 billion investment in the EV supply chain and this program is integral to the Presidents clean energy industrial strategy to bolster a domestic supply chain that enhances Americas energy security and economic competitiveness.  \\n...*Boosting a Domestic Battery Supply Chain*Through grants and loans, DOE is developing a diversified portfolio of projects that help deliver a durable and secure battery manufacturing supply chain for the American people. Through MESC, the Investing in America agenda will generate $16 billion in total investment for battery manufacturing and recycling through the Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Program. Using market, economic and supply chain security-related technical analysis, MESC collaborates with experts to identify gaps and growth opportunities across the nation's energy supply chains, from raw materials to processing and manufacturing. These analyses inform investment and program implementation. Todays announcement of round two selections builds on this progress and aims to further address existing and future supply chain challenges. The selected projects span strategic segments across the supply chain, building and expanding commercial-scale facilities to extract and recycle critical minerals including lithium, graphite, and manganese, as well as manufacture components. These components represent the most essential building blocks of the battery supply chain, like electrolyte salts, solid state electrolytes, polymers for separators, cathode and anode materials, that are critical to onshore a robust and reliable energy supply chain. The selected projects also cover traditional and next-generation lithium-ion chemistries, as well as non-lithium-ion technologies, to ensure that the U.S. has a diverse portfolio of domestic battery technologies that can strengthen our overall energy security.  \\n...*Creating Good-Paying Jobs Across the U.S. Battery Sector*Of the 25 projects selected, more than half have committed to or already have signed a Project Labor Agreement commitment and 10 have an agreement with labor or a neutrality pledge. Union partners represented across selected projects include NABTU (North Americas Building Trades Unions), Boilermakers, SMART International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART), Carpenters, Operating Engineers, UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers International Union), IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) and the UA (United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada).   Nearly 90% of selectees are located in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities, advancing President Bidens Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments in climate, clean energy, clean transportation, and other areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  \\n...&amp;nbsp;Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:Were in the midst of a manufacturing revival in the United States as the Biden-Harris Administrations Investing in America agenda continues to breathe new life into communities and local economies across the country, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. By positioning the U.S. at the forefront of advanced battery manufacturing, we are creating high-paying jobs and strengthening our global economic leadership and domestic energy security, all while supporting the clean energy transition.Statement from John Podesta, Senior Advisor to President Biden for International Climate Policy:The Biden-Harris administration is using every available tool to onshore and friend-shore the supply chain for EVs and batteries, working with our allies and partners, for the benefit of our national security, our economy, and our planet, said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to President Biden for International Climate Policy. Todays battery manufacturing grants from DOE will boost Americas manufacturing base, create good-paying union jobs all over the country, and help tackle the climate crisis.Statement from White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi:Since Day One of this Administration, President Biden and Vice President Harris have acknowledged that taking action on climate change and rebuilding our domestic manufacturing capacity are mutually reinforcing goals. Nowhere is that more true than in the supply chain for a clean energy economywhether thats batteries for electric vehicles, energy storage, or a range of other applications, said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. Todays game-changing announcement is helping support the technologies that we need in the market today, the components that we will need in the near future, and the innovative technologies we need to advance our vision for a circular domestic battery supply chain that positions the United States to continue leading the global effort on clean energy.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Over $3 Billion to Support America's Battery Manufacturing Sector, Create Over 12,000 Jobs, and Enhance National Security"},{"text":"thanks","title":"A Neoliberal Case Study on the Valar and Elves: Protectionism, Ethnostates, and the Stifling of Free Trade in Middle-Earth"},{"text":"Its wild how no matter what happens, there's always a conspiracy theory ready to explain it away; seems like some people can't accept reality.","title":"MAGA Is Already Spinning Wild Conspiracies on Eric Adamss Indictment: The Democratic New York City mayor has been indicted in a federal corruption investigationand still, somehow, MAGA has a conspiracy theory to explain it."},{"text":"Yes, he plays Virgil Earp.","title":"\\"Are we really going back down that same fing broken road?

However, it bears on this discussion, so I'll reproduce it here.Out of curiosity, I downloaded and plotted the month-by-month voter registration data for my state (Colorado) from the CO Secretary of State office, for the period of 1/1/2009 through 9/1/2024, just to see what the trend lines might show me. I plotted only dem, rep, and unaffiliated, leaving out the various minor parties like the Greens and the Libertarians (7 in all).The graph is linked below, at the bottom of this comment. It turned out to be somewhat more amusing than I'd expected. You can see the semi-annual voter roll reductions, where by law the rolls are reduced after certain elections to remove people who have not voted within some period of time (I believe that it is in the past 3 elections, here in CO). You can also see very plainly the point at which purple Colorado turned more blue than red, in early 2016 (and largely thanks to Bernie Sanders, who swept in a large number of previously-unregistered voters).But by far the most compelling number is the number of people registered as \\"unaffiliated\\", the local version of no-party-preference. The dems have added perhaps 90k voters to their registered rolls over the entire period 2009-2024, but they are off significantly from their high-water mark in 2020-2021. The republicans are actually *fewer in number* today (by about 35k) than they were in 2009, which surprised me. My conjecture is that the reductions in both the uniparty's numbers are due to the introduction of open primaries.But by far the biggest growth has been in unaffiliated voters. There are 1.2 *million* **more** unaffiliated voters now than in 2009. For all the state's dramatic population growth, the voter registration stats would lead one to believe that they have essentially all fallen into the unaffiliated camp. 1/1/2009: dem 1,061,543; rep 1,066,680; uaf 1,069,750.   \\n9/1/2024: dem 1,152,623; rep 1,028,367; uaf 2,268,657.Current total registered voter count was  3,217,803 in 2009, and is now 4,544,238, just for comparison.This was an interesting exercise. I make no electoral predictions based upon it: it will all be down to turnout, as always. And, of course, to the depths to which the various parties will stoop in order to do their usual and customary election \\"adjustments\\", via their control of the various county and state offices. But I'd have to say that things might well be wide open here, as far as voter registrations can tell us: unaffiliated voters like me could do just about *anything*, couldn't they? This indicates to me that there are many more like me, people who want nothing whatsoever to do with the uniparty. This is another reason that I'll happily be voting Stein this cycle. And I think a lot of the disaffected, unaffiliated voters might just join in.The effort involved in this exercise is trivial. Those of you in other states should give it a try. You might find it surprisingly informative.https://ibb.co/SKJr6N7","title":"Americans should vote for third parties"},{"text":"Scott Jennings must live in the building.","title":"Nancy Pelosi Snaps After CNN Airs Nonsensical Trump Smear of Harris"},{"text":"I doubt it'll be blue for the presidency, Texas suppresses the vote way too hard, there would need to be a larger margin to overcome it.

I admit being concerned about that sort of thing myself, much as I wish it didn't even warrant consideration. Once the nomination was done, those sorts of worries took a back seat to our excitement for the future. If there was no other option, then you just had to decide whether you supported Harris (or Trump), not Harris or Biden, or Warren, or Sanders, or Booker, or whoever else might have thrown their hat in the ring.Had Biden stepped down early, we might have had an ugly primary season that could have left Harris wounded by the left, or even given us an entirely different nominee (which could be good or bad, but I think Harris was right for the moment).

I slightly disagree with you, the change we're seeing is I feel enough feminist and progressive men are pushing back against that disconnect. They're saying \\"men do belong in these spaces and fighting these causes, we're not the enemy because of our gender. We belong because of who we choose to be and are tired of being pushed out because of what we are.\\" The manosphere doesn't want positive masculinity, but if more feminist spaces live up to the ideals they so proudly claim to champion, welcoming men in the fight against toxic masculinity without attacking them, we will absolutely see people flocking to our cause. I say this because boy howdy does \\"obviously I didn't mean all men are rapists when I say men are rapists, you should know who I'm talking about, and I'm going to point at your discomfort as proof of the validity of my stance!\\" does *wonders* in turning down enthusiasm. That's the reaction we get historically pushing back against misandry in feminist spaces, something that shouldn't be tolerated as per the values we claim to uphold. Well at least if you're a man, you're just called a \\"pick me bitch\\" if you're a woman saying it. .Edit: tldr, Really all I'm saying is \\"hey if the end goal is an egalitarian Eden, how does frequently attacking the people who stand right next to you for not being comfortable with your hateful and hurtful rhetoric help the cause?\\". I'm hopeful we're starting to see the change but I really think it's a reckoning within modern feminism that will see it through. It's not about coddling toxic men in feminist groups, it's simply about recognizing the men who are in the fight with you and to stop treating them akin to the men whose actions you both hate.","title":"Be a man and vote for a woman: Kamala Harriss unlikely edge in Americas masculinity election"},{"text":"Its gonna be a tough race, but with the DSCC backing Allred, it shows theyre serious about challenging Cruz.

Ok let me break this one down.The agency that has responsibility for firearm related enforcement and firearm crime,  is the ATF. They have access to all FBI data on the course of their work. The FBI and every law enforcement office nation wide also already uses them directly to trace firearms as part of their mission. Interagency operation and FBI website take downs as part of ATF operations already happens, often. None of this changes with the executive order.No funding allocation changes are made via the order as that is congressional spending decision mandated. This is one of those things that is akin to saying, we are creating a group of people to investigate how to make pancakes. America cant punish sellers in other nations, just seize US domains for websites. They spin up new web sites or new accounts on existing platforms. Congress would have to pass legislation to fund anything that changes interoperability, but no interoperability issues are preventing enforcement in the first place. You simply cant enforce thought crime, which is all that exists before you physically print the plate on your 3D printer. Its already a highly illegal felony to possess one, the same as any illegal machine gun. So thats obviously not a deterrent. We already know the death penalty doesnt deter crime, so making that harsher wont help. There are a litany of problems in the world where improving how the government functions would help solve the problem.

I have resigned myself to no longer vote at all, whatsoever. I think that at this point in history, the institution is utterly and completely corrupted such that it cannot be resuscitated. Our only hope would be to tear down the current system and rebuild a better one in its place. There are no in-system avenues that result in the dissolution of the system, meaning we cannot solve these problems by coloring within the lines.I see the third party apparatus much like I see Bernie or AOC--it's all just controlled opposition. This happens every election cycle. Some upstart firebrand politician starts echoing the people's grievances back to them in their own language such that they feel heard. They even go in depth and analyze the problem fairly comprehensively delivering a level of scrutiny that is curiously absent when it comes times to addressing solutions to these problems. Sometimes they have some banner legislation they've written for this one issue (e.g. Bernie's M4A bill), but by and large their \\"solutions\\" are nebulous and rooted in, essentially, \\"Trust me, bro.\\"And every one of these campaigns will inevitably conclude with the candidate conceding to and endorsing the major party, establishment candidate. Bernie endorsed Hillary despite the Panetta emails proving she'd rigged the primaries against him. He was practically endorsing Joe Biden *before he'd even ended his campaign* in 2020. RFK endorsed Trump. AOC turned into a swamp creature, she'll have transformed into Nancy Pelosi, Walter White style, before her career ends. Marianne Williamson and Cornel West will inevitably endorse Kamala. Vivek was all to eager to endorse Trump.And then the candidate that doesn't? They're tolerated because they help sell the illusion that the election is real and that the people just prefer the status quo to \\"radicalism.\\" And even then, these actors are not serious. Look at Jill Stein's recent [letter condemning war criminals](https://x.com/DrJillStein/status/1836902886535492091)--her glibness in putting Assad and Putin next to Netanyahu and Dick Cheney reveals a deep lack of seriousness and a willingness to parrot DNC/CIA narratives and talking points. Howie Hawkins, who ran Green in 2020, was a full on Russiagater. These people are clowns. They're here to entertain and distract us. **It's a fake resistance that sucks the oxygen out of the room so a true resistance cannot take root.**And then all that aside, I just don't see voting as an effective mechanism for change.One day I asked myself, \\"If voting is not effective at its stated purpose (something about the will of the people being represented in legislative government via representatives doing what the people demand in order to stay in office)--if it doesn't really work the way we're supposed to believe it does, what does it *actually* do?\\"And I thought about it and it occurs to me that what voting *actually* does, regardless of which party you vote for-- engaging the system *at all* indicates belief in the system. When you vote, you're expressing the belief that it can still work to your benefit.I mean, deep down, we all ought to know by now that it just can't. We're so fucking deep in the shit of \\"lesser evil\\" or \\"harm prevention\\" voting that we ought to be able to just admit that the entire institution is utterly corrupted. If you can't vote *for* something, if you can only vote *against* something--is it really at all meaningful? I mean, we call this democracy? Seriously? I just--there's too much cognitive dissonance here.But you wouldn't vote if you didn't believe it mattered. So when you vote, you signal to the powers that be that you still believe that vote matters--you signal to the powers that be that their propaganda is working and that they can stay the course and continue doing all the reprehensible acts of empire with your tax dollars and in your name, against your children's futures and their quality of life.I think the act of voting signals that your consent has been successfully manufactured. Who or what you vote for is immaterial.We need a different strategy.

He started life by having his father give him money.  Fred opened a $250K bank account in Trump's name when he was 3 months old.  Fred added $300K to it when Trump turned 3.  In 1976, Fred opened eight $1M trust fund accounts.  One for each of the 5 kids and 3 grandchildren.  Trump benefitted from 3 of those funds.Fred, along with the Hyatt hotel chain, jointly guaranteed the $70 million construction loan from Manufacturers Hanover bank, each assuming a 50 percent share of the obligation and each committing itself to complete the project should Trump be unable to finish it.  In 1985, books showed that Trump owed Fred $14M with 12% interest.  That was never paid back to Fred. I guess that's where Trump learned not to pay his bills.As Trumps casinos ran into trouble, Trumps father also purchased $3.5 million gaming chips but did not use them, so the casino would have enough cash to make payments on its mortgage.  The transaction that the casino authorities later said was an illegal loan. Trump started to claim bankruptcy after this.Trumps Taj Mahal opened in April 1990.  6 months later, he defaulted on the interest payments to bond holders.  So, he screwed the bond holders out of their money.  Then, in July 1991, the Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy.  It was in business 1 year 3 months before he ran it into the ground.  His other two casinos, along with his Plaza Hotel, filed bankruptcy in 1992. Two more properties have claimed bankruptcy since then for a total of 6.  Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 BILLION in debt.?This is the so-called 'man' that the clown cult members think is an outstanding businessman.  I wouldn't let him run a lemonade stand.  He is nothing but a lying, bullying grifter that's out to screw everyone.Added later:  I forgot to say that Trump tells everyone that he \\"borrowed\\" only $1M from Fred to build his \\"empire \\".  What a load of horseshit!  The douchebag has been a grifter all his life.","title":"Kamala Harris Fries Donald Trump When Asked About His McDonald's Truther Stance"},{"text":"Eh, I prefer to be confident in the possibility of change.

As a result I am able to look at the numbers under Trump and the context they should be placed in and meaningfully compare those numbers with their contacts to Biden's.  When you do that it becomes clear that Trump's economy was nominal.  For example GDP did not rise above 3%. The reason that uninformed people think that the economy was better under Trump is because they are not looking at numbers and they are not situating things in context they are just parroting the bad vibes that they have been told to parrot.It absolutely drives me insane that people cannot do the basic amount of work that I did when I realized that I would be a hypocrite if I didn't actually inform myself.","title":"Kamala Harris likely to win election, despite Trump being better on inflation, economy: CNBC CFO survey"},{"text":"Bump stocks and Glock switches are not the same.

It's not like Apple has a captive market or anything like a monopoly in Europe.  From your own post, it sounds like the smartphone market is actually quite competitive, maybe moreso even than in North America, so if Apple is able to successfully sell their products at premium prices, and doesn't lose market share as a result, it is only because the market demand *genuinely* exists for them to do so.It's not that consumers don't have other options for smartphones, they are actively choosing to pay more to purchase Apple products.  To act like consumers are somehow uninformed when making this purchasing decision is, frankly, insulting to the entire population of Europe.  People are *knowingly* paying a premium price for Apple phones because they feel that they are paying for a premium product.It's not the government's role to dictate the \\"appropriate\\" selling price of a product.  Their only role should be to ensure that companies aren't taking unfair advantage of a monopoly position or a captive market.  Apple is not doing that here, they're participating in a competitive open market (moreso than the US, it seems, where they have a fairly dominant 55%+ market share), and consumers have many other options if they don't feel that Apple is offering fair value.","title":"CMV: Consumers in EU need to step up and boycott iPhones"},{"text":"She gets it and gets us Dump never has had to put his nose to the grind like the average American has.

Different types of these compounds are stacked in thin layers like stairs, and the heat gives the electrons or holes enough energy to jump up to the next step.After much trial and error of different compound combinations, the team settled on a device with a 180-nanometer layer of copper phthhalocyanine, 320 nm of copper hexadecafluoro phthalocyanine, 20 nm of fullerene, and 20 nm of bathocuproine.\\n(...)\\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52047-5\\n(...)In the CuPc/F16CuPc device, the HOMO (?5.0?eV) of the CuPc layer and the LUMO (?4.8?eV) of the F16CuPc layer are close together and form a CT state at the interface19,20. Therefore, the CT state generated at the junction interface of the CuPc/F16CuPc layers can be charge-separated by an external electric field (i.e., carrier generation occurs at the CT interface), allowing holes to move through the donor layer and electrons to move through the acceptor layer, and resulting in the current observed in the external circuit ()15. This indicates that the CT states at the CuPc/F16CuPc layer interface are capable of inducing high levels of charge generation at low energies. Additionally, we should note that CuPc and F16CuPc are used frequently in OSCs and organic field-effect transistors21,22. Because these materials essentially have crystalline textures and form microcrystalline aggregates in their thin films, their relatively strong intermolecular van der Waals forces and the resulting dense intermolecular packing are believed to allow relatively easy charge carrier diffusion. Based on these unique JCV properties in the CuPc/F16CuPc device, the combination of CuPc and F16CuPc suggested that charge separation using low thermal energy is feasible.\\nThermoelectric properties of a model element using CuPc/F16CuPcFollowing the JCV experiment, the thermoelectric properties of ITO (100?nm)/CuPc (30?nm)/F16CuPc (70?nm)/Al (100?nm) structures were evaluated. The experiments were conducted at room temperature (~20?C) in the dark, and the JCV characteristics were measured before and after atmospheric exposure to ascertain the effects of the atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. S1). After device fabrication, the devices were encapsulated using UV-curing resin in a glove box. When a small hole was made in the encapsulation and the device was exposed to air, its electrical characteristics decreased significantly; the reverse bias current density decreased by an order of magnitude, and the forward bias current density decreased by more than two digits. However, although the device current density was reduced by exposure to air, detailed measurement of the JCV characteristics under application of a more precise step voltage of 0.2?mV confirmed the presence of a very small electromotive force (EMF),(...)","title":"\\"organic thermoelectric device having a new power generation mechanism that extracts small-scale thermal energy, i.e., a few tens of millielectronvolts, at room temperature\\""},{"text":"Biden was and is no longer mentally able to do that.

I want to understand the model you are proposing to say this will be a next bad for society as a whole. Even if tax incidence on the consumer is 100% it wouldnt be a net bad for consumer welfare. If you are making a leaky bucket argument, then actually make that argument instead of just vibing and saying that lol prices are going to go up people are boned. Residents will also have increased purchasing power and likely will get back more than Oregonians put in due to tourist purchases. Will lots of people complain when it happens because all prices will go up? Sure. Will it hurt richer people more than poorer people? Yes. But that is probably the point.I think its a dumb policy. People will be upset about the inflation even when they do have increased purchasing power because peoples brains are weird. It will likely decrease travel to the state. It will probably be inefficient because our public sector is forced to jump through way more hoops to do anything than the private sector and that will probably hurt consumers. But you cant just look at this policy and say that it is poorly thought out without saying what explicit assumptions you are making because from a classical econ standpoint it isnt exceedingly dumb.","title":"Oregon voters to decide on ballot measure to give every resident $1,600 that has sparked massive opposition fundraising"},{"text":"a real who's-who of pundit dipshits","title":"Remember when Eric Adams was touted as the future of the Democratic Party?"},{"text":"https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/07/11/business/huma-abedin-alex-soros-engagement","title":"Democrats love activist billionaires."},{"text":"What does this even mean?
