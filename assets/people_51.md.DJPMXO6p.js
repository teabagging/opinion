At less than 1% polling in 2020, it was blatantly apparent that she's unappealing to the majority of Americans, and her entire platform was either \\"I HATE TRUMP, HE'S EVIL!!!\\" or \\"Well, I'm going to give out some free money.\\" In the end, that just wasn't enough.

I don't want people in camps.If we come to find out that Latino people were a key part of Trump's victory there will naturally be a desire to tell them they fucked around and are going to find out.But if our response to people being mass deported is to shrug then the fascists win. To the extent it turns out to be true that Latino people voted against their own interests we should forgive them and show concern for their well-being.  If the worst case comes to pass and Latino communities are getting ripped apart and people are being crowded into camps and sent to countries they haven't been in or over a decade they will already be punished. We need to recommit to our principles and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of those principles. When people are suffering and atrocities are being committed we will be there working to fight and resist it and we will earn the commitment that has been lost.","title":"Democrats feel 2016 all over again in Harris-Trump battle"},{"text":"the r // pics post spams","title":"Trump defeats Harris to become the 47th POTUSA!!!"},{"text":"Exactly","title":"Republicans sweep with Presidency, Senate &amp; House majority, and popular vote wins"},{"text":"WI is done, hes 277.

The states failure to take care of the poor turned into a harshness toward them.  \\n    2) Without a serious commitment to social welfare and redistributionist schemes, liberalism itself drifted into the world of far-right policies. These include increased spending on the internal repressive apparatus that polices working-class neighbourhoods and international borders alongside the increasingly stingy distribution of social goods, disbursed only if the recipients allow themselves to be stripped of basic human rights.  \\n    3) In this terrain, the far right of a special type found that it became more and more accepted as a political force given the turn by the parties of liberalism to the policies for which the far right had advocated. In other words, this tendency to draw from far-right policies allowed the far right to become mainstream.  \\n    4) Finally, the political forces of liberalism and the far right unified across the board to diminish the lefts grasp on institutions. The far right and its liberal counterparts have no fundamental economic differences regarding class. In the imperialist countries, there is a very high confluence of viewpoints on maintaining US hegemony, hostility and contempt for the Global South, and increased jingoism, as seen by the full-throttled military support for the genocide Israel is conducting against Palestinians.","title":"Donald Trump is on the cusp of the presidency"},{"text":"Europe is going to have to sink or swim on its own now.

By the time you're done disproving one \\"Democrats want post-birth abortions!\\" X post, you wasted two days in the news cycle and 40 more claims have popped up.The current trend here is remarkably similar to Brexit, where people voted based on the simple, yet insane ideas of the Vote Leave campaign, but then found out it was a scam. By any and all metrics, Brexit has failed spectacularly, yet there is still 1/3 of the electorate clinging onto it.The same can be said for \\"45% of people feel worse of now than 4 years ago.\\" First of all, the statement is arguing *feelings*. The older people get, the worse they feel. How many times do you meet someone who - unless they literally doubled their salary twice and now own a house - would tell people they feel *better off*? Funny anecdote about that: my sister literally makes near enough $4,200 a month *after* tax, doesn't work more than 10 hours a week, only pays my mom $200 in rent including bills, gets her holiday paid for by mom etc. This is outside the US, so social security is higher.Yet she *still* complains she has a terrible, stressful live and things around her go to shit based on her failed marriage. How do you reason with such a person? The answer is *you don't*. Because nothing you say on a *rational* level can change the *irrational* perception that their life is shit. You can literally *show* her how good she has it. Her mind won't ever accept it. So now there is an issue: do you accept that in a post-internet, post-social media world policies are useless and try to reduce everything to a 5 seconds soundbite for X's 120-characters tweets, or do you continue having a rational conversation?If you do the former, elections just turn into shit flinging.

Her sex is a reasonable possibility, as female figures tend to be disproportionately viewed as \\"extreme\\" for the same actions male figures do. See any media discussion around even remotely grey female characters. Additionally, one could argue that running to be the first female (and first black female) president could be considered a revolutionary (read: extreme) action all on it's own. Finally, there could be voters who refuse to vote based on \\"identity\\" and so they vote Trump as an over-correction. Obviously, being a woman also has advantages, as many voters (especially female voters) will feel inclined to vote for her because of it. I'd even say that overall being a woman helped Harris more than it harmed her.

I'm at peace with it, I think in large part because I live in a progressive city. It is what it is. If that's what people want, that's what they're gonna have. I do think Trump winning the popular vote, culturally, changes this country. In a lot of ways. Culturally, that is an impact that you're gonna see felt almost immediately. It won't be everywhere but you'll see that at the corporate level, the entertainment level, etc. The days of the shy Trumper are definitely over, but I'm OK with it at this point. It is what it is. I'm not gonna stand for bigotry, but I can't be a hypocrite and not at least be willing to hear these folks out and respect them. Because a lot of the reason we're at this stage right now is, and this is something a lot of especially leftists don't seem to comprehend, is that a lot of Americans across the board, including Democrats, feel liberals/leftists don't hear them.","title":"MSNBC declares Trump the President Elect"},{"text":"Im a white man that would 100% vote democrat if I was American, and would also vote for Kamala. However I have a feeling that the issue with this election has been that Kamala did not speak to the male population. Rhetoric focused so much on women, who would be far more likely to vote democrat anyway, that they basically turned a blind eye to the men that they needed. Saying Republicans hate women, vote democrat! does not win you the votes you need from men. Dont focus on women when you need to get votes from men, or you make them feel invisible. It seems so obvious that this campaign was ruined by gender issues and democrats didnt know how to handle it. Why they didnt focus heavily on the male population more and winning their votes back from the right baffles me. They need to stop flaring up womens gender issues in campaigns. YES they should obviously seek to protect womens rights but by ignoring men completely they basically lose a lot of disenfranchised men who dont think the democrats are speaking to them.","title":"Trump win Pennsylvania!

Biden is one of if not the most pro-union Presidents ever (much to the detriment of this sub) and the NLRB appointed by him has done historic work advancing labor rights, siding with unions in basically every dispute. And in nearly every one of Biden's bills there are explicit carveouts or requirements for union labor to build or supply the materials for infrastructure projects. Biden saved 1 million plus pensions of union workers set to be axed by Congress. Despite this, union voters went to Trump nearly 2 to 1, even with Republicans explicitly adopting anti-union rhetoric.   \\n  \\nThe reality is neither block is a reliable voting block for Dems, but when Progs break off from Dems they do so inconsequentially, voting for some useless third-party candidate that won't win, whereas union voters actively boost Trump's reelection chances.","title":"What is to be done?"},{"text":"You are the most rational comment in this post.","title":"Trump's odds on prediction markets surge above 90% as election results tilt his way"},{"text":"But she brought out the big gunz..
