That is the reality.  In so many different ways, it is more conservative than Europe.  If anything, the country has moved even more rightward in the last 4-8 years.  In the future, the country can indeed become more progressive.  It remains a far more progressive country than it was in the late 1700s and 1800s.  Forcing the progressive ideal on the country at large will result in the Democrats getting decimated in the voting booth.  One core reason I think both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, which has not been talked about, is that both were seen by large swaths of the electorate as radical leftists, while Joe Biden was considered a centrist.  Notice how the progressive 2020 Democratic field yielded to Biden, knowing that a centrist was the Democrats' chance to defeat Trump.Notice that while I did admit that the US can become more progressive in the future, I didn't say the near future.  It's going to take decades at best.  There is a reason the US isn't ready for a female president, a reason that we have prudish attitudes toward breastfeeding and other nudity, and a reason that men are still largely expected to pay for dates in some regions of the country.

Saw it just the other day from someone on FB group.What i said however is another side of that coin and that is the ignorance of humanities by the tech people. many go through their entire university years without having taken a single class in Philosophy or literature, or World History. So how would they develop the kind of critical thinking needed for Ethics judgement calls?I see these two sides - the anti-intellectuals and the tech ignoramuses as tweedle-dee and tweedle dam. the first are many MAGA types while the second are the musk/Ramaswami/Thiel types. Neither understands or has compassion for the life of regular people, including perfectly smart and capable people who just can't earn enough to keep up with the times. And, another note, if I may: none of the Tech genius types ever took a class on macroeconomics. They may have read a book or two along the way but those would be just enough to misinform and misdirect. They tend to buy into the simple minded view of Capitalism with its \\"rational agents\\" and free-market myths (which is what they are). None could carry a conversation on economical challenges in the modern world with even a modicum of understanding. It's kind of sad, really, how ignorant some of these 'geniuses\\" are.I should know.

Basically anything he didn't personally go out and push for, didn't get done.the build back better failed, but that was because of the dumbass far left wanting even MORE and not supporting it while it could still pass.  that too somehow became bidens fault.So no, we won't see a more progressive presidency for a very long time than the one we just had, and its the progressives fault","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"Donna trump the best First Lady money can buy","title":"Pushing TikTok deal, Trump opposes ban at SCOTUS"},{"text":"Going to defend Biden on this one, but Joe couldn't have stopped the Supreme Court.

A good number of states have raised their minimum wage since the federal isn't.  States have added programs for free school lunches and even breakfasts for students.  They've added mandatory paid sick leave to the law books.  They've strengthened union protections and laborers abilities to collect unemployment.  A lot of states and cities have made major steps in reforming the way police deal with non-violent crime The fact that all of this gets ignored in order to claim the Democrats aren't progressive just because they're not progressive enough for their tastes is so f problematic. I live in a city with minimum wage well over the 15 that most people are pushing for on the federal level (18.81 starting tomorrow. 17.29 now) and some very successful police initiatives for dealing with the mentally ill and the homeless which involve social workers and for other professionals...Things accomplished by Democrats...

Adam Silver works for the owners and its his job to make the league as profitable as possible. Thats the only job of the commissioner, make the league as much money as possible. Now heres the biggest problem with your idea, a lot of NBA fans would boycott the league. But lets adress the rest of your points.1. Bums making 20 million. The commissioner doesnt set salaries on individual contracts so this is a complaint for individual teams. The commissioner trying to implement anything such as caps on individual salaries outside of max contracts is going to be fought tooth and nail by the players association and theyre going to win that fight.2. How do you intent to force someone to play hard? Better yet show me a play where someone is checked out with 100% certainty that its not part of the offense and then show me that their doing it consistently again with each play being 100% certain that its not just how the offense is supposed to run. Theres no way to objectively tell is a player has quit on their team so theres not a way to punish them that will get past the players association.3. Load Management would still exist, theyd just put them as day to day on the injury report. Magical guys come down with knee/ankle soreness on the 2nd game of back to backs and stars tweak their shoulder the day before they play a garbage team during a 4 in 5. Youre not going to be able to force guys to play injured because the players association is going to kill that before it gets off the ground.4. Flopping needs to go but theres no way to get rid of it aside from fouls and fines. Thats a subjective enough foul that it doesnt need to be in the game and the fines would be appealed and overturned more often than not because of the subjective nature of the foul.5. Trade demands are going to exist as long as trade exist. The league isnt getting rid of trades and adding no trade clauses into each contract just gives more leverage to the players. If you want to hand out fines for trade demands, once again good luck winning that fight vs the players association.Youll notice a common theme here and its the players association. Thats going to be the main obstacle to all of your complaints regardless of who the commissioner is and regardless of who the commissioner is the NBAPA is a strong union thats not going to just roll over.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump should be the commissioner of the NBA"},{"text":"or just not taught at all.","title":"Russia rejects Trump teams reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine, FM Lavrov says"},{"text":"hes saying some stuff though","title":"Who voted for Trump and now regret it?"},{"text":"It seems the divide and conquer strategy that trump used to scape goat immigrants is backfiring on Musk who may enjoy the fact H1B visa holders have restrictions such as on their ability to protest by limiting their ability to participate in the supply and demand of our labor force, through finding positions at competing companies.\\nBelow is a summary of many of the issues we face broadly in our nation, please read, share, thank you:https://www.reddit.com/r/March4Unity/comments/1hpaji9/a_summary_of_the_issues_we_face_and_some_of_the/","title":"The MAGA Honeymoon Is Over | Silicon Valley and the nativist right worked together to elect Trump.

After the takeover of the German government by the Nazi Party, Hitler supporters in various parts of the country started rounding up Communists, Gypsies, political opponents etc, and detaining them in small-scale, improvised prisons (basements, barns, sheds).  This amateur/vigilante detention system went on for quite a while until the \\"proper\\" camps were built.  Based on similar gang-war situations in other countries (like the Balkan shitshow) that *were* documented and reported, a lot of undocumented atrocity went on in these cowboy concentration camplets.So my point basically is that this is not historically unprecedented -- and the precedent is bad, very bad.  Vigilante/extremist groups feeling empowered to kidnap and detain fellow citizens (or even non citizens) is frankly terrifying.

An appropriate response to the looming Atlanticist threat, Dugin contends, is for the renascent Eurasian-Russian empire to direct all of its powers (short of igniting a hot war), as well as those of the remainder of humanity, against the Atlanticist Anaconda. \\"At the basis of the geopolitical construction of this [Eurasian] Empire,\\" Dugin writes, \\"there must be placed one fundamental principle--the principle of 'a common enemy.'

The CIA probably needed to put the president in a superstitious mind-frame in order to prepare him, to manufacture his consent for some scheme they had prepared for him to approve.I'd be interested to see what budgets/operations Jimmy Cater approved or supported in the days or months following this interaction.Why would the president of the United States of America be involved in the search for a small plane crashing in Africa? Surely, as one of most influential persons in the world, he had more important things to do with his time than look for a small plane.'Manufactured consent' is not just for the people. It's also critical to manufacture consent from those who have the power to put schemes into effect. The victim needs to be put in the optimal frame of mind to be receptive to your proposal. I'm sure the CIA spares no expense to make this happen.The CIA's favorite trait in a president is naivety. A naive president will let the CIA run amok. That's why they loved Kamala. Their second favorite trait is dementia; that's why they loved Biden.Dementia is not as good as naivety though because a grumpy old man with dementia can be stubborn and not pliable to arguments. A naive person is easy to control as you can play on their emotions and egos to make them believe that your idea was in fact their idea or that they're doing divine work on behalf of a higher power.Also, I think it's a way to condition presidents into accepting a higher power above them. If you're the president, there is no higher power above you (at least not in the realm of human affairs) so convincing you that there is a greater power is a great way to prime you to work alongside the invisible hand instead of fully taking charge.","title":"Little known anecdote from Jimmy Carter..."},{"text":"This election was probably lost by people protesting Biden's Israel policy.","title":"Trump loses appeal of E.

You couldn't shoot them down at the time and certainly not with a plane. The missiles flew too high and too fast. Proximity mattered to reduce retaliation by striking DC quickly but this idea is now rendered moot with the introduction of ballistic missile submarines. Now, no matter how quickly you're hit with nl warning,  you still have a guaranteed ability to strike back no matter what the damage is.Noq, anti ICBM systems do exist now but they are not reliable defence because of the of how nukes are designed today. It used to be 1 missile delivering 1 warhead but now it's 1 missile entering orbit and delivering 12 warheads. Defences are so easily overwhelmed.  A single Ohio class submarine can deliver nearly 300 warheads.\\nNow, this means proximity is a bad thing because if you're more likely to be able to hit the missile before it deploys it's warheads.

Life expectancy has increased by 30 years in the past century and research is investigating treatments to hold off cognitive decline and dementia. In 50 - 100 years being 75 wont mean the same thing it does today, the goal post would be constantly moving. On the other hand, the rate of development to 18 has not changed and no one is attempting to change it, its more or less a constant unlike the age of senior citizens. Senior citizens used to be 40 imagine if someone had your idea in the 1900s and implemented policy to restrict voting after 45.

But if youre already in your golden years, youre likely not sticking around to see how these choices pan out. Meanwhile, younger generations are stuck living with decisions they barely had a hand in making. Doesnt seem fair, does it?Do you think everyone just turns a certain age and keels over? What about policies around SS? Around healthcare, which older people use more than younger? Why should older people be stuck living with decisions they had NO say in making, that were made by people who are this dismissive of their lives?Counterpoints Youre Probably Thinking: 1. But old people have wisdom! Sure, theyve got life experience, but wisdom doesnt always mean relevance. Times change. A 78-year-olds perspective on tech privacy or renewable energy might be outdated. Wisdom about the past doesnt always translate to good calls for the future. 2. They paid their dues! Yes, they paid taxes, served their communities, and raised the next generation. But voting isnt a reward system. Its about whats best for the society were all building, and if theyre not around to see it, maybe they should pass the baton. 3. Ageism! Is it ageist to say someone isnt the right fit for a specific task? We dont let 80-year-olds drive buses or perform neurosurgery for similar reasons. And hey, theres still plenty they can dolike mentoring younger voters.We don't? Why do you think we don't let 80-year-olds drive buses or perform neurosurgery? Where did you get that idea?How about, instead of these silly pretend objections \\"they have wisdom\\" you discuss that they're alive, citizens, and will be directly affected by politicians' decisions? Why This Makes Sense: ? Policies skew toward short-term gains. Politicians pander to older voters because they turn out in droves. Thats why Social Security and Medicare dominate debates, while climate change gets a side-eye. ? It protects younger generations. Gen Z and Millennials already feel screwed by the Boomers (housing market, anyone?). Letting the youth take charge ensures their concerns are front and center. ? Its not unprecedented. Kids dont vote until theyre 18 because we assume they lack the maturity. Why not apply the same logic to the other end of the spectrum, where cognitive decline and disconnectedness are real issues?I see GenZ ppl all over reddit who don't even know who boomers ARE. I saw someone the other day refer to his \\"boomer parents\\" who yada yada so out of touch, who were like 50.Why do you assume the concerns of the youth SHOULD be front and center? Why should people who have not worked decades, who have not had many experiences in terms of government spending, be in charge over people who have?","title":"CMV: Elderly people should retire from voting after 75"},{"text":"it is...most people are not walking around consumed by those things..it's just you alls answer to every single thing.","title":"Biden reportedly regrets ending re-election campaign and says hed have defeated Trump"},{"text":"Society means all of it's members, not just the age centroid or the young.

The country has become a largely urban/suburban dominant population, converting from exactly the opposite about a 100 years ago. When that transition started becoming difficult for smaller farms and independent operators about 40 years ago, the nation decided to take the Reaganomics trickle down approach to economics and safety nets.The exodus of smart, capable people from rural areas over the past 40 years tells a big part of our rural/urban divides today. Those that could adapt and move to where jobs are located did, and those that couldn't or refused have suffered with the dwindling opportunities in rural areas.The remaining farming operations in many places are consolidated, with large (often immigrant-worked) operations. The few insular or owner-operated farming operations remaining in Wisconsin are dwindling traditionalists, mennonites and amish, or niche operations sustained by off-farm employment.Those that live in rural areas are angry, often surrounded by poverty and immigrant inflows to fill the low-paying ag/meatpacking/mfg jobs that remain. At no point in the last 40 years has the country decided that changing this was a priority, and Donald Trump will have no positive impact on rural communities, and perhaps more negative ones, just like his first term tariffs.The writing on the wall for many family farms has been clear for decades. The large consolidated operators in the farming sector today are such a small sliver of the population as to not be of concern, with ample subsidies and federal crop insurance programs to buoy their bottom lines.","title":"Bleak outlook for US farmers C and Trump tariffs could make it worse"},{"text":"Trump could learn decency from poop-flinging chimp, if only he had the capacity to learn.","title":"Biden says Trump could learn decency from Jimmy Carter in tribute address"},{"text":"I don't expect him to do much of anything beyond golfing and enriching himself and his masters","title":"Dont Expect Donald Trump to Tackle Americas Record Homelessness"},{"text":"pretty sure he intends to make it worse","title":"Dont Expect Donald Trump to Tackle Americas Record Homelessness"},{"text":"They organized a huge lobbied protest against it.","title":"H1b will succeed to bring caste system to USA"},{"text":"Trump got elected and the guy living under I-10 is still there, I just saw him yesterday.I KNEW THIS WAS A NOTHINGBURGER ELECTION","title":"Dont Expect Donald Trump to Tackle Americas Record Homelessness"},{"text":"By your logic, addresses should be written (for example):USA-DC-Washington-20500^* -Pennsylvania Ave.-1600-Mr. President.^* The zip code is lower in magnitude than city, mostly.","title":"CMV: \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\" is a superior date format to \\"DD-MM-YYYY\\""},{"text":"No fucking shit","title":"Dont Expect Donald Trump to Tackle Americas Record Homelessness"},{"text":"There another comment that says ?but the current agenda and left leaning politics is to force children to transition at the slightest bit of uncertainty about their identity, pushing them towards that outcome.

It was not specialized labor, merely a Bachelor's and enough hours to qualify for the CPA exam in a given state (sometimes required Master's, not always). While H1Bs were paid the same as Americans, it enabled us to get the number of people we needed each year without raising the wages for all entry level staff. Accounting grads can go work in industry (e.g. directly for corporations instead of accounting firms) and make 20-30% more while working 20% fewer hours. Many choose the firms to accelerate their career growth, but there aren't enough without improving working conditions and pay, and H1Bs fill that gap. Without the H1Bs, firms would have to pay more and work their people less.I recognize that the economy needs extraordinary talent from abroad, but I think the current system is much more abused than you are giving it credit for. For reform, assuming the purpose is for great talent and not just a general \\"open borders are good\\" thing, I think that companies should have to bid on the H1B visa. How much are you willing to pay the government to give that visa to your prospective employee? The most productive employees will have the highest bids and will get their visa. Just like the treasury auctions minimize the financing costs for national debt, H1b visa auctions could maximize the talent the US gets from the program.

Jean Carroll"},{"text":"Some highlights:Donald Trump had ignited this war by appointing the venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan to be his senior AI-policy adviser. Encouraged by the MAGA acolyte and expert troll Laura Loomer, parts of the far-right internet melted down, arguing that Krishnans appointment symbolized a betrayal of the principles of the America First movement.Krishnan is an Indian immigrant and a U.S. citizen who, by virtue of his heritage, became a totem for the MAGA right to argue about H-1B visas, which allow certain skilled immigrants to work in the United States. (Many tech companies rely on this labor.) In response to Krishnans appointment, some right-wing posters used racist memes to smear Indians, who have made up nearly-three quarters of H-1B recipients in recent years. Loomer called such workers third world invaders and invoked the Great Replacement theory, which claims that Americas white population is being purposefully replaced by nonwhite people from other countries.Although Musk has seemingly embraced white supremacy on the platform he owns, X, he apparently could not stand for an attack on a government program that has helped make him money. He is himself an immigrant from South Africa who has said that he worked in the U.S. under an H-1B visa before becoming a citizen. Musk also employs such workers at his companies. He posted on X in support of the H-1B program, arguing that it brings elite talent to America. This perspective is not remotely controversial for the Silicon Valley set, but the reactionary and nationalist wings of the Republican Party got very upset with Musk, very quickly. The American people dont view America as a sports team or a company, the provocateur Jack Posobiec wrote in response to one of Musks tweets on Thursday. They view it as their home. Later, Musk warned his critics that he will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend. By the weekend, Steve Bannon, Trumps former adviser, had called H-1Bs a scam and said that Musks defense of highly skilled immigrants is showing his true colors.The tech right and nationalist right are separate (but overlapping) factions that operated in tandem to help get Trump reelected. Now they are at odds. For possibly the first time since Trumps victory, the racial animus and nativism that galvanized the nationalist right cannot immediately be reconciled with the tech rights desire to effectively conquer the world (and cosmos, in Musks case) using any possible advantage. After winning the election together, one side was going to have to lose....This skirmish is a preview of how tension between the tech right and the nationalist right may play out once Trump takes office. The nationalists will likely get most of what they wantTrump has already promised mass deportations, to their delightbut when they butt heads with Silicon Valley, Trump will likely defer to his wealthiest friends. Thats how things went during his first term. Despite Trumps populist promise in 2016 that he would create an economy that benefited common people at the expense of large corporations and the rich (a position popular with the more nationalist wing of the right), he largely did the opposite, supporting and signing into law tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. This happened even as much of the tech world rebuked Trump over his Muslim ban and family-separation policy, which employees of tech giants prodded their leaders to oppose.This time around, with Musk and the tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy running the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, the billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen helping staff the department, and Krishnan set to advise on AI policy, the tech right is being integrated into the incoming administration. Trumps other appointments also suggest that his administration will be friendly to the rich and powerful. His advisers and Cabinet appointments so far consist of ultra-rich confidants from finance and real estateindustries that prioritize markets above other conservative principles. His proposed Cabinet includes few who would be considered dedicated members of the nationalist right. No surprise, then, that Trump seemed to side with Musk, telling the New York Post on Saturday, Ive always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. Thats why we have them. Perhaps even more so than last time, the plutocrats are in control.If there's one thing that's clear with this internecine conflict is that the public regardless of political persuasion will ultimately lose out here.","title":"The MAGA Honeymoon Is Over | Silicon Valley and the nativist right worked together to elect Trump.

I had a rubric, with a high score of 76, and depending on that president's score out of that is where I put them.\\nCriteria 1: Background. This should not be the number one thing to look out for in a president, but we need to have a mature president, one that doesn't scream and become crybaby in chief. We need one who is intelligent and is willing to take risks. Integrity is a huge thing too. In this criteria, the top scorer was Roosevelt and the lowest was Harding.Criteria 2: Their abilities as a president. These include: Executive, Leadership, Communication, and compromising. A president should not be ineffective, and they should have some experience in knowing how to lead, and knowing how to compromise.  America is not just supposed to make one party happy. Technically, America shouldn't even have parties as Washington said but I digress. The top scorer here was Lincoln and the lowest once again was Harding (his famous quote \\"I am unfit to hold public office and I should never have been here\\"\\nCriteria 3: Accomplishment as president. The retrospect. How united they made America. For this, they needed to progress the world and make changes instead of just holding it back. They needed a good economy and good foreign policy. The top scorer here was Lincoln and there was actually not a bottom scorer, as everyone did fairly well in this category\\nOverall, to boil it down, if they were good people, lead the country into a good era and left the people united more than against each other, I considered them good. I mean, Lincoln literally got us out of a civil war that the Democrat warhawk before him got us into. Tell me that's not a great president.

According to the studies you posted they posit that it's due to lower job mobility for H-1B workers and a lack of salary negotiation.From the 2024 paperThis puts H-1B visa applicants at a distinct bargaining disadvantage when negotiating with potential employers, because employers likely understand the costs, fears, and constraints of applicants and can potentially use this information to depress offered wages (e.g., Svejnar, 1986).We present these latter two potential explanations for completeness, and we acknowledge that observing an H-1B visa holder starting wage discount (relative to other peer new hires) could be attributable in whole or part to these pressures, as opposed to employers having higher bargaining power (e.g., Aobdia et al., 2020) when negotiating starting wages for these employees.Also the 2022 paper only argues that H-1B workers see a wage decrease during their first application round.Consequently, when these workers seek jobs in the subsequent year (t + 1), they have a wider array of choices and greater insight, potentially enhancing their ability to negotiate higher wages. This increased negotiating power stems from the availability of more options at hand and a better understanding of the market, ultimately leading to improved job matches and higher wages.","title":"Clearing up misconceptions and misinformation about the H-1B visa"},{"text":"!delta   \\n  \\nThese are fair points.

We have to remember there is a selection bias not so much in who is on social media, as that is almost everyone, but rather in who chooses to care and speak. The disinterested won't. It is why polls on sympathy for Mangione are not at all reflected online. Those who find his actions condemnable didn't care to speak or didn't get pushed to the top. It is even apparent here; people higher up in the tech industry are more in support of expanding H1B visas. They're leading the charge, in fact, but most didn't speak (minus a few, like Elon).They certainly made those groups the target on social issuesAgreed, it is largely on social issues, which makes them less sympathetic, but it translated to economic ones as well. Notably, opposition to student loan forgiveness, support of abolishing the department of education and presumably reduction in federal spending in that direction, and also opposition to unions that are not their favorite people (they'll support a public union like police, but not teachers. Oppose fast food workers unionizing, but factory workers are fine due to social issues), etc. It's not always one-to-one and it isn't even always a direct benefit to Trump supporters, which is why I state the embers were there to blow in either direction.

Even their enemy of the ownership class and immigrants is full of exceptions, most notably, the president elect and Musk.Tech bros, particularly the younger ones who are more up in arms, are kind of an intersection of all those groups but have the added whammy of being notably very well compensated including with lucrative stock options. They aren't an immediately sympathetic group to Trump supporters.And Republicans have always paid lip service to legal immigration for highly skilled workers which is basically what H1B visas are.I think the embers were set to go in either direction due to the populist \\"America first\\" fervor and widespread xenophobia, but Musk giving this so much space in a lame-duck session could make it tilt against even maintaining the H1B visa program as it exists.EDIT: Your comment was substantially added to since I started writing mine. To address there's no \\"common sense argument\\", I'm thoroughly unconvinced. The common sense argument that Republicans are sympathetic to is that \\"this is necessary to maintain America's global technology edge in the competition with China\\". Republicans supported investment in Mexico and India (not their favorite countries) to fight a trade war, which directly increased their prices, with China. China's an easy enemy; foreign tech talent is an easy ally. In terms of it being quiet, Elon should have been quiet. As I mentioned, there was going to be pushback, but relatively manageable pushback if the bill was already introduced alongside all the other scandal that is Trump politics, compared to now giving people time to organize in a lame-duck session with little in the news cycle.

Further, the places that standardize on one of these formats do not have matching verbal presentations.  E.G. if you're speaking mandarin it doesn't follow the ZH dateformat as written.  That's true in _lots of languages_.  Are you trying to find some unified format or pattern for the verbal and the written/visual?  That's going to be nearly impossible.It's also notable that you'd happily and without controversy in english say \\"the thirtieth of december\\" or \\"december thirtieth\\" - these are not bound to our culture and are not subject to format standardization that the written is (e.g. in the USA we have actual standards for law around dateformats but they don't apply to the verbal, we have actual formats for computers so that we can translate between visual formats easily and do calculations and so on).  The _visual format_ of \\"12-aug-1929\\" can be said \\"the 12th of august 1929\\".  The value of this format is that you can put the elements in any order and it works visually without ambiguity.  the three character month is always a month the two digit element is only ever a day of a month and the 4 digit is always a year.  The order is inconsequential to ability to unpack the meaning.  You can also write a computer program that can decipher it without regard to position of the sub-elements of day, year, month.  E.G. the computer can know with certainty that 12-aug-1964 is the same thing as aug-12-1974 or 1974-aug-12, but that's not true for \\"12/8/1974\\" and \\"8/12/1974\\" - they are ambiguous and you have to have a decipher key of a locale and confidence the person writing it is using that locale in order to know the actual date it represents.This makes it _work exactly like language_ in english (but not in all languages) where you can say dates in lots of different ways and orders and not have ambiguity.  \\"In this year of 2024 on the 4th day of march\\" or \\"the fourth of march 2024\\" or \\"march 4th 2024\\" and so on.","title":"CMV: \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\" is a superior date format to \\"DD-MM-YYYY\\""},{"text":"Trump may storm the breakfast table like Normandy, but a small ramp will stop him right in his tracks.","title":"Greenland is calling up its military reserves....as Trump threatens takeover Barbarossa style"},{"text":"I think you might be in the wrong sub if you believe you have the right to constrain the speech of private individuals.?","title":"Thomas Massie Reveals every member of Congress has an AIPAC Handler"},{"text":"Im more of a diet root beer or diet Dr. Pepper guy.

While the H1B visa program has a complicated impact on the labor market, in this analysis we look at one common misperception about the program: that it represents a source of cheap foreign labor for U.S. employers. To the contrary, we find that H1B workers today are paid slightly above similar U.S. workers in the same city and job according to Glassdoor data -- about 2.8 percent more on average.

Someone earning $50k and someone earning $200k have a lot more in common than someone with a net worth of 10+ million. Right or wrong the right and left blame the wealthy owner class as keeping wages down to collect more profit.

I dont think theres enough support in the house for increased immigration. Id bet multiple house members would have made noise about this. Elon made a couple tweets and the right exploded against him. Its not something that could be shoved through in the down low. Elons only influence is how much he can sway elected republicans. To a certain extent he has to make a somewhat public case for this to have a chance of gaining support.

There's no good way for Canadians to compete with Indians, not because they're statistically stupid-er, but because there are far fewer. If the top 1% of each country were compared they may be equivalently smart, but 1% of India is millions whereas 1% of Canadians is thousands. So allowing too much immigration means that Canadians will have to disproportionately fight for jobs that they're qualified for, as a new elite has entered the country.The issue is, is it fair for one country to make all the jobs the 1% want, while the other country provides all the 1% workers? Perhaps. But I'd doubt anybody would actually want their country to have all the good jobs entirely ran by foreigners. We want 'our people' to benefit first, and for our kindness and giving to spread from 'our circle' outwards.So instead of Canada being a meritocracy where the top 1% type intelligences get jobs fitted to them, the top 5% type intelligences get jobs fitted to them, etc you instead end up with jobs appropriate for the entire top 10% being occupied by an elite group of top 1% types mostly or at least majorly from another country. The top 5% type people from Canada now have to go into jobs much worse than their merit would warrant.And this seems unfair given that India provides very few jobs for Canadians to succeed in.

My point is that DD-MM-YYYY is superior in a wide array of contexts, mainly due to the order in which information is communicated. In the house fire example, with the first sentence I can start running toward the house as soon as I know it's on fire, then process the other information while running, whereas with the second, I might be busy thinking about which blue chair is in which room before I realize there is an urgent issue.Another example is how we use the word, 'please,' to ask for things. \\"If it would please you, hand me that delta,\\" has been shortened to, \\"Please hand me that delta,\\" as the earlier bits, well understood, became redundant, and are usually dropped. Similarly, if I am asking you about a patient admitted to the hospital on the 21st of December, you can guess the year before I say it, and start going through recent charts, rather than wondering where in December I want to look if I merely drop the year from the year-first format.To go even more granularly on the big-endian vs little-endian point, sometimes little-endian is more efficient for data transfer. Maybe I just want to check that a packet of data was not corrupted, so I want to see the checksum digit right away. Maybe I know that my milk deliveryman only delivers to my neighborhood on days that end in 0, so the day coming before the month can tell me more quickly how likely my milk is to spoil soon.Again, my primary point here is that, whether you drop the year off or not, there can be advantages to saying the date before the month. I'm not saying one is always better, but I am saying that year first is not superior. I think it's more like different formats suit different contexts better. Just like a .jpg file format is great for some photos, but a .pdf might be a better format for storing/transmitting lossless vector art. Neither format is wholesale superior to the other.","title":"CMV: \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\" is a superior date format to \\"DD-MM-YYYY\\""},{"text":"The president elect also had enough evidence against him to be placed in jail.

Despite the fact that H1-B guidelines state that an employer needs to have a position available for each H1-B petitioner, they submit H1-B petitions for a huge number of their employees, more than they relocate to the US. They calculate how many jobs they need to fill, what they expect the acceptance rate to be, multiply to find out how many petitions they need to submit. These companies thus get more visas than companies like Amazon, but they're not just importing the top talent. This makes a lot of sense. In the stickied thread I was mentioning how strange it is that I'll work with people from these companies that are far less competent than developers I know who were dependent on winning the H1B lottery. There was somebody in a software development position who didn't know how to write any code!I think the fact that these companies have got this process down to a science as well as offering such cheap rates for quick staffing means the companies they work with are fine taking the risk that some of the people coming in are going to be duds, they're typically giant companies with tens of thousands of employees anyways so the organizations can handle it.

This comment doesnt make any sense. The action in *Carroll II* was for Rape, which the jury expressly did not find. They found trump liable for sexual assault. Any arguments claiming he was somehow liable for rape is misinformation. He could have been, yet the jury did not agree. Specifically, the jury found that Ms. Carroll has not shown that Mr. Trump raped her, and instead found only for sexual abuse. To note, in civil cases the jury reviews evidence based on a preponderance (51%) *NOT* the much higher reasonable doubt standard applied in criminal cases. This is telling because it would not have taken much to ostensibly convince the 9 person jury that a rape had occurred because its not like they needed to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Or if I tell you that I went to a cool party on the 31.10 youd know that Im still talking about 2024. But you wouldnt drop something thats in front of something you want to keep. So it would be weird to shorten 2024.12.31 to 31st. Or 2024.10.31 to 10.31Basically: for sorting things from multiple months / years MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD makes a lot of sense.

You rarely ever plan anything in seconds, rarely even minutes (usually more like 1/4 1/2 3/4) but you always need an hour. Like being 2 minutes and 3 seconds late isnt as bad as being 5 hours late.

It's very easy, especially in this day and age, to throw out the term pedo at anyone even without any real cause and a number of people will latch onto it. It's a dangerous weapon and we SHOULD learn more to be better defended against the mob mentality it brings.Secondly, it's more of a scientific distinction which while used less by people not in certain fields could help develop therapies that can actually help someone with malformed sexual attractions before they offend. I know it's not what everybody likes to hear because it upsets their narratives but there ARE people that have those attractions, don't want those attractions, and avoid opportunities to act on those attractions. I read a cracked article on an anonymous group of them and the equally anonymous doctor that meets with them (people will want to kill the doctor for trying to help these people not harm anyone) that have weekly group therapy. They talked about how they  avoid living near schools and other such places because they KNOW they shouldn't have those attractions and they also don't want to harm children.I would like to see a world where people like that can get help. And yes, I have seen the claims that there is no help but the truth is that we know very little about how certain things in the brain wire into a way to make it happen and we don't get a lot of real valuable data to learn otherwise because the people with such attractions have been hidden into hiding the way they have by our current climate towards it. A situation that has only helped to worsen things, I might add, because now we have driven our \\"protections\\" to only ever being reactionary, meaning a child has to be hurt before anyone does anything because even if someone seeks help and hasn't done anything to anyone they face death without ever even seeing any alternative. Lastly, and admittedly the cheapest part for me, I just have this weird neurosis about things being accurate. That's just me, though.None of that is comparable to when a trump supporter says he wasn't convicted of rape, though. That's just them, trying to lessen what it was because they are angry that yet again the guy they support is a sex criminal and they need to rationalize the fact that they still love the guy. The proof is how they never call out anyone on \\"their side\\" for similar crimes even when it involves children. Maga degeneracy is it's own thing completely.","title":"Trump loses appeal of E.

The top 1% in a country of 1.5 billion is 15 million. 1% of 38 million is 380,000. So now a country which has 15 million 1%-ers and almost no good in-country jobs is exporting literally millions of top notch students to a country like Canada and it's not even a competition. The 1% of Canada can compete with the 1% of India, but there are orders of magnitude more of these Indians. There are now Indians taking jobs that the 5% of Canadians could've easily handled, but instead it's going to the 1% Indians. These 5% Canadians now have to take worse jobs that they would otherwise have to take. So under your version of meritocracy jobs become extremely overcompetitive and Canadian natives suffer. A meritocracy gives a 5% person a 5% job and a 1% person a 1% job. Now 1%-ers are getting 5% jobs. Or 10% jobs. And the many people who's merit earned them a 5% job are having to fight for scraps at a much lower level of merit than they earned. While your system is a meritocracy in some ways, it's a terrible version where people suffer to fight for scraps. Industry and rent cannot keep up with the population boom.Also, importantly, this is exacerbating that exact issue in India. In India there is a ridiculous level of competition over mediocre jobs. You need a bachelors degree to become a menial worker. A masters degree gets you an IT job. They don't have a meritocracy because their education has so completely overreached their industry. Their industry barely exists, but their education is taken extremely seriously. You should see it first hand. It's terrible. You can work your whole life in India and not succeed. You can work hard and fail horribly. So Indians seek any avenue out of India so they can come to countries that have built up industries. But if Indians are allowed to move en masse to Canada, the problem becomes Canada's, too. Canadians struggle to find jobs. They get bachelors degrees only to work menial jobs. Etc.Is it really a meritocracy for one country's problems to be pushed onto another country? Maybe in some global sense, but then how should the issues of India be fixed if they can export their problem? Wasn't it the merit of Canada which made industries in the first place? And is it morally right for the merit of Canada to make a thriving business and the merit of the Indian education system to make all the workers? Should Canadians be relegated only to either creating companies or working menial jobs?If a country of 100 people had one industry, and this industry had 2 hard positions, 3 medium, and 95 easy, would it be fair for 5 talented outsiders to come and take all 5 top jobs? 4 of the 5? 3? All that aside, there are obvious implications in immigrants moving in such large numbers that they don't assimilate, too. And don't pretend that's not a problem. If you happen to not be from America, can I send a million Americans to your home town and have them behave like Americans while taking all the best jobs and you won't mind? If you're from a conservative country where pre-marital sex is taboo is it okay if these Americans sleep around? It's not weird for us to have a few partners, surely your country won't mind? And the list goes on.If my merit made a lot of money I'm happy to share it with strangers, but surely you'd argue that I should share it with my family and friends first.","title":"CMV: Green card country caps are outdated and should switch to a meritocratic system"},{"text":"The government was prepared to not pay Americans working at the national parks, but are going to ensure that corrupt foreign countries are still getting paid?Tell me the government hates you without knowing that the government hates you.","title":"Hey guys we can afford to send yet another $1.25 billion in military aid to Ukraine--keep the grift going until Trump takes the lead"},{"text":"Its because of the Electoral College.

It wasn't anger that caused these unjust situations, it was avarice, fear, and our primal tribalistic traits. On the other hand, anger over the injustice of slavery, oppression, and discrimination was a huge part of the solution.Anger is a tool that can be used appropriately or inappropriately.
