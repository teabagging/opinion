You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket.If you disagree with that fine, but you need to at least engage with what he says first.He also considered white liberals to be *more* dangerous than conservatives because conservatives are openly racist while liberals are deceptive in their racism.

Those vocal about not supporting the democrats if they do not stop supporting Israel have been clear about this since before Harris was even running for president. She knows this group exists and she has clearly decided that those votes do not matter to her. If she loses due to lack of votes from progressives who do not owe her their vote, that is her own fault for miscalculating risk and not adjusting her campaign strategy to better reflect her potential voting base. The blame should lie with democrats for not listening to a significant portion of those they claim to represent. It is literally their job to win votes and pursue a platform popular with voters. US voters are exercising their right to show support to candidates and their policies and they are not obligated to vote for anyone they do not want to. That is what democracy is. I understand and agree with the danger that Trump poses, but many of the fears you have about a Trump presidency are lived realities for both Americans and people outside of the US already under the Biden administration. Yet no one uses this same narrative about the importance of preventing democrats being in power due to the danger they pose to certain peoples rights. In my opinion, the entitlement democrats feel to peoples votes because we need to prevent trump is a strategy that has lost them elections continuously. They also continuously talk out of both sides of their mouth and express support for progressive causes while enacting policy that is quite the opposite. I find this to be far more deserving of blame for the system we are currently in than a small portion of progressives (not democrats) not just handing over their vote to democrats.

However, while there are still allies who pretend to support your cause but identify with your opponent because they benefit from that status quo they do not exist in greater numbers than conservatives now, nor do their votes and political support harm minorities as much as that of conservatives. And that was probably also the case in Malcolm's time.The thing about the liberal who ultimately does not support you any more than the conservative is that until they reveal their lack of loyalty and solidarity you engage with them, vote for them, and so on. It's not just that they're your enemy, but that they waste your time. It's not just that they betray you, but that they allow you to think you have an ally first. Betrayal from someone you think loves or cares about you *with the same degree of injury or effect on you* is worse to most people than the same degree of injury or effect on you from someone who has always demonstrated their indifference or maliciousness.But that does not mean the white liberal segment of the political spectrum was *actually* worse then or is actually worse now. Many liberals may have only reluctantly supported causes benefits minorities but things like the Civil Rights Act could not have passed if they were all fake allies.And consider now. Even a liberal who is ultimately disloyal in some fashion to the support they profess for minority groups does in some part support them--by opposition to conservatives who want *worse* outcomes from minorities, by voting for candidates who--even if one thinks they make *too little* progress--make some progress, and generally do not regress. For example, a man who professes to be a feminist and speaks often of women's causes but is a bonafide textbook misogynist in his personal life may still votes for candidates whom further feminist causes. Also, while there are definitely people who pretend to be your allies that are *worse* than your obvious enemy not just in personal interaction but in their actual political position and votes *as a whole* liberals have helped and will continue to help to move the needle in the right direction some--something conservatives will not do.Also, as for Susan B. Anthony or anyone like her, the phrase is \\"a rising tide lifts all boats,\\" but the reality seems to be that trying to rise the tide is an extremely unlikely task, while trying to improve just one boat (even at the expense of another boat in the short term) is actually effective.In other words you need a narrow focus and to compromise to get any major political movement to a successful goal, unfortunately. That includes expansion, restoration, or recognition of civil rights. And that typically means that one minority group or another gets overlooked or even sold out in order for another to progress. But overall the needle moves forward (and usually) the conditions for progress for another group are improved.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"Yeah, its never been as important to have a rational American leader as now.

Their interests are also not actually what they're telling you. If leftists who are against voting were truly interested in minimizing the suffering in the West Bank on an immediate basis, they would be doing everything in their power to remove the threat of a far right takeover of our government since ethnostates are what far right governments pursue. A far-right United States government will absolutely accelerate the ethnic cleansing process the far-right Israeli government is pursuing. They will stop pushing for aid to be delivered and urge border nations to open their borders for the removal of the Palestinian people. Mobilization takes time. What we are seeing now was accelerated by the 2017-20 administration. The current administration has been unwilling to allow Israel to fall in order to stop it. The results have been poor as no one in the area is more secure for our actions. But there's certainly a difference between the impossibility of great options in foreign policy and active pursuit of ethnic cleansing goals and ethnostate support. Leftists against the electoral process DO have interests here at home. They're not actually invested in minimizing the suffering overseas or here because as long as it continues, it highlights the lie of our center right party here in America, which is masquerading as our left. We don't actually have competitive, true left-wing parties here. We have the far right and the center right because most Americans want that. Progressive and further left wing thought is not popular enough here to gain traction because Americans are poorly educated in history, rich on an international scale, relatively comfortable and used to an underclass of slave labor serving the common citizen's needs.  The goal of leftists against the electoral process is to generate enough suffering at the hands of right-wing extremists for a large enough portion of the population to revolt to create a strong true left movement in America. They believe that this will lead to better (leftist) foreign and domestic policy in the long run. They're acting in their interest.They're just not being forthcoming about what their interest actually is. To be fair, many of the boots on the ground protesters and casual dabblers in leftist spaces are not so subtle and actually think that \\"teaching the democrats a lesson\\" will somehow help  Palestinians this winter.They're acting in the interest of the movement for reasons they haven't considered beyond a reactionary response to a call to action.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Thats the effect of having too many MBAs involved","title":"GMs profit nears a record a year after saying it couldnt afford its workers pay demands"},{"text":"I think theres a big difference between people voting for Trump to get back at Harris and people refusing to vote for either of these candidates and most people who dont want to vote for Harris due to the situation in Gaza fall into the second category.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"As a lifelong chess player who runs afterschool chess programs, you just made my day!

Browns support for organized labor helped earn him Ayers vote in the past but the 47-year-old is not so sure this time.Under Trump, Ayers said, the economy was way better, things were a lot cheaper.The stakes go far beyond the Ohio Senate race, which at nearly $500 million in spending, is on track to be the most expensive US congressional battle in history. A Brown defeat could cost Democrats their Senate majority, a vital asset for the party if it holds the White House and a powerful check on Trump if he wins.At the same time, Browns ability to keep the support of voters like Ayers would show that Democrats can retain at least some of the coalition that has kept them competitive in races across the country despite Trumps appeal.The 71-year-old incumbent has?a narrow edge in most polls.

So do not even go there. During these last few weeks before the election, he's been having fun, he's more relaxed, he's made sure to relate to every single demographic.

Following that incident I continued watching the full press conferences and speeches he made and so forth because thats the only way to form a factual opinion.

They kept watering down their progressive policies that would materially provide for Americans and act as an economic release valve for the fear and anger driving people to the right.Biden, Pelosi, and others kept calling Republicans their friends and claiming America needs a healthy GOP to balance the DNC. Biden even apologized to McConnell after being a bit harsh towards him once. That tells me that Dems are more interested in maintaining bipartisanship than actually gunning for the supermajorities that they enjoyed during the New Deal and Great Society. Theyve hit the limits of progressive policy that their corporate donors will allow, which still falls short of the social programs the rest of the developed world takes for granted.So now theyre appealing to conservatives that claim to be sick of Trump, ignoring the fact that the conservative ecosystem sees Dems as evil demons that kill babies. They wont get points by trying to pass tough, conservative border laws or campaigning with the Cheneys. But that WILL demoralize progressives that hate Dick Cheney for the War on Terror, and those that understand how the US abuses the migrants we create through our Latin America foreign policy.No one is buying the claims about democracy being on the line if they see how NORMAL the Dems are politicking. We can see how Liz Cheney and other republicans voted for over 90% of Trumps policies, and dont want them on stage with Harris. Dont bring the party of fascist-enablers into your campaign, when you could instead be mobilizing your base through winning issues like womens reproductive rights and worker protections.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Some folks see a rabbit awhile others see a duck.","title":"Kamala Harris beats Donald Trump on disaster response: New polling"},{"text":"It would be nice if it was good enough that she beats him by far in action instead of polling.","title":"Kamala Harris beats Donald Trump on disaster response: New polling"},{"text":"Yep its ironic that in 2016 they would air his empty podium, now theyre letting him run a basement campaign during a non-pandemic year and normalizing it","title":"Kamala Harris Isnt Repeating the Mistakes of 2016"},{"text":"Harris has never done anything on her own","title":"Kamala Harris Plagiarized Pages of Congressional Testimony From a Republican Colleague.

Say, a bunch of people in various communities organizing events and protests to raise awareness of the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide.Astroturfing is when the grassroots effort is artificially laid down from the top. For example, an energy drink billionaire wants people to be afraid of dihydrogen monoxide, but knows that people won't trust an energy drink executive telling them that water is dangerous, so he hires a bunch of people to protest against dihydrogen monoxide to create the appearance of a grassroots campaign. Grassroots efforts have an inherent sense of honesty and sincerity to them because they're driven by people who care about something enough to use their own time and resources to advance a cause. So, astroturfing allows you to advance an agenda by masquerading your agenda as a sincere, passionate cause. If it's done really well, you'll even be able to convince enough people that your agenda is truly noble and they'll happily join your astroturfed movement. On the flip side, since it's harder to argue against a cause that's being driven by sincere concern and passion, calling a grassroots campaign 'astroturfed' can also be a way to rob it of legitimacy.","title":"Reddit is not a place full of liberals"},{"text":"Even if they had the most successful union in history, there arent enough of them to move the needle.Its an absolutely absurd assertion.

Seems like she got away with a few things \\n\\"Critics argue that Harris was slow to adopt progressive criminal justice reforms. She opposed statewide initiatives like Proposition 47 (which reduced some nonviolent offenses from felonies to misdemeanors) and was criticized for not taking more aggressive action to reduce mass incarceration.\\"\\"Harris faced backlash for resisting the reopening of cases involving possible wrongful convictions. In several instances, her office fought to uphold convictions even when new evidence suggested they might be unjust. This stance led to accusations that she prioritized convictions over justice.\\"\\"In 2014, Harriss office argued against releasing nonviolent offenders from overcrowded prisons, citing the potential loss of cheap labor. This position was widely condemned as it contradicted her stated support for criminal justice reform and efforts to reduce prison populations.\\"Before when she was Deputy district attorney \\"In her early prosecutorial role, Harriss work did not emphasize or engage with community-based interventions or diversion programs for offenders. This was an area where she later evolved, but it was absent in her earlier career.\\"\\"Her involvement in the prosecution of drug-related cases as a deputy district attorney aligned with the War on Drugs policies of the time, which disproportionately impacted communities of color and contributed to broader systemic inequalities.\\"\\nHow about her career before that I asked my friend \\"Her role as a deputy attorney general was not high-profile, and she did not build a public presence or establish herself as a leader or advocate during this period. This limited visibility likely delayed her rise to more influential and reform-oriented positions.\\"When did she start seeing Willie Brown?Kamala Harris met Willie Brown in the early 1990s. Willie Brown, a powerful figure in California politics who served as Speaker of the California State Assembly and later as Mayor of San Francisco, played a significant role in Harriss early political career. Harris and Brown had a brief relationship, and during this time, he appointed her to two state boards: the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the Medical Assistance Commission. These appointments helped Harris gain visibility and connections in Californias political landscape.Here's how this fits into her career timeline:\\"Early 1990s: After Harriss time as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice (1989-1990) and her role as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County (beginning in 1990), she started her relationship with Willie Brown. Brown's influence and connections helped her advance her career and gain important political allies.Appointments by Willie Brown:California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board: Appointed in 1994, this position provided Harris with a well-paying role and broadened her experience in state government.Medical Assistance Commission: Another position appointed by Brown, this role further enhanced her profile within Californias political and governmental circles.\\"","title":"This is the most tyrannical and evil thing that Kamala Harris has EVER been caught on camera saying."},{"text":"If that were true Trump would not have any votes at all.

On the maternal side, they are descended from Lincoln, not from Abe, but from one of his ancestors who married one of Paul Revere's daughters. (Two Massachusetts Lincoln brothers married two of Paul's daughters. Abe learned of the Massachusetts Lincolns and wrote they were no relation, but genealogists beg to differ)\\nThe family is  a whole PBS special in itself.But I digress. The New Deal began getting repealed or amended almost before the ink dried, except for two biggies, Social Security and welfare. And FDR signed the bills. I won't speculate as to why they lasted. Of course, everyone has been bleeding Social Security and a New Democrat bragged about having ended \\"welfare as we know it.\\" Even so Republicans like Eisenhower, accepted it.  That may or may not be explicable by history. As I see it:Between Lincoln and FDR, the only Democrats elected President were Bourbon Democrat and perennial footnote President, Grover Cleveland, and POS Woodrow Wilson. There were reasons why they were exceptions that had nothing to do with the nation's love for Democrat Presidents.  Between FDR and Eisenhower, however, Democrats held the Oval Office for twenty consecutive years. Given history, I imagine that shell shocked Republicans aspiring to be POTUS and assuming it was likely to be theirs if they just got the nom. World War II hero and Columbia University President, seemingly genial Eisenhower, versus Truman's anointee \\"egghead\\" Adlai Stevenson?  No contest.IMO, maybe why Eisenhower didn't rush to repeal anything or lower taxes because he was part of the shell shocked Republicans and wanted to be re-elected. (JFK, lowered them,  though.) Maybe even his shell shocked Party cautioned him about it.As for Eisenhower's second term, his VP wanted to run, so.... Lo and behold, though, Nixon lost to another Democrat. This history may explain why Nixon seems so liberal to today's Democrats.

About two weeks after the October 7 attacks by Hamas, as Israels bombardment had already killed more than 2,000 civilians in Gaza, a CBS poll of more than 1,800 Americans found that 52 percent of American adults said the U.S. should not send weapons to Israel. The totals included large majorities among both Democrats and independents, and 43 percent of Republicans. In April, CBS News/YouGov asked the same question in a new poll and found that an even larger number of Americans (60 percent), including 68 percent of Democrats, said they felt the U.S. should not send arms to Israel. The poll was conducted days after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in a clearly marked World Central Kitchen convoy. And in June, when more than 30,000 Palestinians were killed and as Israel continued its operations in Rafah where many of Gaza civilians had been sheltering, spurring the All Eyes on Rafah social media campaign, a third CBS News poll seemingly solidified Americans opposition to military aid to Israel with 61 percent of American adults calling for a halt on weapons transfers to Israel, **including 77 percent of Democrats.**","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Im assuming these are marks so he knows where to stand.

Progressives have power in the Democratic Party in primaries, which is why progressives do well in those, but they don't do well in general elections.  When candidates swing moderate during general elections, it isn't to get the swing states on board, it's to get enough people on board to actually win them the election (for instance, light blue or pink states could become purple if they don't moderate).  There is no political benefit to pursuing progressive policies except where they converge with moderate opinion.\\\\2) The VP is a symbolic position.  Unless the VP was specifically designated duties that can be pointed to (such as Kamala with the border), it makes more sense to assume that the VP has little to no impact on the actions a President takes.  The Republican talking point of \\"why aren't you doing those things *now*?!?!\\" for Kamala is also stupid for that reason.  It is illogical to assume that Walz will have more impact on Kamala's policies than any other VP had with their own Presidents.  The exception to the rule of VP's doing mostly nothing was Dick Cheney.  However, he was the most powerful VP in American history.  Walz doesn't have Cheney's \\"stuff\\"; even though Harris *may* be as passive if not more than Bush Jr.  If Harris' presidency is unpopular (and looking at the polls for the Senate, it seems that this is a foregone conclusion as she will likely be unable to actually do anything), Walz will catch strays, which makes him less likely to be politically successful in the future.  The progressive side doesn't have many strong candidates (not saying that Walz is in the first place), so having his political career be married to a Harris presidency isn't a good look in the first place.3a) The emphasis on Supreme Court seats needs to go away.  The job of the Supreme Court is not to legislate by proxy on things that the legislature is too incompetent to manage a vote on.  The legislature should spend more time on common sense policies, rather than edge issues that are either extremely divisive or that most Americans simply don't care about in the first place.  Supreme Court seats aren't too important to most voters this election because they are unlikely to overturn their Dodds decision anytime soon.3b) The issues that Americans care about in this election, in order are: Inflation, Healthcare, Housing, Gun Violence, Jobs, Corruption, \\"Protecting Democracy\\", Women's Reproductive Rights, Education, Immigration, Crime, Climate Change, Taxes, Free Speech, Israel/Palestine, and Student Debt.3c) As Harris is the sitting vice president under a president where certain commodities have exploded in price (despite actual inflation being lower this year than it was in the previous years of Biden's presidency, and lower than it was at the *end* of Trump's presidency), it's likely that people have a strong prior against her for this reason.  So, there might also be a subconscious bias in favor of Trump because there was a strong economy with relatively affordable prices when he was in office until COVID.  Trump actually had little to do with that (no President does), but the public loves to assign credit and blame to the president.  The  general voting base is economically illiterate.\\\\4) If Kamala wins, even if they *did* vote, she'd need to abandon them.  The Senate races aren't looking good for the Democrats, so if it all goes as expected, if she wants a shot in hell at getting *anything* done she will need to moderate further right to court right leaning Democrats (yes they exist, but are rare) and left leaning Republicans (also rare but exist) to her side.  She will likely need to move even *further* right to court moderate Republicans, leaving her Democrat allies staunchly in the center and the further left ones will be left behind.  A successful Presidency for Kamala would look like Bill Clinton's second term.  Of course, bipartisanship is rarer these days, however, Trump was much more effective at getting bi-partisan deals done than Biden was, and Obama more effective than Trump, it's not really a *trend* downward, Biden essentially dropped off a cliff.  Pointing fingers at the fillibuster is unproductive.  Obama managed.  Biden simply allied himself with a weaker political faction.  Harris ought not commit the same mistake, and as she seems almost entirely beholden to her advisors, it is unlikely she will.\\\\5) The idea that Trump is a \\"threat to democracy\\" is overblown.  This line of attack has been ineffective except for people who already believed this to be the case.  If people legitimately consider Trump to be a \\"threat to democracy\\", they would vote against him as the alternative is democracy may collapse.  Therefore, I believe the people who legitimately think that Trump is a threat to democracy are not the same people as the ones abstaining from the vote.  Alternatively, they may believe that he's a threat to Democracy, but see this as a *good* thing, so him winning is indeed within their interests.  This is not the typical case where people do not understand politics or economics and so they inadvertently act against their interests, this result is evident to any reasonable person.\\\\6) Trump may not advocate for (because the executive branch is not the legislature) progressive bills (or at least not progressive in the sense that people mean, as Trump was a fairly progressive president, just in a different direction); however, I'm not sure if that is necessarily a *bad* thing from their perspective.  In  Eric Hoffer's \\"The True Believer\\", it was argued that the recruitment stock of ideological movements come from their opponents.  If this is true, then Trump's messaging may be more palatable to populist progressives than a more moderate message.  The amount is not clear, but a not insignificant amount of Bernie Bros went full Trump after 2016.  This may be the beginnings of that same process anew.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Kamala is leading a masterclass in this right now","title":"Mark Cuban says the election is now a battle between Kamala Harris and Elon Musk, not Donald Trump"},{"text":"An yes, Trump would have just detonated some nukes to cancel it out.

Democrats have fully capitulated to Republican framing on several issues, but most notably immigration. 4 years ago it was \\"In this house we believe no human is illegal\\", now it's \\"we'll actually build the wall! Our plan is approved by Border Patrol\\". There has been virtually zero discussion of Medicare for All this election. It and other progressive policy goals poll incredibly well with the American electorate at large but especially with the party's base. Tough on crime is back and police budgets keep exploding. Democrats are fighting ballot access for things like Cop City here in Atlanta or having 3rd party candidates at all. Suddenly we're the party all of the war hawks of yesteryear are endorsing. The party really feels like it's shifted to the right to appeal to the tiny contingent of Never Trump Republicans instead of engaging with the base.Democrats don't respond to anything the left pushes for. Democrats exist to sap energy and momentum from the left then capitulate to the right, or at least that's been the long standing electoral strategy.

While true that we have a right wing politician on the rise, its not MAGA. He likes to use language that draws in the conspiracy theorists, but hes moderate compared to Trump. Currently the issues hes fighting on is what meds should be covered in universal prescription coverage, universal dental, getting rid of an environmental tax, etc. Heres a pretty decent [article](https://www.vox.com/politics/24140480/canada-pierre-poilievre-conservative-party-populism-democracy). From the article His signature proposals are repealing Trudeaus carbon tax, cutting spending to fight inflation, and removing restrictions on housing construction. He even says hes pro immigration, for example. I dont support him, but hes not comparable to MAGA in terms of rhetoric or policy just yet. Canada has had a very liberal goverment in power since 2015 with Trudeau winning 3 elections, last in 2021. Politics in general are much different here as Canada has no religion in politics, so not many single issue voters as abortion isnt on the table, no second amendment so guns dont sway peoples votes. Many people are swing voters, no party registration either. I have no doubt Canada could head in that direction especially if Trump wins. The province I live in is actually ran by a far right nut job, but politics here is still ran by things like taxes cuts, oil incentives, and being less involved with our federal government. Canada isnt a two party country, and there is a party that is on Trumps level, however in the last general election the leader of that party didnt even win his own riding and the party received less than 5 percent of votes and that was in 2021 and focused on the anti vax people. The largest rush of MAGA energy I saw was in 2020-2021 when Covid had people losing their minds but its lost alot of steam now.

Person with good politics but no chance to win, 2. Hitler, and 3. Worse than Hitler... I'm going to go with number 1.

You do not owe anyone a vote. If candidates choose bad policies, then it is their fault if they lose. Democrats may try to blame leftists if they lose, but they have no one to blame but themselves. Additionally, Democrats have no interest in catering to leftists. Leftists voting for Democrats without Dems first doing anything leftists want just teaches dems that there is no need to actually push for leftist policies. Traditionally Democratic communities' issues are often overlooked by Democratic policy makers because they're safe. Politicians only care about satisfying people whose votes they need to earn. If dems want to pursue right-wing votes over leftist votes, they can try, I just think it's a dumb tactic. They're never going to be able to out conservative a Republican. All Republicans have to do is ask \\"who do you trust to keep those [insert horrible description] migrants out of this country?

It does not all point in one direction of supporting the lesser evil or allowing yourself to be co-opted by parties that oppose your politics. Sometimes it turns out to be a mistake not to build alliances with those who would happily see you dead. Sometimes it turns out to be a mistake to build alliances with them. Sometimes it makes no difference to the outcome. In this case I see signals in both directions.In this confusing situation, most people have to resort to deeply held heuristics. Progressives who have been deeply affected by the lessons of the holocaust, colonialism and apartheid and have internalized lessons of never again would therefore have a visceral reaction that they have to stand up and be counted. In this case First the came for the Palestinians . And the lesson is that if you do not speak up (including by voting for candidates who bravely speak up) then there will be no one left to speak for you. So voting for progressives against Harris has a logic based on protecting a core value representing standing against barbarism. This is a question history puts to people and is repeated in popular culture such as in films like the zone of interest. Are you willing to martyr yourself to stand for the basic rights of others?When it comes to the question of how voting for Harris protects the basic human rights of other groups threatened by Trump, so why not martyr yourself/the Palestinians for their sakes? The progressive might respond that such an argument being aired shows how threatening to vote against Harris in itself is effective as a tactic to counteract the erasure of Palestinians humanity. The original post itself refers to problems with Gaza once but makes no explicit concession that Palestinian human rights matter. But by drawing Harris supporters into this argument more deeply, progressives are also taking part in a kind of activism by making other political activists clarify their positions on the basic human rights of Palestinians and what they themselves are doing to effectively counteract Harris and Bidens erasure of Palestinian human rights and arming of their oppressors.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"She can't, as there are more pro-Israel Dem voters.?\\nGOP don't have that problem, as they have barely any pro-Palestine voters.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Inconceivable!","title":"Campaign Aide: Kamala Harris Is Against Fracking Again"},{"text":"Probably to offset the shoe lifts, so he doesn't fall over.","title":"Trump using pads under the front of his shoes so he doesn't tip forward.

Let me explain:  \\n  \\nThe \\"cats and dogs\\" was based on a perpetuated claim that Haitian immigrants were killing and eating pets, but originally was sourced by self-admitted Nazis on Twitter (X) who took the the post on Facebook out of context, and there was never any credible evidence to it, as the owner of the pet found it in their basement later.  \\n  \\nAs for Project 2025, a conservative think tank \\"The Heritage Foundation\\" drew up a plan for a conservative platform for the Presidency to act on, as they always do every four years. However, given the freedoms that were taken away/subverted due to the previous Trump presidency, and the extreme nature of this iteration of the plan, this one went viral, and unlike the cats and dogs thing, actually exists.  \\n  \\nThe problem with disassociating Trump from Project 2025 is that a good amount of his former administration were architects of Project 2025, and that the Heritage Foundation develops a short list of judges, and a good amount of federal judges, including the Supreme Court Justices he appointed, were on those lists. More often than not, the policy will be closer in line to the Heritage Foundation if Trump gets elected. The judges overturning Roe v. Wade is part of that effort. I urge you to take a look at it to see if you think that's worth risking.  \\n  \\nAs for the immigration problem, after holding up Ukraine aid on the condition to solve the border problem first (which was meant to not actually happen, the Republicans just wanted what they thought would be a condition that couldn't be fulfilled so they wouldn't pass Ukraine aid, when Ukraine was holding Avdiivka with low ammunition under meat wave assaults for months with no progress on whether further aid would be passed), a bipartisan effort formed an very conservative border security bill that both Democrats and Republicans were ready to pass, and Biden would have signed it into law.  \\n  \\nIf you don't believe me, you can look this up: Trump said to torpedo the bill just so that he could run on the border being a problem. Trump isn't actually interested in solving problems; he just wants to know how it will benefit him and him only. If it will benefit him but hurt the country, he'll do it in a heartbeat. Harris won't.  \\n  \\nAdditionally, to address the Afghanistan situation: that plan was drawn up in the Trump administration. It was a terrible plan, and probably shouldn't have been acted on and went down the way it did, but it shows how unsustainable the situation was. But as a result, we're no longer there.  \\n  \\nThe Democratic Party is currently only divisive to the far left of the party, aka, those that care about the current situation in Gaza, and those who believe it to be. Some feel that they are catering too much to the center right. However, the current administration is doing what they can to limit the damage to civilians while still supporting Israel.  \\n  \\nTrump's big economic policy is a large blanket tariff on goods imported from China. This would have devastating impacts on low and middle class consumers, and the businesses that would import those goods. The only people that would suffer from this would be Americans.  \\n  \\nThere are numerous other reasons, such as the personal freedoms of women and others, as well as preserving Democracy, and not electing a President who says they'll use the military on \\"the enemy within\\" and political opponents, but as I've stated, there's numerous other reasons, and for each question you can ask, there's a good reason to vote for Harris.","title":"Mark Cuban says the election is now a battle between Kamala Harris and Elon Musk, not Donald Trump"},{"text":"Let's check....ok so only 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza, so definitely not equal yet to 4 hostages which may still be alive.

Why should I vote Kamala over Trump? I look at Kamala and dont see a strong leader whatsoever. I dont want any answers saying to choose the lesser of two evils. I am a male and 24 years old and dont like either candidate but am leaning Trump at the moment. I am white but grew up in a very liberal city and went to an all black/hispanic school in HS and definitely leaned left but now I truly dont know if I recognize whats going on in the Democratic Party. Ill lay out what I think and you guys can educate me why I should consider Kamala. I hate how divisive this current democratic party is but I also completely realize that Trumps diction is divisive as well. The project 2025 stuff is propaganda but so is the stuff about Haitians eating the cats like Trump was propagating. Im not sure how our political system got to where we are at but here we are. For Kamala voters I hope you guys can see how the mainstream media is very skewed towards her after such a low approval rating as VP. I know she probably wasnt left much of a choice but her acting like Biden has been completely in his right mind this entire time doesnt sit well with me either. She also doesnt have many clear cut policies that I feel will help America advance forward from the Biden administration. Im not gonna act like the trump administration was a success, but you cant deny the fact that the world wasnt a much more peaceful place and you also cant deny the fact the world leaders respect and fear Trump more than they would Kamala. I dont think shes a bad person by any means, I just dont feel like shes done anything in her political career to make me feel comfortable voting for her. I also feel like she lacks genuineness. Trump is genuine to me but is crass and cant get out of his own way. I am a supporter of abortion but aside from that issue I dont see what she has going for her.  As a child of two immigrants I see the immense value immigrants bring to our country but I also dont think the Biden/Harris administration handled immigration issues well whatsoever. Im not ignorant enough to believe that Trump handled it perfectly either but I do believe that he will care more about vetting who is coming into our country.

That escalating these wars will result in more Israelis dying.     Things like full out war with Iran and first strike use of nuclear weapons are being floated.  This is insanity.The only people served by this are the extremists on both sides and Netanyahu.  Netanyahu doesnt care how many Israelis (or people period) have to die to keep himself in power.  Forever wars serve authoritarians. Some people have a problem with boots on necks. Some people only care what side of the boot they are on.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"I'm not batshit crazy and not eager to see the world burn.

There was also a point on her website where it seemed as if someone had copied and pasted much of the wording from Biden's campaign to hers. When links to her policy were posted it would say \\"join our campaign to re-elect Joe Biden today!\\" At the end of many of the subsections on her site, project 2025 has a collapsable section stating something about Trump. This happens for all 3 sections on her website. A good handful of conducted interviews show her deflecting to Trump when she is asked on policies such as immigration, fracking, Biden's drop-out, and foreign policy. The very policies progressives and many other Americans have openly disdained. Her economic agenda pushes for an \\"opportunity economy\\" in which the Child tax credit is expanded, but does little to counter the rising costs working class individuals experience. I also keep looking over \\"A New Way Forward\\" and Trump is mentioned a signifigant number of times, many charts compare his economic policy to a potential \\"Harris economy.\\" In fact, it seems that her economic policies primarily rely on tax cuts and fighting \\"junk fees\\" rather than substaintial policies that are harder to reverse. Additionally, if these policies are so much better ,why did she promote business loans instead? When she was asked how she would lower grocery prices, she stated she would \\"ban price gouging\\" within the first 100 days of her presidency, but didn't go into specefic.  There's a large lack of statistics when it comes to her policies instead I see things like, \\"Unlike Donald Trump, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are committed to ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes.\\" However, it doesn't go further to address how much is currently being paid by this tax bracket or how much they would pay under her admininstration. Harris' biggest problem with her campaign seems to arrive from insufficient messaging.

Senator Sanders endorsed every Dem Presidential nominee from and after Mondale. Maybe before, but I didn't research past Mondale. He campaigned for Obama. I don't know about anyone else, besides, of course, Hillary.He used to preface his endorsements with lots of criticism of the candidate before saying \\"but you have to vote for him because the Republican nominee is so awful.\\" But I think he stopped the critical bit, maybe after Clinton. Most mavericky thing he did was encourage Jesse Jackson to run as an indie.Odd fact I read:  He *and the Party's Treasurer* left the Liberty Party after he ran for Governor on the Liberty ticket.  How many time have you read someone left a political party? OK, now how many times did you  read who left the party with that person? Ok, now how many times was it the Party's Treasurer?Anyway, at some point Sanders left Vermont for a stint at Harvard U., I assume to teach. And he seemed to change after that.  Also, after that was when he won his first election other than Mayor. He got to the US House after losing several earlier elections for different offices.In the Senate, he has a deal where Democrats don't back anyone running against him for his US Senate seat. In Vermont, that all but guarantees him a win. The Vermont Dem Party has nominated him a number of times, putting him on its Dem ticket. Before the election, he declines the nomination. So much for being \\"independent.\\" I read about that deal in his wiki around 2014. I don't think it's there anymore. I also read about it one other place. Neither time did I read exactly what Sanders owes them in return. His wiki described it as voting with Democrats on \\"administrative matters.\\" However, when he did that filibuster that he turned into a book he profited  from (dicey in itself), I read that he got permission from Dem Senate leadership to filibuster. Everyone says Senator Sanders can do nothing because he only one Senator. Well, one Senator can filibuster and that ain't nothing. If he gave up his right to filibuster, he did his constituents a real disservice. Same for the one Senator hold.  And, even though it's rare that one Senate vote might make a difference, when Sanders one vote might have, he was absent. And that absence has never been explained.  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/bernie-sanders-absent-as-anti-surveillance-senate-amendment-fails.html Again, so much for \\"independent.\\"There was also that business with his wife and allegedly falsifying loan documents.

The whole reason many migrated to the Republican party over the next 30 years was because they were conservative.America has leaned conservative since Nixon and this is why the socio-cultural political shifts that occurred in the late 1800s to early 1900s are glossed over in American classes. European immigrants left Europe and migrated to America. These folks were the people who saw the ruin and failure of post-Napoleonic, monarchic, *conservative*, \\"von Metternichian\\" Europe and needed to leave.They got here with funding from a new group of religious *liberals* who were Abolitionists. They were called Republicans. Lincoln was one of them. When those Europeans moved to America, they saw the South and the control there of the Democrats, and how *conservative* it was. It reminded them of Old Europe. The Democrats represented this world. Old pastoral feudalism... lords and serfs (and slaves). And the Democrats, a conservative socio-political group, viewed the North has \\"changing too much\\" with all those liberal Germans and Irish and later Italian Catholics flooding into the country and changing the cultural landscape.If you look at old immigration maps, Europeans hardly ever move to the South. Why would they move to a place that looked exactly like the places they were escaping from the various revolutions of the 1830s through 1850s?The Republicans brought those folks to America. Liberalism and change were happening in the North. Stagnation and conservative feudalism, controlled by Democrats, imprisoned the South.After the Civil War, something strange happened. From Reconstruction to a lot of false promises, the Republicans started being viewed as all talk but no do...  while the Democrats, having lost the war, started becoming viewed as the \\"underdog\\". This spirit mutated and evolved over time to the point that many ex-slaves, poor working class white folks, and even Catholics and pro-Union folks flooded into the Democratic party, dismayed by the lack of action by those religious once-liberal-but-now-getting-a-bit-uppity Republicans. In fact, they got really pissed at how many Republicans were anti-Catholic in general. The Republicans became distrusted, especially since Prohibition (which was another one of their crusades), and they became the place for the \\"status quo\\", people who didn't want change, people who felt like America had lost its way and were no longer grateful for the Grand Old Party. The greatness they once were. Each successive generation reinforced this belief until the Republicans looked just as conservative in 1960 as the Democrats did in 1860. The Dixiecrats were the final hold-out, most entering the Republican party who were all too welcoming of them by the late '60s and '70s.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"I don't answer for people I know.

The authority for EINs is derived from 26 USC 6011(b), requiring taxpayer identification for the purpose of payment of employment taxes. The provision was first enacted as part of the revision of the Tax Code in 1954. This authority was broadened in 1961 by 26 USC 6109. An EIN is usually written in form 00-0000000 whereas a Social Security Number is usually written in the form 000-00-0000 in order to differentiate between the two. There are EIN Decoders on the web that can identify in what state the company registered the EIN.[3][4]A business needs an EIN in order to pay employees and to file business tax returns, as well as to open corporate accounts with financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and brokerage houses. To be considered a Partnership, LLC, Corporation, S Corporation, Non-profit, etc. a business must obtain an EIN.

Yes I am aware of Trumps convictions in the past year - however, far from hurting his chances, these seem to have energized his base. Couple this with the assassination attempt back in July and I believe voter turnout for the R's will be high in November.I understand what you're saying here, but what we need to remember is that polls aren't deterministic. Pollsters get data from their sample, and then weight that information based on who they predict is likely to vote, and on who they think they might not be reaching with their polling. In 2016 and 2020 pollsters failed to adequately capture Trump's voting base, and didn't weight their data heavily enough to compensate for this absent population from their data set. Given that they made that mistake twice, I suspect most polls are weighted far more heavily towards Trump this year, in order to compensate for Trump voters polls aren't reaching. That weighting might be spot on, it might still underestimate Trump, or it might even be overestimating him. Frankly, we won't know for sure until after the election. What we *do* know however is that Trump doesn't seem to be gaining a ton of new voters right now. His polling bumped up briefly by about a point after his assassination attempt, but that didn't translate to sustained enthusiasm. Moreover, the number of Republicans who say they will definitely vote has actually declined a bit over the past two months. This speaks to a political reality that we can see pretty plainly: people who like Trump tend to love him, but right leaning voters who don't love him tend to be turned off by Trump. His path to victory relies on getting his fans to go to the polls, not a surge of Republican turnout across the board, as he can't generate that.     The psychological impetus to vote against Trump this year is not as acute as it was back in 2020, when he was the incumbent. Yes, a Trump win carries the same result, regardless of whether he is the incumbent or not - however, I believe Dems won't be as motivated to vote against him while he doesn't currently wield the levers of Executive power. The US was also deeply embroiled in the steadily-worsening Covid pandemic at the time of the 2020 election, and many Americans felt that DJT handled the crisis with an immense lack of care and diligence, contributing to voter turnout for the Dems. No such domestic crisis on the scale of Covid currently exists to give the Harris-Waltz ticket anti-Trump fuel.You're right that getting Trump out of office in 2020 was highly motivating, but on the flip side its important to remember that he entered that election with a strong incumbency advantage. This time around Trump doesn't have that same boost to visibility and respectability that comes with being sitting president, and it may hurt him. Perhaps even more importantly, I think there's an argument to be made that voter outrage with Trump, while admittedly not as high as in 2020, hasn't died down all that much. The January 6th insurrection was a generational scandal that has left many voters with existential worries about what Trump might do if allowed to take power again. Its aftermath has both motivated many voters against him, and caused many more moderate right leaning voters to say they're sitting this election out. Adding yet another layer of complexity, abortion has remained a significant issue, and has turned out women to vote out rates consistently higher than pollsters predict. Polls underestimated the turnout of left leaning women in the 2022 elections, and with abortion fights ongoing in many states, its possible this group will be highly motivated to show up again this November.  According to a Gallup poll only a few days old, most Americans feel worse off than they were 4 years ago. I think this bodes very poorly for the party currently holding office.Normally I would agree with you, but this election is really, *really* weird. Polling like this should be a death blow to the incumbent candidate, but many voters seemingly don't view Harris as the incumbent to the same degree that they do Biden. They blame her some for current social and economic ills, but not nearly as much as one might logically expect. In contrast, while Trump doesn't get blamed as much, voters also just seem not to trust him to actually help them if he becomes president. Its striking that while the majority of voters think they're worse of than four years ago, Harris is actually slightly [outperforming](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-poll-kamala-harris-policies-trump-democratic-convention-2024/) Trump on the metric of which candidate voters think will fight for someone like them.  DJT's recent momentum is not merely due to a gaming of the polls, as many on Reddit have been saying over the past week. From the article, his support is likely consolidating a bit, right before the election, as Republican leaning undecided voters lock in. (Note that the source I posted here, The Economist, is generally quite unfavorable to DJT, so I believe that what they're saying carries some weight).Some undecided voters are certainly locking in, but I think there's still enough weirdness in the polls to prevent us from calling the election decisively for Trump. To start, we don't know if the people locking in are true swing voters, or folks who always leaned towards Trump that have finally decided to hold their nose and vote for him. If the latter is the case, the changing numbers don't necessarily represent Harris losing momentum, or Trump really gaining any. In fact, if polls are accurate this just reflects a return to the razor thin margins of the 2020 election cycle. However, I think there's an anomaly in the polls that isn't getting talked about nearly enough. In several swing states with senate elections this year, Democratic candidates have maintained a much more significant lead, and are outperforming Harris by +3% in many cases. Some of this may be due to split ticket voters, but given increasing polarization of politics nation wide I would be surprised if that fully explains this gap. Instead, I wonder if there's a significant chunk of voters who are more motivated by state-level Democratic candidates, and share that they wouldn't be motivated to go vote for Harris on her own, but may still cast their ballot for her when they go to the polls. If that's the case, we could see a consolidation of some remaining undecided voters in Harris' favor when voting actually starts. __________________Having said all this, I hope I've given reason to reevaluate where this election is likely headed. Again, I think the outcome will likely be extremely tight, and will look more like 2020 than a blowout for either candidate. That said, I suspect there's reason to think Harris has some support that isn't being fully factored in, and that Trump's support may have maxed out, or even been overestimated. We won't know until election results are actually in, but I personally don't think there's a way to give the advantage to either candidate at a level outside of the statistical margin of error right now, barring one of them making a really awful gaffe.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"As a liberal with Jewish lineage, for its many flaws, I see the current administration as one that is protective towards Jews during a global and steep incline in antisemitic hate crimes.

Take the nearly universal conventional wisdom of punting on 4th down, for example. So boring and literally leaves you with 25% fewer chances to advance the ball within any given set of four downs. Lately youre seeing more teams breaking this rule and it is working in a ton of cases.  Thats what the democrats need to do. Play to win, stop playing not-to-lose.  You cant win if you dont have the ball. I think voters like candidates who play to win, and I think thats why democrats find themselves in these way-too-close elections.  The eggheads who run the Democrat party have way too much influence over the campaigns their candidates need to be runningto their detriment. Bean counters dont inspire the electorate to get out and vote, but they somehow have all the leverage over their partys campaign strategies, insisting on bad strategy that is supported by bad data and weak-ass instincts. There is an obvious pattern in Democrat campaigns where winning strategy is subordinated by narcissistic  leaders who have only earned their leadership position by virtue of their longevity in the party.  Its my turn now is absolutely a thing (and a problem) within the Democratic Party. They need to knock that shit off and play to win. I dont care whose turn it is. I just want to win the game. This time around, the democrats stumbled into a formula that might actually work. By not proceeding with the predictable run the incumbent strategy, theyve totally thrown Trumps campaign into disarray. Trump has been running against Biden for four years (at least), and all of that inertia disappeared like a fart in the wind when the democrats pivoted (for good reason) to Kamala. Stroke of luck that looks like a stroke of genius to me, and massive credit goes to Biden for this change in tack. I think a great strategy would be to keep building on this hide the ball strategy in future campaigns: one-term presidencies by design, setting up the sitting VP to be the next terms candidate. If we want the best ideas to win, and if we want to see those good ideas extend farther than only two terms (only to be tossed aside in the name of change after two terms) campaigns need to try something different. Republicans could never pull this off, be sure they love authoritarian leadership style. Democrats could totally make this work if they could do more of what they are doing this time around: be unpredictable (from the Republican campaign strategy POC), and be extremely committed to winning AS A PARTY.  The problem of ultra old candidates goes away when democrats arent selecting their candidate based on who has been waiting in line the longest (see Barack Obama).","title":"Kamala Harris Isnt Repeating the Mistakes of 2016"},{"text":"I don't think that's a good definition of \\"reasonable.\\" He says he knows that what he's doing is harmful and destructive to society, but his party allegiances willfully supersede his understanding of basic decency.","title":"Maher: The Left Is Far Too Willing to Stifle Freedoms for Power"},{"text":"Genocide is their red line but they're willing to tacitly seed power to the party that is openly supportive of the genocide and also is willing to cut funding to Ukrainians who will **abolutely be subject to a cultural genocide should they lose**.That doesn't feel like they care at all.

After the Bolshevik revolution they didnt just flip a switch and suddenly everything was socialized, it took years of collectivizing industries one by one and they were still attacked relentlessly by foreign capitalist governments in the meantime. The same process applies to your racism example. You remove the people in positions of power that are racist and uphold racist systems by revolutionary force and create new anti-racist systems to prevent backsliding like the US did after the civil war.

And they often do so by co-opting progressive social movements. Obama, for example, ran on a very progressive campaign and ended up being a centre-right president.In political theory, Liberalism is a centrist ideology. The US has no progressive political party. Liberals are (in American culture) often seen as \\"the good guy\\" to Republicans' draconian views and policy, but when push comes to shove they will most likely ally themselves with conservatives over progressives (especially in manners related to protecting the socio-economic status quo and the interests of their donors). Hell, for all the Project 2025 fearmongering, Kamala just came out and said she wants a strong Republican presence in her cabinet. Conservatives are a more open form of harmful, liberals are more insidious. If you are a progressive, neither one is aligned with your interests.

Now onto his point about Liberals using the issues of Black Americans to gain political power.. in a sense that's true because that's by design of a Democracy. You use the issues facing your constituents to gain political power to do something about it. I'm not sure why that's a bad thing.

So I can tell you what I think, as someone who voted for Bush twice and then McCain, then voted Obama for his second term and have gone D ever since. Im clearly not unbiased, but I dont consider myself a party shill. I think both parties are corrupt power machines, working only to keep themselves in power. I dont consider either political party to be morally superior to the other.

Can we not take a break from being so fucking angry _all the time_ and give a laugh?Ignore it, move on, don't engage. Absolutely. Laugh? Nah. Because it's not funny. He's actively pursuing policies that hurt working people. Like he's doing that *right* now. Life is harder for McDonald's employees because of his presidency and will be harder for them still if he wins again. Would you think it's funny if he cosplayed as a woman being refused an abortion? I mean, if he looks *really* out of place would that make the photo a *banger*?? Of course not. It wouldn't be funny at all. Laughing would be denying the harm his policies have done to women's rights and callous indifference to his work to do even worse with another term. The McDonald's stunt is the same vis-a-vis the working class who he so despises and for whom his policies are so dangerous and detrimental. Now, again, I don't think the stunt is that big a deal. I don't think it should have made the news. I think the media is (as ever) distracted by the shiny new thing and unable to cover Trump (or anyone, left or right, good or bad) well.So ignore it and focus on what's important. But laugh? Nah.

The project will replace Draw 1 C a 92-year-old bridge that links Amtraks Downeaster intercity passenger rail (IPR) service and four separate MBTA regional rail lines to North Station C as well as extend and activate a two-track platform at North Station and replace track, signals, and switches throughout the project area. Despite the poor condition of the bridge, Draw 1 functions as the primary portal for over 1,100 passenger trains each week into North Station, the fifth-largest transit station in the New England region. These trains are routinely subjected to delays attributable to project components, with 165 unique delay events between 2019 and 2021, and an average operational lag of 24.7 minutes. As regional rail ridership continues to grow, this project is critical to preserving and expanding future service in the Northeast. \\n* $217.2 million to the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority for the SouthPort Berth Phase 2: Capacity and Resilient Growth Optimization (CARGO) project in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project will increase resiliency and expand operational capacity at the Southport terminal by providing approximately ten additional acres adjacent to the Phase 1 berth development and adding a second berth downriver. PhilaPort, recognized as the fastest-growing port on the East Coast, will achieve cost-savings efficiencies from an improved terminal layout and will be more competitive as the project will provide capacity for additional roll-on/roll-off cargo. \\n* $68.6 million to the Iowa Department of Transportation for the Southwest Mixmaster Interchange Reconstruction project in Des Moines, Iowa. The project will reconstruct the existing I-35/80/235 interchange, which was constructed in the 1960s and is considered one of the most dangerous in the state. The interchange was built to handle 1,000 vehicles an hour C today, it carries an estimated 1,500 vehicles per hour and is expected to grow to 2,000 per hour by 2050. The reconstruction, which includes new flyover bridges from southbound I-35/80 to eastbound I-235 and to westbound I-80, will improve the safety and reliability of travel for people and freight through the region.In todays round of selections for the INFRA program, for which funding was increased more than 50% by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing $2.58 billion into 36 projects that will improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the movement of freight and people in and across rural and urban communities.*Selected INFRA projects this round include:** $196 million to the Michigan Department of Transportation for the River Raisin Bridge and Interstate 75 Revitalization project in Monroe County, Michigan. The project will replace the deteriorating River Raisin Bridge along I-75 with a new crossing to accommodate estimated future traffic, update and replace six existing structures C including two bridges over class I railroad lines C with new ones designed for a100-year lifespan, and reconstruct over two miles of roadway to improve safety and the efficiency of freight movement along this vital U.S.-Canada trade corridor. The I-75 River Raisin Bridge serves as a vital connection point between Detroit and Toledo and currently serves approximately 61,000 vehicles daily, with 25% being truck traffic. \\n* $86.6 million to the Mississippi Department of Transportation for the Improvements to the I-20/I-55 Freight Corridor project in Jackson, Mississippi. The project will update seven bridge structures to meet modern design standards, repair an additional 19 bridge structures, deploy Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) equipment, and resurface approximately 32 miles of roadway to enhance the movement of goods and people and reduce the number of fatal and injury crashes on this critical corridor. The excessively rough road surfaces in the project area cause significant travel delays for both trucks and cars, and the segment of I-55 between US Highway 49 and Pearson Road was identified in 2022 as the 6th worst freight bottleneck in the state.  \\n* $66.5 million to the Florida Department of Transportation for the U.S. 1/SR 5 Long Key Bridge Replacement project in Monroe County, Florida. The project will replace the current Long Key Bridge built in 1982. US 1 is the only roadway linkage across the Florida Keys for 113 miles between the mainland and Key West and is a critical emergency evacuation route for the Florida Keys. Additionally, freight movement over the Long Key Bridge is a lifeline supporting the Florida Keys economy C more than 134,000 trucks carrying an estimated $2 billion in freight cross the bridge each year. This replacement project is critical to the 72,000 people and hundreds of businesses located south of the bridge. ...  \\nAs with last years awards, despite these historic increases in funding, these programs were significantly oversubscribed. The Department received approximately 200 INFRA and Mega applications requesting more than $27 billion in funding, far exceeding the amount of funding available.  Applications for the MPDG grants were evaluated based on the criteria published in the NOFO. The criteria included safety; state of good repair; economic impacts, freight movements and job creation; climate change, resilience, and the environment; equity, multimodal options and quality of life; and innovation areas such as technology, project delivery, and financing. The Department also considered cost effectiveness, project readiness, and certain statutory requirements related to funding and design in evaluating the MPDG applications received. Rural Surface Transportation grant applications are still under evaluation, and the Department anticipates announcing selections by January 2025.Statement from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg:\\"Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris administration is carrying out ambitious, complex transportation projects that will shape our countrys infrastructure for generations to come, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. With this latest round of awards, dozens of major and much-needed projects C projects that are often difficult to fund through other means C are getting the long-awaited investments they need to move forward.","title":"Investing In America: Biden-Harris Administration Announces More Than $4.2 Billion From the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for Transformational, National Infrastructure Projects"},{"text":"Based on fraudulent polling numbers.\\nPlease I beg of everyone.

Second, if their vote is so important to the fate of Democrat's presidential candidate, then the Democrats should probably prioritize ending the genocide so they don't lose those important votes. The voters have political opinions and beliefs, they are supposed to vote for the candidate that most closely matches their beliefs. If a candidate wants their vote if is incumbent upon the candidate to earn it.

It keeps everyone grounded in the mission of the company, and makes sure people actually understand the business. If they have no clue how the other departments do their job through being exposed to that, then certain decisions could be made which don't integrate well into the rest of the company.2. Culture. Jobs often suck, no denying it, and sometimes we hate our coworkers and just want to get home. But work culture can also be important and enriching to the employees and customers. There are plenty of offices where this could be a very big reason to have employees actually come to the office, in order to be part of something bigger in person.3. Building on point 2, workplaces are in some sense also third places for some. We meet people, we form friendships, some people find romantic partners, when my mother died, my father's office coworkers came to her funeral because he was so beloved in their office. This social support system is an important part of the human experience. We thrive in relationship with others, so even while other people can annoy us, we also do better when we actually feel like we're part of a team, working together to solve a problem, among our tribe.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Nah, a pardon won't even be necessary.

A beach?)*, which means that the perception doesn't involve the genitals in the overwhelming majority of situations.Then it turns out she's got a penis.Hmm, is he now gay then? Or does one have to change the definition? Is he just a feminine-phile?Of course, the mature (LGBT ally) answer is to simply state that one can find both women and trans women pretty or cute, not give too much care towards pedantry/insecurity over genitals (\\"I am totally, totally obsessed with the details of pussy, even gnarly looking ones, trust me bro, I am all right\\" and therefore not get too hot and bothered about it.But if you support a creed or movement that doesn't accept the LGBT, **it's a monumental wrecking ball to manipulative or controlling political intents on gender.**At least gay men &amp; lesbians can be seen to be consistent with one another or more visible: a trans person and non trans person together makes it ambiguous, as well as the inconvenience of having to control the birth organs of trans men versus cis women.","title":"Donald Trump, an actual threat to democracy, claims its transgender kids who are a threat to democracy"},{"text":"Happy birthday!

Where exactly are you seeing people say that white liberals are the ultimate in good. CONTEXT MATTERS. Let me put this into context for you. Currently the GOP consists of Trump, a wanna be fascist despot, and the rest are LEGITIMATE religious extremists interested in setting an authoritarian theocracy in the US. If thats not bad in your opinion given we ALL already know exactly how EVERY religious authoritarian governments operate, then youre either full of shit, or living in a fantasy world. Anyways, given just how far the right has fallen just about anything in comparison is going to be seen as good in comparison thats literally how BAD these people on the right are. This is not Hyperbole, none of these people on the right are hiding their aspirations, believe them when they tell you they want an authoritarian theocracy in the US, they want to dismantle democracy. Thats issue 1, thats the highest priority. Once this literal threat to democracy has been dealt, maybe then we can all get back to living in reality and actually start trying to make this country a better place for all. So, just because people may not be voting for Trump, that doesnt mean ALL those people are on the same page and just assume that all liberals are just greatest people on earth. Again, context matters, democracy is literally on the verge on vanishing from the US. That should take priority over everything for every citizen in the US (assuming you actually prefer democracy). Anything else comes next after existential threat is dealt with first. Because If its not dealt with, then nothing else matters, literally. Im more alarmed that there is seemingly a fuck load of people in the US who arent alarmed by the fact that literal religious extremists are gunning for democracy in the US and they arent even being secretive about it","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"If lucifer is real.

Susan Ford Bales, the youngest child of the late president, issued her endorsement on Monday. She said that though she may disagree with some of her policies, Harris \\"recognizes the goodness and greatness in our country,\\" and will \\"defend the rule of law and our Constitution.\\" Ford Bales is the latest in a growing list of Republicans to publicly endorse the Democratic nominee. Her endorsement followed both Harris and former President Donald Trump campaigning in Michigan over the weekend in a bid to secure the battleground state, where Gerald Ford grew up. Ford was the 38th president, serving from 1974 to 1977 after the resignation of President Richard Nixon. He is the only president born in Nebraska, and died in 2006. Ford Bales is his only daughter. She is an author, photojournalist and the former chair of the board of the Betty Ford Center. Ford Bales said, \\"Vice President Harris and I likely disagree on some policy, but her integrity and commitment to those same principles that guided Dad have led me to conclude that Kamala Harris should be elected 47th president of the United States.\\" \\"I know she will work to bring all Americans together to move us beyond partisanship. That is what America deserves from our president, and that is why I am proud to endorse Vice President Harris for president of the United States.\\" \\"America cannot regress back to a divisive paradigm of loathing toward one another and disdain for our Constitution.

The vast majority of that time, this knowledge was not gleaned through any official channels, but through offhand encounters and discussions with other employees.  For a seasoned employee, work can probably be just as effective at home.  However, the experienced workers need to be in the same location the newer employees, or the knowledge chain will be broken. (2) some things need to be off record There are questions that sometimes need to be asked that wont be asked if the question has to be in writing or in another format that is easily recorded.(3) you dont even know what you dont know. Even if my company is great and I am free to ask questions, sometimes I dont even know that I have questions to ask. Maybe somebody completes a task surprisingly quickly using a trick that was never discussed.  Maybe a functionality exists for a machine or program of which I was unaware.  I would not even know to ask these type of questions. (4) summaryI think employers recognize these above points, which is why there is a push for RTO.

Our program becomes not the realization of socialism, but the reform of capitalism; not the suppression of the wage labor system but the diminution of exploitation, that is, the suppression of the abuses of capitalism instead of suppression of capitalism itself.That ultimately people who seek incremental change are looking to suppress the ills of a bad system instead of replacing that system with a better one, and that in order to achieve *actual* change you can't approach it with marginal progress.So when you say his gripe was that things weren't immediately solved, it's not quite the point.

Enya? More subtle, she is a Witch Queen and her subliminal magic, the imagery, the vibration, the sounds, what she makes you feel, what she makes you see, what she presents herself as, how she moves, it is all very intentional with these Warlocks and Sorcerers. The way to combat this? Consume that which makes you feel alive and motivated, the go-to music like that is often power metal or rap, put on displays or view paintings that give a magnitude of power and excellence that is not degenerate like Baal or some satanic obscure shit, but something an image straightforward as Alexander cutting the nerd knot, paintings that have no other goal in mind than to make you feel inspired, like the Norse Gods, Thor facing J?rmungandr or Wotan hanging from the world-tree, just anything that has relevance to you that inspires and makes you feel like a higher man, these spells, they're all meant to put you down, they're all meant to bundle your mind, be a brute, be a jock, be like Conan The Barbarian and that's enough to counteract these spells, and when you do hear their music and see their images, you will know who they come from because they always give off a certain vibe of witchcraft, occultism, and strangeness that will boggle your mind. Most people are under the spell, they are what they consume in the modern world, we all are, and you will notice that what they consume gives most people a false idea of reality, of what their ambitions should be, of what they should think of themselves because they're single, you see this type of incantation all the time, sulking and chanting doom-spells that make you feel like a cuck because your partner left you for someone else, or talking about status and getting money and cheap women who have no attraction to you other than for social climbing, that the world is so bad and terrible I'm jaded with the world like Kurt Cobain! Boo hoo. it's always so prevalent in the music today, it's the most popular programming and barely anyone keeps tabs on the lyrics and what emotions it makes you feel, Material girl? Madonna? Kitten Programming. Alan Parsons Project? Softcore Doomer, understand that music has variety for every emotion and that's good you should have music that will appeal to the states of the heart, but if you listen to certain popular artists they have one vibration no matter what they sing about that you just can't quite describe but you know you feel it, they make you feel it, but you can't quite describe it, that's a spell, that's a hidden programming, if it's a Warlocks' or Witches' music.","title":"Enya the high priestess in the music industry"},{"text":"Do you understand the concept of 40 years ago?

Most of it is tied up in Tesla stock. And Tesla is struggling. Theres build quality issues, poor service and the Cyber Trucks a disaster.

So Tesla is facing a major new competitor in the EV market. Elon borrowed from the Saudis to pay $44 billion for Twitter, now valued at $9 billion by Forbes. The Saudis would be within their rights to ask for more collateral on their loan due to its falling value - and that would probably be in Tesla stock, so Elon needs the share price to stay high. So why does Musk need Trump elected? Trump has said hell put a 100% tariff on imported EV cars, which would neuter BYD and save Tesla. Trump would also give billions to SpaceX. How much would stay in SpaceX I dont know. Its an alliance of money and power. For his public support Musk gets money and access to the president.

As a result, from what I've seen, there's a massive chunk of people who are considered \\"undecided\\". Personally, I think a lot of republican voters are going to sit out or vote for Kamala, and I don't think those voters are being accurately represented based on the polling questions.

We know Trump is in decline, he has been for years. What people are mad about is regarding Biden's inability to do his job and how the democratic party and those around him concealed the truth from the public. Now people want to pat him on the back or head like he's a \\"good boy who did his job,\\" when his term isn't finished yet? There are many faults in Biden's ability to be the head of the \\"leading superpower.\\" It is a real problem when this dude is the leader of the country and he can send troops anywhere and use nuclear launch codes, yet he can't even explain why a fascist shouldn't have your vote because he can't muster a full sentence. He never consistently speaks to the public now, and when he does it's off a teleprompter. Hell, it's a surprise when we get a speech from Biden now, because it means he's not off at a beach or some other kooky shit.","title":"Jill Biden says it was the right call for her husband to drop out of 2024 campaign"},{"text":"This is so boring that even Trump voters wouldnt care about this if they werent told to care by a senile old man.","title":"McDonalds has no record of Kamala Harris working there, contrary to the Harris's campaigns delusional statements"},{"text":"The charitable part of me wants to think she's trying to make a point about how even something as banal as a DA's power to prosecute can wreak horrible consequences on a person's life when abused.What stops that cold is the thinly concealed glee when describing those consequences that gives the whole thing a sadistic vibe. She doesn't fear harming a person like that, she enjoys the knowledge that she can.The last time I saw that open sadism out of her she was grilling Brett Kavanaugh. And I'd note as well that she was the closest to getting a rise out of him as well.
