I would agree he's cynically made no effort to put forward a platform. He has no ideas. He's lazily and impulsively taken to his podium and rambled aimlessly with low energy for months and months. His ramblings center on his own ego and id, as they always have. He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. Worst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. But you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.However, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. Obama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.Kamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her. And that's not the best campaign ever.

This is almost impossible unless the polls have been **MASSIVELY** off, but it's the only early night for Harris scenario.If one of GA/NC go blue, it's not looking good for Trump. He has to win 2/3 of PA/MI/WI to take it. Most likely scenario, unless both WI/MI flip blue early, is we're waiting on recounts and legal challenges in PA.If both GA/NC go red, we're just waiting on any of PA/MI/WI to go red. If they do, it's an early night. If both WI/MI go blue, we're back to the PA scenario above.In any scenario, if PA calls early due to overwhelming numbers out of every county except Philly, it's an early night.I think those are the only realistic scenarios.

The US military is in desperate need of bodies because it's [struggling to meet recruitment goals](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/368528/us-military-army-navy-recruit-numbers). With the wars brewing in the Middle East and the looming Russian threat over Europe, manpower needs are only likely to get worse. Also, one of the first lessons of the Russo-Ukrainian War is that manpower is critical to success in a long conflict. Russia is advancing largely because it has a nearly three-to-one population advantage over Ukraine, which allows it to sustain the severe casualties it incurs storming Ukrainian poistions. War between peer states is still largely a contest of manpower and industrial strength.There is little prospect of the draft being reinstated in the near future, but it is easy to imagine events that might require it later this century, such as war with China over Taiwan, a ground war in the Middle East, or a prolonged recruiting crisis. Then we will have to confront the question of whether a male-only draft is justifiable. Insisting that it will never come back - as some people surely argued, wrongly, after the American Civil War and World War I - feels to me like an attempt to avoid answering that question.","title":"CMV: American women have it amazing."},{"text":"Yeah guys, everyone knows that when you stop being friends with someone that supports a Hitler that you automatically are a mean girl.

Rotten people.At the peak of the nonsensical Covid era it wasn't uncommon for them to talk about \\"rounding us up into camps.\\" That was a normal thing to say and see heavily upvoted. And it wasn't just online -- I heard that at work.It reached a point where it was no longer a theoretical thing - it was me facing the loss of a job as a single earner who feeds my wife and four children, if I didn't take their useless and harmful injection.After that? All gloves off... They're as good as dead to me. There's no coming back from that. I was a supreme court decision from having to move my family into our van...The theoretical, \\"Well they're just doing this to push you to the other side\\" blahblahblah --- yes, sure, maybe so.But it was reality. They turned an entire political party into MONSTERS. Just rotten to the core, worthless walking garbage.Anyhow, it's not my fault I voted for Trump or voted against protecting gay marriage... It's their fault for trying to make my family homeless for not taking their death injections.If this election doesn't go their way? They did this.Not even \\"the powers that be.\\" I mean the Democrats on the ground. The *people*. When they excitedly censored half the country and forced people into their goddamned harmful injections and then silenced-and-denied when people were injured and killed...THEY did this.They could have said \\"NO.\\" I used to be a Democrat.But they didn't. And not only did they say \\"YES!!!\\" they wore their masks with pride, tried to force them on us, and shot themselves up and poisoned their own children with their godawful shots.So in the end, it's the people who did this.

Trump has been the most divisive political figure in recent memory, and not only did he play a primary role in facilitating January 6th, but his lies, his dangerous anti-democratic rhetoric, his constant fearmongering and his emotional tirades on Truth Social have solidified a movement of deranged fanatics willing to go to any length to protect *their* country from all of the big bad boogeymen that Trump and his allies incessantly warn us about.Trump has always appealed to the worst impulses of his supporters, their hate, their fears, their victimhood, their phobias and paranoid delusions. He is a beacon for white supremacist and violent, far right extremist groups.There are countless remarks to choose from, many of them unconstitutional threats that Trump has made against his opponents, whether on the ticket, in the media, or all around us, constantly scheming to undermine him, rig elections or assassinate him, plotting to weaponize every system of justice against him, to spread \\"fake news,\\" to relentlessly persecute him and his followers.He has convinced millions of his supporters that violence is a first and last resort against a radical leftist monolith and monster of his own making. One person said, \\"We aren't the violent ones. You lunatic leftists are the ones that burned our country down!!\\"This false equivalence always drives me crazy. These people have the audacity to minimize, whitewash, downplay the events of January 6th, and after all of their conspiracy theories fail to do so, they turn to this deflection, as if the two things are anything alike, as if one cancels out the other.But it doesn't work like that. Two wrongs do not make a right, and if we actually examine both events, something becomes apparent.What happened on Jan 6th was not only politically motivated, but almost solely carried out by Trump and his most fervent supporters. These violent rioters and agitators came to the Capitol at Trump's behest, they showed up for him, for their party, for themselves, and violently stormed the Capitol after being inundated with Trump's lies of a stolen election, after months of election fraud propaganda and misinformation confirmed their unfounded suspicions. They came that day to overturn the election for Trump because he had convinced them that there was no other recourse left, that \\"justice\\" had to be taken into their hands. Because at that point, Trump himself was out of options. This is Trump's swan song and January 6th was his magnum opus.It was a day of reckoning, a day of political extremism and violence. And if you take Trump out of the picture, January 6th does not go down in history as the day that democracy almost died.They came with weapons, as confirmed by the January 6th investigation, when Trump himself even acknowledged that the crowd had weapons with them. When confronted about it, Trump demanded that the magnetometers be taken down, that he didn't care that they had weapons, they were *his* people, they weren't there to harm *him*.And so they brought their weapons, they wore their T-shirts and hats, they brandished their flags and banners, they donned their political symbols, they chanted Trump's name and his slogans, adorned themselves with MAGA merch and clothes embroidered with Trump's portrait and favorite platitudes. From almost every standpoint, these people were a unified, political force, guided to the Capitol that day by Donald Trump, many of whom were willing to go to great lengths to vindicate him and his lies.What's the point to all this? To contrast this with the George Floyd protests, even though I shouldn't have to.By all accounts, a vast majority of the protests were peaceful, and the violence that did occur in proximity to those protests, was often escalated by police presence. Damn near every arrest made of those who participated in January 6th, involved a Trump supporter incited to rioting and violence by Trump himself.But a majority of those arrested over the summer of 2020, were not so called \\"radical leftists\\" or ANTIFA activists. Some were first time offenders, and many were taking advantage of the situation, some were even political provocateurs. And those that took advantage were harshly criticized. No democrat encouraged it, no democrat, to this day, tries to downplay what happened.The riots that did break out were not fomented or facilitated by any one political figure, former president or prominent Democrat in office. These people weren't garishly decorated in the political garb of their party and favorite candidate. They weren't chanting the name of their president, shouting his lies and slogans, carrying his flags, waving his banners, committing acts of violence and treason in his name, threatening to harm his opponents...Where the summer protests can be depicted as chaotic at times, sure, while millions demonstrated peacefully and condemned the outlying riots. January 6th can and certainly is categorized as a monolithic and collective act of political violence.It's also important to point out that the false equivalence applies to the fact January 6th was precipitated by lies, carried out by fanatics, centered around one man's ego, while the George Floyd protesters rallied around an actual cause, one rooted in reality, and a reality of decades of racial injustice, police brutality, a lack of accountability for authorities, race related discrimination and profiling, deep seated racism in the police force and more...","title":"Trump Said He Doesn't Need to Tell Supporters to be Non-Violent.

The CHIPS Act, the IRA, etc., has done a ton to help our economy from slipping into a recession. Inflation has been falling, and wage growth has been outpacing it for some time now. Much of what hasn't been fixed can be blamed on a divided congress and the House leadership being unwilling/incapable of passing legislation... granted that it's partially just logistically/politically complicated to pass things the closer we get to the election and that goes for both sides, especially when both bodies have such slim margins by which their coalition clings to its majority power. That being said, it is on brand for the GOP to essentially obstruct any meaningful legislation when the president is a Dem, so as to not give them any accomplishments to campaign on, not to mention Trump and Co. torpedoing the bipartisan immigration reform bill, just to keep it broken so he could campaign on the \\"invasion\\" narrative. Despite all the challenges, we have suffered far less than almost any other industrialized country in terms of inflation. Did I mention unemployment is very low and stable?

Amendment to Limit Government\\nInterference with Abortion:\\nNo law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patients health, as determined by the patients healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislatures constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\\nThe proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida. The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time.

If that was the operation --- reverse psychology, basically --- then worked. We won't know until the election outcome is known.If Trump takes office? Then it was absolutely the plan.  There are no accidents. No shakeups.*People who are a threat to the system are not allowed into the system.*Anyhow, you're right. And I knew that even as I voted for him. But still, it's what I had to do and I have no regrets. It was either that or... what, vote for Kacklamala?I've been voting 3rd party ever since Obama forced Americans to buy private health insurance. It never goes anywhere though.So yeah I guess I sided with the other salesman. It's still better than the other one. Our system is a farce, and we need instant-runoff elections and proportional representation.None of that will ever happen, though. And our votes don't even really matter. The powers that be get the election outcome they want, I firmly believe.All of this is to give us the illusion we have any say in it.Anyhow, with all that -- I still hope Democrats have a bad night and a miserable 8 years. And miserable lives. Just to be perfectly honest, after what I faced in 2021 with their nonsense I wish the worst on the whole lot of them.I also voted against gay marriage protections on a proposition today. Why? Because most gays sided with forced masks &amp; coercive vaccine mandates. So now I on no longer on their team for that, either.So am I being fooled? No, I'm responding to them being fooled and being horrible to me. So screw them.Spite is now my primary political identity. lol","title":"Trump has eaten too many carrots ??"},{"text":"Hey guys, now that we've proven that we'll follow through on our extremist agenda, let's threaten even more rights of the people who make up the majority of the electorate body","title":"Trump snaps at reporter when asked about abortion: 'Stop talking about it'"},{"text":"Damn hope yall have some sort of camera","title":"Look what these Trump supporters did to my uncles car today"},{"text":"I was under the impression the point of naming it \\"Douglass Commonwealth\\" was so we could still call it D.C.

Otherwise B has zero incentive to change, sincd they already have your vote in their pocket. It kind of sucks that people are wasting time on this discussion now at the 11th hour. The politicians did the math and locked in their stances. They found that there are more people (group X) who would not vote if their party didn't give *unconditional* support to Israel than than people who would not vote if the politicians continued to financially support the genocide (group Y). You can even have a situation where 90% of voters condemn the genocide but not enough to risk a loss, but if group X is bigger than group Y, then the politician logically has to side with X. That's the cost of voting out of fear rather than what you stand for.And then people will blame group Y, when not only are there more people who would not have voted from group X, but many many more folks who are voting for someone like Trump.

Thats all it tookIf libertarians were genuine about their ideology, they could probably get a very large % of the national vote.

They cited a variety of reasons, but it mostly all came down to the fact that he was a liberal. There isn't anything you could have said to them to change their mind. Voting Biden was always a bridge too far.From what I've seen, the people who refused to vote Dem because of the Gaza genocide are broadly the same people who refused to vote Dem back in 2020. Even back then, when there wasn't an ongoing genocide, they found some kind of reason not to vote for Biden. Some said it was about Healthcare, others said it was the children still in cages on the border, others said it was about the DNC shafting Bernie in the primaries, etc.. I'm convinced that, even if Dems weren't supporting genocide, this particular group of internet leftists would just find some other reason to abstain from voting blue. They'd say Democrats are too moderate on LGBT issues, or they'd criticize their rightward shift on immigration. The reason they've all gravitated specifically towards citing this one issue this time around is because there's a certain punchiness to \\"I won't vote for genocide\\" that \\"I won't vote for insufficient Healthcare reform\\" lacks. The genocide itself isn't actually all that relevant to their thought process-- it's just a convenient excuse for doing what they were already planning on doing. So I wouldn't say it's correct that these voters don't care about those other issues. I think they genuinely do, to some extent. It's just that they're lying when they say Gaza is the sole reason they're withholding their vote. If the genocide wasn't happening, a different issue would suddenly take its place.","title":"CMV: those who don't vote because of a single issue (e.g. Gaza) don't care about any other issues"},{"text":"I bet it was an inside job by the deep state","title":"Look what these Trump supporters did to my uncles car today"},{"text":"Elon mentions it in the conversation.

People literally believed that homosexuality was a *rare* thing because very very few people were out of the closet.Anybody born after about 1990 really can't grasp where society was with LGBTQ sensibilities before that time.  There were a tiny number of culturally significant people, like John Waters, who were willing to go \\"I don't give a rip *what* society wants, I'm going to just be very open about this stuff that nobody wants to talk about, and I'm going to make movies and musicals about it,\\" but he, and those like him, were seen as *subversive*, bordering on terrorists.  Gen X was probably the first generation that even *began* to question whether any of this stuff even *was* subversive.

From my understanding, if you did see unemployment rates of like 1%, that would be indicative of an economy where there is a severe labour shortage and so the cost of wages would boom, inflation would get out of control and it would harm long term stability of the economy. People are over-focusing on that point, it's macro-econ stuff and essentially no one understands it, me included, it's not intuitive at all, so maybe it's wrong to say that it's lower than it should be, and there is a better phrasing of the point. Regardless, inarguably there isn't a problem of unemployment at the moment and cutting down the labour force will hurt the economy and make the cost of living increase.","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.

For starters polling taken just after an assassination attempt is clearly going to skew the figures, similar to polling last year when Turmp was up on charges. When supporters see injustice, or worse a direct attempt on their guy's life, they're gonna be mad. A lot of respondents would simply be up for defending their counties interest with force against anyone.I find polls that delve into partisan animosity far more interesting.. In what should be a belief, support for partisan violence is fsr lower than what broader polling would suggest. As below-  Support for any type of partisan violence is low as fewer than 4% of Americans support violent crimes like assault or arson against political opponents.This one's interesting, and concerning given the numbers should really be 0%.. Slightly more D's support politically motivated murder than R's. Pretty wild that these numbers would indicate a few million people out there are ok with killing over political differences... In like manner, most Americans do not support politically-motivated murder. At 2.1%, Democrats show slightly higher levels of support for this type of partisan violence as compared to Republicans at 1.8%.Also interesting to see the demographics of people who support violence against their political opponents - the affluent, educated and presumably liberal is surprising, the extreme MAGA supporters not so much. I know who I'd back in a fight though... Support for partisan violence concentrates among young, male, wealthy, non-white, and more educated Americans, according to the report. Support for partisan violence for those under 30 is 5.8% as compared to 1.7% for those above 30, illustrating that young people support this type of violence at nearly three times the rate of the older age group. And among Republicans, MAGA Republicans support partisan violence 1.2 times more than other members of their partyAre colleges pumping their privileged students full of hate in the same way hard done by MAGA zealots indoctrinate themselves? Plenty more to look into, but I wanted to highlight a couple of the crazier findings...Food for thought [source](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/02/study-most-americans-do-not-support-partisan-violence)","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"It is not a choice to be gay","title":"Voting FOR My Interests"},{"text":"I like the freak out over the prospect of wives voting differently than their husband's.

Brawls broke out between pig &amp; turkey farmers who were not being paid to sit on their ass and the soy farmers who were. It was utterly hilarious to watch soy farmers who claimed they voted against socialism only to become the very definition of it. Perdue had to leave ina fuckin hurry. More than a few soy farmers in Minnesota went broke. Capitalism, the free market and democracy brings out the worst in people, BUT, so far it's still the best way to peace and prosperity. This is what people like Ronald Reagan believed in and showed everyone it's the better avenue. What tariffing will do to the United States is move us towards a hybrid socialist economy like the authoritarian capitalism China has employed. Tariffing leads to millions of unintended consequences. People like me just aren't that into becoming the things Reagan warned us about. I just don't believe you are smarter and more prescient than Reagan. That's all I got. Hope it makes sense.","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.
