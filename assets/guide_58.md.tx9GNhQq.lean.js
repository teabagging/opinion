At the same time, I think Biden realized that the only reason Hunter Biden was being prosecuted the way he was, was because he was Biden's son. If Hunter Biden had been anyone else but the son of Joe Biden, the GOP would not have been interested in him. They would not have pressured the judge not to accept the plea bargain. Hunter, if he were not Joe Biden's son, would not have been a potential target for whoever will be the next AG. His dickpicks would not have been entered into the Congressional record. Hunter Biden was a target for the GOP specifically because he was Joe Biden's son. And for no other reason. Not because of the drug abuse, not because of the gun charge, not because of the tax fraud. Only because he was Joe Biden's son was he a target for Trump. In my view, that justifies Joe Biden pardoning his son to stop the illegitimate witch hunt the GOP has pursued against Hunter Biden. Given that we can expect a lot of chaos after Trump gets into office, and Trump probably needing a scapegoat to distract the MAGA masses, it is not weird to think Hunter Biden would once again have become the target of GOP persecution.

He pitched the idea of using private funds to rescue the Hubble space telescope rather than just let it burn up in re-entry after eventual retirement. His privately funded Inspiration 4 and Polaris missions demonstrate a good deal more than just high-cost recreational excursions - as real science and technology testing were accomplished on those flights. The beforementioned consulting with NASA on ideas to replace Hubble's reaction wheels and re-boost it to extend its life, even potentially without taxpayer funding was novel - it would be nice to see Hubble's useful life extended.  On the topic of SLS; The launcher, Orion capsule it carries, and the associated ground infrastructure have cost close to 85 billion dollars total to date when accounting for inflation. (23.8 of which is just SLS launcher) It has so far flown only once. Cost per launch will be an estimated 2 billion.By comparison, the final cost to develop Falcon 1 was 90 million, Falcon 9 was just $390M ($554M inflation adjusted). Estimated launch costs for a mission (non-crew) is 62 million, so for the cost of SLS (just the launcher) you could redevelop Falcon 9 all over again and launch it 370+ times. The Crew Dragon program came in originally at 2.6 billion with 6 crewed missions wrapped up in that cost. 10 NASA flights have been flown so far after continuing contracts for flight services. A falcon 9 crew launch to the space station is about 256 million a pop - or 55 million a seat. (Compared to the 90 million we paid per seat on Soyuz)There's a pretty good reason SLS is on the chopping block. It's powerful, and capable - but excruciatingly far from anything resembling cost effective. Orion can do long distance and duration spaceflight, but also overly expensive for what it delivers. ULA's Vulcan launcher, and Blue Origin's New Glenn are far better contenders to compete with SpaceX on launch cost - if they can succeed in maturing those systems. Plenty of reasons to be excited for the space program in the coming years and decade. SpaceX is pushing costs down far enough to make multitudes of otherwise unrealistic missions viable. More competitors and private investment will only help.","title":"Trump Picks Billionaire Jared Isaacman as NASA Administrator"},{"text":"Can you share a publication in good repute that discredits it?","title":"Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in United States v.

It was always a very tenuously held-together government. Well, the PM Michel Barnier tried to pass a budget bill that was opposed by both the left and the far-right, which cut spending and raised taxes. When it was clear that the budget bill didnt have the support of a majority of Parliament, he tried to force it through using a controversial provision of the French Constitution. This outraged both the left and the far-right, so they called a no confidence vote on the government, which succeeded. However, since the French Constitution says that there must be a year between parliamentary elections, this means that there cannot be an election until next July. In the meantime, Macron must appoint a new Prime Minister. No one is sure who he is going to appoint yet.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 4, 2024"},{"text":"This.

One could argue its a bad trend, given that Lloyd Austin sucks, and James Mattis was very disloyal to Trump.But ultimately its the generals who are making the military strategies, and the Secretary of Defense is a liaison between those generals and the president, communicating the presidents goals to the generals.So the question becomes Will the generals respect Hegseth enough to listen to him? Because if they dont respect him, the end result may be that Trumps agenda gets stymied.It also depends on what Trump wants to accomplish. If he doesnt really want to make any major changes to DoD, and just wants a cheerleader who can smile to the camera and wont say anything bad, Hegseth may be fine.But if Trump wants to make any significant reforms to DoD, he should expect resistance from the top brass, and then it becomes a question if Hegseth can handle that resistance.","title":"Why is this sub so quiet about the full on, Kavanaugh style assault on the Hegseth nomination?"},{"text":"I think it's so funny how they keep egging on the people who outnumber them by hundreds of millions.The reason they're so scared of the poor is they're willing to use violence against the poor and are terrified of being treated how they treat the poor.","title":"Ramaswamy Once Called DOGE Partner Elon Musk a Circus Monkey for China"},{"text":"Thanks, I'll have to give that a read later.I wouldn't go so far as to claim everything Trump does is 4d chess, he absolutely makes fucked up and completely stupid decisions sometimes, but I disagree with the MSM/liberal \\"intelligentsia\\" portrayal that he has no plans or schemes at all The premise of the original article in early 2018, from the near end of [Russiagate investigation was this](https://archive.is/bFlNF) ...What follows is an attempt to divine Trump's foreign policy. It proceeds from the assumption that he does know what he's doing (as he did when he decided to run in the first place) and that he does have a destination in mind... ...We start with four remarks Trump often made while campaigning...Trump is saying that1) the post 911 military interventions did nothing for the country's security;2) foreign interventions impoverish the country;3) the alliance system is neither useful nor a good deal for the country;4) Russia is not the once and future enemy.A Chinese leader might call these the Three Noes (no regime change wars, no overseas adventures, no entangling alliances) and the One Yes (cooperation with Russia and other powers)....There is a powerful opposition in the United States to the Three Noes and One Yes. And it's not just from the neocon/humanitarian interventionists: most Americans have been conditioned to believe that the USA must be the world's policeman, arbiter, referee, example. ...How to get out of these entanglements? It's too late to hope to persuade the legions bleating that \\"America must lead\\"... Consider the famous story of the Gordian Knot: rather than trying to untie the fabulously complicated knot, Alexander drew his sword and cut it. How can Trump cut The Gordian Knot of American imperial entanglements?By getting others to untie it.He walks out of the Paris Agreement (\\"a watershed moment when it comes to debating Americas role in the world\\"). And the TPP (\\"opened the door toward greater Chinese influence, and wont benefit the U.S. economy in the slightest\\"). His blustering on Iran caused the German Foreign Minister to express doubts about American leadership. He brusquely tells NATO allies to pay their own way (\\"Americas NATO allies may be on their own after November if Russia attacks them\\"). By announcing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel he unites practically everybody against Washington and then uses that excuse to cut money to the UN.

In particular the underlying research assessing the current limits of our understanding of gender affirming care in children.See fairly well known public health epidemiologist, Gideon M-K (who is pro-trans rights and access to care), assessment on the Cass report:Critics say that the review was biased, excluded a whole host of important research, and failed to engage with the very community it claims to serve. Proponents argue that the review has proven beyond any doubt that there is no evidence for hormones, puberty blockers, and the like, and that giving any medical assistance to children for transition is therefore entirely unethical.I disagree with both of these arguments. **The actual scientific studies that formed the basis of the Cass review - the systematic reviews in particular - were generally quite good. I cannot find any serious, discrediting problems with much of the data underlying the report. The argument that the review is completely inadequate because it discarded all of the studies which were not randomized clinical trials is simply incorrect. There are notable strengths to the review, which are important to understand before ignoring the findings entirely.**Conversely, there are clear errors in the review. Not only are there large conceptual gaps, there are numeric and scientific mistakes that call into question some of the key arguments made in the document. There are places where the authors have relied on extremely low-quality science to make expansive pronouncements, and other places where more high-quality research is almost entirely ignored. In addition, one of the main findings of the review is that the central belief of many opponents to medical care for trans children - that kids are getting hormones and puberty blockers with no assessment in staggering numbers - is simply false. Somehow, this finding has barely been touched on in the report, even though it is a pretty important finding. https://gidmk.substack.com/p/the-cass-review-intro","title":"Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in United States v.

Because we lived it. We spent years, if not decades, dealing with a body that we hated almost as much as the people persecuting us. We tried every single thing possible to avoid transitioning as we knew it would get us killed. But nothing worked. Had I not transitioned, I would have died in 2021. I wish I transitioned as a teenager, or even as a young adult. At least then I'd have my whole life ahead of me instead of thinking about the decade I wasted trying to deal with myself.Transitioning early gives people the best outlook on life. Late transitioners (age 30+) have high poverty rates, high homeless rates and are often arrested on trumped up charges for looking weird. There's a reason that the gay district in San Francisco is the Castro while the trans district is the Tenderloin. You know, where all the homeless people live? That's not a coincidence. SF Trans Pride was probably a covert sweep that got the approval of Governor Newsom. If Kim Petras waited until she was my age to transition, she never would have become a millionaire. She would have spent her life cleaning toilets in a Cologne train station.Older generations want the newer generations to live better lives than they did and this is no different. I want trans kids to never go through what I had to. That's the same reason why I support trans athletes, because trans people are almost expected to live in poverty and any chance to improve things is a net good in my book.","title":"Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in United States v.

She had only enough money left for about two more years. This is the future of Social Security.

I do not pray for politicians, but I have the same hope for Trump and America these next 4 years as I did with Biden, Trump when he was last president, Obama, bush (was very young when Clinton was in office so only know what history tells me about him) and all other people who make decisions that impact my life.

So, when 50% of the voting public supports Trump, it's reasonable that the same number of veterans do. And like the rest of the Trump-voting country, they just block out (or never hear) all the negative things. So what's the problem?There's a lack of diverse veterans groups in today's world, so the vet groups that do exist (Legion, VFW) tend to themselves be politically polarized and partisan. There's been a bunch of articles, even before Trump, talking about how none of these organizations are appealing to more recent veterans and I suspect the sort of veterans (such as myself) who stay away are also more in line with anti-Trump sentiment. So they become echo chambers. It doesn't help that if I did go to a local VFW, the active members sign in their non-veteran friends who just want to argue politics, making it even more of a turn off. Other than that, it's the usual rural and urban divide. Veterans in the cities have 100 different things they can go do. Veterans in rural areas don't have much to do, socially, except go sit at a bar and drink and it's cheaper for them to do so at the local VFW or Legion post so that's where they end up. I couldn't hope to get a word in edgewise, in any political topic, at my local rural VFW because I'd be quickly shot down and outnumbered. I'm not saying I'd be bullied out of talking at all, or even that I'd be ostracized for disagreeing... but I would not be changing anyone's mind, and it's not worth the mental energy attempting to (remember, we are talking about a bunch of drunks anyway.. but drunk or sober, they still reinforce their shitty positions).","title":"The veterans groups and media need to press Trump for a response."},{"text":"Look long and hard at those maga stickers on your hardhat.You got what you wished for.","title":"'Gut punch': Trump upsets local union leaders by opposing U.S. Steel-Nippon deal"},{"text":"The Media and the likes of McConnell will not rest until the cabinet is all deep state actors.","title":"Trump floats DeSantis as potential defense secretary replacement if Hegseth falters"},{"text":"My husband transitioned as a child and he wouldnt be here if he didnt.

Parents insurance didn't cover me anymore. Economy tanked. Finding work became a real nightmare for a recent graduate. My COBRA insurance was cancelled because the insurance company delayed processing my online payment and blamed me for non-payment. No recourse. Immediately cancelled. Tried applying for new insurance to be denied because of pre-existing conditions aka controlled high blood pressure. I eventually found work but I also had to take whatever I get and started my career making about 20k less than I expected. This delayed my move out of my parents. Just an all around shit show and bad start.\\nVoted for Obama in 2008 because at least the idea of trying to fix the system was one of his goals. ACA wasn't great but it was something. But more importantly it made so pre-existing conditions weren't an immediate denial and it allowed people to stay on family insurance until 26.Big win for the little guy. Now I'm well into my career. I never benefited from those wins but I knew people younger than me wouldn't have to deal with that BS. And now there is a good chance a large part of the country is going to lose coverage and benefits from ACA. And if we go into a major recession, the young people are going to be competing against a market full of experienced millenials who are willing to take pay cuts to pay the bills.

It was attributed to Jackson posthumously, but it doesn't make any sense. It was attributed to him in reaction to the *Worcester v. Georgia* case - but the federal government wasn't a party to the case and there was no federal enforcement requested or needed. The case involved the detention of a dude in Georgia prison and the order was for Georgia to release him.Then the idea that Jackson perhaps WOULD have not enforced it doesn't stand up to scrutiny (although his political adversaries were ready to make such argument). The decision was issued in March 1832 and the court recessed. It would not convene again until January 1833.In related news, South Carolina issued an Ordinance of Nullification - another example of a state defying federal authority and Jackson had to manage the Nullification Crisis and he was ready to use force. In December of 1832, Jackson issued the Nullification Proclamation and reiterated federal troops would enforce federal power. So, in December of 1832, Georgia rescinded the law that Worcester was convicted under and they let him go. In the mean time, between 1832 and 1833, Georiga Governor Lumpkin was lobbied by Martin Van Buren and John Forsyth to release Worcester, which ended up being successful.In January of 1833, Congress passed the Force Bill that authorized federal force against states that tried to nullify federal law. Lastly - Worcester's case had no impact because the congress already had passed the Indian Removal Act and a case stating that a state can't act but Congress can didn't have any impact, and removal was already underway.","title":"CMV: JD Vance and Trump will try to coup the government"},{"text":"'Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire.'Except gold doesn't corrode, silver barely.Take that poor people!

Personally, if we could guarantee Russia wouldn't deploy nuclear weapons I'd like to see NATO turn the Russian front lines into smoking holes in the ground, but that just isn't a realistic option right now.

(They both rely on these programs) He said, Ill be dead before that ever happens. I asked again, rewording that the issue would be fast-tracked in the hypothetical scenario. He said, Trump would never let that happen.My conclusion is that if Trump supporters are anything like my MAGA parents, it's all blind faith. Anyone who has ever had the pleasure of speaking with deeply religious folks or a person with this perception, blind faith, has witnessed their reactions when things go as forewarned, which almost always goes something like this: It was God's will, It is what it is, Ive been through tough times before, or Im built for this.I see it as pride. They are too proud to admit they were wrong, but admitting would mean fault. The reality is that their situation will sour until it's too late, and they will either cry for help or cry foul.

The root of the problem is that the benefits process has been come gamified, with whole industries cropping up on how to file paperwork, what to fill out, and what to say on the paperwork to generate benefits.

The plan to exterminate Jewish Germans was not presented to the public, and most Germans would not have supported that if the nazis had said that was their plan before they took office. I agree that deportations and removing citizenship are not the same as a genocide, but you cannot reasonably deny the fact that they were precursors to the holocaust. Jewish citizens had their citizenship rights stripped before any death camps were built. Hitler tried to take power in the beer hall putsch and was given a light punishment by the government, and then a few years later he was chancellor. Donald Trump tried to seize power on January 6 2021, and has not been punished at all and all of his charges have been dropped, and he is now about to be sworn in to the presidency again. This does not water down the horrors of the holocaust, it is a warning to the people here that something similar could happen.The Madagascar plan was a half brained scheme that would never work, fine. Is trumps mass deportation plan not also a half brained scheme that nobody believes would actually work? I fail to see the distinction you are trying to make here.Stephen Miller is slated to become the deputy chief of staff for policy for the second Trump administration. That means the guy who is in charge of policy wants to do these things, with a republican majority in the house and senate and a friendly Supreme Court who has ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for any official act. Forgive me if I dont trust our institutions to save us from these guys enacting their stated goals.Just because something hasnt happened yet or is not official policy does not mean that it will not happen or that there are not people actively working to make it happen. That is exactly the point I am trying to make, we should stop it before it happens.I understand that you think nobody wants to repeat history but I would argue that there are a lot of people here who would like to repeat that history. Trumps pick for secretary of defense has a history of making bigoted remarks like kill all Muslims and has tattoos related to the crusades. I dont think he would be opposed to rounding up Muslims to put into camps if he had the opportunity. It is important for us to recognize fascism in its infancy stage so that we know what we are up against.

And it is a fantastically successful one. My figures are dated, but when I studied SS 50% of seniors would live in poverty without SS and only 10% do after SS.\\nThats an 80% reduction in poverty among the elderly. The only way to reduce poverty among those too old to work is through subsidies.\\nHow does SS create subsidies?\\nRevenue: SS taxes everyone 6.2% of lifetime wages (up to the earnings cap). (Times 2 for employer match and the additional 1.45% is for Medicare HI (Health Insurance), not OASDI (Old Age, Survivors Disability Insurance).) So everyone PAYS the same rate.\\nExpense: When you retire, your benefit is calculated by determining your Average Indexed (for inflation) Monthly Earnings (AIME). Your SS benefit is determined as:\\n90% up to X of AIME plus\\n32% of AIME from X to Y plus\\n15% of AIME over Y\\nSomeone who earned X for their AIME RECEIVES 90% of lifetime earnings and someone whos AIME is the cap RECEIVES 28% of lifetime earnings.\\nDid you get that? The poor person pays 6.2% and receives 90% the\\nrich person pays 6.2% and receives 28%. (Rich is in quotes because many middle-class skilled laborers without college degrees earn the SS maximum.)\\nI did some actuarial calculations once and the poor person (receives 90%) earns about a 15% return on taxes (over a period where the S&amp;P returned 12%) and the rich person earns about a 0% return (an interest free loan.

They couldnt keep that going forever, and now Mexican avocados are more available in the U.S. The federal government also just approved import of Hass avocados from Guatemala. That has led to lower prices for consumers. Now, imagine if a 25 cent tariff is imposed on each foreign grown avocado that we import. Consumers obviously pay that. A small number of farm owners who grow avocados in the U.S. will benefit from, but everyone else who buys avocados will be affected negatively.

Scholars like Sheldon Wolin theorized this was caused by inverted totalitarianism (corporate control of our country).

I still find it to me off^ the mark, but ridiculous was a little rude to you as a fellow human, I apologize for that. I get the concern, and yeah, history is worth paying attention to, but the parallels being drawn here are a bit over the top. The Nazi regimes solutions werent just about deporting people - they were working toward systematic extermination, which is obviously a whole different level. Deportations or changes to citizenship laws, no matter how controversial, arent the same as genocide. Full stop. Comparing the two can kind of water down the actual horror of what happened in the Holocaust. The Madagascar Plan, for instance, was this absurd, impractical idea that Hitler floated to relocate Jews - obviously horrific in its own right - but its a completely different ballgame from modern debates about immigration policy. The intent behind those plans was rooted in a desire to annihilate a population, not just enforce borders or reform citizenship laws.And yeah, people bring up Stephen Miller or Trump and try to draw these straight lines to facism, (which I am not saying I disagree with wholly), but you gotta keep some perspective here. Immigration crackdowns and even extreme proposals arent inherently the same as creating labor camps or carrying out genocide. Thats a pretty massive leap, and it doesnt really help the conversasion when we start treating everything as a direct echo of the worst moments in history.As for denaturalization, its been talked about, valid point, but so far, its not a policy in practice. And even if something like that was attempted, theres a legal and democratic process in the US that, for all its flaws, is still a LOT different than what Nazi Germany was doing when they had unchecked power. Saying the Supreme Court wouldnt stand in the way of something like this feels speculitive at best. At best. I get where the worry comes from, seriously - nobody wants to let history repeat itself - but not every bad policy or authoritarian move is a sign were heading straight into facism. Theres a difference between being vigilant and being alarmist, and its worth keeping the two separate if were going to have a productive discusion about these issues.

The Nazi party had several solutions to the Jewish problem before they settled on mass extermination. Their first plans were to send Jewish people to what was called Palestine at the time. They removed citizenship rights from Jewish Germans and forced them to live in ghettos. The nazis built labor camps for political dissidents and sent communists and socialists to those camps first. Their next solution was to send them to Madagascar. When they realized that no other country wanted to take in such a large number of immigrants, as well as the cost and logistical problems that come with deporting all those people, they commissioned companies in Germany to come up with an industrial plan to kill the people held in their labor camps. The point that the plans are convoluted and incredibly expensive does not invalidate the similarities between trumps plan and the Nazi plans, it actually reinforces the parallels.While the public plan so far only targets illegal immigrants, Stephen Miller and others in the Trump administration also plan to carry out a denaturalization plan, which would remove birthright citizenship from anyone whose parents were not US citizens at the time they were born. It is easy to see how once they achieve this, they will be able to move on to any children of immigrants they want to target, going back generations to invalidate the citizenship rights of whole families. Considering the current supreme courts rulings regarding presidential immunity and other constitutional elements, I do not have faith that there will be any roadblocks put up by the Supreme Court to stop this. You mention the slow chipping away of the legal status for Jewish Germans, but this is exactly what Stephen Miller and others would like to do to legal immigrants and their children here.I also fail to see the distinction you make between what is happening here and the direct unwarranted abomination of a brainwashed populace in economic decline. The Nazi party at its height enjoyed the support of 30-40 percent of the German population, and the American population is experiencing economic decline and just elected a strongman figure to save them. This is the story of fascist dictatorships all throughout history.There are others in this administration that would like to include other groups in their plans. RFK jr was quoted saying anyone who take ADHD medication should be sent to federal labor camps for three years to get their mind right. Im sure I dont have to point out the parallels there.Germans did not support the holocaust until it was well underway. The thing about living in these societies is that people will recalibrate their opinions based on who is performing the action. Republicans have gone back on their word on social security and healthcare, and their voters change their minds as soon as the politicians tell them what to believe. The Nazi party did not start building the camps on day one, it was a slow burn/boiling frog situation where the populace was given a bait and switch message. People are likening the past to the present because there are undeniable similarities. Even with our iPhones, we as a nation still fell for a fascist whose actions parallel Adolph Hitlers very closely at this stage in his political career. While not everything will match up 100%, there are still too many similarities to be discounted.Making a better world for generations to come involves stopping atrocities before they happen. We cannot look the other way until the news comes out that the American government has been killing the people in its deportation camps and then pretend like we had no idea this could happen all along.","title":"How would Donald Trump carry out his mass deportation scheme?"},{"text":"Ukraine must begin manufacturing couches.","title":"Trump's plan for Ukraine comes into focus: Territorial concessions but NATO off the table"},{"text":"They probably want to stay far away from him at this point.","title":"Trump's children won't have White House roles in his second term"},{"text":"What stops Putin from invading more?

Plus, giving big tax breaks or federal grants to these companies would likely cause huge public backlash, especially since people already criticize private prisons for cutting corners and profiting off human suffering.Deportations arent just about building detention centers or hiring contractors. The immigration courts are already overwhelmed, and deportation cases take time because people still have rights to due process, especially asylum seekers. On top of that, deporting millions of people would cost a fortune, and it would require cooperation from state and local authoritieswho might not even want to help. Lets not forget the U.S. also needs agreements with other countries to accept deportees, and thats a whole other challenge.Finally, the idea that stocks will skyrocket assumes privatization would somehow solve all these problems, which it wouldnt.

You might be able to argue under the 4th for privacy protections between you and your doctor but there is really no right to any medical care.  We've banned other medications broadly in the past, but this would be the first case that would ban really any medical treatment *for a specific medical diagnosis*.  This is a wild new frontier if allowed.  The ability for a State to ban treatment for any arbitrary medical diagnosis, even if that treatment is used for other conditions.I have no idea if SCOTUS would rule on that, and I don't know if the scope of the argument includes bans based on diagnosis since the question in Skrmetti is based on discrimination by gender and not discrimination by diagnosis.","title":"Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in United States v.

The only reason Japanese citizens were forced to work during their internment was due to being cited as national security threats  to do so against largely latino communities would not only be wildly dubious, but would more importantly alienate an increasing latino voter base that Republicans rely on. If you are held due to immigration law, you are not subject to forced labor - it is voluntary by law. Even if this were to somehow be enforced - it would be a direct violation of the fifth amendment, that has precedent due to Japanese internment, which resulted in reparations.Even the 13th amendment protects civil punishment for illegal immigrants to forcibly work for free or against their will. An exception would be if any illegal immigrants not only violated civil law for entering the country, but criminal law - which would still entitle them to due process under the constitution, and this would be enormously time consuming and expensive. Additionally, the 5th and 14th amendment also protect due process regardless of citizenship. These notions also break with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO. The only way to overturn three different constitutional amendments is for an overwhelming majority of both the house and senate, and even if that were to occur - it would need to be ratified by 38 states. This would need to happen for all three amendments. The last amendment to the constitution was repealed and ratified was the 18th amendment of prohibition, it was also the only amendment to ever be repealed and ratified. Add the near impossibility of even doing so with one of the three amendments protecting illegal immigrants from forced labor, and there is still the human rights declaration, and International Labor Association which conventions are upheld by US Government. There is absolutely zero chance that a single amendment is repealed let alone ratified - and there is nothing the Supreme Court can do to influence the constitution - they are bound to it. This is a very serious issue, but wild fear is exactly what Republicans want  as it promotes incorrect understanding of the law, and if this type of rhetoric continues  perhaps one day people will be ignorant enough to forget the frameworks in place that bind us to law and order. Do not succumb to propaganda and fear. Simply know that if these safeguards are indeed broken, it will be the true end of American Democracy  unless true patriots educate themselves on our constitutional and international law, and refuse to back down from it. Your fears are valid, and I commend you for seeing the threats we face  though you must understand that all is lost only when we forget the 237 years of the constitution standing and serving as a bastion of our continued, yet imperiled, democracy.","title":"How would Donald Trump carry out his mass deportation scheme?"},{"text":"1) removing is step 1\\n2) securing the border and preventing them from entering is the keySure some will get through, but if they are caught, that is where an example is made...\\nNo more free rides, and that includes in the prisons...no free education, no diet specific foods, no t.v.s or internet access for them.

The reason for this is that they don't care. They don't care that they will be oppressed as long as they can oppress those they look down on. And when the moment comes that they become aware of their \\"lost\\" status (it was always imaginary), they will be distracted by foreign wars or domestic violence.Non-wealthy reactionaries have always been the foot soldiers of crony capitalism and reactionary populism has always been fake populism in service of the rich and powerful. Fascism, for example, idolized workers and soldiers, but all they got was corporatism and pointless deaths. The truth is that movements like that are rooted in capitalism, specifically the problems of unregulated capitalism and the dysfunction it creates. They are above all corporatist movements; the militarism, imperialism, religious aspects are important to the people in it, but functionally just serve to regiment society towards serving the interests placed above them (industry, the army, the party, ...) and opposition to anything that threatens these interests (social democracy, communism, pacifism, unions, ...).I'm not convinced that people susceptible to this message have really changed, or that the ideologies that serve as the window dressing of their opposition to equality are much different from what they were last century. A conservative is often just a reactionary who doesn't speak his mind because he fears society's reaction. Which is why now, when they dominate the media and politics, all the old ideas resurface. They are still the same ideas, the same old hatreds and fears, because they are above all an emotional reaction to people who are different, to the bewildering complexity of life.","title":"Black Republicans feel left out of Trumps 2nd-term picks"},{"text":"There's too many nato members that will veto Ukraine joining.

Many would argue that this is a safety measure for the child who might be fearful of admitting to their parents that they are transgender.  So, it is entirely possible that a parent may learn that a child is called by a different name at school and that might be how they learn that their child is transgender.  However, the GOP doesn't think this type of situation is dramatic enough.  They have to spin it to be the worst possible situation and pretend that what is actually happening is that schools are doing fullfledged sex operations without parents ever knowing.

The plans here are convoluted and incredibly expensive, timely, and face real legal hurdles. It is a very serious issue. Though to conflate the rationale of genuinely alien residents, who have not held any sort of federally legal protection nor claim to US resources through valid UN channels  with that of the completely legal status jews held in Europe, that was chipped away at, piece by piece, leading to manufactured slaughter, is comparing holocausts to sweepingly irresponsible and inhumane relocations. They are both unpleasant, but one of them was a direct and unwarranted abomination of a brainwashed German populace facing economy decline.The situation in the US is much more similar to that of continued occupation within Afghanistan - though this is staging an even more chaotic withdrawal. That said, there is no prejudice laid against anyone in the US legally (there is likely underlying prejudice due to the situation, even for those who are here legally), though we must understand that the immigration crisis is not an American issue, it is an issue for essentially all developed nations. Is this the way we should be handling it? No. Should it be handled, must it? Yes. But to conflate this to sending illegal immigrants back to their home countries or nearby countries in no way equates what the Jewish, disabled, homosexual, black, and Roma peoples had to endure of which many did not. To liken the legitimate reason of deporting illegal immigrants (as does every other country), the main issue now is pairing these policies against our constitution that provides rights for EVERYONE in the US and not just those born here, you can even see Eric Adams, a Democrat, calling for ignoring the constitution. Do not disgrace the horrors of the holocaust. I fully agree with you that this mass exodus will be painful and cruel. I do not believe the aim of such policy is a bad thing, it is common sense, and speaks to those who come here legally - as almost all of Americas ancestors did. Though knowing that, knowing the pain this inflicts on human beings, that is not lost on me  as it was not lost on the US when they released their grip to let the Taliban subjugate women. The world is an unfair, cruel, and increasingly bleak reality. We must understand the circumstances we live in, not those that we wish to live in  and we must work towards the common goal of equality and happiness for all humans. We are a blink in human history, if all we may do in this time is nudge the trajectory of our race in the right direction future generations will thank us. And it is greatness formed from those who plant seeds that sprout trees in which we will never live to bask in their shade. Blame is not the answer. Anger is not the answer. Stalwart belief in some meaning behind human life, and doing what we can to ensure that a brighter future is made for all - that is what we can hope for. Enough with likening the past to the future, let us liken what we live with today - the present; to incur and preserve a bright future not only for ourselves, but for generations thereafter. #tsr","title":"How would Donald Trump carry out his mass deportation scheme?"},{"text":"What are they gonna hack?

Regardless of class, religion, ideals or whose in charge.And none of this changes. One does not have to conform to the personal beliefs of the executive branch, simply because they are the executive branch.No - but if one *works* in the executive branch, they *do* have to conform to the political ideology and goals of the current president. Personal opinions don't matter but professional actions do. One branch wasn't designed to have so much power that it can just stop their political opponents from acting or being able to s5and for their beliefsLiterally not true in the executive branch. Article 2 clearly vests executive power in the president. And there is something fundamentally wrong with treating the presidency and executive branch as an all powerful entity. One that overrides all other people and branches? One that everyone everywhere just has to bow their heads and have no ability to object to anything?No - this is the discussion of the executive branch - not the rest of government. So yea, within the executive branch, the President is the all powerful individual. That is exactly what the Constitution means when it says it vests the executive power in the President. The other branches of government are the check on the Executive branch.Government jobs and officials positions do not require an oath to obey the president above everything and everyone else.To some extent - they do. They exist to fulfill the role and policy as passed by the legitimate leaders of the government. So long as the policies are lawful and within the purview of power granted to the executive branch, they absolutely *do* have an obligation to follow the direction of the President and should be removed if they fail to do so.Just because a group of people fall into the majority party doesn't automatically negate the opinions and and rights of the opposing party. It doesn't mean that they have to just get over it and stop fighting what they see as an issue.Sorry - but not the case in the executive branch. This is the consequence of winning the Presidency. That elected individual sets the policy for the nation. Un-elected individuals don't get to usurp this power from the elected individual. The president represents everyone and the people in the executive branch represent the President. The executive branch doesn't get executive rule or absolute obedience because this isn't a dictatorship or a monarchy.Well - within the executive branch, it kinda is. The Executive power *is* vested in the President. He is the unquestioned leader of the executive branch and has wide deference to how that branch is structured and who works in that branch. This is literal constitutional enumeration here. Your position is directly against the plain words of Article 2 here.Other people in and political or government office should be able to continue their lives and make changes in accordance with their beliefs.No - they really don't get to do this - at least professionally. Privately, they are citizens like any other. But professionally, they are not magically empowered to use their political ideology in contravention of the elected officials merely because they work for the government. What you describe is essentially what the GOP has called the 'Deep State'. This sentiment you are proposing is exactly what our government is NOT supposed to be. The policy and actions of our government are to be set by our **elected officials**, not career bureaucrats who are unaccountable to anyone - which is your position here. No president has an opinion so important that it overrides the ability of other Americans to participate in this democracy.Not privately. But most definitely they do have this professionally for people working in the executive branch. You don't get to implement your private political goals just because you work for the government. You have to implement the policy as provided by the *elected leaders*. This is not disenfranchising Americans of their ability to participate. It is merely ensuring the government is ruled by actual elected officials and not career employees who were never elected.","title":"CMV: JD Vance and Trump will try to coup the government"},{"text":"Perhaps on reddit.

Two nurses had carelessly mixed a muscle relaxant (I think, in any case it was some foreign medication) in a batch of measles vaccine and two babies died from that negligence. The nurses were convicted of gross malpractice and sent to prison. But the anti-vaxxers saw an opening and began shrieking about how \\"vaccines are deadly\\" and managed to not only convince parents not to vaccinate, but convinced the Samoan government to stop funding the measles vaccination program, which had been hugely successful in making measles extremely rare in the island nation. Vaccination rates fell from about 85% to less than 40% within a year. And then the inevitable result: a measles epidemic.Especially obscene was that RFK Jr. and his merry band of anti-vaxx loons tried to claim that the epidemic was CAUSED by vaccines. There was babbling about vaccinated people \\"shedding virus particles\\" which is a medical impossibility.

Canada endures over 750,000 cases of this every year. Nearly every one of these people becomes a permanent resident rather than deported. By 2040 it is anticipated that over 50% of Canadians will either be immigrants or the children of immigrants, with the total reaching as many as 30 million of a projected population of 45 million. By this point people of British or French descent will become the minority in Canada, thin still the plurality. Canadians who have spent 2+ generations in Canada have a negative birth rate. As mentioned earlier, literally 99% of Canadian population growth since 2000 is via immigration. Assuming this growth slows, by 2070 Canada will have. A population do ~60-70 million, where 40-50 million of these people did not have family in Canada under Queen Elizabeth II. \\nNow, for the record, I have absolutely nothing against immigration, but like everything in life it needs moderation.

The disproportionate pressure men and boys experience to be stereotypically masculine brings me to the central role of motivation in male anger and aggression Humans need to feel as though we have agency over our actions, which is why pressured motivation is linked with a host of negative outcomes. We attributed this to the fact that, compared with older men, younger men are in the throes of their masculine identity explorationa time when pressures are exacerbated in relationships, careers and families.  These young men are faced with constant pressures in an increasingly uncertain America. On the one hand, young men from rural conservative areas experience pressures of past generations: to excel financially so that they can find and support a nuclear family. On the other, they experience new pressures and sources of uncertainty (read: threat).

TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *\\"90% desist\\"* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is temporary, reversible puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will \\"desist\\" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.And transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. ---\\n**#1:*Citations on transition as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care, and the only effective treatment for gender dysphoria, as recognized by every major medical authority: Here is a resolution from the [**American Psychological Association**](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-gender-identity.pdf); *\\"THEREFORE  BE  IT  FURTHER  RESOLVED  that  APA  recognizes  the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public  and  private  insurers  to  cover  these  medically  necessary  treatments.\\"* More from the APA [**here**](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/programs/transgender/?tab=1)* Here is an [**AMA resolution**](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transition-related care from coverage* A policy statement from the [**American College of Physicians**](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2482)* [**Here**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines* [**Here**](https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/events/alf_ncsc/Education.pdf) is a resolution from the American Academy of Family Physicians* [**Here**](https://www.socialworkers.org/assets/secured/documents/da/da2008/reffered/Transgender.pdf) is one from the National Association of Social Workers---**Condemnation of \\"Gender Identity Change Efforts\\", aka \\"conversion therapy\\", which attempt to alleviate dysphoria without transition by changing trans people's genders so they are happy and comfortable as their assigned sex at birth, as futile and destructive pseudo-scientific abuse: [**From the APA**](http://www.apa.org/about/policy/orientation-diversity.aspx).

The right to consider your health and medically-approved treatment options with your family and doctors is a right that everyone should have, including transgender children, who are especially vulnerable to serious risks of depression, anxiety and suicide.The DOJ initially won an injunction over the implementation of the law, which was overturned in July of last year by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which allowed the ban to take effect. That November, the Justice Department appealed the case to the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority will for the first time weigh in on legislation targeting transgender Americans access to medical treatment.The Supreme Courts decision will have a widespread impact not just in Tennessee, but on trans individuals living in any of the 25 other states that have passed legal restrictions to transgender individuals access to gender affirming health care.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/supreme-court-tennessee-ban-trans-health-care-1235191566/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/supreme-court-tennessee-ban-trans-health-care-1235191566/)","title":"SCOTUS Considers Ban on Health Care for Trans Youth Ahead of Trumps Term"},{"text":"To me these are the same people that believed in ritual sacrifices to appease the gods, in a previous life. \\"If we just sacrifice the gays (socially) then the economy (crop yield) will improve!\\"","title":"Michigan GOP Rep.

However, his decision to challenge the former president set off a bitter conflict between the two men, with Mr Trump accusing the Florida governor of disloyalty.Mr Trump also gave his rival several nicknames, including Ron DeSanctimonious, which he later retired, and Tiny D.Mr DeSantis later played down the DeSanctimonious nickname, saying I kind of like it.This animosity has meant some within Mr Trumps inner circle strongly dislike Mr DeSantis, according to the WSJ, although recent efforts have reportedly been made to mend the relationship.If he was to make the cut, Mr DeSantis would vacate his position as governor, sparking a race in Florida to replace him.The appointment of Mr DeSantis to the pentagon could also impact the governors own selection process for senator Marco Rubios replacement.Mr Rubio has been nominated by the president-elect to be his secretary of state, and Mr Trump is understood to want his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to fill Rubios senate seat.?A source told The Bulwark: Initially, Lara Trump was not part of all of this, adding: But theres no way it could have been avoided.**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/12/04/trump-consider-pete-hegseth-ron-de-santis-defence-secretary/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/12/04/trump-consider-pete-hegseth-ron-de-santis-defence-secretary/)","title":"Trump considers replacing defence secretary nominee Hegseth with DeSantis"},{"text":"No, there was no political harassment.

I wasn't mean or I didn't talk down to her or anything, but came off as sympathetic, telling her that it's unfortunately the issue that the company is providing the eggs have realized we are all willing to pay more for them, so they raise the price up. That the only way we could perhaps push them to lower the prices if we suddenly went one or two months without buying eggs. She agreed with me, but told me she can't live without the eggs so she's just going to bite the bullet. The moral to the story is that these companies are not going to lower the prices unless they suddenly see their sales dropping and losses coming. It's like an airline that charges too much for seats, but now it's an hour before the flight and they have 10 seats available, and it's a better deal for them to sell them cheap as opposed to having 10 empty seats on a flight. They're not going to lower the price of eggs until we stop buying them. The sadder is Trump could put tariffs on things, and they'll raise the prices again, and then let's say a new Democratic administration in 2028 removes all the tariffs, and they won't lower those prices. Not as long as people are willing to pay them. Economist basically say that the only way around all this is when people are out there, pushing to make more money and getting raises. However, those are becoming incredibly hard to get nowadays, as companies are looking for every way to reduce wages and even force people to take pay cuts through layoffs. This is again why I'm not very sympathetic anymore to all these people that voted for Trump or didn't bother to show up. They want to talk to death about eggs and gas and they honestly don't know how capitalism and the economy works. So they shot themselves in the foot hoping the companies will decide to lower the prices.

The government was built with three branches Yes - and when you read Article 2, it is very clear the President *is* the executive branch. That *IS* the founding principles.The Legislative and Judicial branches are the checks on the executive branch. It's all very inconveniencing and boring. It's difficult to work around for a reason.No, it is ahistorical to assume the leader of the executive branch wouldn't have the power to shape the executive branch. Especially power wielded by un-elected individuals. You may not like this, but it is how the government is structured. It's very unfortunate that any president can just erase the policy of the last with no one who can object.Yes it is. But - this is not unlimited. There is the APA and the concept that Congress can retake power they delegated. But as far as enumerated powers of the executive, it is *exactly* as it was designed to work. Consider how Trump's policies were reversed by Biden. There was no complaining about how Biden reversed Trump - why is this any different. (other than you likely agreed with Biden)here simply IS an obligation to keep people in positions doing things against the wishes of the executive.No there really isn't. This concept is what the right wing has called the 'deep state' and is incredibly undemocratic. Unelected bureaucrats not answerable to the elected officials. Elections aren't a \\"consequence\\" No - elections **have** consequences and changes/shifts in policy is very much one of the expected consequences. Significant restructuring is absolutely a consequence. You are only seeing this as a problem now because this expansion of power is being used against your policy interests. The idea should not just be appeasing the executive branch above all.This makes ZERO sense. The policy is the President is the head of the entire executive branch and gets to set the policy for the executive branch.

I went on Medicare at the beginning of 2019 when I was 66 years old.  Most expensive Healthcare I have ever owned, there is nothing free about Medicare.  I paid a premium for part A and B from my SS payment that totals over $400 dollars a month at this moment that is 40% of the total amount of my monthly SS payments.  I receive a lessor monthly amount of SS a month than a richer fuck head, not because I worked less or fewer years but because the hard work I did paid less in the old days and the type of work I did while important (teaching) didn't pay great. I do resent that not all Americans receive the exact same amount of Social Security no matter how much you paid into the program, I always paid what they said I owed based on my job.  That was a shock to me when I retired.The second thing I will say, is Trump and the Republicans changing Medicare in 2019 (although this doesn't apply to me) so that all Americans now have to buy Medicare Advantage Plans, was the largest single government handout to a private industry, (health insurance corporations), ever enacted.  They are also horrible plans, a punishment to all Americans for forcing the insurance industry to insure those with preexisting health conditions.  In 2019 the insurance industry made up for this by enacting pre-authorization causes into all Advantage Plans the restrict what is covered by your insurance and reduces your health care and cost Americans billions in additional costs.","title":"House Republican: Hard decisions needed on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"It's like one of those 'oils' done by outsider artists and sold on the internet for hundreds of dollars, where Trump is riding a tiger or posing as Jesus or a gladiator, I mean - this is the MAGA aesthetic, really sloppy floppers.","title":"Conquest: Trump posts bizarre AI pic of himself with a Canadian flag (on a Swiss mountain)"},{"text":"Arguing all these semantics is pointless, the court will rule how it wants to and make a justification up to support it.
