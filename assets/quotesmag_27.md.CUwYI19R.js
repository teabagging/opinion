Voting for cloture on a Senate Bill means ending debate on it. For that, the Senate currently needs 60 votes when it comes to legislation. There are exceptions (judicial appointments, reconciliation bills).The process of the Senate works like this: The Majority Leader requests that cloture is invoked, the Chair calls for unanimous consent - if it is not given, the Chair calls for a vote. If 60 Senators vote in favor of invoking cloture, the bill proceeds to a vote on the Senate floor, where it can be passed by a regular majority.At this specific juncture - when the Chair \\"rules\\" on what to do, based on precedent (previous rulings on that matter) and the Senate rules - a single Senator can interject, and appeal the rule of the Chair - the Chair can be overruled by a majority of Senators - so 50+1 are needed in a Senate with full attendance. The appeal has a content - so a Senator can appeal the 60-vote-rule down to 55, or 51 or whatever they like and that new (and now most recent) precedent becomes the new rule (until it is changed, that is) if it gathers a majority of Senators present.No Senate rules package or anything else prevents the Senate from doing that.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 19, 2024"},{"text":"Bring him on.

My kid said she is basically a Reagan Republican, as far as her politics, and her accepting of Wall Street money goes.If you read about some of the Right Wing, Nationalist Christians in the US, they want a MASSIVE Middle Eastern War, which they believe will signal Jesus returning, in the flesh, and they will all get Raptured up into heaven. THIS idea is why trump moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem, when he was President. It was VERY inflammatory towards the Arabs/Moslems  to do this.You're right that the war is a lost cause. Russia is finished, and will descend into civil war and 25-45 new Nations. Europe is now supporting Ukraine more than they ever have. The British and French have allowed their long range missiles to strike Russia. The current German leadership, is still against this, which is one reason they will lost the election, and the new government will support Ukraine even more, and send these types of weapons.Also, it is not THAT big a deal, because Ukraine is developing their own capabilities at breakneck speed. They will soon have a longer range ballistic missile of their own. This will accelerate the final end of the Russian Empire, sooner rather than later.You many have noticed that the President of Abkhazia has resigned. That is a new \\"nation\\", that was formed with Russia illegally invaded Georgia. They created this region as a Russian controlled new country, that separated from Georgia, to be independent. It was really an illegal land grab, just like what they are doing in Ukraine. Unfortunately, The West did NOTHING about it.What just happened was the Russian imposed leadership, finally pissed off the locals. They mass protested, took over the main government buildings, and forced the President resigned. In past, this NEVER would have happened. Russia would have used their troops and equipment, there, sent in more, and killed everybody who wouldn't go home.But, they CANNNOT do that any more, because ALL their troops and ALL their equipment is going into Ukraine to die and be destroyed. They have NOTHING left to control these places like they used to, and are losing control of Russia, proper.Earlier, Azerbaijan invaded Armenia, and kicked their ass. Armenia is now Pro-West.

But this sort of desire to be the \\"hottest around\\" seems to be most easily explained by competition among women and or some obsession with an unreal celebrity world, andit is not at all a requirement to get a man who will be more or less totally pleased with how someone looks.Anecdotally I know many women who are very overweight and by ordinary standards quite unnatractive but they have lovely partners or lovers (kind, intelligent, etc.) who consider them attractive, are very affectionate towards them, and AFAICT they have never made any sort of criticism about any aspect of their body.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"What do you already like?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 19, 2024"},{"text":"Would you believe it more if he said it as opposed to typing it?

When people want to throw da bums out because eggs cost too much, they are thinking of POTUS and maybe Senate, and maaaaybe the House, but their own State Senator? Hes a good guy. Or shes a good challenger. Because I think people hear Democrats and think POTUS or Senate or maybe AOC or Hakeem Jeffries or someone else prominent in the House. They dont think of their city council person or county supervisor.And that ties in with people liking Democratic policies but not the Democratic brand. I think that state and local politicians just dont get the brand tied to them as much.Finally Im so grateful that we arent doing what we did in the Obama years, neglecting statehouses and governorships. This is going to be *vital* if we have to put up with Trump and his clown car for four more years.

This bill failed to pass the House on November 12, but the House is planning to take it up again starting November 18.H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, purports to stop bad actors from using nonprofit organizations to fund terrorism, as is already prohibited under current law. It also includes some laudable provisions to extend tax deadlines for those unlawfully or wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad.But H.R. 9495 goes much, much farther, building on provisions in previous legislation, H.R. 6408, to empower the Secretary of Treasury to designate 501(c) organizations as terrorist supporting organizations and revoke their tax-exempt status with minimal due process. It would allow the Secretary to bring such accusations without disclosing the evidence behind them and would place the burden of proof on the organization to disprove the allegations. The potential for overreach, subjective application, and abuse of this authority is enormous, and the consequences for organizations and the people they serve cannot be overstated.

If 100 men find you attractive, especially if they find you attractive whilst saying they find basically any woman attractive, it means very little when the few you want dont seem to. I feel like the orgasm gap and things like are related to this different attitude from most women to men too because, tbh, men benefit more from relationships with a woman, but most women need a good or attractive man to see the same. You say that its celebrity gossip discourse but what men are saying about women, celebrity or not, is all we really have to go off. I grew up hearing the men and boys in my life speak about the physical traits they thought a woman should have right in front of me and other girls with no regard for how we would feel about it. You can hear it as youre going about your day; a song comes on in a store or something and the rapper is talking about why his girl or she is sexy (its because she has a fat ass, tiny waist, big thighs, big tits). You see it when you go into comment sections and men are derailing the topic to talk about the big tits or fat ass that someone in the post happened to have, despite it not being the focus at all. You constantly hear about which celebrities are considered hot, and you know they look nothing like you and nobody that looks like you gets that praise. Maybe the celebrities that do look like you are constantly getting comments about how mid and unimpressive they are. You see how fictional characters never look like you because well, who would want to look at someone like you? You see how other women who fit the ideals profit off their looks. They seem to be able to get whatever man they want and maybe thats not true but you have no evidence to the contrary. Men as a cohort never praise what you do have and seldom fight back against all the aforementioned.This is just assuming that you never receive explicit criticism on your appearance which Ive seen far too often (both online and irl).So when you dont have any features that are getting praise and attention in discussion, or have features that get criticised, what do you do? Maybe you take it on the chin and try to ignore it. Maybe you live in insecurity. Maybe you become preoccupied with makeup, skincare, dieting, maybe gym, reaching out for traits your genes arent disposed to, perhaps never getting there. Or maybe you achieve that through cosmetic procedures instead I also recognise that I focused a lot on a few particular body parts here, but theres so many things that this applies to. Skin tones, facial features I mean I could get into the minute particulars of tits and ass since people talk about them so fucking much but I just say it to say, its a lot of different things.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Don't forget they made the SC primary first to double down on the gatekeeping.","title":"Dems are repeating past mistakes"},{"text":"YouTubes algorithm somehow thinks Im interested in firearms videos despite me never watching a single one, any creators that even mention guns, or any creators that would even have the slightest overlap with those channels outside of guys from the South.

Resources- Right now it takes a team of ICE agents a full day of 8-10 people to apprehend 7 people for deportation.  That is not including the people involved in transportation,  judges, jails etc. Just ICE agents. A single airplane flight full will cost $125,000. Issues of where do you hold these people? How many agents could you have? How long would it take? How do you feed that many people? An average for a deportation from apprehension to actual deportation is 30 days. Large scale forced movement of people is extremely hard.  We've seen it before.  Razor wire camps, train cars full of people? So there's the cost to consider.  Now your point is that people who have broken the laws ought to be deported. Perhaps so, but it's not cheap. It generally  hurts the economy, and is more complicated than most anyone would suspect.Legality- immigration code is the most extensive and complex code in the entire legal system apart from tax code.  We do not have nearly enough immigration judges or councilors.  Most of the issues with legal immigration has to do with a lack of legal practitioners to move the process along.  So, since regular lawyers and judges can't just jump into cases around immigration,  that starkly limits your options. What we are left with is if you want to do it right,  i.e humanely and legally,  it'll require resources.  Many many more resources.  It is far more effective to address the causes of immigration and delineating paths to legal citizenship, then to spend billions of dollars on a way to pay to kick people out.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"\\nThey filed 3 applications, all of them failed, then they manufactured a document falsifying records from the CIA in order to get approval, the 4th was approved.\\tThis is false.

And yes, I do have a subscription and read the whole thing, which supports the contention that the DOJ was not weaponized and the investigation wasnt political.\\nThis is why they forged documents to get the investigation going.\\tNope. The email that was changed 8 months after the first FISA warrant was issued, and was submitted as part of a FISA renewal. There is no indication the small change would have made any difference to the application.We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influencedThat is not them debunking the idea that they were politically motivated.

He was found guilty.\\tAgain, theres zero evidence adding the words not a source to the email, which was submitted with other documents, made any difference.

First, at the moment, the Ukrainians hold a pretty big chunk of Kursk (which, again, is part of Russia), while the Russians hold a pretty big chunk of Donbas (which is part of Ukraine). If Ukraine can hold on to Kursk, then they have a very nice bargaining chip available if and when everyone decides this is a stalemate, and it's time to talk peace.

There is no money to be made with the general public (low/average credit) at 10%.If rates were lowered to 10% on *existing* cards, the banks would simply close the cards and sell the debt off in a securitized bundle to a high yield fund or distressed credit fund. There is no money to be made at 10% given chargeoff rates (that's why CC rates are so high to begin with, to hurdle the chargeoffs and still leave room for profit). Interest rates don't matter (from the perspective of the bank) when the borrower is not making payments, it just accrues and accrues until the bank sells the debt to someone else for pennies on the dollar, and then that person sues the borrower. I'm not saying they would immediately pay off their balance, I'm saying they would *not* pay off their balance. Default has a less of a correlation with interest rates, and more of a correlation with borrower creditworthiness. A person who is a low credit risk is going to pay their debt whether its 1% or 50% interest - they'll pay it even faster with 50% interest. A low-information, high credit risk borrower isn't going to pay it at any interest rate. The reason that the rates are so high on credit cards is that is the necessary rate for it to be profitable given the massive amount of bad debt and charge-offs associated with credit cards.","title":"Bernie Sanders giving credit: Trump's campaign promise to cap credit card interest at 10% would be helpful for many Americans."},{"text":"How much longer will Putin keep bending over?","title":"The US has directly attacked Russia."},{"text":"Maybe bc starring in Jan, we'll be Putin's puppet.

While I don't think you can ever really untangle patriarchy and centuries of cultural norms from beauty standards, I don't think it's fair to say women have *no* agency when it comes to setting beauty standards among themselves, or among men for that matter. I think you could argue that unrealistic male beauty standards are part of the male gaze in the sense that they position very toned men as the ideal out of a sense of wish fulfilmentI think this is definitely the case for some men and the way some are portrayed in media. However, I think you'd be kidding yourself if you think there aren't thousands of men out there that hit the gym because they think they'll be more successful with women, not because being muscular is some sort of hidden power fantasy for these men.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"**+The Zionists** (it's the Jews meme)*9/11 was an inside job to create Greater Israel*","title":"Does the Left Want WWIII?"},{"text":"Absolutely not.

People forget about it and set up autopay. I don't see a world on which a 20% interest rate drop suddenly results in a large percentage of CC holders immediately paying off their balances. If anything, it would have the opposite effect. Even more people would be likely to forget (or not worry about) their CC balances.The banks would still make plenty of money. Lower interest rate loans are more likely to be paid off (isn't that proven?), so consumers would pay off their CC balances and therefore default rates would go down now that the balance isn't skyrocketing due to disgustingly high rates.

It has only suddenly become a problem with Ukraine because Putin thinks he can grab territory there. NATO expansion WAS a problem. The Russians are not at all happy with Poland and the others in NATO. That's why in 2021, they tried hard to negotiate for a two tier system, where the \\"new\\" members in East Europe would have a lower tier status. NATO refused Russia's request.Side note, Gorbachev's country doesn't exist anymore. Even if it did, it's not like there was anything in writing, unlike Russia's promise to not invade Ukraine after they gave up nukes. So much for that Russian honesty, huh? Earlier you asked me:Idk why people who are so ready to question the US's excuses accept Russia's without question.So that's why the US has zero credibility. The US promised no NATO expansion. American word means NOTHING. You can't just say, \\"oh our promise was to the USSR and not Russia\\". That's why the US has no credibility. Throw in things like Iraq and its \\"WMDs\\" to add fuel to the fire.

So much for that Russian honesty, huh? Ukraine never had nuclear weapons. They old USSR nuclear weapons that were stationed on what became Ukraine were not usable by Ukraine. They did not have the launch codes to use them. It's like when the US stations nuclear weapons on Germany - they aren't suddenly German nuclear weapons or alternatively, if the US somehow lost a state that it had nuclear weapons (say 1 of the lower 48 states somehow became it's own nation) that state would not have nuclear weapons. The launch codes would be retained by the remaining 49 states of the successor state to the US. No honesty has been lost there. There's a reason why the world takes Russia seriously and not the US. Not usually something the world is chill about. So why is 85% of the world trading with Russia? Because you got your facts wrong. The US provoked this war. Your claims have been debunked by basically everybody, and they come from a country that has literally used video game footage as propaganda pretending it's real.Making up things on Reddit isn't going  to change anything. If you'd rather trust the sources of information that told you that Russia was going to run out of ammunition in 2022, well that's on you for not have the critical thinking skills to ask the hard questions and being blindly obedient to Western propaganda.Iraq 2: Electric Boogaloo was bad. Turns out, the west isn't perfect. No one is claiming it is. That doesn't mean Russia is some pillar of honesty in comparison. Iraq was an aggressive war, unlike what Russia was doing. Russia was left with a choice - be destroyed by the West or launch the SMO.  The US never faced an existential crisis like that from Saddam - the closest may have been the Cuban Missile Crisis, which the US provoked by stationing nuclear weapons in Turkey, which the then USSR responded by stationing nukes in Cuba. The US wanted to station nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would have provoked a similar crisis. No nuclear nation wants nukes beside them.Russia isn't perfect, but it's acted in far better faith than the West has. That's why it's trusted in the Global South.  That's why when other nations experience crises like in the Middle East, Russia is trusted.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

With each class being based, not on income, or property, or birth; but instead based on their social role, the work that they do.He gives examples going as far as ancient egypt. He thinks each class has an important role to fill, and that society runs well when the four classes find balance, with each one doing their part without undermining the others.In the modern day, he puts veterans as the warrior class, entrepreneurs and tech bros as the merchant class, the PMC as the bureacrat class and academics as the priest class (because the priest class are the ones who preach morality and truth to the masses). And he thinks the bureacrat class (the PMC) and the priest class (academics) have become too powerful in the culture and that's why people are lashing out.I have many criticisms to his theories, but I still find them fascinating.

Its more about recognizing the shared valueslike justice, compassion, and the search for meaningthat come from these beliefs. These values reflect something universal in human nature, whether theyre inspired by a divine being or simply our shared humanity.Even if their doctrines dont align, the shared principles matter because they help us understand and cooperate with each other. Its less about proving religions are right or wrong and more about appreciating the common ground they provide.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"To be fair that was a great movie.","title":"CMV: we should legalize Cocaine, Ritalin and Adderall instead of weed."},{"text":"Its going to get worse.

Only, this time, missiles were fired from *Cuba*.","title":"The US has directly attacked Russia."},{"text":"!deltaYou make a strong point, and I think I may have overstated my view. I agree that shared values like justice and compassion dont necessarily validate a religions core tenets or its claims about the divine. These are truths about humanity rather than truths about the specific worldviews constructed around them. So, Id say youre rightjust because a religion gets moral principles right doesnt mean its partly true in the deeper sense of its metaphysical or theological claims.I think my view needs refining. Instead of saying religions are partly true, Id frame it as religions reflecting humanitys shared attempt to grapple with universal truths, even if their conclusions about the divine or the ultimate nature of reality are incompatible or incorrect. Thanks for helping me see that more clearly.Although I acknowledge the flaws in my view, as youve pointed out, I feel compelled to explain why Ive been reluctant to detach myself from the idea that all religions hold partial truths. I believe that if this perspective were more broadly adoptedparticularly by religious peopleit could significantly reduce the influence of religious laws, which I see as more harmful than beneficial in many cases.Convincing a deeply religious person that their faith isnt entirely true is an uphill battle, and I speak from personal experience. Though I am not a practicing Christian, its hard to completely separate myself from the influence of the faith I was raised in. I imagine that this is true for many others, and its one reason why more extreme shifts in perspective, like outright rejecting religion, are so difficult for most people.Thats why I see value in this approach. By framing all religions as containing partial truths and converging toward the same underlying principles, we create space for mutual understanding. This stance has the potential to soften rigid exclusivity and help religious and non-religious people alike adjust to a more universal sense of morality and justice.Ultimately, I envision a society where humanity no longer feels the need for religion. A society where we can judge morality independently, stand by our own principles, and answer questions about what is just without relying on divine authority. To me, this represents a kind of maturity for humanityan independence from God in the religious sense, where faith is no longer a crutch but something weve grown beyond.Presenting the idea that all religions converge toward a shared essence feels like a step in this direction. It might not be perfect, but its a way to nudge people toward a broader understanding and, perhaps, a shared path to a more harmonious future.Despite everything, I still believe that all religions, while flawed and diverse as you have pointed out, share foundational principles rooted in justice, goodness, and compassion. These shared values, I think, represent what makes us fundamentally human and are worth emphasizing.It doesnt matter whether these principles arise from the belief that humans, as creations of God, strive for justice and goodness, or if they are simply a natural construct of human society without any divine intervention. What truly matters is the outcome: a society where these ideals are upheld and guide how we live together.If fostering such a society means finding common ground in these shared principleswhether inspired by divinity or purely human effortthen its a path worth pursuing in my opinion. The process should focus on cooperation and mutual respect based on those common principles rather than erasing differences, ensuring a society that reflects the best of what humanity can achieve.Right thank you for changing my view. I believe I was too naive in some regards while being blinded by trying to \\"satisfy\\" everyone.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"The point is that it's always a reverse Uno.The Republicans say something reprehensible or enact a reprehensible policy, Democrats call it out, and then get told they are obsessed with culture war issues.It just so happens the target recently is trans individuals.","title":"NYC Democratic Congressmen Blast Party for Identity Politics"},{"text":" We have so many industries that are literally dependent upon these immigrants to continue to exist, including migrant farm working, construction, transportation, and even a lot of other trades jobs.

Even if it did, it's not like there was anything in writing, unlike Russia's promise to not invade Ukraine after they gave up nukes. So much for that Russian honesty, huh? This is the real problem with this war, though. Russia invading Ukraine means that if you're bordered by an aggressive country like Russia that wants to break off your agreed upon sovereign territory, you have 2 options: join a nuclear coalition like NATO, or get your own nukes. Not usually something the world is chill about. Thanks for not answering why countries bordering Russia overwhelming want to join NATO, though. Wild to think that other countries have a will of their own and aren't exclusively NPCs to be used by the US or Russia. That's how Russia sees it, too, and probably why their neighbors are scared of them. And, like you, they also think it's okay for them to have boots on the ground in one of these NPC countries as long as it's unofficial.Your Ukrainian history is dogshit at best.

Acknowledging this doesnt inherently prove any religions claims, nor does it rule out the possibility of divine influence.hmm let's see, the distinction between human invention and divine truth may lie in how these shared principles extend beyond what is purely practical. For instance, many religions emphasize ideas like self-sacrifice, altruism, or forgivenessconcepts that arent always advantageous for survival or social order, yet they appear across cultures and faiths.These teachings often challenge human instincts, like vengeance or self-preservation, suggesting they may stem from a source greater than human pragmatism.Similarly, the search for meaning and purpose beyond the material world is another aspect that unites religions. While its true that this could be a psychological need, the consistency of this yearning across vastly different cultures and times may hint at something more. Religions, in this sense, could be humanitys varied attempts to interpret and connect with a deeper realitywhether you call that reality divine or simply existential.Ultimately, the question of whether these shared elements come from divine truth or human invention is unanswerable. And that is true for now.Religions could reflect both: human psychology shaping the way divine truths are understood and expressed. While we may never have empirical proof of divine inspiration, the universality of these ideas suggests that religions, at the very least, engage with questions that transcend individual cultures and hint at something greater than ourselves.Whether that something greater is divine or purely a product of human imagination is a matter of perspective and belief.As to wether my own belief is true or not, well only one way to find out eh. We'll get our answer at the end, maybe not the complete truth but part of it. whether we see each other in Heaven or fade into nothingness after our own demise, what truly matters is how we choose to live and treat one another in the here and now.If there is something beyond, let our actions today reflect the love and justice we hope to find there. And if there isnt, let our kindness and humanity be the legacy we leave behind.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"Agreement doesnt guarantee correctness.

Less debt means less social benefits. Less social benefits means less taxes. Less taxes + less debt = more disposable income. More disposable income = more money spent locally at your town's stores, garages, restaurants, and local services etc. Compared with profits made from credit cards that go to a far-away bank, possibly a foreign one, where it benefits people hundreds of miles away who will never spend a dime in your local community.Philosophically, yes I understand reservations RE the growing nanny state.

Grad students (and non-self employed tax accountants) could absolutely be considered working class under this traditional definition since they receive compensation by an employer in exchange for their labour.This tension in the historical conception of working class is exactly what is being highlighted here: A lot of class theory is based on the assumption that working class (wage workers) = low education = poor and owning class = high education = wealthy; but modern socioeconomic status is simply much more fractured and complex. The entire professional class, for example, are wealthy, highly educated, wage(/salaried) workers; and homeownership and investment portfolios are sources of capital income that is available to more than just the extremely wealthy. The category of low education, blue collar workers may be united by some cultural commonality, but their economic interests are extremely fractured based on income, homeownership and being business owners vs. wage labourers. You can see a similar tension within the category of highly educated, culturally liberal, professional workers when divided between homeowners (blue state NIMBYs) and non-homeowners (blue state YIMBYs). When analysing socioeconomic class, its a lot more helpful to separate cultural, educational, wealth and capital ownership factors than to try to combine them to construct a nebulous working class. tldr; No, traditional definitions of class actually completely fail to capture our intuitions about grad students vs blue collared workers, which is one of the reasons why it is not a good model of modern political economy.

While atheists may reject the idea of God, many still believe in objective morality, justice, and the value of human life. These shared values, which align with theistic teachings, could represent partial truths about humanitys deeper purpose or nature. Atheists might not define this in terms of God, but the principles they live by could still reflect a universal truth that others interpret as divine.Regarding whether multiple worldviews can agree on something that turns out to be falseyes, thats possible. For example, many cultures historically believed in geocentrism (the Earth as the center of the universe), which we now know isnt true. Agreement doesnt guarantee correctness. However, when multiple worldviews converge on principles like justice, compassion, or humility, its harder to dismiss them entirely as false. These shared ideas could point to universal truths about human nature or even the divine.In short, I think its possible for some worldviews to be completely wrong, but dismissing all their elements as false might be overly simplistic. Even atheism, despite its rejection of God, can reflect truths about morality or human understanding that overlap with theistic perspectives, suggesting theyre grappling with similar fundamental questions in different ways.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"Of course not!

Truth needs to be defined clearly, and I appreciate your insistence on that. Let me clarify my perspective in light of your critique.When I talk about truth in the context of religion, Im referring to a blend of metaphorical and subjective truths rather than strictly literal or scientific truths. For example, religious stories may not be factually accurate in the sense of describing historical events or empirical realities, but they often aim to convey deeper truths about human nature, morality, or purpose. These truths are different from the \\"roundness of the Earth\\" or \\"I love my wife\\" because they arent measurable or observable in the same way. They belong to a category of truths that reflect meaning rather than verifiable facts.As for the concept of parsimony, I agree that adding unnecessary elements to an explanation weakens its robustness. \\"Humans are storytelling creatures\\" is indeed a parsimonious explanation for the existence of religious narratives. However, I dont see that explanation as mutually exclusive with the possibility of God. The fact that humans are compelled to tell stories about morality, justice, creation, and purpose could be evidence of our evolutionary tendenciesor it could hint at something greater inspiring those tendencies. While I agree that invoking God adds an unfalsifiable element, I dont think its entirely unnecessary if one is open to the possibility that these shared human narratives are attempts to grapple with a deeper, underlying reality.In essence, Im not trying to prove God exists. Im acknowledging that belief in God or the divine remains a valid lens through which many people interpret universal human experiences. It might not meet the criteria of gnosis, as you rightly point out, but it does offer a meaningful way to engage with questions of truth that science or parsimony alone might not fully address. Truth, in this context, is less about definitive answers and more about exploring meaning and connection.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"One things is for sure, though.

However, I think theres another way to view this.While humanity undeniably falls shortoften in horrific waysits equally true that were capable of recognizing those shortcomings and aspiring to something better. The very fact that we feel guilt, shame, or the need to justify our actions suggests an awareness of justice and goodness as ideals, even if we fail to uphold them. This doesnt prove the existence of God, but it does suggest that these concepts are deeply embedded in our consciousness, across cultures and religions, which could point to something greater than ourselves.Regarding genocide or free will leading to atrocities, Im not saying those represent what God wants. If anything, they reflect the tension between human free will and divine ideals. The fact that religions consistently emphasize justice and goodness might not prove God exists, but it does suggest that these ideals resonate deeply with humanity. Whether you see this as evidence of a divine source or simply as evolutionary social development, its a pattern worth considering.Your point about widespread belief not making something true is validconsensus doesnt equal correctness.

But my argument goes a step further: just because these religions might be inconsistent in some aspects doesnt mean they dont contain pieces of truth. For example, their teachings on morality, justice, or the nature of existence often resonate across faiths and align with universal human experiences.Saying multiple religions are \\"partially true\\" isnt a claim that they must combine to form the ultimate truth but rather an acknowledgment that they all attempt to interpret the same divine or existential reality through different lenses.

I dont believe any one religion holds the entire truth, including Christianity. Instead, I think all religions, including non-religious perspectives like atheism, reflect partial truths that attempt to interpret a greater reality. Each perspective is shaped by its cultural and historical context, meaning it captures some aspects of truth but not the full picture.For example, a tenet of Christianity I think might not be entirely true is the concept of eternal damnation for non-believers. This feels inconsistent with the idea of a loving and just God. Some interpretations of Christianity suggest that Gods mercy and justice would extend even to those who never encountered or accepted the faith, which aligns more with my view.On the other hand, Islams emphasis on submission to Gods will highlights a powerful truth about humility and the recognition that human understanding is limited. This resonates as a universal principle that transcends religionacknowledging a force or truth greater than oneself is a theme shared across many faiths.To clarify, Im not saying all religions or tenets are equally valid. Rather, I think they are all trying to interpret the same \\"object\\"a divine reality or greater truththrough different lenses, with varying degrees of clarity.

If atheists believe in an objective morality and live by it, they could be recognizing a truth that religious people might attribute to God, even if atheists dont define it that way.Let me explain this using the \\"auditorium rocket\\" analogy. Imagine a stadium where a rocket is being launched in the center. Everyone in the stadium sees the same event, but their perspectives differ based on their position. Some have a clear view, others might be partially obstructed, and some might not even realize theyre looking at a rocket but still see its effects, like smoke or light. The religious perspectives, like Christianity or Islam, might see the rocket clearly from their angle and define it as God. Atheists, on the other hand, might not see the rocket itself but acknowledge its effectslike objective morality, the laws of nature, or the shared human pursuit of justice and truth.In this analogy, atheists fit into the picture because they still observe and engage with truths that could stem from the same \\"rocket\\" (God or divine reality) even if they interpret them differently. For example, an atheist might attribute objective morality to evolutionary or societal development rather than a divine source, but they are still acknowledging a universal truth that religious people might ascribe to God.So, atheism can reflect partial truths in this frameworknot because it explicitly believes in God, but because it interacts with aspects of the same larger reality that religions try to explain. This doesnt make atheism wholly true in the same sense as a religious claim, but it does mean atheists arent necessarily \\"wrong\\" in their beliefs about morality, even if their interpretation of its source differs from religious perspectives or in this case, the lack of.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"Or have Tulsi tear her to shreds again.","title":"Kamala Harris leads by huge margin in first Echelon poll for 2028 Democratic nomination"},{"text":"I agree with you OP","title":"Fuck this sub"},{"text":"I hope that is the slogan of the Democrat party in 2026.","title":"Democrats wrestle over role of transgender rights in election"},{"text":" In hindsight and strictly from Amazon's short-term perspectiveshort term is right.

This aligns closely with how I see religion: not as a source of absolute literal truth, but as humanitys way of interpreting something greater, often through allegory and metaphor.Let me explain this using an analogy I find helpfulthe \\"auditorium rocket.\\" Imagine a stadium full of people watching a model rocket launch in the center. Everyone sees the same rocket, but their perspective depends on where theyre sitting. Some have a clear, unobstructed view, while others might be blocked by a pillar or blinded by the sunlight. Each person interprets the event differently based on their vantage point, but they are all observing the same event.Religions are like those perspectives. They all attempt to interpret and explain the same underlying truththe \\"rocket,\\" or divine realitybut their views are shaped by cultural, historical, and geographic contexts. For example, flood myths appear in many religions, and while they might not describe a literal, global flood, they reflect shared human experiences of survival, renewal, and fear of natures power. These stories speak to universal truths, even if their details differ.Your point about humanity being a storytelling species is exactly right, but I dont think that negates the possibility of God. The fact that so many different cultures independently create similar storiesabout justice, creation, morality, and a higher powercould suggest theyre all attempting to describe the same \\"object,\\" even if their interpretations vary. These shared themes might point to a common source, something beyond human invention.So, when I say \\"all religions are true in some way,\\" I dont mean their specific metaphysical claims are all correct. Instead, I mean they each hold partial truths, shaped by their time and place, that reflect humanitys collective effort to understand something greaterwhether you call it God, the divine, or simply the search for meaning. The differences dont invalidate their value; they show how diverse perspectives can offer unique insights into the same larger realityI call that common source as God, but you can entirely call Him as human nature, universal truth or something else entirely. My perception of what God is, do differ from conventional definitions established in the Bible for example. I do not nitpick on those terms, religion for me is personal. It serves as a guidance when you can't stand on your own but hope to stand again one day or just for the first time dver. Wether God exists or not at the end doesn't matter to me but matter to a lot of people that can really \\"break\\" as they are religious. I also think I am religious but I do understand that my faith can be false. I search workarounds it, wether faith is for me or for God, as long as it eventually benefit me, then be it. Ignorance is bliss, we have short lives, better to go with a smile of hope than try to get to the end of an unanswerable question that would just ruin time and ourselves. Faiths should have always stood personal, wether it is faith for yourself or for a divine being, it shouldn't matter as long as you benefit from it, as long as it pushes people forward. So what is truth? Truth is something we humanity will never reach. The Truth of the world, of existence, all of that would never be answered. This truth is for me akin to God, something unreachable but something that can still guide us. Despite the fact that we would never reach the truth, the truth of all and nothing at the same time, it didn't discourage us to look for small truth, to search and understand more and more. So yeah truth is hard to define. No one can entirely define it every single time as we, as humans are flawed, our truth will be flawed.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"So basically, bezos picked being a billionaire over the country that made him a billionaire.","title":"Democratic warnings about Trump were not simply campaign rhetoric"},{"text":"Your not president yet sir...","title":"Trump calls for halt in confirmation of Biden's judicial nominees until Inauguration Day"},{"text":"This is how I feelhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5KWZL1blWc&amp;t=867s","title":"Trump vote count drops below majority"},{"text":"Children of legal visa holders such as H1B are not allowed to stay in the country after age 21 because they can't be legal dependents for visa purposes.

Each person has a unique perspective shaped by their position, with some views clearer than others due to factors like lighting or distance. Despite their differences, they are all observing the same rocket, interpreting it through their individual lenses.Religions work similarly. They arise from humanity's attempts to interpret the divine or transcendent reality, shaped by culture, history, and the limitations of understanding at the time.

These gods could be seen as representations of different aspects of existence, ultimately pointing back to one divine source. The same goes for other pantheonswhat seems like separate gods might be facets of a greater whole.While not every detail of every religion is correct, many share fundamental themesjustice, morality, creation, and higher purpose. These shared elements suggest that religions are trying to interpret the same divine truth, albeit through culturally specific frameworks.

There are people who argue that paying anything less than the sale value of the work performed is slavery but I doubt you would like them, they don't want to deport undocumented immigrants. Also anyone arguing against mass deportation with that argument is stupid. The reason mass deportation would be bad is because any time you forcibly displace masses of people you destabilize society in both the original location and the place the deportees get deported to.

I believe that no religion can be entirely true if all religions hold parts of the truth. The reason is that all religions are based on the same \\"object\\"a divine or transcendent sourcebut offer different interpretations shaped by culture, historical context, and the limitations of human understanding at the time.As societies evolve, so do our interpretations of this \\"object.\\" The Egyptians prayed to multiple gods because, at that point in history, they may not have been able to comprehend the concept of one all-powerful deity. Their many gods likely represented various aspects of existence that ultimately point back to a single divine source. What they expressed as many gods may be understood now as facets of one God or universal force.Using your analogy of people in a stadium watching a model rocket, I agree entirelydifferent perspectives lead to different interpretations, and those interpretations are influenced by ones cultural and historical \\"position.\\" This explains why religions differ yet share similar themes, such as justice, morality, and a higher power. Each religion sees part of the whole but interprets it through its unique lens. As humanity grows and learns, our interpretations refine, getting closer to understanding the divine, even if we never fully grasp it.This is why I see religions as offering partial truths rather than complete falsehoods or exclusive access to the ultimate truth.

While the origin of religion can be tied to human psychology and evolutionary traits, this doesnt necessarily negate the possibility of a divine reality. The feeling of gratitude for something beyond ourselves, the search for meaning, and the universal tendency to uphold justice and morality across cultures might suggest more than just psychological evolution. It could reflect an inherent connection to something greatera Creator or a divine order.Even Spinoza, while rejecting traditional notions of a personal God, argued for the existence of a fundamental force that underlies all reality. Whether we call this God or nature, it points to something beyond mere human invention such as a reality that inspires awe and gratitude, not just because of human psychology but because of its profound order and interconnectedness. Perhaps our emotions, such as gratitude, and our longing for purpose are reflections of this deeper truth rather than purely human constructs. Wether we call it God or not, it remains as an universal goodness that we try to uphold despitd living in an unfair world. This could point toward a certain divinity, as to wether it requires us to pray for it, that's another debate.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"I wouldnt say monopoly.

And that's problematic, because without an agreed-upon definition, we can go off the rails really quickly. Consider Aesop's Fables. The stories of \\"the fox and the grapes\\" or \\"the tortious and the hare\\". We can say, with absolute certainty, that these stories are not true. Foxes cannot speak (they literally lack the biological structures to create the sounds we would recognize as speech!), and rabbits do not engage in races with turtles. So if we're talking about 'truth' in the objective, literal sense, then these stories are not true. But, of course, no one talks about 'The Fox and the Grapes' or 'The Tortious and the Hare' as an example of literal truth. We do not tell these stories to share information of talking foxes and racing turtles, but because they are *allegories*. They are metaphors for real-world truths. Human beings *will* irrationally devalue things that they are unable to achieve out of frustration, and we use the term 'sour grapes' as a quick short-hand for that concept. Regular disciplined effort has historically been more consistently successful than rapid bursts of activity, so we tell people that 'slow and steady wins the race'. Just because there is no turtle, and no rabbit, and no fox wanting grapes just out of reach doesn't mean there isn't some truth to these stories. It's just not a literal truth. If ancient people in Pakistan told one set of stories about a creator God with rules and practices, and the ancient people of India told a different set of stories about a creator God with rules and practices, and the ancient people of South America told a different set of stories about a creator God with rules and practices, it's not reasonable to assume that **any** of those stories are objectively true. If different groups of people in different places engage in similar behavior, the truth that is revealed isn't in the texts or stories themselves, but that people are story-telling creatures! Just as with the talking fox, if people tell stories of a terrible flood that drowned the world... they're not actually sharing literal truth. They might be working in allegory, that a flood which washes away homes is like many of the things in life which can uproot us and sweep away our efforts. They might share this story to offer encouragement: \\"Sure, this winter is bad and the floods are terrible, but let me tell you that it used to be much, much worse and people lived through that!\\" Your post talks a lot about what a God might want or intended or plan, but... why assume a God exists? We know the stories exist, sure, and that even if they're not literal truth, they can serve a purpose in revealing knowledge through allegory.

European settlers came here, displaced the native population through genocide and war against them.  Then, to develop the lands, we imported people against their will from African and Caribbean nations.  When we couldnt do that anymore, the children of the poorest were put to work in our new factories.  Then, when that didnt work anymore, we built a nation through good labor and foreign wars.When that ended, we shipped the good jobs to places where cheap labor could be exploited again.  When their costs rose, we brought the cheap labor here and put them to work.  Controversial take:  weve made too many people in America too wealthy.  We have removed the incentive to work with our cost of living versus wages to be earned.  We are near the peak of our economic systems viability.

Of course, it killed literally millions of people globally.Tunisian people don't exist. I've never personally met a Tunisian person, so they must be imaginary.You see how silly this gets pretty quickly.The whole reason we have social sciences like sociology is because anecdotal evidence is not reliable.

Okay, cool. Here is what that means:- Credit card transaction fees become more ubiquitous and jack up from [at most 3.3%](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/credit-card-processing-fees/) to a significantly higher degree.\\n- Credit card annual fees become more ubiquitous and increase.\\n- By the same token, credit card borrowing limits get much tighter.\\n- Add onto that, you are not getting a credit card unless you have an exceptional credit score.\\n- And if that is not enough, when you do get a card, expect that you will have to maintain cash security to have access to that credit.You and pretty much no one else on earth is getting any significant line of credit without collateral at 10%.

Which is ludicrous, I made it up on the spot. Scientology is one such example of a religion that was basically just made up on a bar napkin.We also need to observe the specifics of each religion. For instance, take the Egyptian and Greek pantheons. They have gods with similar domains, but not the same. What youre asserting is that if Hades exists, then so should all the Gods of all the pantheons. If were going to cherry pick, then were not talking about the logical truth of faith.Think about it this way: if you put hundreds of people in a football stadium, then put a model rocket in the middle and launched it, everyone will have a different view, but there will be some similarities. People facing towards the sun will not see as clearly as people facing away from the sun. The differences create religion; Norse pantheons include things related to Norse objects; we never see a god with a gun, although we see plenty with swords, bows, spears, and shields. Ultimately, theres a third option: some, if not one, is true while others are false. We cannot assert to fully understand how another sentient species would understand things, but the logic could be incredibly mundane.

Humans have had feelings for millions of years, part of those feelings are things like, happiness, saddess, anger, but for this example we will  focus on a feeling of Gratitude. As a society based species, the evolution of the gratitude feeling was important, the idea of someone doing something for you and you as a response do something for them.Now imagine this scenario, you are a primitive human, a caveman, hungry, and you walk and see a fruit tree, you take that tree and you are no longer hungry. If it was another person that gave you the fruit, you would thank them in some way, but there was no one, the fruit was just there for you to pick, who should you thank for that.

The assumption that God is loving comes from the context of Abrahamic faiths, particularly Christianity, which often emphasizes Gods love and justice as central attributes.

It could explain why some are born into faiths deemed \\"false\\" or why salvation might seem arbitrary or unjust by human standards.However, within the framework of a God who is loving and justas many believers claimthis exclusivity raises questions about fairness and divine intention, which is what my view seeks to explore.The focus here was to engage with the premise of a loving God as often understood within the Abrahamic faiths and within the environment that I personally grew up in.

The dominant political energy in America really since the Great Recession has been moderate anti-systemism. What does that mean? People don't really like the status-quo.

Progressives tried to build a system of \\"managed revolt\\" but people disliked it because it just seemed like \\"the system.\\" I wouldn't see people want leftism or conservatism either. There is just widespread discontent thats relatively smeared across the political spectrum. Liberals might just sort of be able to sit back and wait for people to lose their patience with Trump and hope they will then be allowed to start implement their policies again but I wouldn't pretend that the current Democratic approach is popular either. There are some easy wins for Democrats. The country tends to lean socially to whoever imposes on them least. If the Democrats abandon prescriptive social beliefs and just champion not liking social conservative prescriptivism that would be popular. The problem with this though is Democrats would never be able to do this. Progressive infighting would break out and independent cultural actors aren't going to take marching orders from the party.

Might as well try to be the rain god. I agree with Noah Smith that getting deeply entranced in the rhetoric of class is mostly just an excuse for progressive to indulge their obsession with moralism and wouldn't actually be all that successful. Everyone who likes left-wing rhetoric is already left-wing. Democrats could take a populist approach to economics but I think it should acknowledge that if purely for political popularity points the goal should not be sectoral interventions but more broadly rewarding labor in concrete ways that translate to higher salaries and making sure everyone knows it was you who did it.","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"Biden.

It could still reflect partial truths about God, morality, and spirituality that overlap with Christianitysuch as the oneness of God, the importance of faith, and the pursuit of justice. These shared elements might suggest that both faiths are engaging with the same divine reality but interpreting it differently based on human limitations and historical contexts.Ultimately, if one religion claims exclusivity, as Christianity does, it cannot reconcile fully with another exclusive religion like Islam.

But the existence of Athe shared concept of Gods omnipotence or other agreed-upon attributessuggests that religions are at least attempting to describe something real, even if their exclusive claims (C or M) might be wrong.The point is that while religions may be wrong in their exclusivity, they could still reflect fragments of a larger truth.

These interpretations might seem contradictory on the surface but could still contain complementary truths about a reality beyond full human comprehension.The exclusivity of some religions does create conflicts, but these conflicts arise from human frameworks of understanding, not necessarily from the nature of divinity itself.

These faiths assert not just a belief in one God but also that their interpretation of God is the only correct one, dismissing all others as false.The exclusivity of Abrahamic faiths makes the question of a just and loving God particularly important because it highlights the contradiction in claiming universal love while condemning billions based on geography or upbringing. While your points about the possibility of a cruel or indifferent deity are valid in a broader religious context, my argument was targeted at addressing the claims and logic within Abrahamic traditions specifically.So you are right that, for many faiths, other faiths being true don't matter and don't make any contradictions to their teachings.

While you're right that humans cant fully comprehend the will or logic of an all-knowing God, thats precisely why exclusivity in religion might not align with divine reality. If God exists and is truly beyond human understanding, then insisting on a strict \\"either/or\\" framework for religious truth might be a limitation of human thinking, not a reflection of divine logic.Youre correct that contradictions in formal logic cant coexist, but religions might not be addressing truth in the binary way we think of in logic. Instead, they could be expressing different aspects or interpretations of a divine truth that transcends human categorization. Its less about contradictions and more about perspectives on the same reality.The post is based on the assumption of an all-loving God, not as a definitive claim but as a framework to engage with those who hold that same belief as me. While evidence for such a God often stems from personal experiences or philosophical reasoningwhich may not be universally persuasiveit holds significance for individuals. Im not asserting that God is all-loving; I believe He is. My intention was to challenge the logic of those who believe in an all-loving God yet simultaneously assert that only one religion can be true.","title":"CMV: All religions are true in part, or none are true at all"},{"text":"good ol podesta. been 8 years since i heard that name, obviously far too long, but seeing Debbie Wasserman Schultz comment on the election was also great, such a great treat","title":"Hakeem Jeffries reelected as House Democratic leader"},{"text":"Cenk started out a right winger.

The meeting comes two weeks after Republican Donald Trump won every swing state in the presidential election and gained ground in traditionally blue states and cities, including New York.?Identity politics does not work, said Goldman, who represents parts of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. Those who are focusing on, you know, all of this identity issues and political correctness are generally not the ones who are worried about the price of groceries.Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, served as lead Democratic counsel in Trumps first impeachment before he was elected to Congress. He criticized the party for not speaking out more strongly about the immigration crisis at the US southern border.Were not gonna gaslight the American people into thinking that the border is secure, Goldman said.Even Latino voters, who have traditionally voted Democratic, supported Trump by unprecedented margins. Torres, an Afro-Latino who represents parts of upper Manhattan and the Bronx, said that when the pendulum swings too far left, people want to shift right.Donald Trump essentially built the kind of coalition that the socialists dream of building, uniting the White working class of rural America with the Black and Brown working class of urban America, Torres said.","title":"NYC Democratic Congressmen Blast Party for Identity Politics"},{"text":"Lost any legitimacy they had left.","title":"The Young Turks continue to redpill themselves"},{"text":"Alternatively, only 6% of the US private workforce belongs to a union and the other 94%, at best, see union pandering as doing nothing for them personally and, at worst, view it as actively working against them as part of a (mostly fictitious) zero-sum game.","title":"Matthew Yglesias: Biden tried to make up for Democrats weaknesses with working class voters on cultural issues by going further left on economics too and it didnt work.

But theres a reason its not recommended for depression anymore, because it feels too good. So when everyone that is down or depressed or tired can go by amphetamine at Walmart, that will quickly spiral into an out of control addiction crisis. Stimulants at low doses are much different than stimulants when abused, and trust me they can be abused because of its very euphoric high. So now your coworker who began a low dose, experienced improvement at work, is now a tweaking all over the place paranoid mess who lost 50 lbs and is hallucinating. Those stimulants rapidly increase delta fosb expression in the brain, which regulates reward seeking behavior. Its called the master protein of addiction. Once over expressed, it starts creating behavioral reinforcement pathways that force you to seek out that reward (the drug), completely overriding self control. Amphetamines (adderall, methamphetamine) does this the most potently, but its implicated in every drug and behavioral addiction. Its deceiving, you dont realize its happening. The one more pill today wont hurt is an indication that delta fosb is being over expressed and youre losing self controlStimulants need to be controlled, because their addiction is severe. Lowering restrictions? Yes I agree. But having unmonitored and unrestricted access like you would with Tylenol is not realistic. We had that in the 40s with amphetamine where you could walk in and buy Benzedrine, an amphetamine inhaler and it was a disaster, Germany had pep pills containing amphetamine. So did Japan, the UK, Canada. Governments around the world quickly and swiftly put tight controls on amphetamine because of that. The only reason those adhd users you mention like bankers and executives arent tweakers is because the amount they can get each month is controlled. If it were unrestricted they would turn into the average meth head you find on the street. These drugs werent always illegal. They were made illegal for a reasonIf they werent highly addictive, I would agree with you. But they are. And that small dose that improves functioning will quickly result in rapid dose escalation and do the exact opposite of improvement.

No. I would, however, put some asshole career middle school teacher in charge of it, someone truly traumatized by lack of literacy, who will absolutely tear apart whoever wrote the last guidelines on it.

Even at 25-27% APR, the margins on credit card debt for banks usually end up around 8-10% (for a well run bank - Ive seen it much lower) - because so many of them default. They usually securitize vast amounts of credit card debt and sell it to high yield funds a couple times a year, because they dont want to deal with chasing charge offs.

The guy who owns an auto-body shop hangs out mostly with people who didn't go to college, who don't practice the same kind of social elite signaling behaviors like \\"quiet luxury\\" or to some extent \\"cultural progressivism\\" they have a harder time speaking in the language of money. Secretarial labor usually has a foot in both camps. A receptionist might marry a truck driver or the well-paid IT guy. There is somewhat of a gender divide here but a lawyer marrying a truck driver is unusual.Teachers are completely welcome in the social elite. No one would bat in an eye if a lawyer married a middle-school teacher. White-collar America loves teachers for the most part. Yeah there is a distinctly conservative strain of disliking teachers but the Democratic Party treats teachers as cultural heroes except when it comes to paying them and teachers can speak the language of money. In fact I would argue a lot of conservatives dislike teachers because they are seen as part of the social elite rather than part of their working-class community and its values. So Teachers are in the social elite but not paid well. I would say they are in the lower end of the struggling academic class and have more overlap with working class communities but it's a high status job. An upper-middle class family isn't upset if their kid becomes a teacher usually. They are upset if they become a mechanic. The mechanic might be paid more but that doesn't really matter.

So maybe were just dissatisfied with Presidents in general, which makes it unclear to me what they think is best for them means.

Take alcohol for example, it's legal in most of the world, and makes people very social.

They point to her wide base of donors and support among congressional Democrats.The most recent unsuccessful Democrats have not returned to the top of their partys ticket in subsequent elections.After losing the 2016 election to Mr Trump, Hillary Clinton remained on the fringes of the party and campaigned for Ms Harris, but did not play a significant role.John Kerry, who lost to George W Bush in 2004, was appointed secretary of state in Barack Obamas administration, and then US climate change envoy under the Biden administration.Other outside contenders for the 2028 nomination, according to the Echelon poll, include Tim Walz, JB Pritzker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Gretchen Whitmer.The same pollster found that, of Republican contenders for the nomination in 2028, JD Vance was the most popular with 37 per cent of the vote.He was followed by Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, both with 9 per cent support, and Ron DeSantis, with 8 per cent support.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/democrats-want-kamala-harris-to-run-again/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/19/democrats-want-kamala-harris-to-run-again/)","title":"Democrats want Kamala Harris to run again"},{"text":"It's not that hard to not commit a crime.It's also not that hard to get framed or otherwise falsely accused of a crime.

It's overblown and unnecessary and paints trans people as threatening OTHERS who don't deserve to identify with their chosen sex because their mere presence is terrifying.

It's the same as salesmen.  Doctors are sort of independent agents in the economy it's complicated but elite labor is basically a guild-system. You train as a ditch-digger until 35 and then you basically work for yourself. There is arguably pressure by the plutocrats to try and financialize health and reduce salaries and autonomy but it's a far from won battle. Doctors/Lawyer are also still paid more (Doctors much more Lawyers slightly more) . I think programmers are trying to upgrade their class status to elite labor but the plutocrats are fighting against that as wellI will admit Finance doesn't really fit in this model well. Some finance jobs fit in elite labor (independent wealth management, independent accountants) I would basically define elite labor as those who both are well paid and can choose when they want to work (don't have a boss).

Traditionally, class analysis was thought to have very robust answers as to both what constitutes the working class and how its members would behave.

Biden repeatedly argued while he was still running that Trump was a threat to democracy. As he campaigned in the final weeks of the election for his vice president, Biden specifically called for Trump to be locked up politically and said our democracy is at stake if Trump wins. Since the election, however, Biden has become more conciliatory, even receiving Trump with a big smile at the White House. Charlamagne spoke about this stark contrast with his co-hosts on The Breakfast Club on Thursday.I just dont understand the White House visit. Now granted, you know, Im glad its a peaceful transition of power, but what happened to the threat of democracy talk? What happened to the fascist talk? Charlamagne asked. By the way, I know Ive said those things about Trump as well, but Im not talking about me, Im talking about his political opponents, like President Biden. When they say it, it holds way more weight than me.He added further, Im just trying to figure out, how do you go from Hes an existential threat to democracy to Welcome back!

On the whole, Republicans have framed themselves as the party for people with *questions* while Democrats often frame themselves as the people with *all the answers*. The former feels validating to those outside of the political establishment, those without advanced political education, and those who feel left behind by economic and social progress. The latter can feel condescending, isolating, and arrogant.Trans issues are the perfect example of this in action. Many people who have no definitive bias and certainly no desire for trans people to face harm *do* have curiosity and anxiety about the relatively rapid social integration and visibility of trans as a concept and the universe of trans issues as a whole. They feel like those concerns are outright ignored, mocked, or derided by most Democrats - that even asking questions may be considered transphobic. The different positions of Americans on the hierarchy of needs leads to a disjointed situation where people concerned with their survival are concerned with inflation and wages but consistently seeing coastal elites whose wages are already sufficient drone on about inconsequential things like using pronouns in the professional workplace. Democrats have to reframe their posture on social issues - they can remain the party of social progress without lecturing Americans on the only right way to think that we only figured out ourselves from collectively skim-reading a Slate article last year.","title":"Democrat Seth Moulton defends comments on trans athletes amid backlash (exclusive)"},{"text":"\\\\ Yes, I also wonder if Bernie might have beat Trump in 2016.?And that's when I stopped reading","title":"America doesnt really have a working class || Noahopinion"},{"text":"It's not about helping you, we have to win elections first then we can do all those great things.

Fifteen percent of men have no close friendships at all, a fivefold increase since 1990. https://www.americansurveycenter.org/why-mens-social-circles-are-shrinking/Men and women have roughly the same likelihood of loneliness. 57% of men and 59% of women reported being lonely. Loneliness levels were close to equal in 2018 as well, with 53% of men and 54% of women reporting feelings of loneliness. In 2019, data showed a spike in loneliness among men, with 63% experiencing loneliness compared to 58% of women.\\nhttps://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look","title":"CMV: The Male Loneliness Epidemic is not as serious as made out to be"},{"text":"I always come to reddit for advice on international relations.

This basically makes them....kinda not exist to society at a larger scale. They're not going to go out, they're going to have a harder time finding employment, they're going to have all those social issues, because they've fallen below dangerous levels of self-esteem/confidence.Back when I was in a more critical state of this (I'm somewhat better now, but I'm very insecure because I always feel like I'm doing something horribly wrong being better) you wouldn't see me.

Or rather, men are not the primary driver of this trend, which is how I interpret your view based on the title and post. Of course everything you are saying is not wrong. Many women choose to adhere to certain kinds of beauty standards because it is what they like. They \\"do it for themselves\\" as you say and that is perfectly fine and valid. People in a modern society should be able to dress and look how they want. Only an overbearing and authoritarian society or government would mandate that people look a certain way. Which brings me to why you need to update your view based on evidence. There is a demographic of pro-authoritarian, pro-Western Chauvinism, and pro-social control people and they are mostly men. These kinds of men have been influencing Western culture since the beginning and continue to today. Perhaps even more so today given the rise of right-wing populism. The evidence shows that men are near equal contributors to this trend. Here's how:1. Plastic surgery is becoming more popular among men, significantly more popular. Men are quickly rising in the percentage of people who seek plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons (to adhere to an unrealistic and unnatural \\"male\\" beauty standard). Source: [American Society of Plastic Surgeons 2023 article on this topic.](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/articles/redefining-masculinity-the-growing-appeal-of-plastic-surgery-among-men)2. Men are largely responsible for the rise in right-wing populism around the world. Their influence in politics and societal norms does reach into beauty standards. Especially in the idea that \\"men should look muscular and large\\" and \\"women should look soft and small.\\" This helps drive some of the unrealistic beauty standards. It is unrealistic because the distribution of muscular/large and soft/small physical traits is a normalized/Gaussian distribution in both male and female populations. I.e., the average woman looks \\"soft and small\\" but that only accounts for about 2/3 of the population and entire 1/3 of women look \\"muscular/large.\\" The same conclusion is found with men (on average they look more muscular and large than women but that only accounts for 2/3. The other 1/3 do not fit this arbirtary \\"ideal\\" that right-wing social value proponents are trying to force upon people). In other words, the male dominated right-wing political movement is very much responsible for the rise of unrealistic, unnatural beauty standards that fit their right-wing cultural myths.

Although women do contribute about equally to the current state of beauty standards in the West, these standards all have roots in ideas that men put forward decades and centuries ago. These ideas have become popular again for the reasons described in #2.

And how does this change the fact that most men prefer women who have not done work on themselves? How can men be blamed for this trend among women when men don't want women who have had a lot of plastic surgery?\\"The answer is quite simple. Even though most men are normal and don't want to see a ton of plastic surgery, a significant number of influential and powerful men (and those that work in their circles) do want to see women get work done. Also, women often seek plastic surgery to try to look thinner or more feminine because right-wing men are the ones influencing culture to say \\"women must look soft and small.\\" Nature makes women (and men) in all sorts of shapes and sizes (it's a distirbution remember). QED, a minority of men are influencing culture to make women (and men) feel like they need to change to conform to their \\"god given gender\\" or some other nonesense. It's essentially gender affirming care but with a right-wing traditionalist flavor. So you're right men shouldn't be blamed for this trend but right-wing men definitely are responsible for this (and right-wing women).","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Jacksonville R +6 doubt it can be flipped.","title":"Hakeem Jeffries reelected as House Democratic leader"},{"text":"Still an absolutely HUGE undertaking to try to deport millions of people.

For example, a general contractor who makes $150,000 a year without a college education is more working class than the sociology post-doc student working at Target to cover the bills while they wait for a tenured position to open up. But its also a cultural phenomenon. The Working Class of America is deeper than education or income or even rural/urban.Its Pliny the Elder vs. Miller Lite. Its vacationing in Branson vs. traveling to Europe. Its Ford trucks vs. bike lanes. Its wild-caught salmon vs. smothered pork chops. Its Hokas vs. New Balance. Its Kid Rock vs Taylor Swift.

You can't just deport millions of working immigrants, legal or otherwise and expect everything to be fine. Prices of food will go up as companies either have to pay more money to American workers, or worst case scenario food supplies start running out due to those jobs being unfilled.

Then you must also know Kamala lied through her teeth when she said Abortion without restrictions on time is not illegal anywhere. What are you referencing by every position? Abortion? Or more generally to any of the other items on the list?\\nIf abortion, and thats what you believe, then fine. But the Democrats party line has absolutely never been that government should not be involved, it is that government should codify the right to abortion, including voting and campaigning against the Partial Birth Abortion act and, when possible, as shown in Minnesota, have so little regard for restrictions that they do not enact any. That is tangible, recent, direct to this candidate, and consistent with Democratic policy. Dont insult me with your insinuations that a West Coast politician is not on board with the most extreme positions on this, and no amount of statements that the government should stay out of abortion will change the actual reality of what that means, and frankly, its insulting to the people that need to be won over to insist otherwise. I agree that I gave a very broad generalization of Trump\\nvoters which was incorrect. The underlying point was that both sides are a coalition of people, and I should have said the CBA of each person would determine how they vote generally, while they may not agree with the full party line. Having said that, your assertion that these Mainstream, recent, and fully supported Democratic positions are in any way equivalent to a cadre of White Nationalists that support Trump running around with flags is absurd. They are coalition members and have been part of both Republican and Democratic coalitions in recent times. More specifically, they are not the policies. The policies listed, since you seem determined to deny their relevance, are in order:\\n1. Kamala Harris supported transgender surgeries for inmates. Doesnt Matter how rare, and one might think if it is super rare that you might just leave it alone.\\n2. Kamala co sponsored the Zero Emissions EV act of 2019 which would have had a 2040 date to be all EV.\\n3. Newsome and California Democrats signed a bill to hide students gender identity from their parents. This issue has come up in multiple Democrats states and is showing up at the local level by districts doing similar or intentionally leaving parents in the dark. Consistent Democratic theme. \\n4. Democrats Juan Castro, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg (too bad, I like Mayor Pete, but thats going to bite him when he runs again) argued for decriminalizing border crossings in 2019. Biden opposed it.  But thats a whos who of Democrats.\\n5. Abortion- already addressed, and again, on the record consistently for no government restrictions which is another way of saying legal through day of birth.\\n6. Not going to do more than a cursory search, will just note you can tie several items together to get to this inference.\\n7. Harris was on the record opposed to fracking as are many Democratic politicians. Words and the policies they push are both applicable here. A pro EV vote is anti fracking which is a huge economic issue for multiple states.\\n8. Democrats fought for single payer, not sure who can claim this isnt desired. It was killed by republicans and democrats playing by the rules. \\n9. Defunding the police was popular among democratic politicians. Google it.\\n10. Marijuana legalization broadly supported by Democratic politicians. \\n11. California democrats pushing reparations commission and the narrative it is required. Get a democrat anywhere with national ambitions,  pre 2024 election on the record against it. Wont find it outside of competitive states. Thats important as well: what you say in moderate states doesnt align with liberal states and when the party is dragged by the most socially progressive, its not surprising to me to see people assume thats how theyll really govern or think. Specifically when its happening in her home state, this is even less surprising of a connection.\\n12. This has been popular for a long time on the Democratic side. If you dont know that, you must be young.Your comparison to the voters in a coalition is not honest, as these are actual mainstream policies of the Democratic Party. Not just their coalition voters. Again, feel free to google and prove me wrong. Finally, I am not saying Trump doesnt have stupid or racist or inane policies. I am saying that the claim that these beliefs of voters are ridiculous, is an intentionally malevolent and destructive lie, meant to tear apart the fabric of the country.","title":"The conservative ecosystem made a big bet that lying constantly about every Dem policy position would help win on Election Day.

But looking just at your stated policy, I'm also not even sure what you are proposing is much different from what we already do. Unauthorized immigrants are already breaking the law and risk being deported. There are some legal paths to become citizens, but certain crimes are going to impact their eligibility. So if I'm understanding your view, I think the main distinction between your view and the status quo pretty much just amounts to the level of Federal resources we should commit to proactively deport these people right now.The other problem is that even if Trump did get the resources to deport all these people that doesn't necessarily mean the other countries will take them.

Again I dont think you fully understand what Im saying, perhaps Im being unclear._There was one caveat where you made a huge claim as a truth. You believe profit sharing is a good thing. I genuinely agree in principle. In practice; its a fucking tough mantra to attain and maintain._I wasnt talking about profit sharing ?? even though I do think it is a good thing too.I was saying one demographic (men) profit from entrenching and perpetuating the unattainable beauty standards society foists on women (and recently, men). That because companies have a profit motive they will take the path of least resistance that will yield the most profit.  That the people at the top of the companies influence and benefit from societal norms and then profit off it. Historically it was 90% men and nowadays its more 70/30 men and women - who benefit financially from those patriarchal norms. _Yeah no the journalism thing I wasnt saying its a bad thing. I was saying that it happened due to (not necessarily progressive) men taking in women to do paperwork. have you ever seen shindlers list?

Yes, lol._Again, what? Here you acknowledge that women in your Schindlers list example got hired due to their attractiveness and then you also acknowledge that women got into journalism through secretarial work and you do not see how youre describing patriarchal norms and how that was a barrier for women or disadvantaged women?Are you serious? And why do you keep brining up an individuals internal motivations? Its not particularly relevant to the discussion and its already been addressed. \\nSystemic marginalization does not require malicious intent or even hatred. Some people do have those thoughts and beliefs but that isnt necessary to perpetuate the harms and barriers. Patriarchy benefits men whether they want it to or not. And even if it _also_ harms men. _Men created the avenue dude it was not the state or lobby groups that formed the opportunities. Likewise, wartime lead to a lot of shifts in role._Huh? Could you expand on what you mean by this. Thank ya. _I am not disagreeing with you on these points; Im disagreeing as to how change comes about._But I didnt discuss how to bring about change? I never made a case for what to do moving forward so how can you disagree with me on something I have not argued?_We romanticize what often happens to be things that appeal to everyone, not just one interest group. I think that also speaks as to why intersectional feminism is so popular; it advocates for collective bargaining amongst differently motivated minority interest groups._Okay? _Monarchy and slavery still exist around the world. Just as misogyny does._Not in every country and most are constitutional monarchies in fact, most countries do not have monarchies . Feudalism doesnt exist as a economic system anymore, and slavery is illegal in most countries and has been banned and dismantled in most of them, so yeah, bad things still exist but not at the same rate or to the same degree and that is a result of the conscious effort and work of an untold number of people across the world and throughout time. So simply acknowledging that bad things continue to exist doesnt take away from how much less of it exists or how relatively quickly things have in fact changed and changed for the better. _Im trying to stipulate as to how weve nurtured Feminism and assigned rights; theres not much to bargain for its more-so protection against regressive attitudes._Okay.

Am I understanding you correctly in that women feel pressured to conform to beauty standards where men find them attractive. Consequently, since this is so prevalent, this standard ends up getting pushed on women who aren't even trying to look attractive to men as the \\"default standard,\\" often by media and other women who are socialized to look that way. This is why it is still the \\"male gaze\\" because it's for the benefit, or perceived benefit of men for women to look a certain way even if those standards are being pushed by other women and men aren't explicitly demanding it.?\\nyes though I would add that I don't see it as simply as \\"women only think it matters to be pretty because men told them it does\\". it's a very, very broad social thing. women are raised to place a lot of importance on how they look for reasons that benefit men. women certainly can and do still look however they want and I don't think that every woman, when she gets dressed in the morning, is thinking \\"how do I make sure I'm hot for men?\\". but these ideas are legitimized through the kinds of women who get to be main characters and how women are portrayed in media overall and the expectations placed on them. but in short yes.?\\nIf I'm understanding that correctly, would it then be true that men who feel they need big muscles to attract women and then push that idea/standard to other men are doing so out of the \\"female gaze?\\" Because if it's done to be attractive to women, and doesn't require women's direct input, then I'm not sure how that's different.\\nwell, what society in which women have been the primary rulers for all time can we look to to compare this idea of the male gaze to the idea of the female gaze? since part of the idea of the male gaze is that it's portrayed as the default, we'd need a society that has always treated men the way men have always treated women. the fact that one doesn't exist kinda gives away why they're different. even if we call what is ultimately a survival strategy \\"the female gaze\\", this gaze doesn't have anywhere near the presence and power it's male counterpart does. that's why people don't talk about \\"the female gaze\\", not because we hate men (I love men) but because the female gaze is an entirely different beast to the male gaze.?\\nBecause if it's done to be attractive to women, and doesn't require women's direct input, then I'm not sure how that's different. That being said, it would seem silly to argue that unrealistic male beauty standards advocated by \\"alpha male\\" or \\"looksmaxing\\" communities are done so because of the \\"female gaze,\\" but I'm not sure how to reconcile that with how you've defined the \\"male gaze.\\"?\\nAgain, I could be totally misunderstanding your point. I'm also not trying to argue that men don't place unrealistic beauty standards on women, just how \\"male gaze\\" is defined in that context.I think you could argue that unrealistic male beauty standards are part of the male gaze in the sense that they position very toned men as the ideal out of a sense of wish fulfilment. men with big muscles are strong because they can exert force and control over the world around them and because women are shown as wanting that. but this harms men as well.?\\nit's so difficult to put into words but I think people read into terms like \\"male gaze\\" an accusatory tone that isn't really there. I think a lot of men feel like, when they hear the term, we are referring to specifically the way all men see the world, as if men choose to have \\"the male gaze\\" but that's not the case. the male gaze evolved through and exists for men, yes, but not because men actively decided to come up with toxic ways to define their masculinity. we're victims of this as well BUT the way in which we are victims of the male gaze is different to the way women are.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Soon","title":"??Anyone feel like this sub has been infiltrated by a steady stream of ??nefarious?? right wing larpers that have been trying to take over this bernie sub in order to further their nefarious goals of dampening enthusiasm for democrats, using ancient putinite tactics such as so called \\"facts\\"??"},{"text":"I cant think of a single time where a certain ethnicity and group was rounded up, put on buses and trains to somewhere far away because a charismatic dude was leading a broke nation.

Why? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws, which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague. In Three Felonies a Day, Harvey A. Silverglate reveals how federal criminal laws have become dangerously disconnected from the English common law tradition and how prosecutors can pin arguable federal crimes on any one of us, for even the most seemingly innocuous behavior. The volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and into the morass of the Code of Federal Regulations, handing federal prosecutors an additional trove of vague and exceedingly complex and technical prohibitions to stick on their hapless targets. The dangers spelled out in Three Felonies a Day do not apply solely to white collar criminals, state and local politicians, and professionals. No social class or profession is safe from this troubling form of social control by the executive branch, and nothing less than the integrity of our constitutional democracy hangs in the balance.However, I wouldn't read it uncritically: Silvergate's choice of examples to introduce his book does not address the quoted thesis at all (that average professionals unknowingly commit felonies), and thus one can assume the whole book fails to support his thesis.(https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/22536)Conversely: The big point is that rule of law CANNOT entail the impossibility of intelligent, decent, informed citizens who cannot stay on the right side of substantive laws. It then means prosecutors can convict anyone these choose to go after. Gives prosecutors the equivalent of bill of attainder power. Once in their focus, other felonies follow (e.g. misleading statements). Many of the people who might contribute the most to society subconsciously choose to avoid being bold and entrepreneurial, lest they attract too much attention and face possible prosecution/persecution.(https://www.econlib.org/three-felonies-a-day/)","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I think ultimately it still all stems from women competing for men's attention, whether or not they admit it even to themselves.Put a bunch of women on an uninhibited island with no hope of ever being seen by a man again, and see if they'll be up keeping many of these practices just for themselves or for each other. That competition then tends to get a bit out of hand - same as with men and the giant muscles. Basically, if you know men like a natural smaller waist and curvy hips, you think great - but mine isn't as small or curvy as the other girl's, so maybe I'll go and get a bbl so I look as good as her. \\nShe gets the bbl which gives her a shape that would be very hard to achieve naturally. Then that naturally curvy girl is suddenly looking at HER, going, CRAP, look at her body, she has such amazing proportions I can't get no matter what I do, maybe I should look into surgery.Bam, she gets a bbl and lipos her waist. And then so it goes, until a bunch of these women are all looking like caricatures more than human beings. Same with lips, lashes, boobs etc etc. The more is better mentality, but you also develop a blindness to it. I would wager not many of these girls are going to their surgeons asking to please give them the most unnatural body in existence. If you read the discussions of women who've had this stuff done even in a way that's obviously botched to others - most will insist and swear up and down that *their* lip filler/ bbl/ implants look 'subtle' and 'tasteful' and 'natural', and they would be convinced no one around them can tell they've had anything done, most of all men. These women then also do tend to be overall extremely attractive due to everything they do to be so, they're 'shiny', glam, sexy, they stand out, so of course they catch plenty of male eyes and are showered with a ton of attention - despite all the men claiming they dislike that look. It may not be quality relationship attention but it's attention nonetheless, which reaffirms that they're on the right path, and also sends a clear signal to other women when all the men are drawn to the shiny huge boob bbl chick like moths to a flame, when the 'natural' girl becomes the invisible wallflower in comparison.\\nThat wallflower is more likely to meet a decent guy who will love her for who she is, but that's very hard to understand especially when you're young and vulnerable.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"If that happened you would starve to death in a matter of weeks.

Creating affirmative action for CEOs will not give you the kind of representation you want it would be cronies to the man who happen to be women, not progressives._No one in this discussion is advocating for affirmative action for CEOs. Why would you bring that up? Plus, I didnt advocate for more women representation at that level. I simply stated that historically and to a somewhat lesser degree that currently men make up a majority of CEOs, upper management and shareholders in those industries. This means that that group profits from those industries and norms and have historically and to a lesser degree currently influenced  what the beauty standards are. That is it. There has been no prescriptions on solving it in my comments or even judgements on it, simply explaining that it exists and how that impacts and is a factor in beauty standards. So either youre not fully reading my comments or youre trying to get me to make an argument I havent made. _Right, and this has changed. This is no longer the trend; does this apply to cosmetics and makeup, considering how many new successful brands there are (past 20 years)? I see a lot of female executives coming up when Im searching household cosmetic brands_I dont disagree and in fact, in my first comment said as much - that it is less so the case in the present. Men do still make up a majority but its like 70/30 or 60/40 now. It is definitely significantly better than the past. _Ok that was 64 years ago; times have changes. Womens re not disenfranchised when it comes to specifically banking and finance._Once again, I literally said as much. Im not arguing that things have not changed or improved. Seriously, are you reading my comments in full? I dont mean to be rude but youve just used more words to say the same thing I did and the ascribe arguments to me that I did not make._Journalism was traditionally a mans job ?._Yeah because at the time women were systemically barred from studying or entering the field. And that changed only in the last century or so. What IS funny is you saying that it was a traditionally a mans job while denying that there was were societal structures that marginalized women to the benefit of men. Such as prestigious jobs being seen as mens work and women being excluded from those spaces and work that was seen as traditionally womens work was not only unpaid but also seen as unimportant and not intellectually or physically challenging such as child rearing, home making or film editing and computer programming (at first). _Just because it was one of the first to allow admins who then segeweyed into Journalism is completely different. That is dishonest as to how it came about._What? Literally what are you trying to say here? That women working their way up from admin/secretary to journalist is less worthy or prestigious than men who became journalists? Why? Why would you assume that that is lesser to how men may have joined the industry? _designed for me ??_It would be more accurate for me to say designed to benefit men at the expense of women. _You mean designed by men for all of society? Men as the pre-dominant demographic, sure, but policy had always included  man, women and child with caveat for elderly._No, I meant designed to benefit men at the expense of women and there are all sorts of examples such as; it taking 5-8 years longer for women to get accurate diagnoses when sick because how conditions present in women was not fully studied until comparatively recently (last 70-80 years or so), womens symptoms not taken seriously, medicine not having clinical trials that include women until like 30 years ago, women suffering greater and more deadly injuries in car accidents because crash test dummies only came in mens forms and sizes until relatively recently (30-20 years ago roughly), etc.None of this was done intentionally to destroy womens lives, but rather unintentionally because of how women simply werent considered or it was assumed men where the base line human and women the deviation. And so women tended to have worse outcomes. Its definitely changing and improving but these things do harm women _because_ of patriarchy and systemic sexism. _I fully understand the history of it._\\nHonestly, and no shade, I dont think you do. You may know the facts but you have not considered how those historical facts impact the present or how they impact social, political or economic policy and norms. You may be coming from a defensive and dismissive place with the expectation of a fight when really Im hoping for a discussion that isnt needlessly adversarial._You are attributing motivations to these organizations that frankly dont even align with their values. Point: youre really being hyperbolic as to how systemic (i.e. the byproducts of a system that revolves around a cis-white-male) affected the individual_No I am describing the result of living in a patriarchal society and how it impacts industries and how it shapes our society. It has nothing to do with any person or companys internal motivations.It has to do with the end result of their actions. And how societal beliefs, norms and structures can reproduce specific forms of oppression or marginalization _even if that is not the goal or unintentionally_. It is profitable to sell an unattainable beauty standard to the majority of people - it is the path of least resistance to lean into questionable or problematic gender stereotypes and expectations. It will earn profit and so companies do that to earn the most profit. _Patriarchal society yes, and its not going anywhere dude I dont like sounding like a pessimist but we literally cannot create that paradigm shift away from patriarchy without destroying all institutions that currently exist. Even then, not all of society would follow suit_Not with that attitude its not. I disagree, I do not think we need to destroy everything to get rid of patriarchy. Considering how things have changed in positive ways, it is possible for things to continue to change and improve if we work at it. Monarchy and feudalism and slavery were all embedded in societies until they werent and things changed because people wanted and forced said change. Change is always possible with effort.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"The cognitive dissonance of essentially claiming the land really belongs to black people and the white people who settled it while ignoring the atrocities committed to the natives is just fascinating.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I'm confused. Am I understanding you correctly in that women feel pressured to conform to beauty standards where men find them attractive. Consequently, since this is so prevalent, this standard ends up getting pushed on women who aren't even trying to look attractive to men as the \\"default standard,\\" often by media and other women who are socialized to look that way. This is why it is still the \\"male gaze\\" because it's for the benefit, or perceived benefit of men for women to look a certain way even if those standards are being pushed by other women and men aren't explicitly demanding it.If I'm understanding that correctly, would it then be true that men who feel they need big muscles to attract women and then push that idea/standard to other men are doing so out of the \\"female gaze?\\" Because if it's done to be attractive to women, and doesn't require women's direct input, then I'm not sure how that's different. That being said, it would seem silly to argue that unrealistic male beauty standards advocated by \\"alpha male\\" or \\"looksmaxing\\" communities are done so because of the \\"female gaze,\\" but I'm not sure how to reconcile that with how you've defined the \\"male gaze.\\"Again, I could be totally misunderstanding your point.\\n I'm also not trying to argue that men don't place unrealistic beauty standards on women, just how \\"male gaze\\" is defined in that context.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Biden has all these new executive powers granted by the Supreme Court and he is just sitting on his hands.","title":"Biden should order background checks of Trumps Cabinet picks"},{"text":"Yeah, CA here.
