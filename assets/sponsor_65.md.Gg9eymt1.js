At this moment, Texas' first anarcho-capitalist society, the tiny Cowboyland Republic, was founded! It is now a city state independent from the USA, like Monaco! Another method is to give towns and local governments, such as HOAs, a path to independence through unilateral referendums. In this way, the USA could be destroyed slowly by breaking it into pieces. The last thing the Federal Government would do would be to check whether independence referendums or land sales were legal.

No matter what choice you make, youll still have to endure the unbearable grief of losing someone you love and know theres nothing you can do to stop it, nothing you can really even do to help them.I lost my dad to dementia earlier this year. His decline was pretty quick  he was in the hospital for just over a month. He went in with a UTI; before that, he had dementia, but still had a lot of his faculties. Physically, he went in pretty healthy (besides the UTI), but his mental state took a sharp decline once hospitalized. He became confused, and just got worse and worse. By Week 2, he was hardly there.I visited him as often as I could bear during that month. I was the only family nearby, but it still took a massive toll on me. I struggled to get through each day, knowing he was in such pain. After visiting, I couldnt eat, would hardly sleep it would take me a while to recover. Some people can stand to see that sort of thing with their loved ones, but I guess Im not that kind of person.We were still able to talk a little, but he was delirious and largely incoherent. He couldnt follow a conversation, couldnt recognize anyone he was hallucinating, getting violent with medical staff (+ me a few times), refusing to eat. He lost all faculties I wont go into the gory details of his decline, but it was absolutely heart-wrenching to see.I felt an obligation to visit him so long as he was still slightly there, but I couldnt bear it very often. 2-3 visits per week, no more. Eventually, though there was no more there. He was just laying in bed, unresponsive, totally empty.We knew the end was coming at that point. It was only a matter of when. I tried to yknow, tried to talk to him, to get even a glimmer of him, but there was nothing. He had gone to a place I couldnt follow  I genuinely believe at that point, his soul had moved on, and his body was just waiting for the end. I like to believe that. It gives me peace.A few days before the end, I went to him one last time. He wasnt really there. I talked to him, sang to him, said I love you. Told him goodbye. I thanked him for being the very best dad told him it was okay to go. Even if he couldnt process or understand me, I like to think he still heard, wherever he was. It was a resolution, a final visit, and it brought me some real peace.That was the last time I visited him. He went into basically a coma, and died five days later.Youve got to understand, itll hurt like hell either way. But theres NO shame in not being there for the end. Its not like pulling the plug on someone, when you know exactly when it will end; its not like an illness, when you can be with someone, comforting them, til their last moments. Dying of dementia is slow, drawn out, and agonizing for everyone involved. What you see, the pain you feel itll stick with you forever.Im so glad to have had that last visit with my dad, but definitely am not ashamed that I wasnt there for the end. We made our peace. I was there for him while he was still there, and said goodbye to him once he wasnt. Sometimes, thats all you can do. And it IS enough.","title":"If you've had a loved one die from dementia/alzheimers did you visit them at the end and how do you feel about your decision?"},{"text":"I dunno, lots liberals have shown themselves to not be that committed to egalitarianism now that those disadvantaged are an interest group they don't care about?","title":"The left is losing its grip on ethnic minority voters"},{"text":"She's now the victim?","title":"Biden sabotaging Kamala Harris' presidential campaign after being forced to drop re-election bid, pundits say"},{"text":"\\"I swear to god I'll pistol whip the next guy who says applesauce!\\" Brian Cox","title":"Michael Moore Dares Joe Biden to Use Full Immunity in Last Days as Prez"},{"text":"So Trump spouting actual fascist rhetoric makes him a liberal?","title":"Mark Cuban on backing Kamala Harris and his concerns about Trump"},{"text":"I always like to remind people that Hillary Clinton lost the college educated female vote in Florida.

Ideologies are not simply flavors of life that we choose to our liking. Ideologies are the unconscious manifestations of people living their lives. The ideology under which you labor is so engrained that you dont even recognize it as ideology. Its easy to point to others as say wow, poor sods, they live their lives under such illusions, only to return to your own life suffuse with assumptions and commitments that you adopted from those around you.Tolerance, social respect, human rights  all are benefits of a modern ideology. Dont get me wrong, as a fellow person caught in this particular ideology, I value these benefits and wish that they could be the universal standard. But even this desire hints at how embedded ideology is to action.What is to be done if people do not wish to adhere to mutual respect and human rights? How do we get people to act virtuously if they simply do not want to? Do we let evil deeds go unaddressed and unpunished? If yes, then this appeal to good nature is suicidal; the evil do what they can and the good preach about good it would be if only everyone was good. But if we instead answer no, then we grapple with the fact that there likely will never be total agreement and social compromises must be negotiated. Social structures such as laws and cultures are formed to shape behavior towards cooperative ends. These social structures are enforced by force. We simply lump all such behavior into a mega-category called ideology. There is no end to ideology because there is no end to human thought. The claim that we can reject all ideology is not actually denouncing ideology  it is simply a bid to replace existing ones with your own preferred ideology.","title":"An urgent message to the world."},{"text":"It doesnt do shit if 47% of the votes are for republicans. If we had a few concurrent landslides it would make a significant difference.","title":"Michael Moore Dares Joe Biden to Use Full Immunity in Last Days as Prez"},{"text":"Mucho texto about social constructionism and LGBT incoming:For the last week on the DT I had a few episodes where I went on somewhat unhinged rants about how the ideas and language of social constructionism have made it increasingly common for people to outright reject the idea that people from the distant past can ever be described as homosexual or bisexual because these are fundamentally modern ideas.If you are curious to see a distilled example of this argument being made, here is a TikTok (I know) link to one about Achilles from the Iliad: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMhUWYqNc/In the video, the creator explains that we can't say the author of the Iliad intended Achilles to be bisexual, because bisexual is a modern category that didn't exist then.If you are curious why this would trigger such an unhinged response from me, it's because this idea, together with pop versions of fluid sexuality, combine to yield an attitude to sexual orientation (and probably gender identity) that generates opinions which sound frighteningly like the homophobic ideas I grew up hearing.The last person who told me that I, as a gay man, should try to date women and be open to the idea wasn't an African traditionalist or an evangelical Christian. It was a university educated progressive type of person. She was doing the whole \\"well you know none of our sexualities are fixed\\" thing and then when I pushed back that I really don't experience attraction to women, she tried to deconstruct that. When I said I was gay she asked what that term even really means, and said it's an artificial social construct. That in a year or two I might find myself falling head over heels with a woman, and maybe the only reason it hasn't happened yet is because I avoid even trying to open my mind to feel that way because of my rigid view of sexuality.It was very much a \\"walks like a duck, talks like a duck\\" moment for me in terms of triggering all my memories of homophobes trying to rationalise the gay away. And yet, everything she said was premised on ideas that have completely taken over the language of LGBT identity in progressive spaces, even if the content of those ideas hasn't fully been appreciated.The reason I went on the unhinged rants is because I was triggered. But I do think the underlying questions and implications of believing that deeply in social constructionism and sexual fluidity are interesting.Here is a BBC article where the author makes the case against the idea that people are Born This Way. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160627-i-am-gay-but-i-wasnt-born-this-way. The title is \\"I am gay, but I wasn't born this way\\".The article is interesting and makes some very good points. I don't deny that. But again, I get triggered by one paragraph in there. Read this with or without context and it's still sus: Why might we be uncomfortable asking whether and how much control we each possess over our full range of erotic possibilities, as Ward calls it? What would it mean to think about peoples capacity to cultivate their own sexual desires, in the same way we might cultivate a taste for food? she asks. Ward thinks this question is the next frontier of queer thought.I'm going to sound unhinged again, but this sets off all my alarm bells. If you follow this line of logic within a progressive context, you can get to some pretty frightening places. Because if we are going to cultivate our sexuality, maybe we should cultivate it with a view to being more inclusive given the sociopolitical context we live in? For example, look how gender critical/TERF people use progressive arguments against trans people. If my sexuality is something I identify into and can cultivate and is fluid, what exactly does it mean that I am so \\"unwilling\\" to consider dating a woman? And regardless of what it says about me personally, the consequences of a world in which the most well educated men in my society turn to homosexuality are pretty negative for poorer women. Marriage is not an ideal institution and women should not have to rely on it to get ahead. But many do. And the fact that as soon as women managed to win some equitable treatment in marriage people like me stopped wanting to marry them is problematic. This sounds insane because it is, but it's an argument I used to hear in a conservative form (\\"you're running away from your responsibility as a man\\"). There is an entire narrative I could spin that would paint myself and most gay men as deeply misogynistic using critical theory logic. And it makes logical sense if you believe people can choose and cultivate their sexuality. Progressives just haven't connected the dots yet. Although they have started when it comes specifically to White gay men.There are really good social constructionist perspectives and really good reasons to deconstruct \\"gay\\" identity. The majority of people who have had sex with the same sex do not fit even a minimal gay identity of \\"spontaneous, innate and consistent attraction to the same sex\\", much less the cultural baggage. Most of them are somewhere in between what I would refer to as bisexual, curious or circumstantially homosexual. And the social constructionists are questioning the value of even distinguishing. In South Africa, the best example would be the men who go to work on mines who had a culture of taking younger men on the mines as \\"wives\\" while they were there. You could have such a man who has been having sex with men for years and has effectively been married to a man to some extent. That man knows _way_ more about loving men than some 21 year old who comes out and recites the whole \\"ever since I was young I knew I was different\\" speech. And that man would adamantly tell you he never desired a man and he only got into it on the mines and it's just a choice because of the situation but he's grown to like it. Why should \\"homosexual identity\\", if it is to be defined at all, be defined by the minority of same-sex loving people who psychiatrists took an interest in during the 20th century?Nonetheless, there are dangers and logical errors in this idea. I just don't want LGBT to be blindsided if in a few years the close-mindedness is coming from the other direction because we gave them free reign to define us. When it comes to racial identity, this sub of liberals is probably correctly skeptical of some of the ideas about how to think about race that come from modern left wing academics. There is an appreciarion that Black Lives Matter might say one thing about being Black, but the ladies at the local AME church might say another and they matter just as much if not more. But with LGBT people, the voice of the academy is completely unchallenged and assumed to be identical with the voice of LGBT people. Which is ironic because the social construction of LGBT identity by white elites in academia and medical science is exactly what was supposed to be deconstructed in the first place.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://archive.ph/8Ujpp","title":"Who Is Kamala Harris?

Time to add my opinions to the mix: I feel like there were lots of people overcomplicating things. It really isn't that hard, even for people with autism.\\n1. **Don't be weird**Meaning, don't do super unconventional stuff super early into dating someone. If you are not in-tune with other people's emotions enough to anticipate how some super unconventional stuff will be received, then don't do it. Don't get overexcited and don't overshare too early2. **Listen to and respect what the other person says**Consent can be withdrawn at any time. This doesn't just apply to consent to touch, or consent to sex, it also applies to the consent about texting romantically. A \\"no\\" is a \\"no\\".\\n3. **Try to be in tune with non-verbal cues**Look, I get it, trying to read body language and tone can be hard, especially if you are on the spectrum. It *is* a learning experience and mistakes happen. That said, there is some Pareto principle at play here. With 20% of the effort/skill, you can get 80% of the results. When texting, you want to be aware of any enthusiasm gap. Who initiates more texts? Whose texts are longer? If you always initiate and your average text length is 5x as long as the other person's, then there is a mismatch. This should be pretty easy to analyze even for people with autism. And this doesn't even take the tone of texts into consideration, which gives even more extra information. In person, this is harder. In the end, practice makes perfect. Similarly to texting, you can tell enthusiasm by who carries the conversation. Other good signs are if the other person enthusiastically hugs you at the start or end of the date, or initiates other physical contact. If you are really, really bad at reading signs, then be cautious about initiating touch. Instead try to focus on sending out signals the other person might pick up on.\\nThe main message I want to convey is that if you stay within \\"standard dating parameters\\" (this is point 1) and honor 100% of direct verbal encouragement and rejections (this is point 2), then even if you lack skill in reading body language and tone (this is point 3), you can get far without the risk of making the other person super uncomfortable. \\nNow it can be exciting to deviate from the \\"standard dating parameters\\", but this requires a lot of intuition about people &amp; dating in general, and about the specific person you are hoping to date. If your people skills aren't super great, then stick to the standard. \\n**Now which of these three things did STRONK fail at? All of them, at some point**He failed 1 by being a weirdo sending a fucking kink questionnaire before a first date. This is something that normal people would talk about AFTER having had sex, and in person (if the vibes are that way). STRONK just does not have the social skills to reliably estimate if sending such a questionnaire so early would be a good idea or not. He should have known this and concluded that such a huge deviation from standard dating parameters is completely out of bounds. Arguably, he failed 1 by trying to date a coworker. Dating a coworker is obviously not nearly as out of bounds of standard parameters as sending a kink questionnaire, but it might be too far out of the standard for STRONK's social skills nonetheless.He failed 3 by texting huge texts to her 3-5 word responses. He might have also failed 3 in person, but we don't know.\\nHe failed 2 by not immediately following her request to \\"stop pursuing me romantically\\". The correct answer is \\"Understood\\", and not another one of his essays. Also, maybe I am out of the loop, but didn't that same woman text him that she \\"wasn't ready for a relationship right now\\" before that? Because that's already a rejection and at that point STRONK should have ALREADY ceased any and all romantic pursuits.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"your wife is based!","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The rich love the dems","title":"Mark Cuban on backing Kamala Harris and his concerns about Trump"},{"text":"Holy shit.

(Different races were counted as different beings) But they also had different species like reptiliansHonestly until I saw this question I forgot I wanted to research more into it. I don't know if people mean physical shape shifters or just reptilian minded(lack of emotion, instinct for survival based). As for my own thoughts, anything is possible. I lean more towards it being true, just based on puzzle pieces I feel I've uncovered. I think there's a lot we don't know. And until the internet, we were pretty limited in knowledge around us and had to take what we did get and trust the source. Now you can talk to someone in real time across the world with next to no lag. Information is power and until recently it was easier to limit and track. I think the internet was a double-edged sword.

However, if companies were told in 2019 that theyd have to work remotely for a year they would have said it would be impossible. Then they adapted. And the longer theyd have to do it, the better theyd get at it. And lets not make this a black and white issue, I think its reasonable to assume that a 70% loss in efficiency would mean an exception where the job would be able to be offered presentially.Edit: also, there could be different rules for companies of different sizes, which is already the case for things like diversity. Honestly, I think massive corps could stand to lose efficiency and ensure more of their profits end up with some extra workers instead of in the pockets of billionaires.","title":"CMV: The EU should legislate to make remote working the rule, not the exception"},{"text":"No. Read the article.

Conservatism is about promoting traditional values and resistance to change. The examples you are giving are just the platform the Republican Party briefly promoted. Party politics are not analogous to political ideology.Free speech is a classical liberal concept, and has very little do with left or right in American politics. Give me some examples of where this has historically been a left/right issues even in the United States and maybe I can see you point here. Today, its just used as a buzz word by both parties to promote whatever agenda theyre after.A free market is also a classical liberal concept. In the 19th liberals promoted free trade and conservatives were skeptical of it. Both political parties in the United States tended to favor it historically and painted tariffs as communist. The republicans only recently abandoned supporting it because Trump saw protectionism as a way to play to the nativist elements of labor.In terms of patriotism, maybe the right has historically championed their own patriotism more historically, but where are you getting that the left also isnt as patriotic. Patriotism doesnt mean blindly following your government. Do you think FDR and Jimmy Carter didnt love the United States because they were on the left?The driving force behind a conservative ideology is always a desire to preserve the things the way they are, a fear of change, and romanticizing previous eras. Extreme right wing ideologies all display these characteristics. If they are advocating radical change, it is to return to what they thought was a better time, even if their view of that time is inaccurate.","title":"CMV: Alt-Right Ideology Is Not Conservatism"},{"text":"I watched kurzgesagts new video on the state of the world and I stopped being suicidalfor like 10 minutes","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If he endorses her, he might.

Ive since changed that mindset after having an epiphany. Two actually. The first was soon after the debate between him and Harris where my reaction in real time was he had blown shot after shot while giving an abysmal performance. Rewatching it later though I noticed something. The man really truly loves this country and wants whats best for it in much the same way he does his children. What I mean by that is his lack of control was being caused by his ideals coming under attack from three different directions. Its easy to criticize someone from afar, but he reacted in much the same way I would had three people been attacking my family. Defensive anger that comes from the fear of something you love being harmed. I read it as genuine and not something manufactured or fake .The second and probably more important epiphany came when going down a rabbit hole of old speaking events Harris had done. Look up her speech she gave at Obamas 2012 DNC when running against Mitt Romney. You could replace every mention of Romney with Trump and think it was a current day speech word for word. Point being here is say what you will, but things that would stick to any normal candidate doesnt stick to Trump.

A lot of unexpected and crazy things have happened this season. Trump supporters can be loud and proud and undecided voters will stand their ground to talk about the issues both sides avoid. And everyone is rightfully worried that this could be the last democratic election should project 2025 make it to the white house. Frankly its just so much noise that the news creates and it can be overwhelming at times. But I also think that Trump is scared. Trump and his supporters were coasting on the idea that Biden wasnt fit to lead and didnt expect Kamala to take his place and bring enthusiasm back to the American public. They were probably betting on the idea that Biden would lose votes to third party candidates or voter turnout would be abysmal compared to 2020 because of a lack of enthusiasm for Biden, likely leading to a Trump victory (though I doubt it would have happened that way regardless as people definitely will vote). I think Kamala legitimately scares them to the point where they know he will probably lose. She is a competent leader who has brought a renewed vigor to her voter base and she can poke holes into trumps campaign without being called a senile old man. Trump and the MAGA republicans were having a field day before Biden dropped out and now theyve lost their cool because Kamala got under their skin. Nobody even cares that Trump almost got assassinated twice. And elsewhere the walls are closing in. Trump has legal troubles he cant escape unless he gives himself immunity, his campaign is shooting itself in the foot with PR bombs (JD Vance, Laura Loomer, Springfield, trumps bible etc). And everyone knows about project 2025 and the threat that it poses. Besides mental decline due to old age, I think Trump has been so unhinged lately because he is trying to appeal to the most fringe people imaginable. He will say anything to get attention and support. Obviously its very close and nobody should become complacent.

It took him a month to drop out, which saw prominent individuals within and associated with the party embarrassingly come out to voice their desire for him to drop out. It was long and drawn out, and Harris wasn't gaining any steam as a possible successor in that time - all of the media was on him.2. The debate performance validated all of Trump's talking points about Biden. Trump's entire campaign at that point was about how senile Joe was with the Dems pushing back on that. *Acting* old and lost at the debate would have been a terrible plan if for no other reason than it gives Trump a win.3. The way he dropped out raised questions about if he was forced out by fellow party elites. If Biden had looked more together at the debate, his decision would have been more respected as his. Instead, it stoked a new talking point on Kamala not winning the primary, which is a pretty bad look for the party that had been running on protecting democracy. Screwing up the debate on purpose would be an awful plan to help Harris - it would have actually helped create an entirely new apparent hypocrisy that didn't need to exist.I personally think his debate performance wasn't nearly as bad as it was reported, and that it *was* Biden's decision to drop out, but it seems illogical and unnecessary to put on a show of incompetence at the debate on purpose. Biden was the incumbent, passing the torch with as little resistance/coverage as possible would have been ideal. The controversy that exists now on Kamala not earning the nomination democratically was exaggerated by the fact that it may have seemed to some like Biden was forced out by the party due to his declining acuity. From the debate performance, it's easy to see why someone might form the opinion that the party took advantage of an aging Biden to push Harris through as the nominee - and that ultimately hurts her campaign.","title":"CMV: I believe that Biden's issues at the debate were a purposeful act"},{"text":"\\"assassination attempts\\"?","title":"Imagine saying in 2019 that in the next five years, we'd face forced lockdowns / masks, soaring inflation, a vaccine pushed upon the masses, two assassination attempts on Trump, Biden mentally diminished and dropping out of the race while on the cusp of world war 3 - you wouldve sounded insane"},{"text":"The current leader of the American conservative movemeWho is this?

(and the 60 minutes interview is designed to be deliberately tough, so I think even great politicians wouldn't be able to do perfectly on it).Case in point, you praise Walz for his answer, but Walz also had other moments during the campaign where he wasn't as brilliant: primarily during the VP debate with Vance where there was definitely a lot of room for improvement.

If you never knew about Batman characters and watched this movie because it was a musical with Lady Gaga in it, all Batman-related references don't matter.I watched 2 hours of a mentally ill man experiencing a manic episode before being brutally killed. There's no strong connection between the killer and him and the movie fails to provide enough insight or meaning to the joke or murder for it to have an emotional impact on me. The main character's decisions have little to no impact on the direction of the story and our character's emotional journey has no significant impact and potentially no impact to what the end result would have been.Arthur likely would have been charged for murder. Maybe a bomb would still go off. Arthur would still die. And if he somehow got a different sentence, he'd just be the same character he was before, but maybe less sad because he was in a slightly better environment. But that goal was never communicated by the movie to actually be in pursuit by Arthur.So, to me, this movie might be a great \\"statement\\" or a good example of \\"art\\" or something.

Lots of Far-Right Islamist extremist groups all hate America including Al-Qaeda, Isis, and Hamas, but many of these groups also hate each other at the same time. For example, though both Isis and Hamas agree on lots of things and have lots in common, they absolutely despise each other. They both hate America but they also hate each other. Indeed the Alt-Right and conservatives, such as myself, do have mutual enemies. But that doesn't make us conservatives allies with them.  \\nNot only that, but sometimes using too much simplicity can be misleading. Things are always simple in life.

Get a big suburban rebound - very unlikely, as the suburbs were trending blue even before Trump, and he kicked that into overdrive.3. Overperform in the deep-blue parts of the state, especially Philly and Pittsburgh.  This one I see as the most plausible, either through a drop in turnout or convincing just enough voters to switch.

So they don't even get the assassination attempt, and yet can have the beans spilled about what they tried to pull. The President does not have the authority to supercede what Congress has deemed unlawful for the military to do.But the biggest problem about that immunity case is people are latching onto it as the final word, to never be brought up again. The dissent is the one who tossed the SEALs idea out there originally. But even as written, anything that's ambiguous has to be decided by a court -- that is anything that's not clearly an official act. It seems vague and broad, but that's because it leaves the path open down the line to more narrowly define it without overturning prior rulings, and also... this ruling probably didn't even consider such a scenario because that's not what was at issue here.

And Bernie's reason for doing so? \\"I don't want to end up like Nader.\\" Apparently that's reason enough for his support of genociders and imperial wars.

So what he does is he takes all of that energy, he raises all of these legitimate issues and he funnels it back into a dead political system so that by April its over.That was the role of Van Jones in the last election, Hedges said. He was running around, using the language of Occupy  Occupy the Vote  and that is what Bernie has done. I dont understand. He fought the Democratic establishment in Vermont his entire career. Now he has sold out to it.Bernie has also not confronted the military industrial complex at all, Hedges said. On a personal level, having spent seven years in the Middle East, Im just not willing to forgive him for abandoning the Palestinians and giving carte blanche to Israel. He was one of 100 Senators who stood up like AIPAC wind up dolls and approved Israels 51-day slaughter last summer of Palestinians in Gaza  the Palestinians who have no army, no navy, artillery, mechanized units, command and control.Because the party is completely captive to corporate power, Hedges said.

There isnt any war going on ANYWHERE right now. There hasnt been war in years. Shut the fucking MSM off. All of that was settled in 2018 with Trump. ZERO WAR AND NO CHANCE of nuclear war. When Trump went there in 2018 and said we will recognize Jerusalem as the capital is when it was all peace in the Middle East. The shit you see on TV now are the same clips over and over again, from different angles and perspectives. When Irans president died in that helicopter accident? Yeahhe didnt want to play ball like the rest of the world. If thats too long ago then just a week or two ago, why did Zelenskyy go to Trump for peace talks? Why not go to the same people who gave him $100s billions in aid? Its because Trump is not only the Commander in Chief of America, hes the Commander in Chief of the earth. Putin and him are allies. When Putin handed Trump the soccer ball also in 2018 it symbolizes that the ball is now in your court and we are on the same team with the same common enemy = The Deep State/The Cabal/Illuminati . All our allies are the Earth Alliance led by Trump and Putin as their top leaders. 2018 was the year we were all saved. We were all supposed to be dead in 2021. Trump went to Saudi Arabia, The Vatican, Buckingham Palace, NATO, the Rothchilds, Russia and 55 Water Street. Every one of these places immediately agreed to what Trump told them. Saudi ousted their old leader and put in a good man and now are allys. The Vatican Bank closed, Pope Francis stepped down and Trump recovered all the hidden gold, artifacts but most importantly we got our children to safety. Buckingham Palace and the British Royals immediately exited the EU. Then coincidentally the King , Queen both died. The rest of the EU Royals stepped down from their duties which has never done before. Prince Charles got cancer, same with Kate Middleton. Thats not coincidence , thats the lethal long term injection all these elites got for a slow agonizing death. We know The Rothchilds leader died and from cancer? Yup. George Bush senior died in 2018 too. Coincidence? Nah. So you see Trump is the US REPUBLICS PRESIDENT and Commander in Chief since 2016. Biden was simply allowed to continue to be the president of the US Corporation which has went bankrupt. The Fed has been bankrupt since guess when 2017-2018. They have nothing except the ability to print paper and thats it. Theres no serious election coming up. Trump is going to take the lead no matter what because our/and the earth alliance is dependent on it being this way. The entire world has the same common enemy = The Cabal. Go back and read all of the Q drops. Understand that they were released prior to these events happening. Then using our history as an answer sheet you will see they got it all right.

It does have dangerous, king-like repercussions, but for different reasons and not where peoples imaginations are taking them. Theres this popular sentiment that the ruling made Presidents suddenly all-powerful and capable of anything, but thats not really the takeaway. The theories seemed tongue-in-cheek at first, but Im seeing far too often these serious, false expectations of what Biden (and hopefully Harris) can do because of it. **The ruling does not expand Presidential power.** Many are hung on up on the whole official act terminology, but its important to note that the ruling gave determination of official acts to *the courts*. NOT the President. The ruling doesnt establish that Presidents can simply say I declare my own actions official! like hes Michael Scott and do whatever they want.  Summing up the ruling as much as possible, it basically says: - Core constitutional powers are absolutely immune (so things specifically spelled out in the Constitution - pardon power, war powers, veto, etc.). And dealings with the DOJ are immune. - Private acts that have no bearing on the office or its duties are not protected. - Everything else (the whole what is an official act or not? question) is up for review by the courts. SCOTUS literally designed the ruling so that anything remotely contentious would boomerang back to them to decide.  **It is much more about corrupt incentive, not outright power.** (Although theres some overlap). What the ruling DOES do is grant (potential) personal protection from criminal liability, and so its much more beneficial to someone who is, well.. a criminal. Think about Trump here: He won a year+ of delays from the January 6th case and potentially others. It incentivizes him to seek the office again for further legal protection. It incentivizes him to offer pardons to those willing to commit crimes on his behalf. He could theoretically commit crimes himself like bribery. He could order the DOJ or Seal Team 6 to commit crimes and have a much greater chance of escaping personal legal accountability at a future date. That is why the ruling is dangerous - it encourages someone who might abuse the office and commit crimes to do so, because they might have more protection - and that begins a much broader, frightening road we could go down. But it doesnt inherently grant someone like Biden power to DO anything more effectively in the first place. It still requires willing criminal participants and navigating the courts to succeed. People might say well, Biden could order Merrick Garland to arrest the Supreme Court or Congress, etc, but that brings me to the last point: he could have tried that anyway with the same success rate before July 1st, 2024: **Sitting Presidents already enjoy theoretical immunity from criminal liability, regardless of the ruling.** Or it would at least require a monumental effort to prosecute a sitting President. It can be argued the rulings legal ramifications are only relevant to former Presidents, because they must be out of office to face prosecution in the first place. (This is why its so important Trump doesnt become President again. The Oval Office is an insane legal shield and always has been) I know it sounds absurd with our whole no one is above the law notion, and I personally disagree with it. But the President is the head of the DOJ and the Executive Branch, they can fire the AG. There is standing DOJ/OLC policy based on constitutional arguments that a sitting President cannot be prosecuted at the state or federal level. And the Supreme Court has backed this notion in multiple rulings, basically saying a Presidents constitutional duties cannot be impeded by legal proceedings, and that they would need to be impeached/removed from office. At the very least, if a President didnt want to be prosecuted, they could put up quite a fight to avoid it. Anyway, the point is that the power so many think Biden gained from the ruling (immunity while in office), he already had. **TL;DR** - the immunity ruling is very dangerous in many ways and can lead to dangerous consequences, but it doesnt suddenly grant the office of the Presidency any inherent new power it didnt have before. These popular notions that Biden or Harris can suddenly do anything they want are misguided and unhelpful IMO.","title":"Michael Moore Dares Joe Biden to Use Full Immunity in Last Days as Prez"},{"text":"And we are people you do not want to piss off","title":"Childless (S)cat Lady and Trump Comforter Looney Loomer is on Kamala Harris's case for not having biological children again.

You're falling into the argumentative trap that is in some sense a component of many conspiracy theories: The fact that an entity *could* do something is viewed as sufficient evidence that they actually did. Some examples:* The US faked the moon landing, because they could have done it; and had reason to do it.\\n* The US is behind \\"chem trails\\" poisoning US citizens, because they could have done it, and had reason to do it\\n* A certain VP candidate has had sexual relations with an ottoman, because he could have done it, and is a being with sexual urges (had reason to do it).\\n* A certain Presidential candidate slept their way to the top, because they could have done it, and had reason to do it.\\n* A certain Presidential candidate enjoys \\"golden showers\\" because they could have done it, and is a being with sexual urges (had reason to do it). etc etc etc.The problem is, if you're going to view that type of argument construction as reasonable, you create space for all sorts of wild claims, because the only requirements for an argument to be valid are (a) that it possible at all, and (b) that intent to do so makes sense, which in and of itself is rather subjective. So, if you're claiming that its *possible* that Biden did that, then sure; because anything is possible and politics are complicated. If you're claiming he *actually* did that,(which you seem to be) then you need to provide an actual, factual, evidentiary basis for your claim.

Not trying to \\"all lives matter\\" you, but the \\"dominant group\\" whose comfort and security are primarily looked after ... are the monied elites. To your point, Black Americans represent a very powerful voting group. You expect, to some extent, that your vote is transactional, e.g. \\"if we lend you our support, then you will support us in turn\\".This is the exact same argument I've heard out of other powerful caucuses, specifically, the progressives.I think there is a misunderstanding though because voting is not a transactional agreement as much as it an existential necessity. You don't actually have leverage for \\"coming in and saving white folk\\" ... because we are all equally screwed if you don't.The last time Trump was in office he nearly kicked 60 million Americans off health insurance by attempting to repeal the afforable care act with no replacement. He's said he thinks Israel should finish the job with Palestine. He's said he plans to erect concentration camps to house illegal migrants in prior to the largest deportation effort the world has ever seen.There is one side you can negotiate with, caucus with, earn slow progress with, and one party that hates you and if many of them had their heart's greatest desire would race right back to Jim Crow or worse. They are already the ones ensuring that the racism which has been entrenched in our legal systems remains so, all the while weaponizing it.So you don't really have a choice if not voting ... or voting Republican ... is only going to clearly make your life worse or reset the very same progress you're concerned with.That's why voting is table stakes. Voting is what it takes to even have a voice in the conversation. From there you must find leverage if you want to make progress. You can even start building leverage by pointing to the fact that you just helped win an election. But you have to vote first. And yep, that cycle has been repeating through both of our lifetimes.It's sad, but it's the way humanity has always worked: people in power try and keep it, and give as little of it up as possible.","title":"Obama tells Black men its not acceptable to sit out election"},{"text":"if I'm sitting to piss I'm probably hungover or sick and my heads spinning","title":"Kamala Harris Sends Out Tim Walz to Talk Man-Stuff to Men About Being Manly"},{"text":"There is zero evidence your claim is true, and plenty of evidence it is false.

Currently an attorney and married father of two living on the East Coast. My family is multiracial, incidentally, with my spouse being Asian.Back in 2008, Obama represented hope for change. Today, Harris represents continuity with the Biden administration, which has not been particularly commendable in my opinion. Too much corporate influence, and military entanglement. I don't want flag waiving bravado from either party. Just practical economic policies to govern a diverse nation, aiming towards the center and the interests of the middle class. The Democratic party believes that promising to reduce police violence and control who gets to drop the n-bomb in public is what the Black community needs and desires. But that's a good damned bandaid on some deep social wounds. Curing the deeper social issues requires giving people the opportunity to do meaningful work and to give their children a better future. Our nation has internal waterways and agricultural soils unrivaled in the world, and educated workforce, and access to capital. So what the fuck are we doing with it? Waste. Confusion. Instead of incentivizing large banks and real estate developers, we need drastic reform of the tax system to allow individuals to be competitive in land and home ownership. And make the process of paying taxes less bureaucratic. Fewer loopholes means both business and individuals pay something fair. Right now, tax, finance, real estate, insurance, and law are industries where individuals can no longer access the systems we've built. It's ossified, moribund, and frankly unfair. I'm not worried about the \\"unconscious bias\\" of individuals, which is the narrative that's popular today, but rather, the over bureaucratization of the whole system, such that it makes upward mobility impossible for _everyone_ who isn't already wealthy, without reference to race or creed.

So I decided to try comparing the mail votes from that election to what we see so far.Obviously, this is an extremely sketchy comparison with lots of factors not controlled for.  But big picture: You can make the case that the mail ballot numbers so far line up with a possible Dem victory.[First, the mail numbers from the HD-35 special election:](https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/1747396035951882463)* The final mail numbers for this election were: 4335 D - 3748 R - 1759 NPA (9852 overall).  That's 44.0% D - 38.0% R - 17.9% NPA (D+5, excluding NPAs).[Now, let's look at the results so far for the November election:](https://twitter.com/VoteHubUS/status/1845225012275577040)* So far, the vote breakdown is: 202,519 D - 172,302 R - 94,695 NPA.  That's 43.1% D - 36.7% R - 20.2% NPA (D+6.4, excluding NPAs).The final result from HD-35 was a D+2.6 victory.  So the mail ballot numbers so far are very much in line with a Dem victory in Florida this year.Obviously, there are a million caveats here.  HD-35 saw huge GOP turnout on Election Day, but the Dem was victorious, likely due to racking up huge wins with NPAs or significant GOP crossover vote.  And that was a much smaller election, which only covered east Orlando and Osceola County.  The state of Florida is a diverse, complicated place, and the recent hurricanes have complicated things further.  Still, these numbers should make it clear that **we have a shot in Florida, and it's time to put in the work to win.**  If we can win a Senate seat there, or flip a couple of House districts, or create an abortion sanctuary in the South, we'll be glad we did.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 12, 2024 - 24 days until election day!"},{"text":"Ironically going to Detroit for Charli XCX was the first time the entire election I saw like 5 Trump/Vance signs.

Yes TRUMP AND MAGA are bad and no this is not a both sides thing this is simply stating facts and giving you the mindset of many progressives.

US has lost the plot on how to speak softly and carry a big stick. Progressives also do not like how college students were brutalized and shamed for exercising free speech, in order to appeal to corporate power brokers and billionaire citizens. It highlighted how little power the rest of us truly have. Progressives do not like being primaried on single issues like Israel, and now see how establishment Democrats actually dont want a liberal wing. While on Republican side, no matter how detestable the Freedom Caucus is , they actually hold clout and power in their party. Democrats on the other hand dont give two shits to have dissenting voices.Progressive POC do not like how the disaster of the Supreme Court and rise of MAGA and ineffectiveness of Congress has been driven by white conservative fundamentalists. Democrats continued to negotiate with these democratic arsonists and their predecessors as good faith actors in the Obama years and it has failed. Democrats should have been tougher and more unforgiving. Instead they chickened out. Progressives today after acknowledging they hurt Hillary in some ways in 2016 to help carry Biden in 2020, wont be saving them again unless we have real power and a real voice. Consequences be damned.Lastly, we have seen modern Democratic Party do NOTHING in holding Trump and his cronies accountable.

Republicans (some of them anyway) oppose abortion because they dont want babies to be killed. Pro-choice Democrats try to frame abortion in terms of the negative impact on the woman who was denied her right to kill her baby, functionally rendering permissive abortion policy as a prophylactic against the consequences of ones own actions (of course, never missing the opportunity to side-step the issue by pointing to the exception cases of rape/incest/medical issues, despite it being logically incoherent to base general policy off the exception case). The actual cause-and-effect impact of pro-life policies is simply less babies killed. Apart from that, the negative impacts are due to having unprotected sex in the first place. Having to carry a baby for nine months when you dont want to sucks, but so does having to make a car payment. I cant abort my car payment after I signed up for it, just because I now dont like the consequences. This is all not to mention the fact of the abortion industrys nefarious origins (Margaret Sanger wanting to solve what she described as the negro problem), and the societal damage wrought by the downstream effects of abortion, in terms of the culture of sexual licentiousness, which implicitly absolves men of the responsibility to care for wives and children.

Some last minute leak or event that will turn up the heat on the divide and conquer stove."},{"text":"So here are my thoughts regarding your points This isnt how the joker should be: What made the first film work was that the portrayal was simultaneously unique and paid homage to some of the original comics through subtle lines about Ive had a seriously bad day or the you get what you fucking deserve! Moment (Killing Joke) which worked in its favour. By the end of the first film, we practically see the breaking point where Arthur is gone and where joker begins. To suddenly flip back to being Arthur and the joker, while relevant for the film title, feels poorly conceived and would work better for another character in that film aka Harvey. For me, the point of joker is that he becomes detached from what society thinks of him in general after he goes through enough. And for all intents and purposes, he goes through more than enough in the first film. Now? Whether he saves a kid from death or beats a pregnant person to death? It stops mattering to him either way. In the film however, we dont really see that detachment in my opinionWhy is this a musical?: Tbh? On this we have a little bit of agreement. The idea that Arthur cant really carry a tune to save his life, is a good motif in the beginning. But as per my previous point? I think they shouldve leaned a bit more into the musical style and actually made him a better singer closer to the end, because by this point, he should be detached from what society thinks. Harley Quinn is one note and shallow: If it were any other random actor playing Quinn? Id be a bit more lenient. But Lady Gaga being one note given her musical career? It feels like they wasted her potential. Plus, the fact that SHEs the one portrayed as the not so subtle toxic fan? I think as a creative decision, this was a terrible idea in my opinion. A rule of thumb is never bite the hand that feeds you (exceptions apply if that hands abuse you) and this is no different. It wouldve been a much better decision to have more Arkham inmates worship the joker toxic fan style rather than use Quinn as a focal point for this, because Quinn in and of herself falls for the joker as a person. Not the ideals he stands for. The movie is slow, gruelling and uncomfortable to watch: any slow burn thriller is. Like Seven. And it works for the genre. The first film was a slow burn with some pivotal moments and here? We dont have enough moments to really make it feel like some high stakesThere is no resolution and the ending is corny at best: It is. The film at the end is both a simultaneous homage to Ledger whilst also being a huge fuck you to fans. The ending feels like its meant to punish everyone and for what? Arthurs death is pointless.

One-party rule is not a good thing.  Democrats had their share of abuses of power when they ruled Congress. But Republicans in the state they are now are about as far from a viable alternative as they have ever been.  Republicans at large deserve no seats at the table, but I have to give some credit to those who lost their positions because they put country before party and spoke out against Trump.  I know that it's only because they had the sense to see that he was destroying *their party*, but so much of that destruction is due to him being willing to say out loud what most of them would typically only say behind closed doors.  I don't necessarily think all Republicans are dedicated racists, for example, but they certainly haven't done much trying to combat racism, either.I'm not going to judge her for saying that she's going to consider Republicans, because I think of it less as an olive branch than offering an opportunity to show that some of them are better than most of them are now.

Because in a total anarchy, nothing prevents you from stealing someone elses resources. So private property rights are not guaranteed.My argument is that, states serve a purpose. They will and should exist. They serve the purpose to protect its inhabitants, and their property. If the citizen has nowhere else to go, and has to settle with its state, then this is akin to slavery.What I propose is a totally decentralized country, in which people can choose their own state, or state-like structures to live in, or pure anarchy. A country where creating and destroying a state is really easy. Borrowing from French revolutionary discussions, I say that only thing legitimizes the existence of a state is a social contract. They mean it in an abstract way. But I mean in a real, tangible way.All states can be mere computer code, signed and thus legitimized by its citizens, who can switch their allegiance easily. Just like any contract between an employer and employee is sacred, so it should be between a state and its citizen, if there is an consensual agreement.We can implement social contracts with distributed ledger technologies. There are some fundamental steps that needs to be taken to create states that live in a decentralized consensus protocol. There needs to be significant advancements in AI and cryptography, in order to achieve that.

Like it should be illegal for any single government to collect taxation from more then a couple million people or something like that.The rise of the administrative state and total take over by bureaucracies is the bane of modern existence. Capitalism, by definition, is the private ownership of capital.  However modern large public corporations are not controlled or really owned by anybody.  The decision making is done by c-level executives who are nothing more then caretaker bureaucrats. These are the ones that call the shots.  Individual share holders technically have \\"ownership\\", but unless they are one of the few \\"Whales\\" that control seats on the board of directors their ownership of the stock confers no actual ownership benefits or controls.

And that is what is going on at all levels in Western civilization.  Ownership, private property rights, is becoming increasingly meaningless.  Instead what is happening is that all major decisions and policies are set by a special Mandarin Class, or a Professional-Managerial Caste System made up of Party Insiders and greater party membership of outsiders.

It is critical to maintaining any sort of cohesive organization.  You needs rules and procedures and ways to manage expectations between different people in any organization.  But economy of scale is a double edged sword and bureaucracies scale miserably. For small organizations the bureaucracy is almost a informal afterthought.  It is often limited to just reminding people to carry out different tasks and the total time and expense on that is a tiny fraction of a small organization's budget.But once you get past a few thousand people you run into the bulk of the resources a organization consumes goes to just maintaining itself.  Big businesses may spend 70 or 80% of their budget to just paying salaries and offices of professional bureaucrats...  HR people, IT people, Programmers, Accountants, Customer service reps, office space, computers, air conditioning, trainers, managers, directors, c-level execs, physical security, etc.    of the people hired actually provide services or produce goods or do useful work like use fork lifts to load up trucks for shipping.  And they are usually the least expensive. For something like the Federal government you have, very literally, millions of people who do nothing but  work constantly day in and day out to maintain organization cohesion.  Even the police are really nothing more then bureaucrats. So to avoid that issue and issues with voting and so on and so forth... the organization of government musts be physically small. Rule #2:There must be rival political organizations.  No centralized sovereign authority. So for a city-state situation you can have, say,  home owners association, business league, town council, and churches. Along with privately owned courts and separate privately owned security.  Just saying this is a possible model, not the ideal one.  The idea is then that each organization then represent a different aspect of ownership and way people participate in society. So that if, say, the town council gets a big head and tries to do some corruptive shit people can go crying to the business league or church to slap them down and visa versa. This way everything done that is bigger then a individual is always a negotiation and maximizes the ability of people to participate in the system to protect themselves and their rights.   This way you don't have some grand poo-bah spending millions of your money on his cousin's road construction company and when you object to it the city council can go and tell you to get bent.","title":"What is the second most ideal form of social order from an anarcho-capitalist perspective?"},{"text":"I have heard very strong arguments made that the only reason they ran Biden was to put Harris in as president because that's who they wanted.

We're already seeing impacts on reversing this, but it can't happen overnight. It's not 'because' of Biden, it's because Biden started the process to fix it but a second dem administration will accelerate it.Inflation is not a spending or printing money issue, or at least not the majority of it. Greedflation and supply and demand challenges are the primary causes, both of which Harris will do her best to tackle. But you also have to remember that we need control of congress to really move fast at fixing these issues. Otherwise, I suspect that downward pressure on prices will actually happen naturally, but more slowly.And also remember, Trump's plan of using tariffs and pro-corporate policies will do the opposite of fix inflation.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 12, 2024 - 24 days until election day!"},{"text":"or do a cyberattack, or stage a seal team 6 style covert op","title":"I think we are due one more pre-election curveball.

Just about nothing except, ... they are doing their best behind the scenes to torpedo the Harris campaign (and I'll add that I applaud their efforts).RFK, Jr. may be the most puzzling one to understand but he's the one most open about it. I'd say he has a ton more in common, politically-speaking, with Harris than he does with Trump, yet he dropped out and endorsed Trump.Terry doesn't have the support to do much to harm Trump but he could be a minor problem if he raised a ruckus about Trump being insufficiently pro-life. Instead, as he said recently, he is completely out to get Harris. Good on him.The Libertarian Party is the most interesting one. Does anyone think it's a coincidence that Trump addressed the Libertarian Convention, promised them a cabinet position, and the Libertarian Party turned around a day later and nominated a guy more likely to take votes from Harris compared to Trump? I don't think so. Recall that in the Georgia Senate race, Walker actually lost by more votes in the run-off with Oliver out of the race, than he did in the initial election where Oliver was a part of it. Also, Oliver is not well-regarded in Libertarian (big or small \\"l\\") circles, which means the party is more-or-less signaling to its supporters that they should go ahead and vote Trump. That's a pretty big deal for a party that loves to be a spoiler and do as much harm to both major parties as they can.","title":"Joe Biden Shows Kamala Harris the Cost of a Failed Coup"},{"text":"George W.

But rather, hes simply a senator who aimed higher, and has no qualms about saying whatever he needs to say to get there. Hes not a secret leftist, hes just someone who says what he needs to.He was a never Trumper in 2016, not because he fundamentally believed it, but because Hilary Clinton was the presumptive winner of the election and being anti-Trump was his best ticket upwards. He jumped on the chance to be Trumps VP this year, not because he fundamentally believes any of his rhetoric, but because it lets him have a 50/50 shot of becoming VP with an 83 year old President, and therefore a decent shot at being President himself.Its not a grand plan. Its just a politician seeking power in whichever way he deems the most fruitful. Donald Trump himself has famously switched parties multiple times in his life, generally coinciding with the party not in executive office, since historically it is the opposing party who gets elected next. When it became clear that abortion was a losing issue, Trump backtracked on his statements about it. When it became clear that Project 2025 was largely disliked, Trump backtracked on his involvement.

I call this monster SCOTUSferatu.SCOTUS appointments is an area I'm not well versed in, but if it's feasibly within the President's power to appoint new SCOTUS justices thereby increasing the seat-count then I think Harris needs to make this priority number fucking 1.Edit: Also, impeachment for SCOTUS justices isn't a tenable answer for how you deal with those justices, specifically. I had discovered in grade school, through a class genealogy project, that I am a descendant of the sole SCOTUS judge to ever be impeached, Samuel (De) Chase. He was in fact impeached. He also wasn't removed. The sole instance of impeachment happening to a SCOTUS judge and it amounted to **nothing** and THAT dude was corrupt as they fucking get. Real fuckin dirt bag.

I think that's fine, but isn't a serious detraction from the film. The other side of this complaint is by those who dislike that the musical aspects seem half-assed: they are somewhat fantastical, but not?*very*; they are sung, but not well, and not with a ton of emotion; they are frequent but they don't display anything that would necessitate a musical number. I think a lot of this was intentional. I think the way Phoenix sings as Arthur Fleck is really heartbreaking, and also has that same feeling as when you see him do comedy in the first movie. He wants to be good, to express himself artistically, but he just isn't very talented or creative of a person. I think this is also why the musical numbers aren't super grand -- Arthur Fleck doesn't really have a coherant fantasy life that can be imagined through music. He is sort of a hollow person, thrust into situations he cannot handle and doesn't really have a grasp of, all while trying to figure out who he is in general. My guess is why some scenes shown in the trailer were obviously cut, such as an apparent big dance sequence with Lee on the iconic staircase. I think if the film was from Quinzel's perspective, then the grand, traditional, ADR-ed music numbers would be more appropriate.I'll focus in on this as I think that the musical aspect of the movie is its weakest element.  I went in excited about this being a musical as that seemed like a bold approach and one I was down for, but the execution just doesn't work.  The songs themselves just aren't well done.  Phoenix can't sing very well, the songs themselves are not well chosen, and the arrangements don't breathe new life into them and the staging lacks spectacle.  They aren't entertaining in their own right like musical numbers are supposed to be.  That could be justified if they each individually made interesting statements about the characters' psychology but I don't think they really do, or at least not big enough statements to justify just how much screen time is dedicated to them.  You make a decent argument that this is intentional, but like, there are limits to how much you can dedicate to mediocre entertainment in your movie and get away with it.  The first movie didn't dedicate huge amounts of its runtime to raw unfiltered bad Arthur Fleck stand-up comedy to make a similar point, for example.","title":"CMV: Joker 2 is one of the best movies of the year"},{"text":"This is giving \\"Bill Cosby telling black teens to pull their pants up\\" energy","title":"Barack Obama smears Black Men as sexist for refusing to support Kamala Harris Liberals really believe they own the Black vote Black people need to abandon the Democratic Party the same way that Arab Americans are"},{"text":"Because of the gov and feds doing nothing to maintain moral high ground, theyre conceding Arizona, Georgia at the least to this cheating.","title":"Democratic campaign office in Arizona closes down after being shot at 3 times in 3 weeks"},{"text":"Further proof that she has absolutely nothing going upstairs in terms of original thought.

The two movies do not appear to follow one another very well. \\"Why is this a musical?\\" Again, one movie to the next, this breaks continuity. Also, it serves as a poor musical, as musicals go, in my opinion. Once again, if that works for you, who am I to argue?\\"Harley Quinn is underdeveloped and one-dimensional.\\" I do not mind. We have plenty of movies with characters that never change. I love The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading. No one changed throughout either of those films. The film remains centered on Joker. I would argue the film's characters mean nothing. Joker just serves as the first iteration of Joker. The _real_ Joker appears at the end, giving himself a Glasgow smile.\\"There is no resolution, and the ending is corny at best.\\" This part I loved. It seems to me that the entire twin set of movies just leads to the creation of the _real_ Joker, less of a clown, less of a withdrawn individual, to more of a bold, violent person. That aside, not much else in this Joker film captured my attention.The visuals end up \\"okay\\" to me, but the world building left me flat.At the end of the day, you enjoyed the film. Even if you accept someone else's critiques and opinions, you enjoyed what _you_ watched. What would ever change your view about _what_ you viewed and _how_ you viewed it?","title":"CMV: Joker 2 is one of the best movies of the year"},{"text":"Thats literally not how accurate sampling works.It is impossible to know how the total voting population will vote today (i.e., the accurate account of the borader electorate), which is why the larger sample size is better.

I'm not a \\"muh both sides\\" kind of guy, but this is absolutely a prime example of \\"both sides.\\"  \\n2. Why did our elected officials (congress and president) agree to this? Was this amendment voted on alone, or was it part of a larger negotiated bill where lots of topics were rolled into a larger bill, where there are things both sides like and both sides hate? You know... a compromise.  The answer to #2 is that it was part of a much larger bill. I couldn't tell you why any one elected official did or didn't sign it, but without asking their reasons for doing so, it wouldn't be correct to say that every person voting in favor of it actually was in favor of the amendment OP is talking about it. There would have been lots of people involved who viewed it as a bad change, but felt like other things in that larger (defense spending, ofc) bill were more important.  Why do so many people here try to boil down their anti-Obama, anti-Trump, etc rhetoric to such simple terms, willfully ignoring context?

Terrorist organizations aren't \\"rational actors\\" by game theory standards and they'd happily develop nuclear weapons. What determines whether a state is a rational actor is how they use said weapons, the rhetoric they use and the likelihood that their motivations are driven rationally ie by self preservation. It's hard to consider a theocracy a rational actor, as relgious motivations are often irrational by geopolitical standards. As for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it's actually quite a rational step even if it's not gone as well as they'd hoped.  Yes, it's led to sanctions and that was almost certainly included in the calculus of the invasion but the land they've taken from Ukraine is extremely mineral rich, has good quantities of rare earth metals important in modern fabrication, and adds solid farmland during a time where food shortages are being predicted due to climate change. Additionally, the warm water port of Crimea was a massive gain for Russia. Their initial military assumptions proved to be wrong but I would guess the initial goal was to quickly conquer Ukraine, weather the sanctions and end up with not only the warm water port but a plethora of resources and more control over the pipelines to Europe. Their backup goal is settling along the regions they've been able to conquer which are the most mineral rich portions of Ukraine, which is still a net win for Russia.","title":"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country."},{"text":"FirstHow would he manage the bigots and stupids in his party?

I think, in practice, as it relates to Vance, in particular, there is no evidence to support the idea that he is pretending to be bad so that he can position himself to do good.Eg, I have said, I think what Pence should've done, post-election, was to tell Trump he would go along with Trump's plan to declare Trump the winner. This would've given Trump a false sense of security, denied him notice that Pence wasn't going to go along, potentially made it so he wouldn't arrange for the insurrection on January 6, 2021, etc. And then, on the day of, on J6, Pence should've betrayed Trump and certified Biden the winner, as he did.But, with Trump having been kept in the dark of his plans, Trump might not have made contingency plans for the insurrection, for members of Congress to object, etc. The idea here would've been for Pence to play bad in order to do good, though not really in the sense you're claiming, since Pence wouldn't have been engaging in a power grab, since, by carrying out my idea, Pence would've been *denying* power to both Trump and himself. Pence was obviously unwilling to do this (or perhaps it never occurred to him? Or he's not a good enough liar to pull it off?), though I think (with the benefit of hindsight) this would've been the safest way to quash Trump's auto-coup attempt peacefully.But, as it relates to Vance, I have seen nothing to indicate he has any willingness or ability to do anything like what either you or I have described.Until recently, he had on his campaign website that he wanted to end all abortion, nationally. That is bad. It would result in many women suffering, and either losing their fertility, and/or their lives. And the ones who survived, regardless of whether they maintained their fertility, would be in worse shape in other ways. They would have suffered trauma, they would have a child they were unable and/or unwilling to care for, they would be indebted for medical care, etc. He says women exist to have children, and that post-menopausal women exist to share the burden of raising children.He has refused to answer whether Trump lost the 2020 election, and has said that he would do what Pence refused to do, which is to declare the loser to be the winner.Now, maybe you're correct, and maybe Vance is doing this for good, but there's no evidence of this, and you're making an awfully big gamble on something you have only speculation to support. What if you're wrong? What if, instead of Vance playing bad to get himself into power to do good, he's sincerely bad and is attempting to get himself into power to do bad? What then? Anyone willing to vote for Trump on the basis of Vance being on the bottom of the ticket and secretly wanting to do good things must reckon with that question: what if they're wrong about Vance? What if he's as bad, or worse, than he appears to be?And, supposing you're correct, over whose will does Vance intend to do good? Does Vance believe Republican voters are bad people, and that they need to be tricked into having good things done on their behalf? Does he believe other elected Republicans (eg, members of Congress, governors, etc) are bad people who he needs to fool? Supposing he succeeds, what stops these bad people in the public from electing bad members of Congress to thwart him? Or what stops these bad members of Congress from thwarting him, up to and including the possibility of them impeaching and removing him to prevent him from doing the good things he allegedly needs to keep secret because others don't want them? Even in the best case scenario, where you're correct (you're not), it still stands no chance of success, so it's a pointless exercise. In the worse case scenario, where he truly wants bad things, we are all worse off.And, most importantly, anyone who wishes to do good things ought to just vote for Harris instead, because if she wins, the question of whether Vance is secretly good or not becomes moot.

He continued his rationale with: If you dont have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldnt get nearly the same voice. - I think Pete G. responded to this best, that before he had kids he was a soldier deployed overseas, but also every childless person who is part of building the technology for the future, and even those who are doing it in other ways with the time they have that parents spend on parenting. I do care about the fact that in my community right now the leading cause of death among 18-45-year-olds is Mexican fentanyl thats coming across the southern border. - most undocumented immigrants came legally and overstayed their visa, the cartels are far more sophisticated than relying on border jumpers to move their product, Americans are participating in the distribution channels (including border agents, not all but definitely a few) because it is more lucrative and they cant afford to live off of minimum wage. Hes also said things to dehumanize and devalue people who are legal immigrants, identify as LBGTQIA, and everyone who is a Democrat. I understand that the parties may disagree on what policies are best for the country and may have different opinions about the role of government, but he has made the issues about groups of people and ignited a national debate over the value of people to society and not about policy. Kamala has certainly attacked Trump and Vance, but regarding the public they talk about gun laws and abortion rights, as their solution (whether good or bad its their policy proposal) to address school shootings and gun violence, and as what they believe is appropriate to protect a womans right to make her own medical choices. They arent saying people who own guns are thugs, animals, and a stain on country. They arent saying people who are religious are prude or deserve to be put in bad situations because of their personal values, its not about the people but the policies. Whoever is elected is going to be the president and vice president of all Americans, and at the very least, every lawfully abiding citizen in any country should feel safe from their own government.

Vance is secretly good"},{"text":"Because no one else has yet heres that story from chatGPTIn the year 2024, amidst a contentious political climate, Donald Trump met his end under mysterious circumstances during a summit in Antarctica. As news of his death spread, a secretive organization saw an opportunity. They preserved his body in a cryogenic chamber, believing that one day, the world would need a figure of his influence.A millennium later, in the year 3024, humanity had transformed. Society was interconnected, thriving on principles of unity and sustainability. However, remnants of the pastburied artifacts and ancient legendsstill sparked curiosity among historians.When scientists stumbled upon the cryogenic chamber, they decided to thaw its occupant. The world watched in awe as Donald Trump emerged, bewildered but retaining his characteristic flair. Initially, he struggled to comprehend this new world, filled with advanced technology and unfamiliar governance.As he acclimated, Trumps old instincts surfaced. He saw a populace longing for leadership and seized the moment. Promising to restore greatness, he tapped into a vein of nostalgia and discontent, rallying followers who yearned for a sense of purpose and identity.With charisma and cunning, he began to gain power. In this new society, the once-celebrated values of democracy were slowly replaced by his authoritarian vision. He established a regime that emphasized loyalty and conformity, employing advanced surveillance technology to monitor dissent.As his grip tightened, dissenters were silenced, and the media was co-opted. Trump declared himself the Supreme Leader, reviving his old slogans with a twist. Make Earth Great Again became a rallying cry for a nation now ruled by fear and propaganda.Yet, a resistance began to form. Groups of citizens, educated and determined, rose against his rule. They utilized their technological prowess to challenge his surveillance, spreading information and inspiring others to reclaim their freedoms.The battle for the future intensified. Trump, ever the strategist, countered with tactics from a bygone era, but he underestimated the resilience of a generation that had long envisioned a different path. As his regime faced mounting opposition, cracks began to show in his iron grip.In a climactic confrontation, the resistance launched a coordinated effort to expose Trumps abuses of power. As his regime faltered, he realized that a thousand years had changed the rules of engagement. The people no longer sought a dictator; they craved empowerment and equality.Ultimately, Trumps reign ended not with a bang, but with a revelation: he had resurrected a past that could not coexist with the future. In the end, the world chose progress over tyranny, forging a new narrative free from the shadows of history.","title":"Kamala Harris to release health report saying she is fit for presidency C aide"},{"text":"You guys are turning into MAGA at this point.

Local newspapers and their journalists had far less reason to take political sides or support bad actors like Trump.

Not a single newspaper, magazine not even the Gallup poll gave him any chance of winning a presidential election. But crowds of people were showing up for whistle stop speeches in small towns and larger crowds were showing up for his campaign rallies. And people were listening to him instead of just showing up for the chance to see a president. Truman won Ohio by 7,000 votes in an election where none of the reporters, pollsters and others had bothered to take the time to reach out to the comman everyday citizens who did the voting. Truman had been telling people across the country to not fall for the Republican tricks, scare tactics and propaganda that they use every time, that they represent Wall Street and special interests and today there are PACs, dark money and foreign influences to consider also. In the end voters should be voting for themselves, theres too much at stake.","title":"Harris vs. Trump analyst tells panicky Dems: GOP is creating fake polls | Desperate, unhinged, Trumpian"},{"text":"You are an idiot conspiracy nut.

The biggest issue with Texas is its abysmal voter turnout. Ive seen it said elsewhere that Texas isnt a red state, its a non-voting state, and thats pretty damn accurate. From quickly looking, by percentage of voting eligible population, Texas had the 6th worst turnout of any state in 2020. Two of the biggest reasons for this would be the sheer number of voter suppression tactics used here (only 1 drop box for Harris county, intentionally putting polling stations in awful locations, purging voter rolls as much as they can, and plenty more), and then far too many Texans have fallen for the propaganda that their vote doesnt matter so they simply dont vote. Theres hellish gerrymandering as well, but that doesnt play a role in state wide elections outside of them picking which districts theyll use more voter suppression tactics on (look up the district maps around Austin and Houston if you want to have a stroke). The biggest thing that could be done for Texas would be national protections for voters, making various voter suppression tactics illegal and then enforcing those rules. Even better would be something like how Australia does required voting, but thats more far fetched for the US to adopt. As for Democrats running campaigns, Allred has been doing an excellent job thus far, although he is helped by running against Cancun Cruz.

However, my concerns about Harris are deeper than anything Trump presents. If he is supposed to be a threat to democracy, then she is a threat to the Constitution, Bill of Rights and liberty.Some reasons I say this include the strong potential that she may endorse and has endorsed packing the Supreme Court. The long-term impact and precedent established by this will be the most dangerous threat to liberty presented by any action thus far.She has endorsed ending or at least curtailing the filibuster in the Senate. The entire purpose of the Senate is to basically be a barrier to the populist passions of the House. My personal caveat on the filibuster: it can be lifted only when a law is being repealed, not replaced.She presents a direct threat to the 1st Amendment with a censorship regime over social media with the continuation of mafia-style threats and intimidation. Can we say RICO, but using the regulatory state as the cudgel.She presents a direct threat to the 2nd Amendment with her proposed mandatory gun buy back planShe presents a direct threat to the 4th Amendment when she stated the following:Just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesnt mean that were not going to walk into that home and check to see if youre being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs.Her partner on the ticket, Walz, presents a direct threat to the 5th Amendment, and it is extremely likely she would also support similar legislation, for no fly, no buy laws.This would be a violation of the due process clause in that placement on the list is done without procedural due process and the result would be a loss of, in this case, ones 2A protected rights, but could be used to deprive a person on the list of anything Congress determines.When we look at policies proposed, both Trump and Harris are pretty awful. I am not saying it is a wash, from a libertarian perspective, but they might be. It is not relevant for the long-term.To me the greater danger are the threats to liberty and the BoR.One last comment after I said policy proposals could be a wash is the Medicare for All idea which she supported one day and did not the next. But if the bill gained momentum, you know she would push hard for it.Medicare for All is one of those insidious policies that once enacted will never be repealed but will forever alter the political landscape of the nation for the worse and empower government even further than we could ever imagine. Financial control of the entire healthcare system will be a Pandoras Box of powers the government will utilize for any number of matters of a personal nature. And I have no idea how its costs will be paid over time as consumption of free goods becomes limited only by rationing of the good.Thus far, I have not seen Trump proposing ideas that threaten so many amendments, the judiciary and medical care for the future in the manner she does. This is not to say Trump is good. He is far from good in terms of libertarian ideas.

Vice President Harris thanked Imam Elahi and IHW for their preparation to host her at the House of Wisdom.The meeting was recounted in an explosive new report from George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism, which charts Irans extensive efforts to spread hateful propaganda in the US.The GWU report also singled out the radical Manhattan-based Alavi Foundation, once accused by federal prosecutors of serving as a secret front for the Iranian government.The group has funneled nearly $500,000 to Elahis organization since 2000, along with another nearly $1.9 million to American universities, including Columbia, according to tax records reviewed by The Post.Democrats hold a dangerously mistaken notion that Iran is part of the solution  not the main problem in the Middle East. This leads them to outreach here in the U.S. with Muslims tied to that tyrannical theocracy like Mohammad Ali Elahi, Jim Hanson, chief editor of the Middle East Forum, a DC-based think tank, told The Post. Obama, Biden and Harris have all enabled and even funded their efforts.Elahi, 68, maintains deep contacts to the murderous regime.Hes regularly posts photos on social media showing him meeting with former Iranian presidents, including Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, Hassan Rouhani, and the recently deceased Ebrahim Raisi, according to the report.\\"Imam Elahi joined the vaccination mobilization event addressed by Vice President Harris, Governor [Gretchen] Whitmer . . . and a group of state and national political leaders,\\" the imam's nonprofit gushed amid images of a smiling Elahi with Harris.Elahi once called the ayatollah  the infamous architect behind the kidnapping of 53 American hostages for 444 days in 1979  as an exceptional religious authority, and was photographed with the zealot.Elahi has openly expressed support for Hezbollah, which killed 241 Americans during a terrorist attack in 1983 and has been locked in a war with Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.If my blood would help the liberation of Lebanon, I would give my blood to liberate Lebanon, he once told an Arabic paper in Michigan.The war that Netanyahu and his terrorist cult have started against Lebanon will never succeed, Elahi thundered in September as Israel assassinated Hezbollah leaders. I hope to see Netanyahu and his criminal cabinet in jail soon. And if they escape justice in this world, for sure they wont escape the HELL next.In 1991, Elahi was tasked with inspecting American branches of Hezbollah and promoting Tehrans influence on Shiite communities, according to the U.S. Institute of Peace.Elahi is also a member of the Ahl Al-Bayt World Assembly, an Iranian-based organization founded in 1994 by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The group has tentacles in about 90 countries, aims to extend regime influence through networking with academic institutions, civil rights organizations, charities and welfare projects around the world.Elahi is the only identifiable American member of ABWAs general assembly and he has been photographed at top leadership meetings in Iran, GWU reported.While sanctions prevent ABWA from operating directly in the United States, the group organizes trips for American academics to Iran to meet with regime leaders and receive training at their headquarters in Islamic holy city of Qom, the GWU report said.Despite Elahis close ties to Tehran, he has managed to ingratiate himself with top American Democrats.In addition to Harris, he has mingled with former Secretary of State John Kerry, and Whitmer, photos show.The GWU report also named Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell and the late Rep. John Conyers as people who have associated with Elahi.Elahi is a regular donor to Democrats through the fundraising platform ActBlue, Federal Election Commission records show.The GWU report also discussed Elahis prime benefactor, the Alavi Foundation, which has long been on the feds radar.In 2008, the Department of Justice alleged Alavi secretly served as a front for the Iranian government and as a gateway for millions of dollars to be funneled to Iran in clear violation of U.S. sanctions, according to court papers.Since 2000, the nonprofit has donated at least $486,810 to Elahis Islamic House of Wisdom, Alavis tax records show.The group has also donated roughly $1.9 million to American universities over the years, including recent hotbeds of anti-Israel hate like Harvard, Columbia and Hunter College.In June, Elahi signed a letter to Wayne State University leaders demanding they meet radical campus activists from Students for Justice in Palestine.In July Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines confirmed that Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza which has included providing financial support to protesters.Lara Burns, a lead researcher on the GWU report, said Haines was correct.We are tracking that [DNI] report and have seen messaging in protest activities consistent with support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran and even Iranian regime leaders have openly praised the activity, Burns said.Alavi is at the center of a widespread campaign to influence the American public, the researchers said.The New York-based Alavi Foundation is arguably the most prolific actor in the spread of Iranian regime influence in the United States, according to the GWU report titled Propaganda, Procurement and Lethal Operations: Irans Activities Inside America.With its multimillion-dollar budget, it either directly owns or funds through grants, no-interest loans, and donations a broad array of mosques and entities nationwide that disseminate Tehrans viewpoint.Alavis then-president Farshid Jahedi was sentenced to three months in prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and destroying documents concerning Alavis relationship with Irans Bank Melli.For decades, the Iranian regime has worked closely with far-left, far-right and Islamist groups across Europe and North America, Sam Westrop, director of Middle East Forums Islamist Watch project told The Post in August. Following the October 7th attacks . . . Tehran has poured money and logistical support into anti-Israel and pro-terror rallies, encampments and civil disorder. Weve uncovered evidence of this in Houston, where the Iranian regime appears to operate mosques, activist and student groups that are deeply involved in pro-terror demonstrations, alongside Hamas-aligned groups.Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), said Irans evil ideology and malign influence have no place here, after being apprised of the report.We need an administration that has the backbone to reject Irans propaganda that undermines America and espouses antisemitic views. America must stand up to terrorists, not cower to the ayatollah at every turn.","title":"Kamala Harris mingled with Tehran regime operative who promotes terrorism"},{"text":"Woah oh living on a prayer...?","title":"Jon Bon Jovi endorses Kamala Harris and Tim Walz with song dedication"},{"text":"Y'see, election interference is when they're held to account for interfering with the electoral process or voter fraud/intimidation.Literally anything the other side does is justification for them to take up arms and attempt another coup.","title":"Democratic campaign office in Arizona closes down after being shot at 3 times in 3 weeks"},{"text":"He threatened her life aka trump threatened Katie Johnson.

I dont know what state youre in or how the specific laws are written/enforced, but everything you describe doesnt jump out to me, having been a poll worker in Pennsylvania.First, the rule about No canvassing within 100ft is very loosely defined and depends on your polling location. The rule is 100 feet from the literal area where the voting is occurring, not the building. So if youre voting at a school where the machines are located in the gymnasium, the canvassing rule applies starting from the door to the gymnasium, not the door on the exterior of the building. Every location is different and usually the people canvassing sample ballots are the same ones doing it in every election, twice a year. They know where to be because they do it all the time. This goes for both parties.The poll workers should be indifferent or even cold. Theyre allowed to be friendly but should show no favoritism or be wearing any kind of political paraphernalia. The person you thought was looking at your ballot was likely looking to make sure you were inserting it into the machine the correct way. Every year we would have tons of people feed it in upside down, sideways, etc. The workers at the machines were there to make sure you input the ballot correctly so it can be counted. If you feed it incorrectly it can jam the machine which could require them to call in a technician from the county to drive to the location and fix it. Then you need the judge of elections at that polling place to open the machine with the technician and watch them fix the jam, then remove and void the ballot that was causing the jam. Its a huge headache and can really slow things down. So they watch people feed the ballots to make sure theyre fed into the machine correctly.I wouldnt worry too much about it, a lot of this sounds pretty innocuous.","title":"I voted early, I'm worried"},{"text":"Republicans would rather people suffer so they can blame Democrats for it","title":"Biden warns hurricane-relief funding needed soon as he calls on Congress to step up"},{"text":"20%.","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Good News in Must-Win State From Most Accurate Pollster"},{"text":"Ok it feels like youre veering into bad faith sock puppetry at this point.As a general statement, I assume its never good for a VP to upstage their running mate.Coach Walz knows that it takes a team to win, Im sure.

I'll be voting for Harris, she might not be the perfect candidate running the perfect platform, but she is far and away the best viable candidate on the ballot.","title":"You cant trust who??"},{"text":"Crazy we haven't really seen anyone talking about Bob Woodward here","title":"I think we are due one more pre-election curveball.
