While extreme wealth inequality can raise concerns about fairness and opportunity, many of societys biggest challengessuch as inadequate education systems, lagging healthcare infrastructure, or environmental degradationoften have root causes not solely driven by the presence of ultra-rich individuals. Structural inefficiencies in public policy, regulatory frameworks that fail to adapt, and deep-seated historical inequities all play significant roles in creating and sustaining large-scale problems.Additionally, the ultra-wealthy represent a relatively small subset of the population, and their individual spending or investment choices may not have as direct an impact on day-to-day life as public sentiment suggests. For example, the argument that billionaires hoard wealth often overlooks the fact that much of their net worth is tied up in companies or investments that, at least in principle, support economic growth, innovation, and employment. While theres debate over whether such growth always benefits the broader population, its not necessarily true that these substantial fortunes are simply sitting idle.Another point in this vein is that because the ultra wealthy is a small population they dont consume very much relative to their wealth. If their wealth was seized and distributed it would (a) lose tons of value because it isnt cash and (b) be very inflationary as everyone simultaneously increases their consumption Moreover, wealth concentration has been a feature of economic systems throughout history, and its direct impact on contemporary problems is not always as straightforward as it seems. In some cases, the ultra-wealthy champion philanthropic initiatives, fund research and development in critical industries, and drive technological progress. Its uncertain whether curtailing their individual fortunesthough perhaps warranted for reasons of fairness or fiscal resource allocationwould automatically solve systemic social issues. Many problems, like wage stagnation or the high cost of housing, involve complex market dynamics, outdated policies, or limited affordable solutions rather than just the presence of ultra-rich individuals.In essence, while it is entirely reasonable to criticize the effects of extreme wealth inequality and consider reforms (including tax adjustments or stricter antitrust measures), its not obvious that the ultra-wealthy, as a group, should be seen as the singular or central cause of most pressing modern problems. Other structural factorspolitical gridlock, outdated policy frameworks, globalizations uneven effects, and the rapid pace of technological changelikely play equally, if not more, significant roles.Thus, it seems very reasonable that people with very different social preferences would not ben agreement on going after the ultra wealthy.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"People really forget the government isnt just CongressA government shutdown right now would be absolutely ruinous for so many people I work with, this isnt something that should be taken lightly as a political game, unless youre okay with a shit ton of Soldiers and Sailors not getting their next pay checks","title":"Trump: If Government Is Going To Shut Down, Let It Begin Under Biden"},{"text":"Is president musk in favor of this one?

We could reduce drugs cost...no reason why we should be paying so much more for the same things. value based care makes sense. provide incentives for actually providing good care and solving issues instead of just treating symptoms. We also probably need to reassess end of life care and spending. So much is spent on the final months of older people's lives.

Past a certain point, dollars are just gold stars you receive from society for running big companies.Going from $0 to $10M makes a huge difference on your consumption. Going from $10M to $20M? Less so. Theres only so many meals you can eat in a day.This might sound like an insignificant detail. But then consider the whole notion of taxing the ultra wealthy to pay for everyone else. Does a few less dollars in Bezos bank account magically imply theres more goods Amazon can deliver to the average person?The money sitting in wealthy peoples accounts or tied up in financial assets isnt buying anything. Meanwhile, any income we give to everyone else (ordinary people) has to actually buy groceries and gas.The truth is that if we implemented a UBI tomorrow, and we funded it by taxing rich people or if we funded it by literally printing the money, the effect would be exactly the same. Either the economy could respond to the UBI by producing more goodsavoiding inflationor it couldnt. Because theres only so many resources to go around.Im saying: counterintuitively, taxing the rich is an entirely psychological benefit. It makes people feel more equal but thats all it really does. Marginal propensity to consume is already a kind of stealth limit on rich people hogging all the resources from the rest of us.Meanwhile, income in everyone elses hands is a huge material benefit and a huge real draw on resources. More spending power to people meaningfully increases their consumption and meaningfully increases the draw on available resources.From here theres only one logical question. How much consumer spending is too much? How many goods can the economy actually produce? If we lift the UBI, we can find out. We can increase peoples incomes until we discover the limits of total productivity.In other words, Left and Right should be united not on trimming the incomes of the 1% but boosting the incomes of the 99%.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Sounds like Lindy is in the wrong party.","title":"DNC fundraiser delivers stunning blow to Kamala Harris and 'delusional' Democrats"},{"text":"There's no way that the National Guard trying to sweep a city like Chicago doesn't turn into open combat.

If that person isn't trans, would they be considered a cisgender AMAB woman? Or a cisgender AFAB man? Legally speaking, that person would fall under the same anti-discrimination protections as trans people. The only practical impact of setting a bar that excludes some people would be if you'd choose to misgender someone who didn't meet your standards for being \\"true trans\\".As far as experiencing gender dysphoria, a post-transition trans person might legitimately not experience gender dysphoria anymore, but they don't stop being trans. A trans person might experience gender dysphoria and not recognize it as dysphoria. Many trans people report experiencing gender euphoria, which is oftentimes the absense of dysphoria. If you've lived your whole life under a blanket of dysphoria, it's hard to recognize what that feeling is. Fish don't know what water feels like. A person doesn't turn cisgender just because they have difficulty recognizing gender dysphoria. It's much easier to recognize euphoria because it's new and different.It's also just not helpful for the community to gatekeep based on dysphoria, especially when so many questioning people have a difficult time recognizing dysphoria. It's almost a trope how many people post on trans subreddits \\"I don't have dysphoria, but &lt;lists 5 different forms of gender dysphoria\\". It's not helpful to tell those folks that they couldn't be trans. It's better to direct them to a gender therapist where it'll probably take a lot of time to unpack it all.Even in the hypothetical case where a person had never experienced gender dysphoria, but transitioning made them happy, made them feel better in their body and comfortable with their gender, I wouldn't begrudge them transition.

The original bill went through the process in a bipartisan way and was ready to be passed but has not been voted on. It was 1500+ pages long to get an extension through March, when the new GOP congress would be able to do what they'd like at that time.The new bill, described by Johnson as \\"basically the same thing\\" is 116 pages. Aside from requiring a higher threshold of votes because it appeared out of nowhere yesterday, it suspends the debt ceiling for 2 years, and nobody really knows much else about it because nobody's had time to review it and the relevant committees haven't debated it. Certainly nobody who's been working on this for months has had any ability to cross-check what the differences between the two bills are.In that vein, the failed proposal from yesterday hasn't been scored by any agency for cost impact and with a 2-year suspension of the debt ceiling, would open the doors to larger deficits than we've ever seen before and little to no accountability along the way. As painful and stupid as votes about raising the debt ceiling are, they do offer an opportunity for both parties to enforce at least a small degree of checks and balances on one another by requiring a semi-regular compromise when the balance of Congress is at such a thin margin.[The text of the original CR](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/CR.pdf).[The text of the failed proposal voted on yesterday](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/American%20Relief%20Act%202025%20Final.pdf).tl;dr, the original bill had bipartisan support. It was researched, discussed by committees, and only needed a simple majority it probably would've gotten plus or minus an amendment here or there. The new bill circumvented every typical process, requires a higher 2/3's majority plus still needs to make it through the Senate, and would've left the debt ceiling suspended with no guardrails whatsoever. It needed roughly 290 votes to pass [and only got 174](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/10515/all-actions).

Meaning if the borrower defaulted the Federal Government would ultimately settle the debt. That's how they were at low interest in the first place for such an unsecured loan. That is why the costs have gone up. The system they came up with where this debt could be paid off over a long time. They thought it was basically free money and that the banks would be happy to take the little extra boon they got through decades of debt being serviced. The system doesn't work. They changed it to this system, they can change it again.But it's the same with healthcare insurance through your employer. It started with good intentions in ERISA but the lack of legislative maintenance in that set of bills has lead to the corporations being able to take complete advantage.The ultimate reason for this and many other issues is the past 12 years of Congressional Nullification. With the House and Senate unable to function, barely able to fund the government let alone perform legislative maintenance, the infrastructure of our system of laws are degrading and legally companies are able to take full advantage with no one able to do anything about it.Now all of those things need to be reformed rather than amended to keep with the times and trends.

Following Covid credit debt among Americans skyrocketed, home refinancing that got hammered by interest rate changes have been utterly devastating. Rent has skyrocketed across the country, and were one of the only developed countries in the world where rent consumes on average more than half of peoples monthly earnings.

Since then, for all the flaws people have, our judgement *has* prevented their further use.Part of this is because humans understand that the nuclear deterrent is essentially a lie. We have them, we officially are willing to use them, but in the moment every human being knows you aren't actually supposed to. And it's a terrible system, but to the extent it works, it does so because we assume the same of our partners on the other side of this equation.AI, as we understand it, does not exercise judgement. It works on weighted probabilities. Calculations over and over again of the most likely course of action in a scenario. There's no way of giving it the human psychology.

The Moonies had impoverished the mother of Tetsuya Yamagami through indoctrinating her to donate everything she had, and Tetsuya got his revenge by assassinating the highest profile person he could with Moonie connections, Shinzo Abe, former Prime Minister of Japan.Once the motive was revealed it created a lot of ill will and scrutiny for the Moonies and their influence in politics, which led to political parties distancing themselves and legislation passed to limit the influence of groups like them.None of this required protest movements, marches, direct action (well... other than killing Abe), etc to happen. The assassination merely surfaced a longstanding and well enough known issue in the minds of voters and the politics adapted to an enviroment where Moonie connections were suddenly toxic to the electorate.That is the 'successful' outcome of the Thompson Assassination.

You've said that you don't envision building some kind of general AI that could have its own motivations or behave in ways contrary to human interests. But you do want to build an AI that would, apparently, be capable of analysing the international geopolitical, military and economic situation, correctly anticipating the behaviour of other, human parties, and developing complex, novel strategies for deescalating international tension. It seems hard to reconcile the idea of engineering a machine that is both one of history's greatest statesmen and a mindless automaton incapable of independent thinking or unpredictable behaviour.It also ignores the fact that we can't build such a machine. Computers are good at strategy games because they have understanding or insight. They're good at games because games have clearly articulated rules that interact with each other in predictable ways. Playing a game well requires the player to perform relatively simple bits of logic, then stack them into sequences and pick the most desirable sequence. Computers are good at this because they can perform these logical exercises quicker and retain more, larger sequences than a human. The world doesn't work like that. You can teach an AI 'the rules', but the output is only as good as the input. And fallible humans, who haven't solved the game of Thermonuclear War, are providing the inputs. You can ask an AI to try and infer 'the rules', but it's still constrained by its dataset. It seems like your view boils down to saying that the systems we use to manage nuclear weapons are too prone to failure. So, instead, we should use a system that doesn't make mistakes. Great! We'll build a machine that never breaks and always works as intended, even though we can't articulate our intentions...Looking at the history of nuclear close-calls, it seems like they broadly fall into two categories. The first are situations in which real disputes raised tensions between nuclear powers, and the humans running those powers ultimately decided against nuclear war. The second are situations in which misunderstandings or technological failures were misperceived as escalation. And the humans in charge decided to trust their common sense, rather than what their radar screens told them. In both situations, it seems like humans' irrational, emotional aversion to nuclear holocaust proved to be a feature, not a bug.

Even beyond that though, the trick to things like launching nukes is that you ensure safety by having it pass through a lot of hands. It doesn't matter if there's a nutjob in the line truly itching to destroy the world if there's 20 people before or after him that have to pass along the key before it's launched. Sure you could pass the key to an AI but if you know the logic it's using then humans could just follow that logic or trick the AI into believing false info, and if you don't know the logic then you're just blindly relying on an unknown hoping it doesn't destroy the world. Heck even beyond all of that we're finding ways to hack the unhackable very VERY quickly. The idea of digitizing the thing that could destroy everything just isn't a sustainable idea. I think more and more the endpoint of security will basically always be people there watching and strictly controlling access.   \\n  \\nIf you boil it all down it just becomes \\"Who watches the watchmen?\\" If you need a key, who has access to the key? Who verifies access to the key? Who watches whoever verifies access to the key? If it's an AI instead it's really just the same thing, but now the computer can decide to launch whenever and it's who has access to the AI, who verifies the information the AI can use, how does the AI know what is real and what isn't? The end result doesn't improve because it's still all about access control and information handling, except now there exists some way for the AI to either fully start the launch, which means there is a signal that can be sent to even do that unilaterally and thus can be replicated, or there's a way for the AI to send a signal to fully stop the process with the exact same problem. All this to say, maybe it'll become part of the process but a 1-1 replacement would be strictly worse because convincing/tricking one AI to launch a bomb is easier than convincing/tricking everyone in the building that you'd have to get past to do the same thing.

There certainly are different ways of experiencing your transition etc., but one can get too lost in the weeds on this.It would be like trying to distinguish homosexual vs homoromantic people and figuring who precisely is gay in this way or that. There are different ways of experiencing gayness and different gay subcultures and sub-subcultures, which can be interesting to compare and contrast. But if one hyper-focuses on how other gay people dont experience gayness in the same way they do, then thats mostly just making people feel bad if communicated in negative ways. I think its also important to keep in mind that encouraging exclusionary thinking can be bad for the movement on the whole. After all, there are plenty of LGB people that want to exclude trans people for not really being queer and kick them out of the group altogether while passing anti-trans legislation, or LG people who want to exclude bisexual people. Its fundamentally the same dynamic, and every trans person feels horrible when LGB people are anti-trans. Technically, youre not queer in the same way they are, and they can easily argue that you exist but not in the same way they do, so why should they accommodate you? They technically have the stronger selfish argument even, since it certainly would be politically expedient for cis LGB people to just ditch trans people altogether to protect their own rights.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I doubt it's because \\"it's happening\\".","title":"NEW: Kamala Harris just abruptly cancelled her planned trip to California and raced to the White House, per reporters"},{"text":"The Democrats have finally returned to their roots ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Are they increasing it in their part of the Golan Heights or Syria's?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"every single time I make popcorn it's like god personally sent down a panacea for the first few bites and then suddenly  mediocrity and struggling to finish the rest of the bowl","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Until China and India make changes, anything we do over here are a waste.","title":"Biden pledges to cut US greenhouse gases by more than 60% | Trump vows to undo the Green New Scam"},{"text":"netanyahu said the excursions will last until 2025, but based on how he is, theres a good chance it ends up being permanent. the fact that they're planning on increasing the population in the golan heights is not a very good sign","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Republicans have never expressed a shred of interest in drawing down and almost always take the opportunity to gain further advantages by abusing the decency of others.

Think of it in terms of power. The ownership of massive wealth grants a person incredible power, power that they can exert over you, a business, the government, or our entire society if they have enough of it. Whether or not you think it affects you, it does. And there is little to nothing any of us can do to effectively challenge that power if and when it negatively affects us or our community.What if a company decides to start polluting your Iand because it saves them money? What if a billionaire buys up your local factory and shuts it down because it's a competitor? What if your job is cut a few years from now because a robot is invented that saves executives a few bucks and they'd rather pocket the difference they save by not paying you anymore?Because they own things, because they have access to huge amounts of capital, they can do all this, they can ruin lives and loot our country, and it's all fully legal. And if it isn't legal they just spend millions of dollars legally bribing politicians until it becomes legal. This class of people is filthy rich and more powerful than any of us will ever be, because on some spreadsheets on Wall Street or corporate headquarters, there are big numbers next to their names. Not because they work hard or earned it or deserve it or were chosen by the people.The point is that that sort of power shouldn't exist. It's bad for our entire country and for the world. I'm okay with people being rich, I think some people work hard for their money. But being well compensated as an inventor or artist or athlete or skilled professional isn't the same as manipulating the entire economy to serve you and extract as much money as possible from hundreds of millions of other people, consequences be damned.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Scrooged for a different take on it and the Patrick Stewart version for something more traditional","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"alr hold on","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Joe Biden?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"dude claims 9-10 million people will dielol it was more like 350 thousand onlyThat's still a lot of people, and it shut the world down and inconvenienced everyone for more than a yearThis is nitpicking at its worst","title":"4 chan posts talking about the pandemic before it occured!"},{"text":"The first line of response should be lifestyle, RFK Jr told Jim CramerThe secretary of health and human services under President George W.

In that case, I would generally advise Biden *not* to pardon the serial killer, because it's wrong to do so; maybe Trump will do it, but if he does, that's on him, there's no need for Biden to do it for him.But if you think that the Jan 6 attackers should have never have been convicted in in the first place and morally deserved to be pardoned, that argument would be tangential to your view.","title":"CMV: Biden should pardon the January 6th attackers on his last day in office"},{"text":"Where's the submission statement?","title":"Conspiracy theorists right again on Biden's mental decline"},{"text":"I think an important question is what the country can and should unite around.  \\nI think the country needs to unite around the idea of respecting the results of elections, and recognizing that much of the country disagrees.President Biden won the US presidential election in 2020.

Despite being warned to remain inside his home, Horn stated he would shoot, telling the operator,  I have a right to protect myself too, sir.

One of the bullets struck and killed 15-year-old Jamonta Miles.

An assumed goal of common law is making laws which induce behaviors reducing societal costs. With self/property defense, we want people to protect themselves from harm, but not so enthusiastically that they unnecessarily kill or harm people.\\"Castle doctrine\\" spells out that if someone is using force to enter your property, you are allowed to use force to prevent them or stop them from harming you -- provided you face *reasonable danger* and act on a *duty to retreat if possible.* For instance, a catburglar's mere trespassing only permits \\"brandishing\\" (ex. rattling your spears at them). Your violence also won't be justified if you provoke the intrusion, provoke their use of force, are there illegally, are aiding fugitives, or are acting against an agent of the law (qualified immunity).If you *do* kill a person after you attempted to retreat in order to protect yourself, you will still likely be arrested and tried -- you have to prove that it was lawful to kill them, and the burden of proof is upon you to justify this. The goal here is to disincentivize needless violence, and restrict it to those cases where the costs are justified.\\"Stand your ground\\" takes all the above, and throws it out the window. In an absolute sense, you don't have a duty to retreat wherever you are (in some places, you may off your property). Provided you *fear for your safety* ( =/= reasonable danger), that is justification for the use of deadly force. It also reverses the burden of proof: now, the state is obliged to prove that you *didn't* believe killing someone was necessary.All in all, SYG doesn't improve on Castle Doctrine, and just changes the incentives towards deescalation and lowers the threshold to \\"costly\\" (deadly) violence, where agents are able to act without facing the true costs of their actions -- you can kill someone unnecessarily, and get away with it.","title":"CATO's Freedom in the 50 States: Positions of Orthodox American Libertarians"},{"text":"All hail president musk","title":"Trumps Ego Explodes as Dems Call Musk President, Forcing His Team to Reassure Hes in Charge, Not Elon"},{"text":"We're also deep into a period of relative peace and experiencing almost exponential technological progression which almost seems to be cascading forward, but not fast enough to stop cooking ourselves to death","title":"House Democrat: Unelected oligarch Musk governing by tweet"},{"text":"Sharp as a tac","title":"Conspiracy theorists right again on Biden's mental decline"},{"text":"Came here to say the same.

One thing you, as a non-American covered by universal health care, may be unaware of is that health care is becoming exponentially more expensive, much more than the rate of inflation, and this trend persists year after year.  The pace is unsustainable and radical changes are eventually going to have to happen.  Enough Republicans are in favor of the Affordable Care Act, so health care is starting to be considered more of a basic right vs. a luxury, even though there is still quite a way to go.Medicare Advantage plans (those provided by private insurers) currently get a subsidy from the federal government, that subsidy seems like low hanging fruit to discontinue.  Subsidizing this industry is not a good look, and the US budget deficit can use the money.I'm not in favor of murder or other harm, for any reason, but sometimes it does take one event like this to energize a movement, just like you mentioned with George Floyd.

Let me lay it out, any elective outcome would've ended the same, one side will freak out while the other side reacts. This is how it goes almost all the time, so how is this any different? I don't think you're looking at this very diplomatically. This problem, though not as widespread and looked at as today, has always been a think. Look at Obama for example, everyone thought he wasn't born in the United States although and his birth certificate was shown as proof. Look George W Bush's victory where there had to be a recount because people suspected fraud and the Supreme Court decided. So, it's not one party or the other, it's just people being people, hateful, non-researching, indoctrinated people. What we need to do instead, is choose people to get into power that choose to show their policies and have the better policies. One mistake Kamala and the Democrat party had this election was the fact that Kamala didn't outline her policies. She just compared what Trump did compared to what the Biden Campaign did while they were in the house. This isn't a good strategy to win the seat. Instead what she should've done was what Trump did, outline what SHE would do in office if she's elected. Trump outlined what he would do in office, he didn't compare himself as being better than the other party, sometimes he did though but not during every questioning. So the problem is not the candidate or the party, parties are just large interest or pressure groups, no, it's just the people that follow the candidates which are the issue.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"Why does one preclude the other?  \\nYou can troll somebody with the truth, especially if they are a corrupt lying scumbag.","title":"Dems Troll Trump by Saying Elon Is in Charge"},{"text":"Good to have friends that share your interest","title":"Biden will meet with Pope Francis in the final days of his presidency"},{"text":"Is it either of *Game Change* by Heileman and Halperin or *The Battle for America 2008* by Balz and Johnson?","title":"How the White House Functioned With a Diminished Biden in Charge"},{"text":"Are you mad? \\nKushners real estate empire was managing and worth billions a decade before he had another to do with Trump. \\nTry reading.

My FIL declined for about 10 years before passing. I experienced first hand behavior beginning to his death, and Biden reminded me of him so much. My coworker was so angry for me even suggesting Biden wasnt fit for office and screamed at me. I knew I was right. Right now Biden seems to me that he will either only be around for another 2 years or so. He will fall getting out of bed or trip or something which will send him quickly down the road to complete mental incapacity and will be totally out of it, and the illness will be allowed to take its natural course or the family will keep him alive and bedridden. Biden is so far gone right now. Its quite sad. My FIL was sent to a really great facility for his remaining years. He wasnt on medication because it just keeps patients in a state of drugged confusion instead of just letting his body naturally kind of whither away.

The other people on the republican side are either the ultra wealthy; the upper class who owns a home, drives a new car, and takes an overseas vacation every year wealthy; or the temporarily embarrassed millionaire with only an 8th grade education wealthy. These people all think being that right isn't just okay but that they deserve to be that rich too and it's just a matter of time until the have private jets and stuff or they already are and are okay with the current system. In order to get both sides together, you'd have to get them to admit a. Being a billionaire is wrong, and b. Their specific billionair is also a bad person. Both of those things are going to be pretty hard to sell to one side of the aisle. Then, on the other side, you have a team that supports politicians that also support the ultra wealthy even though they say they don't and it's an open secret that they do. And these people point at the ones who don't like either and say they have to vote for their terrible candidate because look how insane the other person is and tries to make people feel bad for not liking the choice that's shoved down their throat.

Now imagine you have AI, robots, and automation to meet all your needs, from food and medicine to entertainment and comfort. Now, due to the energy and resources this will take, these benefits will only be available to a select few. Now, if you're one of those people who could possibly live hundreds of years, the only thing that could get in the way is the destruction of the planet. So if you're potentially going to be in that situation, do you: A. Risk allowing humanity as a whole to potentially fuck it up for you and destroy resources you might need for little to no benefit to you, or B. Find a way to kill off 80% of the population gradually over the next ten years as the AI transition occurs, through a vaccine that will significantly shorten people's life spans, giving you access to all the resources you would ever need and allowing the earth to start healing. If a few people could live forever, the only real potential obstacle would be the rest of pesky humanity. I'm vaccinated, so I hope it isn't true, but my gut tells me the timing of AI advancements and the COVID vaccine stuff is just too convenient. 80% of the population is vaccinated... Don't think for a second that the elites and people with access to the real potential power of AI wouldn't kill us all in a heartbeat in order to live longer and more comfortable.

But we both firmly believe in it being a game, and its really us versus the ultra wealthy, and fundamentally that is the most important unity with the other. Also just acknowledging that as much as you may not agree on certain topics, that the other person isnt necessarily an asshole or an idiot, goes a long way. Him and I may argue all day about a topic, but then the next day go to lunch and continue on being friends and moving to the next conversation. Definitely acknowledge that our friendship is VERY abnormal in terms of acceptance, but we honestly are very good friends because we know we can actually be ourselves with each other. There are no eggshells to be worried about. At the end of the day, Ive come to pick him up when his car broke down, and Vice versa.

Not sure it's warranted, though, given that Trump is incomparably worse on LGBT rights or Palestine than Harris is, and he still made significant gains with that demographic in this election.The fact is that most Americans simply do not sympathize nearly as much with some progressive values as many here tend to believe. I already gave some examples in my previous comment to another poster, if you care to look it over, but here's more:[America is becoming less woke](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/09/19/america-is-becoming-less-woke) ([non-paywall version](https://archive.ph/knWrN))Almost everywhere we looked a similar trend emerged: wokeness grew sharply in 2015, as Donald Trump appeared on the political scene, continued to spread during the subsequent efflorescence of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, peaked in 2021-22 and has been declining ever since (see charts). The only exception is corporate wokeness, which took off only after Mr Floyds murder, but has also retreated in the past year or two.The simplest way to measure the spread of woke views is through polling. \\\\[...\\\\] Woke opinions on racial discrimination began to grow around 2015 and peaked around 2021. In the most recent Gallup \\\\[poll\\\\] 35% of people said they worried a great deal about race relations, down from a peak of 48% in 2021 \\\\[...\\\\] Polling about sexual discrimination reveals a similar pattern \\\\[...\\\\]Woke views on gender are also in decline. Pew finds that the share of people who believe someone can be a different sex from the one of their birth has fallen steadily since 2017, when it first asked the question. Opposition to trans students playing in sports teams that match their chosen gender rather than their biological sex has grown from 53% in 2022 to 61% in 2024, according to YouGov.And so on. On other issues like Palestine, the public also disagrees: far more Americans are sympathetic to Israelis than Palestinians on the whole. In short, these some of the ideas that are popular with the far left are not exactly popular with the rest of the public. Our personal views aside, the majority of Americans dislike or even downright hate some of them. Now, I'm not arguing that we should give up, embrace full-blown sexism and racism and forget about things like climate change for good, but we obviously need to address the issues most voters actually care about if we want a Democrat to win in 2028 and beyond. Going further to the left is only an answer if it gets the popular support up, not the opposite of that.","title":"James Carville claims 'tyranny of the left' loses Democrats elections"},{"text":"Unfortunately America has never listened to him!","title":"Bernie Sanders Goes Off on 'President Elon Musk' for Derailing Bipartisan Spending Bill: 'Billionaires Must Not Be Allowed to Run Our Government'"},{"text":"Hes too stupid and annoying to be effective.

While this perspective identifies a genuine problem (the concentration of wealth and power), it is also flawed due to an oversimplification of political and economic realities.1.  The False Dichotomy of Class vs. Culture: The argument presents a false dichotomy, suggesting that class issues and political/moral differences are mutually exclusive. These issues are often intertwined. For example, conservative stances on deregulation and tax cuts often directly benefit the ultra-wealthy. Similarly, left-leaning policies on social programs and environmental regulation can impact the distribution of wealth. Simply abandoning these issues in favor of solely focusing on class issues ignores the core reasons for wealth disparities.2.  Defining the Enemy: The statement claims that the focus should be on \\"taking down the ultra-wealthy\\". This phrase, undefined, is a problem, but you clarified that it meant not separating due to infighting and instead uniting to peacefully protest. However, billionaires are not a singular entity. They have varying interests and political stances. Focusing on an abstract concept of ultra-wealthy overlooks the need to address specific policies and structures that allow the accumulation of extreme wealth. Furthermore, it risks alienating individuals who might support specific economic reforms but hold different political or moral beliefs.3.  The Problem of Unity: The idea that the left and right can \\"put aside\\" political and moral differences is naive. Political and moral disagreements are often deeply ingrained and rooted in differing values and worldviews. Attempting to suppress these differences for the sake of unity is not only impractical but also potentially counterproductive. It can create an unstable coalition prone to infighting and ultimately, it invalidates the individual goals that people are fighting for, which prevents long-term unity.4.  Ignoring the Nuance of Political Change: The assertion that focusing solely on class issues is the path to societal reform ignores the complex reality of political change. Successfully challenging wealth inequality requires addressing a wide range of issues, including campaign finance reform, lobbying regulations, and tax policy. These are inherently political issues that demand addressing through different perspectives. Dismissing these political nuances in favor of a simple, unified approach to class struggle is not only impractical but also hinders the creation of effective solutions.5. Strategic Misdirection: It is also worth noting that a common tactic in politics is to distract from the core issue through culture wars and the like. While it is important to focus on class issues, the argument that cultural issues should be put aside may in fact be what the \\"ultra-wealthy\\" want. They use culture wars to divide and misdirect from the issue of class inequality, and saying that we should stop focusing on these cultural issues may be exactly what the wealthy want. There are multiple sides to every issue, and there is often a lot of nuance that is left out if the primary focus is the economic.In conclusion, while the concern about the influence of wealth on politics is valid, the proposal to abandon political and moral arguments in favor of a singular focus on class issues is not a viable solution. This viewpoint ignores the complex interplay between economic structures, political power, and cultural values. It also underestimates the deep-seated nature of political and moral disagreements. A more effective approach requires engaging with the full spectrum of these issues, promoting dialogue across different perspectives, and pursuing policy solutions that address the root causes of inequality.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"WOOF","title":"The 43rd President and his husband Bob.

Thats  my blunt message.  I  could  probably  end  my discussion at this point and it wouldnt really matter. My position is clear and you likely already get the gist of what I want to say. I have nothing positive to  add to the  discussion  about neoliberalism, and  to  be  perfectly  honest,  Im  quite sick  of having  to  think  about  it.  Ive  simply  had  enough.  For  a  time  I  had  considered calling this  paper Forget Neoliberalism  instead, as in  some  ways  thats  exactly what  I  wanted to  do.  Ive been  writing  on the  subject for  many years  (Springer 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015; Springer et al. 2016) and I came to a point where I just  didnt  want  to  commit  any  more  energy  to  this  endeavor  for  fear  that continuing  to  work around  this  idea  was  functioning  to perpetuate  its  hold.  On further reflection I also recognize that as a political maneuver it is potentially quite dangerous  to  simply  stick  our  heads  in  the  sand  and  collectively  ignore  a phenomenon that has  had  such  devastating  and  debilitating  effects  on our  shared world. There is an ongoing power to neoliberalism that is difficult to deny and Im not convinced that a strategy of ignorance is actually the right approach (Springer 2016a). So  my exact thoughts  were,  well  fuck  it then,  and while  a quieter  and gentler name for this paper could tone down the potential offence that might come with  the  title  Ive chosen,  I subsequently  reconsidered.  Why  should  we  be more worried  about  using  profanity  than  we  are  about  the  actual  vile  discourse  of neoliberalism itself? I decided that I wanted to transgress, to upset, and to offend, precisely because we ought to be offended by neoliberalism, it is entirely upsetting, and therefore we should ultimately be seeking to transgress it. Wouldnt softening the title be making yet another concession to the power of neoliberalism? I initially worried what such a title might mean in terms of my reputation. Would it hinder future  promotion  or  job  offers  should  I  want  to  maintain  my  mobility  as  an academic, either upwardly or to a new location? This felt like conceding personal defeat to neoliberal disciplining. Fuck that.","title":"The year is 2025 AD. The world is entirely occupied by the forces of illiberalism. Well not entirely!

There's a huge core of ego at the heart of the GOP's worldview: if we aren't winning, then either the other side cheated or we made a huge misstep somehow. Because otherwise, the answer is that they were *always* destined to lose, on account of just being a bad party. So in 2020, the immediate reaction to Trump losing was \\"The Left is cheating!\\". And in previous elections, the vibe was less extreme, but still \\"We fucked up by *letting them win*, because we weren't united enough!\\" Their fragile egos assume that any loss is a catastrophe, because frankly the GOP's platform falls apart under basic scrutiny on multiple levels.And because they view their world that way, they assume the same is true when the Democrats lose. And they try to rub it in their faces: \\"You lost! This means that everything you ever stood for was bad and you should just sit down and accept it!\\" But in reality, the Left is at least somewhat more resilient than this. They're at least aware that there are multiple opinions and levels within the Left-leaning ideologies, and while they can argue about how or why they lost, it's rarely based on fear that the entirety of leftism and liberalism was wrong and doomed to fail. So we get these \\"look at the Left crying!\\" responses, when nobody was really crying, because the Right knows *they'd* be crying right now if it were them. It's not that they're treating the Left differently than they treat themselves; actually it's that they're treating the Left *the same* as they treat themselves.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"!ping FUCK-NEOLIBERALISM","title":"The year is 2025 AD.

Things like climate change and race relations were not far behind, at #21 and #18 respectively.So further embracing some of these things regardless of their merits, like doubling down on the \\"woke\\" C something only about one in five Americans actually support and most seem to oppose vehemently C will only drive even more voters away to the right.

Can you share some quotes where people want to punish rich people for being rich?\\n[Bernie Sanders](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/politics/bernie-millionaire-senators-immoral/index.html) for example, although it's extremely easy to find that kind of rhetoric. So sending a millionaire to jail for murder is a violation of his property rights? That's not how justice has ever worked in the history of the concept. That would also be the opposite of what I said.You're going to have to show me where this has been applied by conservatives.The abolition movement, the civil rights movement, the prolife movement.The conservative supreme court has at least two justices who've taken gifts, some of them lavish and continuous, from people with business before the court. The law does not apply to them.The law does apply to them, and that's bad. The conservative president had enough evidence and testimony presented before congress to convict him in two impeachments but conservatives wouldn't let that happen.Because the cases presented were insufficient to convict him.Historically conservatives have been the stalwart defenders of denying equal rights to minorities and the people wearing swastikas and waving confederate flags are voting for Conservatives to express their views and write them into law.Correct. Because all are equal under the law. The government cannot decree what a symbol means to people. Throughout the nation the law is applied unequally to minorities and whites. Conservatives consistently deny this in spite of the evidence and where they don't deny it the celebrate it. In my experience, conservatives are suspicious of such claimed, but they don't celebrate when it does happen. Many support police reform to some extent. Of course, in my experience, democrats and their allies actively push laws and systems that sort people by race when determining punishment or requirements.Assuming you are not wealthy, you don't enjoy the same system of justice wealthy people do. A millionaire who kills people or destroys millions in property through willful negligence through the operation of his corporation suffers no consequences under the law.Indeed. Much work has to be done.His rights under the law are more than equal and Conservatives in government, want badly for it to stay that way. To be fair, Neoliberals in government don't want much of that to change either. There are too few liberals in government anymore to change things.That much i agree with.

When times are good (for middle class white people) that's when people are at their most empathetic and most willing to entertain the idea of enacting policies that lead to more equality -- but that's also when they're the most afraid of change, because when things are good, change is probably bad. So if you want to sell them on change you have to sell them on the end result (poor, brown, gay, etc people get to live better lives and you get to feel like Good People for supporting them) and not the act of change itself.But as soon as things go bad (for middle class white people) you have to pivot *immediately* to a blatantly obvious change, change, change message before the right swoops in and blames all their problems on Muslim drag queens or whatever.","title":"John Fetterman vs AOC: the battle for the Democratic Partys future"},{"text":"Being light refracted through water droplets would be pretty boring...","title":"The 43rd President and his husband Bob.

The government had the most power over us maybe ever before (literally telling us to stay in our homes). and B. There was a media machine telling the country it was Trump's fault we had to stay inside and that he was responsible for the deaths. Don't forget that media machine manufactured outrage about the president since he came down the escalator. I don't think any president could have navigated a crisis like that and won re-election. 2020 tapped into the very low propensity voters who opposed the incumbent. Those people didn't feel the need to vote in 24 because, even though on a macro level, the past 4 years have sucked, at least we live in a pre-pandemic world again. Oh and they also didn't get ballots sent to their homes. I hope Trump investigates the 2020 election, but if nothing comes from it, I think it would be best for us to drop it. I personally know people who draw a line in the sand about supporting Republicans because of this thinking. 2020 is over, we got our guy now with a more favorable win than what would have been possible in 2020, so let's take advantage of it and focus on tomorrow.","title":"Where Did 6M Democrat Votes Go Between 2020 and 2024?"},{"text":"doesn't make them any less stupid","title":"How Liberal America Came to Its Senses"},{"text":"We also elected Trump to be your Daddy.","title":"Top Democrat Mocks Trump for 'Following Orders' of 'Unelected President' Elon Musk"},{"text":"there's always 1 that decides to enable the republican bullshit.","title":"Michigan House Democrats order police to retrieve boycotting Republican members"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.
