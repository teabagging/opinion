Paul Krugman says hell only make their lives harder.The economist, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, criticized the president-elects plans to raise tariffs and cut taxes during Tuesdays episode of The Daily Blast with Greg Sargent podcast.He told The New Republic show that those and other policies would lead to the working class paying higher prices while high earners keep more of their money.Even more than usual for a Republican, he appears to have an extremely regressive economic program in mind, one that really will effectively redistribute income away from working-class voters to the top, Krugman said.American households are already being pinched by inflation, which spiked to a 40-year high of more than 9% in the summer of 2022 and remains above the Federal Reserves 2% target.On top of higher prices for food, fuel, rent, and other basics, many consumers are also paying more toward their credit cards, car loans, and mortgages.Thats because the Fed, in a bid to curb inflation, increased its benchmark rate from zero to north of 5.25% in under 17 months, and has kept it as high as 4.5% for now.The battle over groceriesKrugman, a former MIT and Princeton University professor and New York Times columnist, zeroed in on grocery prices. Trump said during his campaign that he would reduce them, but hes walked that claim back in recent weeks.Yet recent surveys show that his supporters still expect him to do so, Krugman said, despite the fact that broader prices are still rising and deflation is almost universally regarded as undesirable for an economy.A CBS News/YouGov survey, conducted in late December with a nationally representative group of 2,244 US adults, found that 40% of Americans expect Trump to make food and grocery prices go down, exceeding the 36% who expect him to make them increase.A lot of people are going to get brutally scammed, Krugman said. Trump isnt just misleading people by saying theyll be better off once hes in office, he also doesnt appear to know how hell deliver on his promises, Krugman continued. So the scam is there is no plan.Trump said last year that lowering grocery prices would be tricky, but improving supply chains and boosting domestic energy production could lower costs for farmers, who could then pass those savings onto consumers.Tariffs and immigrationSeparately, Krugman nodded to the fact that tariffs are a tax on imports, and businesses usually pass on their increased costs by charging higher prices to consumers.He described their impact as really bad, and said the fallout from Trumps proposed mass deportations would be much, much worse. Theyd be hugely disruptive and drive up prices in industries like agriculture, food processing, and construction, Krugman said, leaving the US with a shortage of workers for large-scale programs like rebuilding Florida after a hurricane.The author and blogger also rang the alarm on Trump and his allies fierce criticism of colleges and skepticism of higher education.Weve been pulling ahead on technology, but an administration thats extremely hostile to universities and education is going to undermine that source of advantage as well, Krugman said.Trump wants to turn the clock back to 1896, and thats not good for the US economy.","title":"Economist Paul Krugman, Who Won The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Says Trump's Policies Will Leave His Blue-Collar Base Feeling 'Brutally Scammed'"},{"text":"Understated detail.

Went through separation myself and it tore me to shreds, and when i was at the lowest point of my temporal life, (i was at the 5 year mark of studying The Word) blubbering over the fact that my marriage was over officially, literally 3 weeks of non stop tears, it hit me one day, And by hit me, i mean hearing the thoughts that the Holy/Pure Spirit impresses upon our minds, not an audible voice, but certainly an understanding of clarity.And this is what was impressed upon my mind,Now you have had just a little taste of how I've been feeling for quite some time now, and even worse, that sadness is mixed with anger, not a good combination ??

And for that matter, Your endless eternal resources from?Well, now for a little while, we are seeing in temporal reality where it is that He does get them from, When ALL diplomatic solutions are exhausted, and the abusers refuse to stop abusing the other life forms amongst them,Then comes unfortunate but necessary war, and from war, comes the spoils of war.The negative part of the universe has the right to exsist, They just don't have the right to abuse, and if they are abusing other life forms, then they shall most certainly be hearing from our Father Love, not us ??We were never meant to know about this garbage, and at the end of the next stage of the perfect plan of salvation for ALL, eventually ?? our Father Love promises to erase ALL the memories of this temporal flesh realm, forever ?It is looking at this temporal nightmare from our Father Love's perspective that gives true peace of mind, looking at it from our own perspective shall surely drive one crazy ??\\"and i would not have ye be ignorant of this one thing brethren, that as a thousand years is unto man, so is as a day is unto Get Over Death (GOD) Almighty our Father Love, and as a day is unto our Father Love, so is as a thousand years is unto man.\\"That works out to 42 temporal flesh years =1 morenatural hour.We are not even here nearly as long as we \\"believe\\" that we are ??","title":"We've all been hijacked"},{"text":"Thats a nice stat in a vacuum, but incumbent parties all over the world lost their chairs.

Jonathan Wilkinson, minister of energy and natural resources, said Canada wanted to co-operate with the US on facing down China but his country would not stand by if the president-elect imposed potentially devastating tariffs on its exports. Wilkinson said retaliatory tariffs would focus on products that would create the greatest amount of angst in the United States with the least amount of pain in Canada  potentially steel from Michigan or orange juice from Florida. Trump, who will be sworn in as US president on Monday, has said he will impose a 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian imports into the US. But Wilkinson said Canada was open to new co-operation with Washington, including potentially buying submarines and other military equipment, and developing more critical mineral projects in Canada that would displace Chinese products from US supply chains, he said. There are opportunities for us to procure a lot of the go-forward military equipment, like the submarines from the United States. And certainly, we are open to that as part of the broader conversation, said Wilkinson in an interview in Washington. A fight over tariffs was a distraction from more pressing issues, he added. The challenge that we face internationally right now, its not Canada-US, its China, said Wilkinson. It has strategic control of a number of different assets, and particularly true of critical minerals. He called for the North American allies to build an energy and minerals security partnership or alliance that actually enables us to both contribute to common outcomes. Last month, Beijing banned the export of several rare earths to the US in an escalation of a technology war. China controls most of the supply chain for rare earths, which are critical inputs for advanced clean energy and defence technologies. Wilkinsons visit to Washington  where he is meeting Republican politicians, industry representatives and other stakeholders  is part of an increasingly frantic lobbying effort by Ottawa to persuade the US president-elect to resist imposing tariffs on Canada, which economists have warned would tip the nations economy into recession. In November, Trump proposed the 25 per cent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, accusing the USs closest neighbours of failing to tackle illegal migration and drug trafficking. The US and Canadian economies are deeply intertwined. Canadas oil industry supplies more than half of US crude imports, and Washington has invested tens of million of dollars in Canadian critical mineral projects in a bid to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. Wilkinson said US tariffs on Canadian imports would hurt US consumers as well as Canadians, pushing up the price of gas and other vital goods. Where are they going to get potash? Where are they going to get uranium? he said. Where are they going to get critical minerals? Are they really going to turn to China? Last week, Trump suggested he could use economic force to annex Canada, saying it would be much better for national security. Wilkinson said Canadians were agitated by the comment, adding that Canada would not become a 51st state. We are a sovereign nation, he said. Our national game is hockey, its not football or baseball. We go to Tim Hortons, we dont go to Dunkin' Donuts, and we have two languages, they are English and French?.?.?.?Canadians have no interest in being Americans.Further readings:https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-critical-minerals-export-canada-us-trump-tariffs/https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/canada-says-it-has-border-under-control-just-ahead-of-trump-inauguration/https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-premiers-trudeau-meeting-trump-tariffs-1.7431085!ping Can","title":"Canada warns of tit-for-tat levies on US products if Trump imposes tariffs"},{"text":"Yup, which means the GOP owns absolutely everything that happens from 1/20/2025 on.","title":"The GOP Is No Longer the Party of National Security | Americas allies and enemies watched as Trumps pick for defense secretary failed to quell concerns about his character and qualifications"},{"text":"Because they dont care.","title":"Trump advisers concede Ukraine peace deal is months away"},{"text":"Let me guess its really just a concept of a plan and it should be ready in two weeks","title":"Trump advisers concede Ukraine peace deal is months away"},{"text":"They have t been in my lifetime (I'm late 30s)","title":"The GOP Is No Longer the Party of National Security | Americas allies and enemies watched as Trumps pick for defense secretary failed to quell concerns about his character and qualifications"},{"text":"That USMCA really not as good as he promised, isn't it.","title":"Donald Trump's return more welcome by US adversaries than allies: poll"},{"text":"Neither, [stay home.](https://www.youtube.com/live/ohFvFuiLSUU?si=9px9pHacXWawBZJ2)","title":"Which hat should I wear to the swearing in ceremony?"},{"text":"I really really really despise this fake blond cult member.

They're the ones who want to come by and talk about last night's game, or their boat, or ANYTHING not work related.

Be it for politics, directing companies or driving your own life, instead of picking metrics to judge things by like an accountant looking at sheets, what is needed is an actual vision for what one wishes, and the drive to pursue it even in spite of metrics and accountants telling you this one metric could be optimised more.","title":"CMV: Result is much more important than the process"},{"text":"Trump seems to be against interventionalism and deficit spending.","title":"Is \\"MAGA\\" and Libertarianism compatible?"},{"text":"Stop using this, when we know it's about trans people.","title":"Why Mike Johnson's fake \\"Jefferson prayer\\" matters:  Replacing facts with phony history is a linchpin of the Christian nationalist movement."},{"text":"He never led a large number of troops.

Instead, Republicans on the committee showed that they would rather elevate an unqualified and unfit nominee to a position of immense responsibility than cross Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or the most ardent Republican voters in their home states. Americas allies should be deeply concerned; Americas enemies, meanwhile, are almost certainly laughing in amazement at their unexpected good fortune.Most of the GOP senators asked questions that had little to do with the defense of the United States and everything to do with the peculiar obsessions that dominate the alternative reality of right-wing television and talk radio, especially the bane of wokeness. Perhaps that was just as well for Hegseth, because the few moments where anything of substance came up did not go well for him. When Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, for example, tried early on to draw Hegseth out with some basic questions about nuclear weapons, he was lost. He tried to fumble his way around to an answer that included harnessing the creativity of Silicon Valley to innovate a future nuclear force  or something.On many other questions, including adherence to the Geneva Conventions, the role of the military in domestic policing, and the obligation to disobey illegal orders, Hegseth fudged and improvised. He seemed aware that he had to avoid sounding extreme while still playing for the only audience that really matters: 50 Republican senators and one former and future president of the United States. His evasions were not particularly clever, but they didnt need to be. He was clear that his two priorities as secretary will be to lead a culture war within the Pentagon, and to do whatever Trump tells him to do....Some Democrats highlighted that Hegseth has never run anything of any significant size, and that his record even in smaller organizations hasnt been particularly impressive. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan pointed out that no board of directors would hire Hegseth as the CEO even of a medium-size company. Other Democrats drilled Hegseth on his personal behavior, including accusations (which he has denied) that he has engaged in sexual assault and alcohol abuse. At one point, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona listed specific incidents, asking Hegseth to confirm or deny them. Each time, Hegseth responded only by saying anonymous smears, which he seems to think is like invoking the Fifth Amendment. Hegseth also said he wasnt perfect, and that hes been redeemed by his faith in Jesus Christ, whose name came up more often than one might expect during a hearing related to national security.Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Army veteran who was wounded during her service in Iraq, brought out a large poster of the Soldiers Creed, emphasizing the insistence on standards and integrity embodied in it. She asked Hegseth how the Defense Department could still demand that service members train and serve at such high standards if the Senate lowered the bar for leading the Pentagon just for him. After she quizzed him on various matters and Hegseth again floundered, she put it simply and directly: Youre not qualified, Mr. Hegseth.Not that any of it mattered to the Republicans on the committee, some of whom took great offense at questions about Hegseths character. Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma tried to turn the tables on his colleagues by asking how many of them had ever voted while drunk or cheated on their spouses, as if that somehow obviated any further fussing about whether a possible secretary of defense was an adulterer or struggles with substance abuse.Unfortunately for Mullin, he doesnt know his Senate history, so Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, helpfully spelled it out for him: If any member of the Senate were nominated to such a position, Reed said, they too would have to answer such questions. And then he added that the late Senator John Tower was in 1989 rejected for the same job Hegseth wantsover accusations of a drinking problem.Deeply disappointing that much of what we saw from this hearing was dodging of questions by the candidate, and attacking those asking the questions by republican members of the committee. None of this dog and pony show indicates in any way that this candidate is qualified or able to lead a major organization such as the DOD, and yet based on a misplaced sense of loyalty to the incoming president it's likely that many senators will still vote to confirm.","title":"The GOP Is No Longer the Party of National Security | Americas allies and enemies watched as Trumps pick for defense secretary failed to quell concerns about his character and qualifications"},{"text":"Here's the thing, no matter how well you manage forests, NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING can stop a fire where fuels are bone dry from drought and driven by 100 mph winds.

Or are lollipops just as addictive?\\nMaybe you should look into how addictive sugar actually is and how terrible American's health is due to its mass  sugar consumption. Nice attempt at a strawman but it isn't even a good point. Sugar is likely more dangerous than isolated nicotine. It is the smoke that is unhealthy for the body. These cigarettes are just as terrible for you regardless of nicotine levels. If nicotine is the problem not cigarettes why not ban all vapes which by average in the United States contain *vastly* higher levels of nicotine than cigarettes. \\n \\nIf you care about your health then yes you should lay off the lollipops.

But let's look at how we got here:The Republicans didn't set this trap. This is the logical outcome of 50 years of immigration policy. The Democrats and Republicans have strung this issue out over decades to use it as political capital.  Just so it's clear:The Biden Admin won a supreme court case that allows immigrants to be detained indefinitely. It has always been this way, but this was the Supreme Court cementing it. So the Democrats fought to keep the power that this law relies on. This law forces illegal immigrants to be detained.Deportation is not considered a criminal matter,  immigration courts have no right to a speedy trial. Immigration court has no right to an attorney. It seems cruel. But at the same time,  the person being detained can voluntarily leave at any time prior to the start of deportation proceedings.  Hence why those things have been held to not apply. Whether you think this is right or wrong.  This is just another one of those things that has ended up this way over decades of both parties running the country and using a special interest issue as a pawn and a sideshow. In the grand scheme of things,  neither party has shown any interest or care in fixing the problems with immigration,  and the 'judicial' system backing it.","title":"Trump Just Laid a Brutal Trap for Dems, and Theyre Walking Into It"},{"text":"Mike Johnson has turned into the lowest form of human being since getting the power of the speakers chair.

Feeding people on dogs/cats would be very expensive as they have been bred for other tasks.  Same with horse - it's very bad meat because they're bred for tasks requiring strength.  Another big problem with eating \\"non-traditional\\" meat stores is they have not been bred to avoid disease.  This is also why \\"wet markets\\" are generally a bad idea.  A lot of your cultural stigma of non-traditional livestock comes from the spreading of disease.  Think about pigs in Islam, Judaism, etc.  God didn't tell someone \\"don't eat pigs\\".  No, people got sick eating pigs and assume it was God being angry.Same is true with dogs and cat.  If someone just goes to an animal shelter, gets some free dogs and eats them, you are taking a big risk compared to livestock raised for the purpose of eating.  Now, if your position is \\"we should raise them to be eaten\\", well that goes back to my first point: they aren't efficient.In the end, like all things, it comes down to money.  We raise/eat that which makes the most profit.  It's also why chicken consumption is increasing while beef consumption has flattened out.  Let me assure you - if raising dogs to be eaten was profitable, there would be McFidos everywhere.","title":"cmv: Eating dogs or cats is not bad."},{"text":"He's gonna switch parties before 2028.","title":"Trump Lavishes Praise on John Fetterman After He Bends the Knee"},{"text":"wasn't there someone on the right that said there was a bloodless coup underway, so long as the left allows it?","title":"Minnesota state House Democrats walk out in effort to block GOP speaker vote"},{"text":"There are better ways to approach the problem.

Which also leads to a in general much more appaling behavior towards animal where hurting and torturing something like a pig is seen as genuinely funny and is treated like squatting a fly.And yes our industries are not perfect, far from it, and meat production on such a scale could be caleld immoral by itself. But one could claim that suffering within this system is a bug not a feature.While in some cultures animals are for example slaughtered or even consumed while still being alive.(And yes I know every animal is alive before being slaughtered, I wanna avoid talking too much about what I mean because it is quite appaling but those who know how for example Donkey or similar flesh is sold on the street in some asian cultures knows what I mean.","title":"cmv: Eating dogs or cats is not bad."},{"text":"Just a snippet:The returning president appears to have an extremely regressive economic program in mind, one that really will effectively redistribute income away from working-class voters to the top and there appears to be a lack of Wall Street heavyweights who could steer him away from his most destructive instills, Krugman said.","title":"Paul Krugman Issues Dire Warning On How 'A Lot' Of Trump Voters Will Be 'Brutally Scammed'"},{"text":"Adding more goverment jobs?","title":"Trump says he will create external revenue service to collect tariff income | Trump administration"},{"text":"Exactly!

The reason they left the Netherlands was because they didn't want to assimilate with Dutch churches. It was for cultural/linguistic reasons; not religious ones. Just to be clear. Religious non conformists were persecuted to some extent by the government (the exact amount varied by time period). While doctrine was a little fuzzier than the post Cromwell Church of England the government was pretty adamant that a traditional church hierarchy with bishops would be followed by all Christians in England. Puritans pretty much all backed local congregations as centers for church governance. As did Scottish Presbyterians (the bishops wars in Scotland were precursors to the English civil war) .  The pilgrims left before Cromwell got rid of the bishops.

This is more than just pragmatic advice. It's to understand that the cultural norms of whatever the scope of your country is.\\nAnd you post seems to be making that point but interestingly you're only applying it in one direction. Someone else said in this comment section \\"Who is pretending only one set of values matters?\\" But I think what you're also concerned about is the double standards within an individual value system. And you could be right, maybe there's a clever defense for this perceived hypocrisy but I don't see it worthwhile to expend energy in finding it. What I'm more interested in is why you seem to disregard potentially very genuine feelings of discomfort or even anger against eating an animal that a person has valued for companionship and sometimes even family.\\nI think what you're frustrated about is when people from the \\"west\\" (I'm only using this term because you used it but the idea of cats and dogs being taboo for consumption is more widespread in other cultures than you think) impress their moral standards on people outside their country when they express disgust or indignation with holier-than-thou style language. And sure, that's fair but this also goes in the other direction for cultural standards that don't exist in the west, which you have saliently noted.?Is it you believe that religious reasons are more noble and hence understandable than what you view as whimsical secular reasons? OK, you're free to hold that opinion.\\nPerhaps you can make an argument about the asymmetric influence of western nations in deciding what's good or not good. But now we've run into a discussion topic much wider in scope than your OP.?\\nI will briefly address your argument that there's no logical difference between eating cats/dogs and other domesticated animals. Someone else already pointed out that it is significantly more energy-inefficient to eat them.?And from an anthropology standpoint could be precisely be one of the reasons why a stigma would develop against eating cats and dogs. Not because there is a stone solid philosophical argument that champions certain forms of life over others, but simply because pragmatic behaviors are rewarded regardless of whether or not they arose from a logical thought process or arbitrary morality. A country that you believe is more tolerant towards the idea of eating dogs most probably was more against it during periods of greater prosperity where companionship becomes value after immediate food needs are addressed.

Pigs are the hardest edge case, but the difference is most strong between cows and chickens versus dogs, cats and horse.* Some domesticated animals provide services to people.  Traditionally a horse served the same purpose as a car.  Cats kill mice and vermin which protects food stores and reduces the spread of disease.  Dogs help people in many of ways, even in modern times they outperform alarm systems, they allow vulnerable people to go for walks in otherwise sketchy situation, they help the blind, and traditionally they help hunt and fight.\\n* other domesticated animals allow people to eat food that they otherwise could not eat.  Cows eat grass which people cannot eat, but people can eat cows.  Chickens eat bugs which are impractical to collect.  Collecting eggs is far easier.Pigs kind of straddle both categories.  But they can eat just about anything, especially scraps and they cannot be trained nearly to the degree dogs can.the cultural norms that control what we do and do not eat, did not evolve randomly.  In India they ostensibly don't eat cows for religious reasons, but the same pragmatic elements are at play there.  Historically they used cows to plow the field.

The key issue isn't about Western vs Eastern values - it's about unnecessary suffering in 2025.You mention factory farming being terrible (and you're absolutely right), but that's actually an argument *against* expanding the range of animals we eat, not for it. As a progressive person, I'm sure you understand that just because something is traditional doesn't make it ethical - we've moved past many harmful cultural practices throughout history.Consider this: dog meat production often involves extremely cruel practices like beating dogs to death because of a belief that adrenaline makes the meat taste better. Moreover, unlike cows or pigs which were specifically domesticated for food over thousands of years, dogs were selectively bred to form emotional bonds with humans. They literally evolved to read our facial expressions and understand our pointing gestures - no other animal can do this naturally.The solution to factory farming isn't to add more species to the list of animals we exploit - it's to reduce animal suffering overall. Instead of saying \\"well, if we eat pigs, we might as well eat dogs too,\\" shouldn't we be working to reduce meat consumption across the board?I get your concern about cultural imperialism, but there's a difference between respecting cultural differences and accepting all practices uncritically. Many Asian activists and organizations are actually fighting against dog meat consumption in their own countries, seeing it as incompatible with modern ethical standards - just like how many progressive Germans oppose traditional practices that cause unnecessary harm.","title":"cmv: Eating dogs or cats is not bad."},{"text":"Hey now he said he's gonna sober up if they give him the job!That counts right?

They're shouted down by the \\"Christians\\" for being too liberal, being \\"brainwashed by the devil\\" for actually abiding what the Bible says. The media doesn't cover the good things they do and give them a voice because doing good works like we're told to do isn't as interesting as the screaming, raving, hateful lunatic \\"Christians\\" who give the media the views and clicks they want.You proved my point. The loudest, most vocal and the most political active have taken over what is Christianity. They are the real Christians at this point. But I guess your answer is to keep going the same way as it's been, because one group is the majority while the other group is the minority, thus, nothing can be done, aside from complain online about how \\"Christians\\" are giving real Christians a bad name. So, the question is now, what is a real Christian and who defines it? however comments like yours aren't the rallying cry you think they areIt's not meant to be a rally cry, it's meant for those trying to make a distinction have a bit of self reflection. There absolutely are real Christians who are trying but what you're arguing is little different than saying that there's no such thing as an \\"American\\" (ie, someone who is not loyal to this country but claims to be) because Americans (no quotes) aren't doing enough.And there you go, saying there's real Christians who are trying. At the same time, there's real Christians who are succeeding in getting rid of public funded lunches, social services, keeping child marriage legal, covering up for child abuse, justifying rape, and so forth. I don't see those who you call real Christians using their Christian identity as a cudgel to make the world a better place like these other real Christians who are trying and succeeding in their goals and objective. And semantics matter.

Across the last hundred years if not more, the left has been staunch defenders of free speech. Even offensive speech. You only need to look at liberal comics like George Carlin and his routine on euphemistic language to see what left wing liberalism should stand for.2. You have a very small and biased sample. As you say yourself universities are hyper partisan, and not representative of 'the left'. The people attending your debates likely represent the extreme end of the left.  3. The 3600 arrests in the UK (where I'm from) came from the conservative government, labour have only been in power for 6 months. This speaks to a larger point, the right still attack free speech. Yes some vocal libertarians defend it, but there are many fundamentalists and extremist who seek to ban books, prevent people from living how they choose, and silence ideas they don't like. It's only whilst they feel their speech is being suppressed they claim to be on the side of free speech.

Theyre held instrumental goods rather than inherent goods, otherwise you would end up in the paradox of tolerance (it is good to tolerate bad things).

Look its me in the centre, all my views are exactly normal and in the middle compared to the extremists left and right of me. You sure about that?  Note: I am not advocating for either side, I am aware that this exists on the right as wellI mean this is literally not true.

Obama energized the base by his message of hope.  Biden's supporters were energized by COVID, the promise to forgive student debt and Trump fatigue (classic anti incumbent sentiment).  Harris largely appealed to older voters and didn't reach younger voters, so they didn't show up.  The message Dems thought would carry the day was simply Trump is bad and then they focused on the organization of a ground game.  Trump sold a message on the economy to economically depressed areas and peppered it with enough racism and misogyny to win the disaffected by telling them what they wanted to hear.  Harris had no counter. Trump gained support in swing districts bc he won on the economy.  The reality here is that Trump understands messaging to the poor disaffected voters. Democrats still seem to be getting all of this wrong, as they think Trump voters went against their own interest.  For example, Democrats are currently saying that Trump's policies will raise prices on foodstuffs bc this is true of the fresh fruits and vegetables their constituents eat that have to be hand picked and/or imported.  Red State Republicans are more likely to eat meat, potatoes and grains.  Guess what is going to decrease in price when Trump decreases oil prices?...\\nTrump decrease oil prices?  Tariffs will slow economic growth by decreasing global demand, reducing oil demand.  At the same time, Trump plans to increase domestic production, bringing more money to oil producing areas (red states).  All this before we account for the decarbonization of Europe.  In effect, Trump will create American jobs in oil producing states in the short term.  So, Trumpers aren't voting against their own interests, they are voting for the message that matches their self interests in oil, agriculture and manufacturing.  All of the other rhetoric is largely self reinforcing bias around their candidate.  The Harris campaign did not have economic messaging of importance to the microeconomic reality of a majority of Americans. While there were lies told, it sure does sound like Trump's oil economy is full steam ahead.","title":"Canada must shut off critical minerals to U.S. to counter Trump: Singh"},{"text":"According to Wikipedia there are only 352 Greenlanders in the USA so less than 1% have decided to move there.","title":"Trump's Greenland plan: US House Republicans seek support for bill on possible purchase"},{"text":"And the shittiest part is that Im sure if trump ever dies his followers are going to insist on years of the most obnoxious inconvenient for everyone forms of public mourning that anyone could ever think of.","title":"Flags to fly at full-staff for inauguration after Trump's complaints"},{"text":"Nobody should be whinging.. ??","title":"Is it time for Europeans to stop whinging and get our house in order? \\"European jitters about Trump 2.0 not shared by much of world, poll finds\\""},{"text":"So why the fuck didn't you release your report earlier and why the fuck did Garland not do anything for 4 years ?

The perspective that philosophy brings to this issue is that outcomes or consequences are *not* entirely in your control. A person can work really hard in a company, really doing great work by many metrics. Then the company goes bankrupt. However, the cause of that can be that, say, some macroeconomic change that the work output by any single employee simply cannot reverse. We can also take less extreme situations. Say a promotion, where it just happened that a really competent guy externally applied to the position you were aiming for, while a less competent colleague happened to get a similar promotion, just because there were no strong external applicants. If we take a process view, focused on your efforts, leads to a certain equanimity in face of these fluctuations in fortune due to no fault of your own. The reason equanimity has benefits is that it allows you to persist in your efforts. Sure, the short-term result was not good, but rather than going home, hug your knees in the shower thinking the world has turned against you, the Stoic perspective is to rather focus on the accomplishments in the domain under your control, that is, your process.Should be noted that this is very similar to the techniques taught in cognitive behavioural therapy. A narrow result focus combined with a bit of neuroticism can make people miserable, but also, make people pursue low-risk efforts, below a persons true potential, because the pain of failure is felt too much.On this last point, results do creep back in to the consideration. The hope is that by *not* becoming too focused on the results of immediate actions and the goal post just up ahead, you, as a moral person, can set your aim at results further up ahead and then simply let the chips fall where they may. In a more theistic frame, we would place our trust in God that the small and bothersome storms in life are not obstacles for the greater purpose we are intended for, whatever that may be. Take this far enough, and the result that counts is what happens after life.What I hope to illustrate is that a process focus can be a mind trick to remove the troubles of short-term losses and discomfort in the accounting of results/outcomes, and thereby set the aim at more important outcomes or pursuits. Results are part of the mix, but less so in terms of day-to-day timescales. I agree this can be taken too far where people become detached for any external guiding principles. Still, on certain timescales and in pursuit of grand enough efforts, process focus grants a person a degree of stability in a variable and random world.","title":"CMV: Result is much more important than the process"},{"text":"Doesn't really matter, truth be told.

I am sure there are some things that both sides can come to agreement on for example I think that anyone convicted of SAing children should be immediately put to death, I think even democrats can agree with that.  If Congress could start with things that they 100% could agree on like that then move onto things that would be more problematic would be a start.  I don't think that inflation or the cost of living are bipartisan issues being as they seem to be things that Congress can't seem to find an answer to, and yes printing money is a problem, but and I agree that both parties have added to the national debt, and I disagree with the current Republicans trying to raise the debt ceiling, though with the current problems in Cali I also understand they need to do so to have money to help.  I agree that BOTH parties need to focus on lowering taxes on working-class people and focus on policies that grow the economy without making it harder to get by. As for Trump, I disagree that his promises are ALL empty.  I'm not saying he was 100% with his promises but he did SOME good, SOME bad.  I hope his 2nd term he does better.  He is qualified for the job, and I agree there could be better choices, heck my wife has never voted but she was going to vote for RFK Jr. but when he dropped out she chose not to vote again because she hated both choices.  You are right that there are many who saw the democrats not having a primary after Biden dropped out as going against their claim to want to \\"save democracy\\".  I feel it was believing that between the 2 actual options his leadership was better than hers.  As for wanting to maintain power rather than serving the people, is questionable being that he did sign the First Step act and even though I disagree with it many people say that it was serving minority communities.  This claim of \\"systemic inequality\\" is part of the problem because it is a lie by democrats to make a victimhood narrative within black communities while causing finger pointing at White people.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"Just like Vance and being Vice President.","title":"Pete Hegseths only qualification for defense secretary is fealty to Trump"},{"text":"Yes Republicans shop at small businesses and tip better (generally, as shown by a study). Actually shopping at small businesses and tipping better absolutely means that they are prioritizing small businesses.  As for a policy level, the best thing that they could do for small businesses would be to get rid of Obamacare (the ACA), and give them greater freedom. The best way to empower workers is to get rid of collective bargaining and allow individuals to value themselves and not have good workers be encumbered by bad workers. I feel that unions, had a time they were needed and there are SOME careers that need them currently however I'm all for people being able to CHOOSE if they want to be part of the union, or not.  I live in Illinois and it is mandatory to be part of a union, they don't help for your first year but they still collect your dues and such because they want to steal your money, and a couple of years ago when there was a problem trying to reach an agreement on contracts people were looking to strike, but the Union didn't have ANY money in the strike fund.  No Unions don't play a role in protecting workers, they steal your money and when they bargain for YOUR contract they put the best workers and the laziest workers in the same group to bargain with the company instead of you getting what YOU are worth, you get what the group is worth on average.  That is the lie that they want you to believe but they were built to protect the lazy and incompetent, for example I was a Firefighter/EMT and there was a firefighter that got a DUI off duty, normally that was a quick way out the door, but the Union got him to keep his job, there were 3 people that came up hot on a UA test again normally easy way to get fired Union got them to keep their jobs.  Protecting people who KNEW the rules and broke them but made sure they kept their jobs that is what unions do.  We need to stop allowing these criminal organizations to allow inferior workers to stay at jobs, or the worst are teachers unions.  The Industrial Revolution was terrible.  It is part of the reason for all the environmental problems that liberals like to complain about.  Doing any job WELL comes with the opportunity for upward mobility.  Again the claim of \\"excluded people of color\\" is a out and out lie.  Race even during times when racism was an actual issue for blacks was far from a barrier look at people like Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis,  Heck the FIRST slave owner in America was a black Man named Anthony Johnson.  The problem is that liberals want to push a narrative that portrays blacks as victims and White people as the transgressor but if you look all the way back into slavery it was one African tribe enslaving another tribe and then selling those slaves to Arab traders who sold them to White Europeans.  Most Whites haven't had great success either no it isn't \\"disingenuous to hold her up as proof that the system works\\"  She is just ONE example of MANY examples of Americas class mobility, and how it is equal to ALL who work hard and have a good idea.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"No, which was part of the problem.","title":"Trump Fumes as Final Jack Smith Report Details 'Series of Criminal Efforts to Retain Power' | \\"But for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the presidency, the office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\\" the report states."},{"text":"Ok long response so I'm taking it bit by bit.  I think that there is an easy response to crime, I think that MAGA just needs to implement it, and that is to actually enforce the laws and be strict with punishments, I feel that Presidnet Trump was too soft on crime in his first term with things like the \\"First Step Act\\", I think he needs to be strict with the laws and this includes immigration.  Take the list of illegals from Obama's DACA and arrest every single one of them and deport them they are here illegally, they have had more than 8 years to become legal citizens kick them out, start making it so that there are no more anchor babies for illegals, get rid of duel citizenship you are either American or you aren't.  Then tell illegals that they get no protections under the law or the Constitution if you are here legally you get full protection but if not GO BACK anything that happens to you happens.  All other crime will be strictly punished no more soft on crime DAs if the DA lets a criminal off easy and they commit another crime the DA is held as an accessory to that crime.  It isn't \\"blaming minorities\\" it is looking at statistics and identifying reality.  If you live in a community that is 87% White and a crime happens guess what the probability is that the person that committed the crime is White, if you look at Murder in the USA and 51.2% are committed by blacks guess what when you find a murder victim you have a good probability that your suspect will be black that isn't blaming that is a statistical reality.  It isn't \\"romanticizing\\" anything it is looking at the world and seeing that when your grandparents (or great grandparents) were in their 20s and 30s they could walk the streets at night and not worry they could leave their doors unlocked or their cars unlocked and not worry about getting broken into.  And there was the fact that family dynamics were better a husband could hold down 1 job, work 40 hours a week with his wife being a stay at home mother and they could afford their lifestyle and still put some money away for saving now we have 2 people working 50+ hours a week just to barely make ends meet.  You claim that this \\"came at the expense of marginalized communities\\" but that isn't true because blacks at the time were actually the fastest improving group within the socioeconomic ladder.  They were able to move from low income to middle class, with ease.  It isn't enough to pretend like things were bad and ignore the reality of the good.  Crime is caused by all kinds of people but as stated if you look at statistics you will see that White collar crime tends to be White people, while 50% of all violent crime is committed by 15% of the population of the USA.  No crime isn't \\"tied to systemic issues\\" that is a liberal lie because if you look at poverty stricken White communities there is less crime in poverty stricken black communities.  Inner cities have a crime problem and interestingly enough if you look at crime it tends to be in democrat run cities even within Republican run states the cities are run by democrats and that is where the greatest amount of crimes are happening.  Part of the issue is this imaginary \\"systemic\\" problem that liberals love to throw out there but yet are incapable of every having an example of a law that says \\"If a black person does this they will be arrested and it will be a crime, but if a White person does the same thing it will not be considered a crime\\" The ONLY cases of systemic racism in America today are Affirmative Action and DEI programs that says because of skin color or gender you gain preferential treatment.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"The Mariana Trench wouldnt reach the depths the GOP is willing to go","title":"Nancy Mace Erupts At Dem In Committee Clash, Asks To Take It Outside"},{"text":"[Fact Check](https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-5466940186)\\n[Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-did-donald-trump-call-republicans-dumbest-voters-us-1824080)\\n[Fact Check](https://www.wtol.com/article/news/verify/donald-trump/did-trump-call-republicans-dumbest-group-of-voters-fact-check/536-360346c6-289c-4644-8e06-ca0dfb580bd9)Theres three different sources for you, all with a quick google search.

Look at Samsung's pivot from pure profit metrics to their \\"New Management\\" philosophy in the 90s - focusing on innovation process rather than quarterly numbers is what transformed them from a budget brand to a global tech leader. Same with how LG completely revamped their corporate culture away from pure results.The problem with fixating on outcomes is that you miss breakthrough opportunities. Some of the most profitable innovations like Post-its or penicillin came from \\"failed\\" experiments. If those researchers were just chasing specific results, they would've scrapped those projects immediately.Plus, the modern workplace is all about adaptation and continuous learning. I work in tech and I've seen countless projects where the final product looked nothing like the initial goal - but the process taught us invaluable lessons that led to even better outcomes. Without this intense focus, we lack the motivation to push through challenges and achieve goals.Actually, research shows that process-oriented people are more resilient when facing setbacks. They see challenges as learning opportunities rather than failures. This mindset is especially crucial in fields with rapid change and innovation.Sure, metrics matter.

That's on Merrick Garland.The indictment was issued in Aug 2023, which is rather fast work considering how many witnesses and co-conspirators were involved.  Jack Smith asked the judge for a trial date of 2 Jan 2024.  The judge pushed it back to 4 March 2024.  Trump's attorneys claim Presidential immunity and the case should be thrown out.  This triggers a cycle of rejection, appeal, rejection, appeal, rejection, appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court which makes an outrageous ruling that Presidents are pretty much immune for almost everything.This corrupt SCOTUS ruling completely upends the original indictment and trial, essentially requiring Smith to refile a new indictment and new charges in Aug 2024.  But by this point, Trump's lawyers and the SCOTUS have interjected delays and stalled enough that the new trial would start after the election.Jack Smith was a diligent professional for his part.  The blame is on Garland for dragging his feet and the Trump-friendly SCOTUS for intentionally choosing the longest legal route when they knew time was of the essence.Edit:  This report is Smith essentially saying \\"my case was rock solid, but our flawed legal system and corrupt courts allowed him to repeatedly delay his way to the WH.\\"","title":"Trump Fumes as Final Jack Smith Report Details 'Series of Criminal Efforts to Retain Power' | \\"But for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the presidency, the office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\\" the report states."},{"text":"I looked up several other sources and they all say 82% of Canadians do not want to become our 51st.state (who would?).

And yes, I'm pretty sure your intention isn't to defend this claim. What's more, Jefferson's letter has been invoked in constitutional jurisprudence and public debate for literally hundreds of years, and it's often to call upon the significance of this separation in protecting the rights of the people, and either from an imposing (governmental) religious authority and/or rule of law, or in the case of the government intervening in the establishment or practice of religion. While some believe it's disingenuous to think that Jefferson viewed this separation as one directional.So in reality, there are significant interpretations of his writings that support the fundamental concept of a separation between church and state. All that being said, even if you want to cite Jefferson's letter this way, there is already more than enough evidence to show that our founders/framers were not advocating for a national religion and/or Christian nationalist state.

Both platforms have become breeding grounds for far right, maga propaganda and misinformation. All the while, more and more Americans are getting their \\"news\\" and information from social media, and especially Trump supporters. This is due, in no small part, to these platforms becoming less moderated, Zuckerberg has even vowed to end Facebook's fact checking program, instead, Facebook will be adopting something similar to Twitter's grossly ineffectual \\"community driven\\" system. Eliminating basic oversight has allowed for dangerous misinformation, propagandistic political messaging and conspiracy theories to run rampant across these sites, while the overseers of these platforms are helping to elevate far right voices and personalities who continuously post whatever clickbait content garners them the most engagement.As a result, these major platforms are intentionally magnifying (and rewarding) the most inflammatory, dishonest, hateful and extremist mouthpieces on social media. Content creators who receive far more engagement and \\"clicks\\" than posters with nuanced points of view or facts-based commentaries.Studies consistently show that the truth is, well, boring in comparison, and algorithms are designed to inundate user's feeds with the most divisive, incendiary, and propagandistic content imaginable. Which means that the more credible and unvarnished the information may be, the more likely it is to be buried beneath this gish gallop of \\"churnalism.\\"It also means that the people managing these social media accounts are encouraged to continue publishing this type of content because it's much more effective at reaching wider audiences. Combine this with the distressing fact that social media users have been desensitized and primed to engage more with online caricatures, internet trolls, political agitators, and clickbaiters, and you've got yourself a recipe for an uninformed electorate.Additionally, Republicans have been making an effort to drive their audiences to these platforms, while encouraging them to distrust most other forms of media, and where they will be more receptive to the propaganda and misinformation that is overrunning social media.It's no wonder conservatives prefer to get their \\"news\\" from places like Facebook and Twitter.Add all this up, and you get a large chunk of the electorate that's incapable of making politically informed decisions, instead, they let their *feelings* dictate their views, and that's what gets someone like Donald Trump elected, *feelings*.So considering this, it's no surprise that Trump wants to cozy up to these social media owners.Take Elon Musk for instance. Since Musk's takeover of Twitter, he has altered the sites algorithms to direct traffic specifically to him, as well as any far-right voices and political agitators willing to pay for the privilege.Musk has also fired thousands of employees, many of them dissenters, which mind you, has caused a number of different problems for the platform.He awards Musk bucks to conservatives who spend most of their time and energy \\"owning the libs\\" and trolling users across the platform.He's also been heavily criticized for censoring voices who publicly disagree with him. Not to mention, he's basically a walking conflict of interest considering the fact that, in exchange for a made up position within Trump's new administration, Musk contributed hundreds of millions of dollars towards Trump's campaign and presidency, and essentially ran election interference and influence for Trump during the election after turning Twitter into a bastion of far right, MAGA propaganda.Trump continues to meet behind closed doors at Mar A Lago with billionaires, tech and finance \\"Bros,\\" and media moguls to ensure that they are on the same page and plan to be in lockstep with the next Trump administration. Some of these people have already promised to contribute millions of dollars towards his presidency. Populism my ass...And keep in mind, it's Trump supporters who continue to whine about Democrats being in \\"cahoots\\" with \\"big tech\\" and the media.This was never about \\"free speech,\\" it has always been about conservatives wanting a controlled mass media for *themselves.* It's about them interpreting \\"free speech\\" as being entitled to say whatever they want, wherever they want, and however they'd like without any consequences what so ever. It's about their *feelings*.It's about being free from criticism and accountability, and about them being able to control the narrative at all times.And it all stems from the fundamental notion that they are *owed* these things, that they are the dominant and supreme authority, and as a result, only *they* are entitled to the god-given rights and freedoms afforded to them in the Constitution, only *they* are entitled to privileges, ownership and control.","title":"Musk, Zuckerberg and Bezos will have ringside seats for Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"ok, thanks for clarification!","title":"Gavin Newsom and California Democrats reach $50M deal to Trump-proof the state"},{"text":"Im good.

It was a promise that the government would never try to force censure of religious ideals.\\nJefferson often rallied citizens to the cause of revolution by warning folks Monarchies had a habit of taking over religions and changing them to fit their end goals. The establishment of the Church of England, the puritans leaving England to escape the Crown from changing their religious practices, etc.\\nBenjamin Franklin, during the Constitutional Convention, called for daily prayers, asking for God to guide them\\nThe Chruch and State issue was argued for days on end. Madison was the only one to bring up the idea of complete seperation being outlined in the Constitution, as he feared religion taking over government. \\nJefferson realized complete seperation would anger religious leaders, who's backing was extremely important to the Revolution.

Something isn't working and they need to work on what worked with Biden but didn't work with Harris. She was on his ticket when he won, but when she got her own ticket she lost. She was an unpopular primary candidate, she wasn't even a top contender despite how prevalent she was in the primaries in 2020. Democrats need an Obama, bottom line. Someone inspiring to find America again.

They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or churchThere is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts.For Christ's sake, and quite literally, even Jesus believed in the separation of church and state Mark 12:17, Jesus said to them, *\\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\\"*Our founding fathers staunchly opposed the union between religion and government.In fact, some of them were considered deists, rejecting the idea of a divine hand meddling in our affairs, and emphasizing the importance of rationality, intellect and observation in understanding nature and governing society. Thomas Jefferson coined the phrase \\"*a wall of separation between church and state\\"* in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association. Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was later quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878, and was famously referenced in the Supreme Court Case, Everson v. Board of Education, which interpreted the First amendment's establishment clause as intending to erect that \\"wall of separation.\\"Jefferson's writings have been referenced in a series of important legal cases and public debates throughout our history. His famous words are often invoked to stress the importance of how this separation protects the rights of the people, whether from a governing religious authority, or in the case of guarding one's religious practice from government intervention.Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for *\\"a wall or hedge of separation\\"* between *\\"the wilderness of the world\\"* and *\\"the garden of the church.\\"*There you have it, an early American statesman and minister, and a profound authority on the matter, acknowledging the need for this separation. James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's \\"doctrine of two kingdoms\\", as a conception of the separation of church and state.During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended *\\"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\\"*In his writings years later he documented his support for the *\\"total separation of the church from the state.\\"**\\"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States\\",* Madison wrote, and he declared, *\\"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution...\\"*John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, \\"A Letter Concerning Toleration,\\" Locke argued that, *\\"ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate'\\"*Even George Washington supported this separation.George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated *You will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.*That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, *If I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure  no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.\\"*As for a more recent example, even John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, *\\"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute\\"*Furthermore, *\\"One Nation under God\\"* wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, red, white, and blue bleeding Christian \\"patriot\\" for that matter.The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of the *Youth's Companion*, an American Children's Magazine.Francis Bellamy a Christian SOCIALIST, who *\\"championed 'the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources, which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus.\\"* worked for the magazine and drafted the \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas, a marketing gimmick. Bellamy *\\"believed in the absolute separation of church and state\\"* and purposefully did not include the phrase *\\"under God\\"* in his pledge.What's more, Bellamy *\\"viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.\\"*Additionally, *\\"In God we trust\\"* wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the big bad atheist communists of the Soviet Union.And all of that aside, I shouldn't have to remind conservatives that our very first amendment prohibits the government from *\\"respecting an establishment of religion\\"*. While the Supreme Court has expanded on this clause, not only invoking the words of our framers to settle the debate, but also by establishing three basic rules that must be followed in order to not violate the clause.Government actions:- must have a secular purpose\\n- must not promote or inhibit religion\\n- must not create excessive entanglement between the church and state The fact of the matter is, Christian nationalism has never been and never will be a foundational code for this country, its government or its laws. Remember that it was the biblical literalists in the south who vocally defended slavery and inflamed the sectional conflict. A time when our nation was divided more than it's ever been.It *is* self evident, that in the United States of America, religion has no place in government, and vice versa.","title":"Why Mike Johnson's fake \\"Jefferson prayer\\" matters:  Replacing facts with phony history is a linchpin of the Christian nationalist movement."},{"text":"You turned 18 and could!","title":"Iowa GOP leaders oppose legalizing cannabis to fill shortfalls from tax cuts"},{"text":"Republicans don't reward their leaders for being good at governing.

And this is my take on Christianity and or God;I truly believe that we come to this world to suffer and go through pain.Various religious beliefs, such as Buddhism, or Ancient Greek Paganism, believed that we lived in a fallen world, and that the world was in fact suffering, which I find so fascinating as bad things do happen in the world, and yet we believe that God created a perfect world....correct?Well...God did create a perfect world, and he created a world where we could have FREE WILL. We can affect the world and others, both good and bad. One could say that God created a world without suffering; but we chose rebellion. But I think the point of us coming here was to experience pain.God is all knowing, I believe that he KNEW that we would choose rebellion and turn this world into a place of suffering. Yet he allowed us to do it.....why? Free will was a big reason. Yet I think that we were meant to come here and suffer and experience bad things and that this was part of his PLAN.So why would he want this? Pain helps us grow. Pain makes us more understanding. Experiencing sad things and pain makes people more caring and understanding; which is not the same as being weak. If the goal is to love our neighbor, we need to feel the pain that they felt, and it helps us come together. It creates compassion.By seeing how awful things are, we want to work together and help each other so that others don't have to feel that pain. By doing this, we are closer to being in sync with the divines. We are closer to achieving the levels of love and compassion that God has.Yet unfortunately....I don't think that everyone is going to make it. Meaning that some people experience this pain....and it turns their hearts dark, it makes them bitter and they are angry at the world and everything. I'm afraid many are like that. Pain can help you grow; and turn you against yourself as well. I don't want anyone to go to hell but I'm afraid that people don't want to be with God.The message is; don't let yourself become bitter. We will all experience tragedy; but it's to tear us down and build us back up to (ideally) be the way that God wants us to be.  \\nSometimes we can't help ourselves no matter how hard we try and we need the love of God and the Divines and even the love of others to help us get through these tough times. You explaining your troubles to me makes me feel horrible that I get depressed sometimes when my life isn't nearly as bad as yours and I'm grateful to not be in such a horrible circumstance. This I believe is the human understanding and discourse that we all need.","title":"We've all been hijacked"},{"text":"Hes going to try to stay longer than four years","title":"Even with a second chance, Trump is unable to carry out an orderly presidential transition"},{"text":"held hostage by the tax dollars it generates for Red Welfare States","title":"Mike Rounds says tying debt limit to California aid 'not meant as a penalty'"},{"text":"Do you actually want change or do you intend to just impede the democratic party everytime they can't stop a literal war for you?","title":"Seeing Arab and Muslim Americans celebrate a potential ceasefire in Gaza as proof they were right to back Trump.

There might be a few  womens basketball programs too.You get into smaller schools, D2, D3 schools none of them are self funding.

He has more money than he could ever spendto fix the system just so it benefits him further is insanity. The problem with these takes is they just assume every billionaire is this money-obsessed psychopath. Very often you dont get to that kind of a level by being driven primarily just by the pursuit of capital, you have other intrinsic and ideological motivations that influence you. Making a billion dollars is a lot of hard work and these kinds of pursuits always fail if the motivation is shallow and vapid. If most of these billionaires primarily cared about money they would all stop well before they reach a billion dollars. Theyd go into early retirement and live a life of luxury, clearly they are driven by other factors. If you follow Elons actions these past few years its blatantly obvious to anyone doing a proper analysis that hes willing to lose capital and reputation in order to pursue his ideology, which happens to align well with American values. Give him a fucking chance to do something and maybe youll be pleasantly surprised. This anti-Elon sentiment in this sub lately seems like a psi op to dredge up negative sentiment. The old regime of the government is panicking because they know their system is about to be deconstructed. If you really think Elon is the enemy then you must think the status quo government beurocracy that hasnt been working properly for decades is somehow good for the American people. Its clearly not, so maybe you should think carefully before aligning yourself against the one person that actually has the ability to change this.","title":"The billionaire class has tricked the average worker"},{"text":"Thats probably to me, one of the most disturbing parts of this whole legal saga is basically the discovery that Republicans have been stacking courts and acquiring judges and attorneys because they know many of their ideas would never survive a popular vote.

The current psychiatric consensus on addressing gender dysphoria in most cases is to allow the individual to transition to the gender that The individual best feels corresponds to them. It is an indisputable fact that in all metrics of their quality of life, things improve for those individuals. Regret rates are low enough to be irrelevant and not really discussed, because there is no such thing as complete, total absolutes in life. Conservatives always complain about this for everything. Is something isn't 100% successful and doesn't 100% accomplish the goal they want to achieve, such as vaccine effectiveness, etc, they think that it needs to be banned or discouraged.That being said, if conservatives are against gender affirming care in a therapeutic setting with a counselor, are against puberty blockers, hormones, and bodily surgeries, the burden of proof is on CONSERVATIVES to provide a step-by-step methodology in a psychiatric setting that will allow a person with gender dysphoria to be able to realize they are the sex that they were born as, to be happy to accept it.If any conservative in this comment section has the balls enough to answer me, provide me an empirical, data driven, successful methodology that addresses gender dysphoria with similar or higher success rates that allows a person to accept their born birth sex and to live as that gender.If you can't do this and aren't able to provide a solution, frankly you need to sit down and shut the fuck up. Provide some real solutions, or quit your bitching and complaining.","title":"House Republicans pass bill to ban trans women and girls from school sports"},{"text":"I thought republicans were against handouts","title":"Republican senator previously seen as a roadblock to Pete Hegseth's nomination says she'll back him to lead the Pentagon"},{"text":"When is someone in the media going to call out the blatant mental illness afflicting several Republicans.

Women communicate differently than men, their relationships with other women and with men are different than how a man views and regards relationships.  Example, when women talk to each other they often do so face to face, but often their conversations stay more along the lines of superficial small talk.  Men prefer each other shoulder to shoulder, although given some time and space, their conversations can become very deep and thoughtful.
