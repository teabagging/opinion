Generally, he was fairly well regarded in Eastern Canada and BC up until a few years ago when things started to slide. There is very little actual legislation that was passed to draw this ire, but there has been a concerted hate campaign from ultra-right-wing sources. Unfortunately the Liberals didn't really do a lot to undermine those mostly inaccurate attacks and that is on them.Some of the things that did cause issues were a relatively poor immigration policy. Now, I don't claim to have a better plan but our TFW program and immigration system in general was pretty good at flooding the labour market with cheap immigrant labour and did little to foster high talent immigration. I am a pretty progressive individual that tries actively to combat my own internal biases. However, I also hire professionals into a scientific field and can honestly say that in the last 4 years I've hired 8 people into roles. 6 of them were recent immigrants and 4 of those proved inadequately prepared and had obviously lied on their resumes. People that said they had 8-15 years of related experience overseas and degrees in the field. All of those were handily out performed by the two new-grads straight out of university that I hired. This is a pattern that can understandably (but not CORRECTLY) lead to the reinforcement of racist opinions on immigrants.This was all exacerbated by rampant housing inflation. A lot of blame is put on immigrants because it's easy to blame an external force. But I think a lot of this is the free market failing us in a way we don't want to address. Housing starts have not kept up with population growth in most major Canadian cities. And the ones that are started are often a poor match for the demographic of buyer. I live in Calgary. The amount of 1 bedroom and studio condos built in our downtown core is fucking ludicrous. They allow the maximum profit from the developer and are attractive to people looking for \\"investment\\" properties. But I don't know a single person who would want to make a 1 bedroom apartment their primary residence for more than a few years in their early adult life. Once a person finds a partner, having that second bedroom becomes a necessity even just as an office space. So, prices on places big enough to actually live in start to climb.\\nTrudeau's Liberals have also made some questionable attacks against certain demographics that were stupid. I am all for gun control. However, the blanket bans of certain firearms in 2020 and 2024 without a plan to actually reimburse the gun owners was dumb. Particularly because all evidence points to illegal firearms out of the US being a much bigger issue. And those are already illegal. I think it was an effort to appease some uninformed Liberal voters in their core voting districts. But if we're going to be realistic, it isn't like those voters are going to suddenly flip blue or orange without the poorly thought out legislation. I would whole-heartedly support evidence based legislation that forces the RCMP and other federally empowered law enforcement agencies to actually enforce our gun laws. Maybe even better funding for the CBSA to catch them at the borders. Though there is political headwind there as many guns are smuggled through First Nations that border the US. And that whole thing is another political bombshell.On one hand, First Nations peoples have been treated like absolute garbage by every government back to the days of original British/French colonization. More should be done to address the systemic issues that keep First Nations people disproportionately in poverty.On the other hand, enforcement of laws within reservations particularly around drugs and firearms smuggling has been abysmal and has led to issues both inside First Nations communities as well as broadly across Canada. I do not envy a person or party that tries to tackle this particular hot potato.Carbon Tax legislation is another area where Trudeau and the Liberals have done the right thing, but done such a piss-poor job of communicating how it actually works that it has come back around to bite them in the ass. Carbon taxes DO WORK. The way the Canadian version works is actually relatively progressive in that most people up to around $150,000 in income will see a net benefit from the tax in the form of rebates. However, talk to the average Canadian and most will have no idea that they get a rebate. I don't know how they don't notice that quarterly deposit into their bank account, but apparently very few do. Maybe people don't file taxes?This all adds up to a government with broadly fine if not great legislative history being poor at handling misinformation campaigns against them as well as being terrible at actually explaining their policy decisions. This is all taking place in a world where social progressivism is being targeted by bad actors. Canada, like Germany, the USA, France etc. is currently dealing with a resurgence of populist right wing authoritarianism that is feeding on the weakening of the global economy and a stagnation in quality of life.In short, it's a mess. The only political party in Canada that seemingly wants to try some new things is the NDP but \\"socialism\\" has become a curse word in modern times so we're going to go from a socially progressive, fiscally conservative Liberal party to a socially conservative, fiscally irresponsible Conservative one.","title":"Trudeau has resigned under political pressure and threats of tariffs from Trump"},{"text":"Very unlikely I think, Reagan won 2 landslides and then had his successor win in another landslide and succeeded in totally transforming the American economy despite never actually controlling the House.

In some ways for the better and in others for the worse. Having self value and standards is good that the changes around that needed to happen. Feminism, when its about men and women being equals, having/respecting boundaries, getting consent every time, basically all of the points about men and women both being humans and deserving of respect and equality isnt the problem. Sure those parts made it so a handful of shit bags couldnt get someone but if the opposite gender literally being treated as less than is what it takes for you to have a partner then nobody really cares if youre lonely. You have to remember that not every single member of a group is rational and reasonable. Extremists exist within every group, feminists and mens rights included. Think of kill all men and your body my choice. Both of those statements are coming from the respective groups even if its only a tiny minority of the group that thinks that way. If extremist views are regulated within the group before they get out or wildly condemned by a huge majority of the group when they get out then that message is attached to the group.So with all that in mind heres my breakdown on the negative side, feminism was largely the driving force that told men the way theyd approached women was wrong and women would let you know while simultaneously telling women that if a man wants you then hell make an effort to get you, which is a problem because youre telling both sides that they should wait until the other makes the first move. This helped lead to the stalemate that is modern dating where nobody is willing to shoot their shot and make the first move.Then on a more individual level which Ive seen with a couple friends and more so in the younger generations of men in my family and their friends. A lot of men are terrified of being accused of something because of the potential social consequences coming just off the accusation with no proof. Not saying that happens all the time but it does happen and the consequences are so severe that some men dont view the risk vs reward as worth it. Its not like those men dont want relationships, a lot of them desperately want the relationship. Its just that some people took the phrase believe all women way too literally and the results of those cases scared the living hell out of a lot of guys.In short, some very vocal extremist feminists that make up a minority of feminists made a big impact on a lot of men because they got their way a few times to the extreme detriment of the men in involved. Thats how feminism helped create the male loneliness epidemic.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"What's it like to be that ridiculous?","title":"Nancy Mace Mocked for Suggesting Dems Will Try to 'Steal Election from Trump' Despite Peaceful Certification: 'Drama Queen'"},{"text":"\\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/aoc-loses-bid-for-top-oversight-committee-seat-after-nancy-pelosi-schemed-against-her/You are not on the left.","title":"Donald Trump Is Building a New Army of Foot Soldiers | Neo-Nazis and white nationalists have been emboldened by Trumps reelection."},{"text":"Yeah.

The moderators on the women's forums are incredibly dogmatic and incredibly intolerant of any pushback on that dogmatism.  This is not true on the men's forums, and therefore, the women's forums end up being an indiscriminate cheering section for whatever \\"women first\\" point is being made, regardless of whether that point is genuine or self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing, or outright bigoted.  The men's forum, while it contains a great deal of truly offensive and stupid crap will often have better discussions because a diversity of opinion is tolerated.  \\n2.  There is a nasty smugness to many of the commenters (and moderators), especially on the women's forums.  While women certainly don't hold a monopoly on nastiness and abusive behavior and rhetoric, it's very clear that these people are using \\"oppression\\" as justification for their own bad behavior and lazy bigotry and feel quite confident that it provides them with a blanket get-out-of-jail free card on those fronts.   There's also a self-indulgent conceit that of course they aren't being bigots or assholes, because they are women and \\"oppressed.\\"  I'm using \\"\\" around oppressed not because I'm dismissing problems that women have in our society, but because, in these situations, I think those very real problems and issues are being coopted to justify bad behavior, and I take issue with that.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Be emboldened.

If a man is talking about his struggles in life, and one of his struggles is that he lost a custody battle for his kids in court to his ex-wife, that is a part of his story that needs to be addressed. Our entire legal system is overwhelmingly biased towards women. Women get lesser punishments than men for commiting the same crimes and they typically win custody/alimony disputes in divorce court. If I'm trying to workout in the gym and I'm uncomfortable because a woman is filming a video next to me why would you call that a petty issue? If it were the other way around would you still call it petty? If a guy were filming you in the gym without your consent and posting videos making fun of you then you wouldn't be upset? You have some serious internalized misandry that you need to address. You don't even realize that you're being hypocritical and brushing off men's issues. As for your point about therapy, the reason that men don't go to therapy is because the entire industry is extremely gynocentric. What I mean by that is that when men go to therapists to talk about their issues their problems get brushed off by the therapist just like how you are brushing off men's issues right now. The entire system of diagnosis and education is focused on helping women. So when men go to get mental help they feel that it is a waste of time and energy because the education and training that the mental health professionals received is not applicable to the problems that men are facing. For example, many men have body image issues. They take steroids and take protein supplements and eat carnivore diets all in an attempt to get their bodies to look like Wolverine's or Superman's or Captain America's. However, when they go to a therapist to talk about these body image issues the therapists act like there is no problem at all. Why is that? Because the therapists' education and training prepared them for female body image issues not male body image issues. They associate body image issues with bulimia or anorexia. Teenage girls starving themselves to look skinny. They are completely unprepared to help men with the male version of body image issues. So a male who goes to therapy for this issue will just be wasting his time. That is why men do not typically go to therapy. Because therapists are unhelpful for most of the problems that men face.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"There's no such thing as international law as between nations.

In that same year, there were 48k suicides in the USA. So, 9800 suicides were women, and 38 000 were men. Now, all death is bad.

Trump claimed credit for capping Medicares out-of-pocket expenditures for insulin at $35 per month when he did not. It was Biden who achieved that. To this day I doubt Trump understands that. The upside to Trumps narcissistic personality disorder is that he can con himself, or be conned by others, into believing whatever reality most pleases him.

The whole gender pay gap has literally been proven false ages ago!!! So the fact that you even bring it up, regardless to the fact of whether you want equal or better pay, literally just proves my point!!!You don't even understand that some of your own talking points are irrelevant and that's a big problem, but it's what a lot of feminists want. They want to keep perpetuating lies and false statistics that make it seem like they have it far worse than it actually is...And no, most feminists are not fighting for equality. If that were the case then Why do feminsts vote for things that are blatantly misandrist and sexist. If you wanted equality you would actually care and try to change that fact that only men can be drafted and never a women.Women talk about body Autonomy all the time when it comes to thing like clothing/sex/pregnancy etc, but I have never heard a women ever discuss how men have the right to zero body autonomy when it comes to drafting. Last time I checked being forced to do to war is much worse then being forced to give birth to a child. Both are terrible, but the former is objectively far worse!How about all the different types of grants/scholarships/work opportunities that are specifically only available to women and not men.

In what world is it factually correct of even a little appropriate to say such BS! The answer is none!Listen, I am not trying to say that all feminists are bad/wrong or that feminism hasn't achieved positive things for women and society of a whole. However what I am saying is that a lot of feminism has turned quite toxic and it has long gone from trying to achieve equality. A lot of feminists want to be on top instead of equal footing.

They're controlled opposition, because they have to cater to the capitalist class the same way republicans do. But since republicans run on helping the capitalist class and de-regulating and lowering taxes, they don't have to play this two faced game, they just satisfy their base with right wing social views. Meanwhile democrats have to pretend to have center-left ish economic views but can't actually push for anything substantial and significant because everything that'd actually benefit the people are anti capitalist class/big business - socialized healthcare, raising taxes, more social and welfare programs, public housing, etc etc. So the democrats have to pretend they wanna do this stuff, but come up with lame reasons they cant do it, like having a \\"rotating villain\\" like Joe Lieberman then Joe Manshin and Christen Sinema and be like \\"awww shucks sorry guys I guess we just dont have the votes oh well, vote blue no matter who harder next time and maybe just maybe\\".  Democrats hate having to play this pretend game, and people wisen up to it over time, what the democrats hate more than anything is actually having a majority but then having to find elaborate ways to tell the people they cant actually do these super popular policies that they campaigned on. Had anyone even heard of a senate parliamentarian before? They could just replace that person, you think republicans would let that shit get in the way of their agenda?  So the democrats prefer to lose, so they can just sit back and criticize the republicans, and also fundraise off it. Its much more lucrative to fundraise off \\"guys we need to save democracy donate to us so we can win next time\\", and they don't have to be responsible for their inactivity either. They can virtue single all they want and act super progressive, criticizing the republicans for kids in cages only to continue that policy but give it a different name later. The true purpose of the democratic party is to be a bulwark against an actual leftist movement in this country developing. Their purpose is to squash actual grasssroots social movements or to integrate and neuter them, and disallow people like Bernie and others to establish a viable alternative in this country. Hell, funny enough, the republicans dont have a super-delegates system that basically allows them a last ditch way to make someone running against them in the primaries lose, democrats do, to stop a leftist from becoming their nominee, because thats the actual threat to capitalist system, not someone like trump taking over the republicans.","title":"Democrats blame Merrick Garland slow-rolling Trump investigation for election loss: 'Fatal mistake'"},{"text":"I think the prevailing thought among Republicans and Democrats was that Trump would just fade into obscurity and that prosecuting him would just keep his name in the news and add to his relevancy.

The EU has one, the Gulf countries have one, Africa is considering one, Asia is considering one. There is no reason for Canadians to be wasting money on currency conversion fees and import duties. Have actual free trade with our largest trading partner.It would give Canada most of the positive economic benefits of closer integration with the USA without the negative political implications. Make it as easy as possible for Canadians to trade with Americans. Canada would adopt the USD and eliminate all existing trade protectionism with the USA. Many Canadians already invest in USD or their work already pays them in USD. Most Americans never deal with CAD and as a result will never buy from Canada even when the dollar is in their favor, in addition to fear of import duties.It would save Canadian consumers and businesses tons of money by transforming cross-border trade. No more import duties, brokerage fees, currency conversion fees to banks, payment processors, and credit card companies. Consumers could buy things at the best price available.The current free trade agreement between Canada and the USA doesn't benefit consumers much and remains sub-par for businesses because it misses the bigger picture: it's impractical for Canadians to buy anything from the USA, and similarly for Americans to buy from Canadians.If a Canadian wants to sell something, there are limited buyers in Canada because of a small population but there are tons of buyers in the USA. Americans are generally going to be hesitant to buy because if you list in Canadian dollars, they will think the price is too high (most won't think of adjusting to USD even if it's in their advantage). Americans also don't want to bother paying import duties and could just as well buy from an American with no import duties.If a Canadian wants to buy something, they can find all sorts of great deals in the USA, but most of the time it won't make sense when considering import duties, brokerage fees, and currency conversion fees.An economic union could be a big win-win for businesses and consumers, and much more realistic too.","title":"Trump proposes merger of U.S. and Canada amid Trudeau's resignation"},{"text":" America does feel the same way about the Carbinian colonies.Does it?

The child support system in itself isnt petty and definitely has flaws but I was talking about the MRAs who complain about paying child support in general. If youre not there in the household to support the child and only see the kid on weekends, you should definitely be helping the primary parent pay for the expenses involving the child such as clothes, school supplies, doctor visits etc. Women who arent primary parents are required to pay child support as well, as they should. Do you know how many men commit suicide over alimony and bad breakups? How many men are thrown in jail because they cant pay their child support payments?Yes and thats an issue, but the root of the issue is more complex than that. Men and women both commit suicide over bad breakups and alimony. If a man gets primary custody, the woman pays it. If a woman gets primary custody, she pays it. And the parent who has the kid most of the time, whether it be mom or dad, is paying way more expenses for that kid than the person paying child support is. Food, clothes, doctor visits, stuff for school projects, treats, bedding, toilet paper, everything. And in most cases men or women are in jail for child support if theyve went 3+ months without paying which of course is unacceptable. Being a single parent and paying for all of those expenses is hard. And suicide rates could be prevented if men were more encouraged to go to therapy, but there are alpha men out there like Andrew Tate and Elon Musk who are literally telling these men who are struggling to not go to therapy because it makes them weak.

And even then, guys wouldn't mind so much if the female character wasn't often a man-hating misandrist in the role or a male character in female skin.Frankly, I struggle to think of a single media property that would fit this definition, it looks like some imagined strawman.And even if we put that aside, when it comes to custody battles, the judges typically default to giving custody to the mothers, even though the law is officially neutral. Oftentimes, it doesn't matter if the mother is a crackhead and the father is a productive member of society - 9 times out of 10, the child's still going to the mother.A key element you forgot to mention here is that the judges default to that, because the man doesn't want the children, and does not file for custody. In the event that men do contest custody, the standard trends towards equal custody. In the event that men contest custody, and the woman accuses the man of abuse (especially child abuse), the chance of children being awarded to the father **increase**.

There is no clear defined feminism or \\"men loneliness\\" movement. They are not even movements if we stick to the actual definition - sure, there are groups that push each seperate agenda, and we could call these actually organized groups as movements. Movements have to be loosely organized - commenting on social media doesnt make you part of a \\"movement,\\" it just make you part of a particular narrative imo.Hence your position is so vague it cant be reasonably argued, for or against. Is 4B movement part of the feminism movement? Are they two separate movements or they are one movement and two movements simultaneously? We dont need to label people talking about issues as \\"movements.\\"Its making any discussion extremely difficult, because now we arent talking just about a specific issue(s), we are talking about all the issues that we associate with that specific labeled group of people. Not only we can have widely different understandings on what group of people this is, its also basically impossible to determine what all the other issues are, yet we are making them part of the conversation, further obfuscating it.EDIT: Just to add to the idea to the definition of movements - in the past, before internet, people actually had to get together, connect, discuss. In the same vein, organizing on internet (chats, groups etc.) where people have actual sustained contact with each other and talk about actions make these individuals part of a movement. But leaving a comment, filming a tiktok, without actually engaging with the same group of people over a sustained period of time on this issue, in other words actually organizing, doesnt make you part of a movement. Otherwise voicing any opinion on the internet would make you part of some movement, at which point that word truly becomes completely meaningless.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"About time Canada gets rid of that WEF puppet.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxJ1wPnkk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxJ1wPnkk4)","title":"A dark era in Canadian history is finally coming to an end."},{"text":"Yea, but he had the opportunity to change the sheets and kick the bed shitter out , but he felt it was more important to have the bed shitter and his friends like him.

Men discussing their struggles with loneliness, mental health, or systemic inequalities isnt an attack on womens rightsits an attempt to address real issues. Dismissing these concerns as derailments or petty complaints reveals the very bias you claim to oppose.Male loneliness is a crisis tied to shifting societal roles, declining community, and stigma around vulnerability. Feminism rightly critiques toxic masculinity, but it often stops short of offering men meaningful alternatives, leaving them isolated. Ignoring their struggles while demanding unconditional support for feminist causes fuels resentment and deepens the very gender wars you decry.The fact that some trolls weaponize male issues online doesnt invalidate the broader conversation. Mens suicide rates, mental health crises, and custody inequities arent pettytheyre systemic failures. Dismissing these concerns as whining only perpetuates the divide.

This is obviously upsetting and not a good thing, but I really dont see why a lot of men (and some women too) will always bring up things like what about the male loneliness epidemic or men have it worse when someone brings up how women and girls all over the country are losing their reproductive freedom, stuck raising children on their own financially struggling and not getting a penny of child support, walking home at night in fear, being sexually harassed in the work place and dealing with your body my choice remarks from conservative men. Or if theres any post on social media at all that is about empowering women or glorifying the womens rights movement, theres always people in the comments or stitching the video to talk about how men somehow have it worse because of the loneliness epidemic and a woman didnt have the right to vote, a man in WW1 didnt have the right to keep his life, big deal as if that excuses anything. Well, I think part of it is that a lot of these ideas are BS or partially BS. For every woman not receiving proper child support, there is probably a dude who is getting financially skewered in the same situation. Walking alone at night in fear is, statistically, something men should be more affected than women. How many peope are actually saying \\"your body my choice\\" unironically, outside toxic internet spaces? I think their is a lot of misinformation out there, and we live in a cultural climate that discourages questioning things openly. But even that isn't enough to stop some people reacting to instances of propaganda and fear-mongering with equally stupid and needless counterpoint. Basically, what I'm saying is that you're presuming the shit they are reacting to is positive and that it should have been put out there in the first place. A lot of it isn't and shouldn't. Also there are things like a mens right movement happening, which isnt bad in itself, but a large portion of the so called activists are just straight up misogynistic in the way they talk. They start out speaking of important things like male loneliness, suicide rates and mental health but they they slide into talking about petty things like women having lead roles in movies, women filming at the gym, how unfair child support is etc. I just dont understand why the male loneliness epidemic or other male issues should be used to somehow downplay feminism MRA, like feminism, is an ideological movement. Neither are going to be perfect, especially in terms of the sorts of people they draw. You do realize there are a multitude of self-descfibed feminists out there who are quite misandrist, right? The typical response is the classic no true scotsman argument; those misandrist individuals are not actually feminists. Like there is some code or judge to determine, objectively l, what \\"real\\" feminism is.

My own experience/belief is that this really messes with vulnerable people, but does little to actually pull down the people who could be pulled down a notch or two.

When most of the time all the man did was offer to help or happen to look in their direction. Child support equality has also been an issue going so far as women claiming and receiving child support when the child lives with the father. Child support fairness is starting to get better but its still an issue. A large portion of so called feminists activists are just misandristic in the way they talk. Theres bad people on both sides and unfortunately they get most of the attention. Both of these groups are about the equality of the sexes, comparison is inevitable. The comparison of the right to vote and being drafted for war is extremely valid, as originally signing up for the draft was a requirement for voting. Some comparisons arent as valid like male loneliness to reproductive rights. However, when either side generalizes to say women or men have it worse, which often happens, any comparison is valid. At the end of the day someone concerned with equality shouldnt perceive a complaint/issue from the other side as harmful, just as another aspect that needs improvement.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"That article was published three months ago.

Who stand by abusers because they claim to believe in feminist values, and shout down others who actually do things to keep women safe. Likewise, the Andrew Tate, male grifter online personality is also awful and doesnt help. Plenty of men dont actually hate women or need a woman to be their slave pretty much. They just feel alienated in the current society where male spaces are torn down in the name of inclusion, yet female spaces are built up in the name of empowerment. Men are far less likely to get custody. Less likely to initiate divorce, and more likely to have to pay alimony after divorce. Less men are graduating from college. The patriarchy has become a boogeyman to blame men for the problems men and women face, at a time when people are pushing back on the people of x group before you did abc bad things, so members of x group should be held responsible todayThe problem of mens rights/male loneliness is largely a result of the liberation brought on by the feminist movement where women dont need to rely on a man anymore. And the subsequent male loneliness epidemic is from part of society not adapting to feminisms liberation as a whole, as well as societys broader issue of coming to a conclusion and finding evidence that supports it, rather than asking questions to find answers and then come to a conclusion.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Like Mitch McConnells sis in law","title":"The CIA murdered Anne Heche"},{"text":" If we have 1:1 men and women equally, we have to support equally.\\nWhich is what feminist and (healthy) men's rights are trying to do.?\\n You're just supporting my negative views on feminism that it is one-sided.\\nLol what's negative?

You could say, poop is gross, and if you say it to enough people, someone is going to say, I disagree. The more people you ask, the more of those people youll find. So were never going to come to a 100% agreement. One thing youre implying that I think youll get a vast majority of agreement on is, being a woman is harder. Sure, theres always gonna be some folks that disagree. But thats just how people work. Feminists complaints are traditionally about what men could do to make womens lives better. So you should expect retorts to be based on the same principle. If feminists never talked about what men need to do, and only discussed their feminist plans with other women. And devised a course of action that women can take to change their own circumstances, I think youd see the replies change considerably. Men wouldnt give a shit if you guys handled your own business.  So I think what youre seeing is, someone writes something online. 100k read it. 5k comment. 2.5k are in agreement, and 2.5k disagree. The people that disagree will just reword those complaint to show how their group suffers from the same problems. Theyre not trying to shoot you down. Theyre just saying, youre telling me I need to change my life to benefit you. Ok, then you change your life to benefit me. And even though youre seeing 2500 comments like that, 100k read it and didnt say anything like that. They didnt give a shit.

It was about forging a bond between the genders where we could see each other, and our different experiences, and empathise with one another. This comes out very strongly in bell hooks work.I'm a man, and I'm somewhat of a manly man by accident of my hobbies. I have also been a victim of domestic abuse. I had numerous difficulties in my life that were tightly connected to my gender - as many people do. I was put into a situation where my abuser was able to counter-accuse me, be believed, and even once I used the incontestable evidence that I had to prove that I was the victim heard many make the excuse \\"I'm sorry she did that, but she needs the support more right now\\". That was a gendered experience.The point here isn't to make a comparison to what most women go through or experience. It isn't about quantifying relative harm or difficulty. You cannot look at life through such a weak pseudo-utilitarian calculus, this isn't about trying to figure out who has more 'negative utility' from their gender. The point is, the core of feminism is about *radical empathy* which means that women have work to do, as well as men. That is what many of these men are trying to get at when they bring up the male loneliness epidemic, they're trying to make the point (even if they don't have the vocabulary to explain it) *you are asking me to make the effort to understand you, but you are not making the effort to understand me.*To take this a step further, I will highlight that this is a particularly significant problem for white, privileged women. I went from the gutter to earning some serious money after University, and the women that I met at university and after had significantly less empathy for and understanding of men than the women I grew up with. Just look at the writing of Audre Lorde and bell hooks if you want to grasp this distinction between how certain kinds of white, middle-class and upper-class women understand men and how people who have experienced real adversity in their life see them.These women have a taste of power and privilege, but see that there is a caste of men beyond them who have that privilege, plus further power and agency by virtue of their gender. They will take that model and impose it on the rest of the world, even though these men are realistically about 30% of men at most, and they consistently fail to recognise their own privilege within the trappings of their class and race. These people *do* need to do some serious work, and their feminism is often rightly criticised by economically and ethnically marginalised groups for its weaknesses.So I disagree with the premise that it is 'hurting feminism', it is a valid and legitimate critique of some kinds of feminism which often come from a position lacking in mutual empathy. It is up for those feminists who haven't done the work, to go read Lorde and hooks and related writers and do the work to understand why certain groups feel left behind.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"\\"Loneliness\\" is kind of a squishy topic to use as an example of the tension between the goals of feminism and the wellbeing of men. Let's talk about health generally.For 50 years, it has been known that men die younger of every preventable cause, but especially deaths of despair. Setting aside of the effect of suicide and addiction, the other major reason for mens shorter lifespans was the fact that 50% less was spent on their medical care compared to women.The affordable care act was passed in 2005, written by feminist leaning senators and representatives. Given that the acute distress men are in had been known for so long, what was the approach of the new law? The text of the ACA refers to \\"women\\" 145 times and \\"men\\" exactly once - in a section mandating that women should pay no more than men for this superior level of care.The perception of \\"hurting feminism\\" is unavoidable if we are going to shift the spotlight to the people who are most in need of healthcare (including mental healthcare - the indirect point of your OP).","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"But democracy is supposed to be ending.

I am going out on a limb here and what I am typing could be completely and utterly wrong but here's my perspective as a man who has been on the internet for a while The problem non insane grifter men have with the feminist movement generalizing all men, and they are hurt by the generalizations. They see the generalizations made about them on the internet, things like men are violent is the big one, and they turn to alternative sources that tell them that that is just evil women demonizing the nice boys they are. Usually into alt right circles. Now for this, I actually empathize with that. Words matter and it is hurtful to be lumped in with a group of people performing *heinous* actions. And I know the response will be \\"well if you arent violent we don't mean you\\", but like that doesn't help. Change those 2 words, and make it \\"black people are violent\\" and you have one of the most destructive generalizations ever put on this earth. We don't accept those kind of generalizations and just tell them \\"well if you are not violent we don't mean you\\". Same thing with \\"Women are emotional\\" and \\"well if you arent emotional we don't mean you\\". The generalizations still hurt everyone in the group. I have watched a few friends fall into this spiral, and yeesh its tough to watch. Now the unhinged griftersThey are working backwards. They are starting from a place of \\"women should be subservient\\" and justifying it by using women's actions against them. Most of the time pandering towards that first group. These are the people you are probably interacting with online, and they are the absolute scum IMO. I think a lot of actual men who have fallen into the alt-right were in the first group, but they are edged on by the second group.TLDR: In the era of everyone being online, people have become more and more lonely in general. Add on to that that, feminism has a lot of very divisive rhetoric in the form of generalizations, which hasn't helped the situation with reasonable men, and a ton of bad men acting in bad faith to demonize women for clicks or control or money or power, and you get the male loneliness epidemic.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"I worked for a company that told me if I didnt get my Covid shots when they were needed, I wasnt gonna be able to come to work so I bought into the whole shenanigans and I have three different Covid shots in me from the beginning.

At least when it comes to Gorsuch, Roberts, Barrett, and Kavanaugh.In the case of those four justices, I think they just really do read the constitution differently than the rest of us, I mean they're originialist, textualist. They try to get into the minds of what the founding fathers had in mind 200 years ago, So they're thinking is a little...backwards.  Also Barrett has shown that she will side with the liberal justices on some issues, same as Gorsuch, Roberts, and Kavanaugh. I mean Barrett was part of the majority that refused to hear the cases of a florist who refused to serve an LGBTQ couple, and a case involving a catholic hospital that didn't want to treat a Trans patient. Both of whic left in place a lower court ruling that ruled in favor of the copule and the patient.But because of that, it's hard to predict how they'll rule on each individual case. It's why I'm optimistic on that Trans case they heard last month, I mean all it takes is for two of them to side with the plantiffs and that mean spirited law in Tennessee will be struck down.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 6, 2025"},{"text":"It might be more important to those who talk about it, I personally don't care about women filming at the gym or having lead roles in movies.

But if you're holding on to offensive ideas, I don't know what choice you're giving people.

Anything can be framed as petty to be dismissed.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"I genuinely dont see why this gender wars stuff is happeningBecause feminism is the main aspect of gender wars and has been widely accepted society wide as a base belief.but from what Ive seen online and by talking with some men about it its just about how a lot of men dont have friends or a relationship so therefore they feel lonely.A major reason for this is feminist activism.  Men used to have clubs and those were insisted on being done away with to make room for women (such as Boy Scouts of America, which is now The Scouts, while the Girl Scouts were left alone). Men used to have hobbies, but those are called toxic and have to be changed for women (such as video games where woke ideology get pushed now making bad games).  Sports have been under assault as well and with the Civil Rights Act male sports in college were reduced to make room for women. So everywhere you look, things that are male get attacked in the name of supporting women, but the reverse is never looked at.  what about the male loneliness epidemic or men have it worse when someone brings up how women and girls all over the country are losing their reproductive freedom, stuck raising children on their own financially struggling and not getting a penny of child support, walking home at night in fear, being sexually harassed in the work place and dealing with your body my choice remarks from conservative men.So even when talking about male loneliness, you have to make it about women.  This is a standard approach in discussion.Also there are things like a mens right movement happening, which isnt bad in itself, but a large portion of the so called activists are just straight up misogynistic in the way they talk.This is you saying it's bad. In fact, this exact topic was covered in a movie by a feminist movie maker.  It's called [\\"The Red Pill\\"](https://youtu.be/_sRp73g7lfU?si=rJfs7Yx_3LfyXjLz).  It's worth a watch if you have time because it's about how this feminist movie maker set out to look into Men's Rights Activists and she came to see the female centric society in the process. In fact, she was attacked for making this movie by former feminists.  I just dont understand why the male loneliness epidemic or other male issues should be used to somehow downplay feminismBecause the source of most of these problems is feminism. How it doesn't care about any aspect of men and looks to demean and combat men. When it comes to male loneliness (and I'm not lonely btw), it's the total destruction of the dating world by feminist liberation movements and the high expectations that have been given to women. So, for example, on a dating app, women will go for the top guys only and 90% of guys don't get any responses. While women will continue to get a lot of interest, men live in a different world where they get none and also have no place to go to hang out with guys and also have no where to escape to for a past time because feminism attacks and ruins all of it.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Not from China.","title":"Trump Insists Hes Not Scaling Back Plans to Wreck the Economy - Donald Trump is planning to go full steam ahead with his tariffs."},{"text":"So that's your big arguement? \\"Women are dying!\\" You mean those abortion rights that were just abolished a couple of years ago?

I have. I've had to teach some economics myself, although rudimentary. They are often taught devoid of ethics. Things like elasticity of demand, aren't taught with the explanation, that often things with inelastic demand are so, because people would be devastated without them. Never have I been more disgusted, than hearing economics professors telling their students about someone who made tons of money, and how they were such a success, without even mentioning how. As if the how didn't matter. Leaving economics to \\"economic experts\\" often means leaving it to people who only care about profit, and not about the people. Granted, economy policy is a subset of economics, and perhaps it's taught better, but in general, just because someone is an expert, doesn't mean they should be the only ones who should have a say on an issue, because how the issue effects them, how they were taught about the issue, doesn't necessarily reflect how it will affect the average American citizen. That said, I do think there are some industries and topics, where those in power should be expert. Rather, I'd think it'd be best if they were. That doesn't mean every topic is best regulated by an \\"expert\\" however. I'm not saying a pure democracy is best. I'm not saying I have all the answers.

The older kind (which I'll call Old Feminism) wanted to level the playing field by lifting women up. The modern kind (which I'll call New Feminism) wants to level the playing field by tearing men down. As a man, I'll agree 100% that women shouldn't have to walk home in fear, be sexually harassed in the workplace, and such like, and I'll advocate for women's rights on those fronts 100%. But a number of those women will then turn around and say \\"I hate all men,\\" \\"men should die,\\" and cheer whenever an innocent man gets fleeced in a divorce settlement just because he's on the wrong team.So the way I see it (and I could be wrong about this), the Male Loneliness Epidemic is an emotional plea for empathy from the other side. It's men saying, \\"we're struggling too, you know,\\" and that hating on them isn't okay. That's how it hurts New Feminism.And that's *also* where the other stuff you mentioned is coming from:women having lead roles in moviesGuys love women in lead roles. What they don't love is women deliberately replacing men in lead roles. And by that I mean roles where the character was originally male, in a story designed around a male character, replaced by a female character. And even then, guys wouldn't mind so much if the female character wasn't often a man-hating misandrist in the role or a male character in female skin. Writing men out of stories just because they're men isn't cool.women filming at the gymAgain, guys normally wouldn't give a shit, except that women were using their filming rights to bully men by painting them as sexual harassers just because they looked in the woman's general direction for two seconds. Not cool.how unfair child support isIt *is* unfair. No-Fault Divorce is fine, great even, if children aren't involved, but if there are, then the one who put them in this situation should be the one paying for it, *regardless of how much money they're making*. Instead, it's always the higher earner, and because women still act like it's the 50s whenever they enter divorce court, it's almost always the men who pay because the men are almost always the primary earners.And even if we put that aside, when it comes to custody battles, the judges typically default to giving custody to the mothers, even though the law is officially neutral. Oftentimes, it doesn't matter if the mother is a crackhead and the father is a productive member of society - 9 times out of 10, the child's still going to the mother.The point is, not only are men lonely, but a case could be made that it's a direct result of feminism swinging way too far in the wrong direction.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"As of right now Dems have no shot at 26/28.

It's because there is a lot of emphasis put on ameliorating issues that women face (and rightly so!) and the impression some men get is that *their* issues are discounted simply because of their gender.I think there is a lot truth to that, FWIW.  I mean, look at your post.  You are trying to say that men's issues are important, too, but you cannot help but make the comparison to things women face (and raising children without child support isn't a gendered issue, FYI), and not only that, but you can't help but disparage and minimize a male-centric issue!  Again, I agree with everything you're saying, but it's quite telling that you can't even get through a 3 paragraph post that is ostensibly about the \\"male loneliness epidemic\\" without basically telling men that their issues are unimportant and that they should sit down and shut up and focus on women's issues.Lets put it this way.  You (generically) would be absolutely raked over the coals if you went to a topic about reproductive rights and said \\"wait a minute, what about male loneliness?!?!\\"  And yet here you are, discussing male loneliness, and you simply cannot help but make the comparison.  They aren't and shouldn't be considered equally problematic, but it's also nice to think that maybe someone is advocating for you because they think it's worthwhile, and not to be told that simply because you occupy a place of relative privilege, you aren't allowed to have meaningful problems.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Its wild to me that there is not going to be a recount after all the meddling, russian/chinese bomb threats and hacks, republican voter suppression and probable tampering.

So you yourself are participating in this \\"gender war\\" and using women's issues to downplay men's issues. Which, though you certainly didn't mean to do it consciously, is incredibly hypocritical.I am aware that often, people discussing women's issues are invaded by men complaining as you describe. On the flip side, though, I have NEVER seen male issues discussed without someone trying to say \\"yeah, well women have it worse so you don't really have much to complain about\\". As in, I've been at parties where a guy is opening up about his struggles with clinical depression and suicidal thoughts, including a previous attempt, and SEVERAL women casually brush it off with \\"yeah, but you've never been catcalled, so I don't feel bad for you\\". I even know a guy whose girlfriend broke up with him because he cried when his immediate family member (a brother or father, iirc) died. She \\"got the ick\\" and couldn't see him as masculine anymore. Neither of these things are uncommon experiences for men. Women often tell men they need to be more emotionally available, but most men have several experiences telling them that is a lie.So while I agree with you men's issues shouldn't be used to downplay women's issues, the inverse is also true. Men have legitimate and unique issues that shouldn't be downplayed by \\"oh, but women have X problem you don't have, so you can't have problems\\". Until women recognize that, this shutting down of gendered issues is going to continue, because you can't expect someone to stop doing something that you keep doing to them.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Do you have women in life your life who trust and love you who you actually speak to and understand?

When it comes to doomers saying stuff saying stuff like oh surely woman's right to work or to vote will be taken away, 1 Not only is it wrong, but frankly with the current congress they won't be able to repeal the 19th amendment. Just like Trump won't be able to repeal the 14th amendment. It's like when it comes to LGBTQ rights, I have read comments from saying that the court's gonna overturn obergefell just like Roe and then after that they're gonna make LGBTQ people themselves illegal and get rounded up and I'm like \\"Slow your horses.\\" First off the Respect For Marriage act which I will admit is not a perfect law, but it was passed because of fear that one day the court would overturn Obergefelled (Which according to legal experts with Trump's election,remains unlikely. And it was passed with bipartisan support including Mike Walz who is becomign Trump's National Security Advisor, and Elise Stefanik.Then of course they can;t just make a law declaring LGBTQ people illegal because that's a whole other supreme court case Lawrence V Texas.

That leads them to abandoning reason, logic, and their will to try and make things better.

(Yes, it is a thing.) As much as women feel that men do not understand what their lived experience is like, I think women have a shockingly poor idea of what men's lived experience is like. I have noticed in a lot of online discussions, when women do chime in and offer support on men's issues, it is typically because they have a son and are distressed over his day to day struggles, such as bullying, self-image, loneliness, etc.I do not think that the Men's Rights Movement is going to tear down feminism because in social discourse, feminism is the norm, the standard by which things are judged. But I do think that feminism needs to study up on what male issues are and understand why they are a concern.

Social media companies make money by keeping people engaged with their platform for longer so they have more opportunity to sell ads. Controversy keeps people engaged, so the algorithm promotes it, and creators who want to get their message out are incentivized to add controversy to their message.But even setting aside social media algorithms, when people hear a good idea they go \\"Yeah, that's a good idea, somebody should do that.\\" And then stop talking about it. When people hear a controversial idea, they start arguments with each other and the discussion lasts a lot longer. So once again, if you have a message you're trying to get out, it will get shared more, discussed more, and stick in people's minds more if you can get them arguing about it than if it's just an innocent idea.This isn't to say it *should* be controversial, but I hope it helps you understand why people add controversy to things like this.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"It's a very small investment with *massive* return potential if you are a company","title":"Trump Admin Gave Tariff Exemptions to Companies that Donated to Republicans: Study"},{"text":"Good catch.

Ultimately, the biggest problem is that many are not saving enough for retirement, and people are tending to live longer and need more to live. We can debate the mechanisms to work within that. Preserving Social Security and using 401k's as retirement vehicles are equally valuable goals. I think the video is a bit biased since they look at auto workers who don't realize how well the stock market has done over the past few decades and have too much nostalgia for auto as an industry in America. Pensions ended up costing way too much, and many companies couldn't fully fund their pensions (unlike government pensions where public pressure is enough to strongly support it). I guess what I'm figuring out is there should be ways of encouraging saving through investment vehicles, but they can neither be fully government run or individual run. Any reasonable policy to reform Social Security should recognize how lifespans have increased, and therefore benefits are basically being stretched further into the future to pay for older people. Whether that means tax increases of some kind, or spending cuts like extending the retirement age, or some combination of both, that will come to a head in coming years.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 6, 2025"},{"text":"Give 'em time.

Go overthrow the government. Because you aren't going to get change at a faster pace than Biden just by changing presidents. In fact a more leftist president would have just hardened opposition from his own party and not gotten anything more done. Yes, Trump will make it worse as he's tapped into the anger and discontent average Americans feel while both Biden and Kamala couldn't reach them. So people voted for the ridiculous as opposed to status quo, which gave them little to nothing.Well you recognize the problem, but that doesn't mean there was a realistic solution. Well aside from Democrats lying their asses off about what they were going to do just to go the same pace that they always go if they win. Voters can't expect radical change off of half-hearted support.

But yeah, he's well aware of how narrowly he won that seat, how it only happened because of a red environment, and how Pennsylvania is ripe for flipping that seat right back when it's next up if he does anything stupid (i.e. too extreme). I don't know much about the guy himself, but I don't see him blindly going along with Trump because he's aware that that doesn't play well in a swing state.Tillis is another one to watch. I'm sure he's well aware that his seat is vulnerable, that he and Collins are going to be the two biggest targets for Dems in 2026, and that 2026 will likely be a blue year. I'm also sure he noticed how Democrats did very well in North Carolina this past election outside of the presidential results, in spite of the generally red environment.Even if every single other Republican rubber stamped every single bit of Trump's nonsense, I count 5 with your list plus Tillis who are very unlikely to do the same. Considering that those 5 plus others aren't going to agree to killing the filibuster, there's not all that much that can happen. Even if they somehow did nix the filibuster, they can only afford 3 defections on a given vote with Vance as the tiebreaker.We're not in an ideal position, but we're in a *far* better position than we could've been.

At no point in the construction of the Constitution was allowing people to vote for President even discussed, the system they wrote would have State Legislatures design whatever method they want of picking Electors, and letting them vote however they want. They weren't hoping the people would keep candidates out of office that weren't fit, they decided the people weren't fit to pick anyone and decided the aristocracy should be the ones to do so. They were so disinclined to create voting rights, they just didn't. The states did, and most states said only white male landowners could vote for Representatives, and only them at that. Imagine that system in effect today, only the top 10% of earners, say, could vote for Congress, State Legislatures selecting all the Senators and then the Electors, who would all vote for President. That's the system they designed for us.  And if such a system was in place today, every president would look a lot more like Trump than not. So don't get it twisted, the system is currently more like it was originally designed than not, the wealthiest among us select who will hold office through donations and financial influence, they are the party leaders that then go on to select who will be running for President (sometimes without a primary), and then we hold a highly insecure public vote on electronic machines with extreme vulnerabilities, little paper record and no recourse for inspection or challenge because the states control all their own elections.","title":"\\nHarris Sends a Message to America as She Certifies Her Own Election Defeat to Trump | \\nThe vice president said she was carrying out a sacred obligation."},{"text":"Controlled opposition is a better term.

Based on how they approached the first days of the war, they definitely thought that Ukraine did not improve their armed forces since 2014. Initially, Russia thought it would be a war that's beneficial to them, but they were quickly proven wrong. However, by your logic, any war that doesn't go too well for the attacker clearly indicates that it's a reaction to some other event or third party, and thus is justified (to some extent). By your logic, Vietnam was reactionary and therefore (at least partly) justified.The war is just not in any PEOPLE'S interest.That's undeniably true, as it generally is the case for most wars.

Certain regions of Africa are greening, and the arctic circle melting is generally a huge economic boon -- it enables mining in greenland and opens up northern trade routes. The greening in Africa is happening so extensively that it may actually be problematic for the region according to an MIT article I read on the topic a while ago. Even with all of this, it is still very obvious that the net effect of fossil fuels has been towards a more rather than less livable climate. Widespread climate control &amp; air conditioning has made previously uninhabitable regions of earth, like the american southwest, extremely desirable. Water reclamation and cleanliness is enabled by energy consuming treatment plants. This is reflected in the statistical reality that climate related deaths are down 99%+ since the industrial revolution, and the trend has not reversed. Meanwhile every cent you add to transporation costs, manufacturing costs, or energy costs has a direct relationship with one marginal family going without a meal, one marginal investment not being made, one hospital going without power in the developing world when someone could be getting treatment. It means one more city or settlement lacking access to clean water. It means essentially diminishing living standards in every conceivable way. So its certainly a tall order, maybe the tallest, to PROVE the real future economic costs of fossil fuel consumption, when there is absolutely nothing that even comes close to outweighing the positives in observable reality today.","title":"Biden to ban offshore oil, gas drilling in vast areas ahead of Trump term"},{"text":"I havent got a clue what your talking about and you clearly havent understood what ive said because at no point i ever said NATO invited russia to join or russia joining nato was ever a prospect.

Go and find where i said that to prove me wrong.Go read my original post as?I cant be bothered to repeat everything but to summarise your claims that this war from 2022 was reacting to ukraine joining NATO is false because ukraine already offered a deal with russia to not to join nato AND could not join NATO because it had a territorial dispute. Therefore your claim that the US is trying to shove NATO down Russias throat is false as NATO already said Ukraine couldnt join and it is ultimately the decision of applicant countries to apply to join. NATO cannot \\"force\\" a country to join and this is one example of your dishonest framing which you use to make moral judgements even if not said explicitly. When you say america wants this war and russia doesn't and they are just reacting, we all know what you mean. Nobody thinks oh it's good that america wants this war and bad that russia doesn't want war. Nevermind that it is completely untrue its pretty clear putin wanted the war as I have previously mentioned he turned down a deal for ukraine to remain neutral in favour of war. The most laughable example of your disingenuous framing is that Putin isn't an imperialist dictator when he runs a totalitarian state without free and fair elections who is currently engaging in war that he has explicitly said includes annexation of lands into russia.If you seriously think that cutting american aid to Ukraine will stop Russia and bring \\"peace\\" you are a fool.

Or at least the unalienable right to life, liberty, property. And thats the standard? According to the Encyclop?dia Britannica: In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies.[33] This variety of liberalism is also known as modern liberalism to distinguish it from classical liberalism, which evolved into modern conservatism.FDR and his policies were profoundly against mans rights and turned the depression into the Great Depression. FDR is responsible for some of the worst, worse for mans rights, growth of the executive branch. You can trace how much power Biden had and Trump will have back to FDR. And the Unionization laws or the Wagner Act were a violation of mans rights as well.  American liberals have completely rejected liberalism while using the word liberal to maintain a veneer of respectability. Thats why American liberals are better known as leftists instead of liberals. American leftists have been leading the charge against property rights (or capitalism) and subsequently undermining mans other rights. American conservatives are more on the side of property rights, as badly as they do support them. The main thing conservatives done, badly while opposing property rights whenever it was convenient for them, is serve as a check on the lefts opposition to property rights. And thats why you cant point to much of theyve done.","title":"CMV: Conservatism is Useless Deadweight"},{"text":"Small correction: I don't think the executive office has any control over the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing.

Trump isnt a rapist, stop believing false charges are real, you make your party look so insufferable."},{"text":"The difference between the right and the left is that the right believes in the preservation of hierarchy  particularly class hierarchy (whereas the left wants to abolish it). Liberalism emerged in tandem with the transition from feudalism (hierarchical class system) to capitalism (another hierarchical class system) as a political ideology that extended property rights to ordinary people and facilitates the ability of property owners to become aristocracy. Liberalism creates a class of aristocracy that controls the state and uses it to facilitate the further enrichment of itself at the expense of the working class  which actually produces the wealth through labor. This dynamic creates an agitated working class which is then taken advantage of by fascists, who seduce the working class away from resistance against capital by blaming outgroup/marginalized segments of the population for their increasingly worsening material conditions and shifting cultural values (Jews are stealing the wealth! Black people are getting your hard earned tax dollars through welfare! Undocumented immigrants are stealing your jobs! Queers are corrupting your children!). Fascists (whose ideological purpose is to restore abolished hierarchies) grow in power and ultimately ally with the wealthy ruling class, as they aiming to even further subjugate and exploit the working class. Fascists also serve as a hostile force against burgeoning socialist movements who aim to create political power and organization among workers (Mussolini characterized fascism as the antithesis of Marxism in The Doctrine of Fascism and the Nazis locked up communists first). Liberals ultimately end up siding with fascists because Fascists dont threaten private property/capital the way socialists/communists do  because that is the ultimate point of liberalism and a liberal democratic state, to protect capital and the capitalist ruling class.","title":"Donald Trump Is Building a New Army of Foot Soldiers | Neo-Nazis and white nationalists have been emboldened by Trumps reelection."},{"text":"Okay champ","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

I doubt any deltas will be awarded to a thoughtful and logical reply. Feels like a troll/karma post to be honest.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.

They do see the forest, but they have different opinion about what is important for it? Democrats did not touch the core issues that connect majority of citizens. Rampant COL increase. You can't campaign at continuing the same policies as your predecessor and expect people who were dissatisfied with them to vote for you. That's what killed the turnout on Dem side - policies of appeasing center-right, opposition of introducing more modern labor laws, dissatisfaction with geopolitical decisions, meager reaction to housing crisis - all of that combined may lead people to see the \\"poison and food\\" choice differently - a dose of poison will not be fatal, but will remind about the growing issue and the deterioration followed by poison will serve as wake up call.You can't ignore core beliefs of large part of the left and expect them to blindly follow you as long as you have worse candidate to compare against. At some point you will receive the backlash. This is wake up call for democrats, not \\"the left\\". Especially considering that large part of Republican voters voted for better economy and job market - which is likely to tank during Trump administration. Trump rise happened because Dems ignored rural and impoverished parts of society, who bought into Trumps narration. This allowed him to take the Reps from ground up. Democrats face now at the beginning of the same crisis - there can be a third force that tries to unite both the inactive frustrated voters and active disillusioned voters from both sides and form a platform that can be tackled by new candidate. If DNC will still hold to the same pattern, they can fail spectacularly and have the same \\"takeover\\" happen as in Republican Party or worse, disillusionment could lead to a third party that takes over the votes in enough capacity to replace Dems in US dual-party schema.","title":"CMV: The Democrats didn't fail America or the left.
