It would be more accurate to say they are apathetic, or that they don't care enough. If you drill down on specific questions regarding trans rights, the picture is more mixed. [According to this site](https://visualizing2024.org/) that compares Trump and Harris on various issues and shows which way public opinion leans on those issues, Americans break for Trump on the topic of trans people in sports. However, when it comes to allowing trans people in the military, they break for Harris. I would have liked to see a more straightforward question on this survey. The one here is asking voters whether they think there's too much focus on social issues like trans people relative to problems that the middle class face. IMO, it's basically asking them to rank priorities and grade whether Harris adheres to that ranking. That's different from a question like \\"Harris supports too many changes to accommodate trans people that I disagree with\\".I don't think you should be dismissive of any concerns about how highly that question ranked in people's choice to vote. While apathy is better than outright hostility, it still sucks. Especially because Harris really didn't focus hard on social issues and it seems like Trump hit a goldmine with that one ad. But I think the distinction is important.Americans in general are iffy about certain things like trans participation in sports, but I don't think they are bought into the rest of what the GOP wants to do. It's mostly an optics problem because Reps blow up the specific wedge issues like sports. It doesn't mean we should step away from other things, like their right to serve in the military, to not be discriminated against in the workplace, their right to healthcare, and others.","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

E.g., Obamas pivot on marriage equality probably helped the 2012 ballot initiatives win. But its rare that it works so well. (On that one, it also helped that news coverage of marriage legalization showed lines of boring normies afterwards. Its harder to feel like the foundations of society have been torn asunder when the actual outcome is that Joe from Finance, who did you a solid in the budget negotiations last year, is giddy about getting married.)I think the Internet is a huge problem here too, because every group only encounters every other group through their most strident posters.","title":"Post-mortem polling found inflation, illegal immigration, and a focus on transgender issues to rank among the top reasons for not voting for Harris.

And that \\"massive lead\\" Hillary had wasn't blown as much as the polls were just way off, due it part to the number of \\"shy Trump voters.\\" Wouldn't be the last time we saw that. Part of the reason why I say she's the worst presidential candidate in modern political history is because she's been a terrible candidate on the national stage from the beginning. She received zero votes in 2020, dropping out before the first caucus. The only reason Biden picked her as a running mate was because he promised Jim Clyburn he'd pick a black woman. Biden's own vetting team advised against Harris and recommended Amy Klobuchar. However, Klobuchar only ticked one of those two boxes. She was never really popular as a VP and then gets promoted to the top of the ticket, again without receiving a single vote. She essentially failed upwards.","title":"Special counsel Jack Smith seeks pause in Trump's election interference criminal trial"},{"text":"I've voted in every election since 08, the first election i was able to vote legally and I've loyally voted democrat ever since...not anymore.

On a high level, it's the economy. Although the data is good, the actual experience for most people is that things are worse off now than before the Biden administration. Low unemployment and better inflation doesn't mean much when folks can't afford to buy a house or the groceries they need. By telling people that things are better even if that's not what they see in their day to day life, Democrats are proving themselves to be out of touch and insensitive to the needs of the public. Trump has told people a simple thing: life sucks, and I'm going to fix it. Many people feel that their lives are not going well right now so obviously they will side with the candidate who agrees with them. On another level, the Democratic Party leadership is guilty of political mistakes on a catastrophic level. Biden promised he would be a transition to a new generation then went back on his word. He prevented a competitive primary from occurring and invalidated the results of the state of New Hampshire in the process because it didn't fit his agenda. He dropped out of the race with three months to go, leaving Kamala no time to establish herself as a candidate. His administration did not prepare Kamala as a successor--she was almost invisible the past four years. He anointed Kamala without a single vote for her in a primary which is frankly undemocratic. Again, there is a theme of dictating to voters how things are going to happen instead of listening to them. Such arrogance in talking down to the voter, dictating to them instead of listening, and telling them that their lived experience is wrong, deserved to be punished.

Voting at the polls is not the equivalent of jury duty and the last thing we need to do is encourage criminals to run for office so they can claim exoneration if they win.All Smith has done here is acknowledge the reality that Trump's new AG will fire him as special prosecutor and kill the cases against him. It's not an admission that the cases lack legal merit: from what I've seen, it's likely Trump would be convicted if the cases came to trial. I assume the current DOJ is trying to determine whether the case can/should go dormant for four years or whether they should publish a report of their findings and call it done. Not only do they have to factor in current law, they have to take into consideration how much damage Trump and his cronies will likely do to our judicial system.

Congress holds the purse strings and sets the laws that send money and weapons to Israel. Look at Ukraine for example, a place Biden wanted to send more aid and weapons to and could not without congresses approval. Trump interfered with that trying to bribe Ukrainian assistance and was rightfully impeached, though never held accountable for it. Had Biden done the same he would have been rightfully impeached. The only thing he had the power to do unilaterally was make some non-binding statements that would be political suicide and all but assure trump ( the man who wants Israel to cleanse the Palestinians) would control everything. Harris could do even less as the VP so don't lay the deaths at their feet, these treaties are way older than his presidency and this issue. Israel murdered those people and the only thing that makes it unlikely if more than 42k die as a result of Trump and a full Republican Congress and supreme Court is if there are less than 42 k alive by then. You have helped elect the modern Hitler and if they are the only ones that die at this point then it will be a miracle. Trump will stop the aid to Ukraine, shift aid to oppressing minorities ( including Muslims in different regions) and if the toll next year isn't millions dead something will have happened to stop Trump from causing/ helping cause it. So if you can't see -42 k &lt; hundreds thousands or millions dead as a , admittedly terrible win, idk what to do. However it's worse than that, we are assuming that we might have only held up the status quo but it was very possible that two branches of government could have been returned to sanity and after much work all three and the assistance to Israel be stopped, Putin be stopped, Ukraine saved etc and taking that into account the shift in possible lives saved vs the extras that will be killed it will be a death toll that I hope hangs on your head for generations ( if it cannot be prevented and you live long enough to see it occur).","title":"Dont dare blame Arab and Muslim Americans for Trumps victory | We did not betray the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party betrayed us"},{"text":"But corporations are on our side","title":"Trump hires a corporate lobbyist as his Chief of Staff"},{"text":"Would you prefer they went through with it?

He then commands his team to get that out right away.In a separate post, Mr Trump addresses his alleged connections to Project 2025, a policy document created by Right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation that Ms Harris repeatedly claimed represents a blueprint for the President-elects plans were he to regain power.Responding to Ms Harris comments, Mr Trump dictates: Lying against Project 2025, which she knows and so do all Democrats, that I have absolutely nothing to do with!The footage gives a rare glimpse inside the winning presidential campaign.Mr Trump has previously been criticised for his trademark all caps social media posts, but the video casts them in a new light and suggests a coordinated strategy.During the speech, Mr Trumps staff can be heard discussing the points he is making and how to counter them on social media.Mr Trumps staff have previously claimed he is a stickler for precise grammar and punctuation marks such as use of Oxford commas in his social media posts.Madeleine Westerhout, who worked as Mr Trumps personal secretary until 2019, told his New York hush money trial earlier this year that the President-elect would edit his social media on paper by hand after she had written them down for him.My recollection is there are certain words he liked to capitalise, she said. Words like country. He liked to use exclamation points.It is my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/08/watch-fascinating-behind-the-scenes-video-reveals-how-trump/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/08/watch-fascinating-behind-the-scenes-video-reveals-how-trump/)","title":"Watch: Fascinating behind-the-scenes video reveals how Trump posts on social media"},{"text":"Look up Magnus Hirschfeld.Maybe by todays standards they could be seen as old fashioned, but Berlin was the city leading trans healthcare and therapy thank to Hischfeld before the Nazis came in, burned all his work down, and set us back decades.","title":"For transgender Americans, Trumps win after a campaign targeting them is terrifying"},{"text":"So much for draining the swamp.","title":"Trump hires a corporate lobbyist as his Chief of Staff"},{"text":"The valuation for Tesla has been entirely hype based for a long time now.

Growing up in the digital age, theyve been influenced by viral content and memes, but this often overshadows the deeper understanding of issues like tariffs, economics, and government institutions. For instance, when politicians talk about 50% or 100% tariffs, many young people mistakenly see it as a discount. But in reality, tariffs raise prices for consumers, hurt working-class families, and dont necessarily bring back jobs as promised. They also fail to understand the long-term impacts of their votesparticularly when it comes to issues like the Supreme Court, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ protections, and government programs.and climate.

Here is something I wrote on another forum.  The important thing is that while we looked at it as a \\"defensive wall\\", that is how Russia looked at the Warsaw Pact as well:Now, lets readily stipulate that the war, and the residual impacts, are all on Putins hands. The blood is his.That said, the actions of the foreign policy establishment and the leadership of the West absolutely contributed to his decision(s) to attempt to regain previous USSR territories and pull them back into Russias orbit. And that was very foreseeable to many people that understood Russia. (I personally do not count myself in that number).Kissinger wrote in?*Diplomacy*?about the paranoia surrounding Russia and their insatiable drive to gain land for security. Russia is a country that has been invaded multiple times - at great cost both to themselves and the invader. But its been attacked at various times from the west, the east, the south, and even the north (if we wish to count the Vikings separately). Its lost tens of millions of people to foreign invaders and its people have suffered immensely as a result.Now, think about the impact of being attacked externally dozens of times over hundreds of years and what that does to the psyche of a people. Its extremely hard for those of us in the US to fully appreciate it because we have had a rather blessed history in that regard. Although Ill point out that the two big attacks against us resulted in our nuking Japan, overthrowing Afghanistan, and deposing the Iraqi government for good measure. And if we want to put lesser attacks in this conversation, the attack on the Alamo started a series of events that ended with our taking almost 1/2 of Mexico, while the attack on the Maine - a lone ship - resulted in our taking Cuba and the Philippines after a splendid little war with Spain.Now lets put ourselves in the position of Russian leadership. Theyve grown up in a bi-polar world. Their organization, the Warsaw Pact - disbanded and their country went thru massive turmoil. And the alliance they grew up fearing - NATO - took that opportunity to expand eastward towards Russian soil. And has since made noises about bringing in even more countries. And of course the economic ties between the EU and those countries have been pulling them further into the Wests orbit as well.Looking thru that lens does it look a bit different? And yes, people will say NATO is a defensive alliance! And thats been true. But history shows that things are always just one thing, before they are another. And we should remember that after the fall of the USSR, our foreign policy establishment was tripping all over itself to push the idea of western in general, but US in particular, Hegemony globally. And again, we Americans should remember that we take our security and place in the world for granted. We also dont fully appreciate what a colossus the US is to foreign countries. The US is the most powerful country that has ever existed. Technologically, Economically, culturally, militarily, diplomatically.From a Russian perspective, theyve seen an alliance, formed in order to keep Russia in check, led by the most powerful country in history, expanding rapidly towards their borders. Should we really be surprised that their historical paranoia kicked in against that backdrop?Now again - I dont want to excuse Putin here. None of the above is an adequate reason to invade a sovereign nation that hasnt attacked it. But saying that we should review - skeptically - and evaluate the actions and attitudes of our foreign policy establishment is a very reasonable take. (And we shouldnt forget that the establishment has gotten us into Vietnam, Iraq, and now the Ukraine \\\\[dont say we are not involved when weve already spent more there than we did over the first 10 years in Afghanistan\\\\]. And we should be a lot less gung ho about those people pushing use towards another war with a nuclear armed, paranoid, basket case - one that just signed an alliance with the even goofier version of itself (North Korea).To answer the second part of the question: The establishment didnt do this deliberately. They did it due to their unique blend of hubris and ignorance (which are usually co-existing traits).6/25/2024: Here is a memo from the ambassador to Russia (and the current C.I.A.

I bet most voters were unaware of Kamala's tax credit for small business or the down payment assistant for 1st time home buyers... It's not that deep, and that's the problem the Democrats have. They have to figure out how to appeal-to and court the vote of people who are uninformed and easily swayed by simple messaging. In my town there were signs every where that said things like \\"Trump Low Crime, Kamala High Crime\\", \\"Trump low taxes, Kamala high taxes\\", etc. and I guarantee you that kind of smooth-brained messaging had 10x the impact than the nitty gritty details about their policies.People will say \\"I voted for Trump because of the economy\\" or \\"I want lower taxes\\". But these people cannot articulate a single specific fact about Trump's policy that would lead them to believe he will be better for the economy or lower taxes. Even if it were true - and economists predicted his policies would be better, people wouldn't actually know that.I've read a lot about the reddit \\"echo-chamber\\" over the past few days. There's certinaly some truth to it - but it's not really different from any other place where people congregate to discuss things. Echo chambers will naturally develop because people generally want to hang-out and talk about shit with people they agree with. It's that simple. The real reddit \\"echo-chamber\\" is this notion that esoteric policy details are the \\"real culprit\\" when the reality is that 95% of people are completely clueless about all of this. The vast majority of people are uninformed and always will be. The perceived \\"importance\\" of the election here and elsewhere on the internet doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. Many people are too apathetic to put in even 5 minutes of research into things that have significant impacts on their lives - and I'm not really sure how to adress that.","title":"Elon Musk joined Trump's call with Zelensky"},{"text":"Leftist rhetoric is poisonous and unelectable though","title":"Harris Tried to Win Over Republicans.

However, after Janet Protasiewicz won a Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023 and flipped the state Supreme Court from a conservative to a liberal majority, the Supreme Court overturned the gerrymandered maps, and the state enacted new fair maps that undid over a decade of GOP gerrymandering. This is the result of that: Democrats were able to flip 10 seats in the state Assembly and 4 seats in the state Senate. It's incredible to see what happens we have fair elections that don't have pre-determined outcomes due to gerrymandering.","title":"Democrats flip 14 legislative seats, affirming GOP gerrymander is dead"},{"text":"It's just something for the far left to whine about.

She was always going to be accused of not having policy and not explaining things in enough detail regardless of what she says policy-wise. Might as well not say anything specific and just repeat.  Honestly same effect. I remember during the Clinton campaign they talked about how much of a policy wonk she was. Shes a very academic sort of person and came across talking a bit like a professor I had in college or law school. Detailed policy proposals dont matter to anybody but the minority of really well-informed and often well-educated voters. They still made it sound like either: (1) she didnt explain it enough or (2) shes not charismatic. Almost beginning to admit their charisma matters more. \\nAlso, Harris was at a disadvantage as an incumbent with an economy that by many metrics is good on paper but not for the average consumer. So the cries of if you know how to fix it, why havent yall done it?! Rings too loud. If Trump were in charge during the 21 inflation hed be suffering from similar charges.

He saw first hand, people wanting to hear more from Fauci instead of Trump, so made sure we heard from him less, while also allowing MAGA to demonize him.Like I am not even kidding as I was arguing with a Trumper yesterday on TikTok over covid. The Trumper was claiming that it was the democrats that shut down the country under covid. I tried to remind this person that Ohio shut down and was red state with conservative leadership in charge, the person doubled down on the comment saying that Fauci and the dems were responsible.These people still think that when Trump was president that the democrats were controlling red states like Ohio and shutting them down. Despite that fact that everything that was done at that state level was led by DeWine. He was the one that shut down the state, he was the one that sped run the ability to collect unemployment benefits during the pandemic, etc.It's so annoying that these people can sit there with their full chest and spit out lies as if they are factual and refuse to be fact checked at all.Trump must be one terrible president that if he had control of the house, senate and the white house that a red state with conservative leadership was shut down by democrats who had no control over any branches of government at the federal or local levels.

Im all for Ukrainian sovereignty and for them to win this war. That said, theres no foreseeable end in sight. Ukraine wasnt able to end it before Russia got their war machine working again, which means its no longer a matter of just another 6 months and Russia will be out of tanks. The US has sent untold billions of dollars of aid to Ukraine which has only managed to hold the line, if that. ?In reality, without western aid Ukraine wouldve been under complete Russian control a year ago if not earlier so getting out with any land would already be a win. Id love for the US to be able to fight a proxy war forever and eventually win, but our country is trillions of dollars in debt and I promise you were arent getting paid back by Ukraine. Its an unfortunate situation, but I dont think theres a good answer. It looks like ceding some land to Russia may be the only way to win the war. On the bright side, I wouldnt rule out Trump finding something that he can leverage against Russia that the previous admin was not willing to do. Maybe he can find leverage that would prevent them from coming back for seconds later on.","title":"Well, that was quick: NYC mayor suspends voucher program for migrants after phone call with Trump"},{"text":"The first female president will win because they won't make being female part of their platform.

That includes private citizens advocating on their own behalf if they spend a certain amount of time in government offices.What youre probably referring to is super PAC funding and campaign contributions, which isnt lobbying but certainly makes lobbying easier. Also keep in mind elected officials dont get to keep the money. The campaign can spend it on nice dinners or accommodations but basically no money goes into the electeds bank account. Plenty of nonprofits and charity orgs have lobbyists. Homeless advocates, enviros, legal defense funds, local governments and clean energy companies all employ lobbyists. Small businesses group up and employ lobbyists to help with local tax credits.If you make it illegal, you remove all of their leverage and the question becomes where you draw the line for who is and whos isnt allowed to advocate.

And of course a lot of internal republican Trump Skeptics in Congress have been replaced by people who advocate a more Trumpist Agenda.

Also, remember that most of my and your ancestors were undocumented if they came to the US before 1924, because before that the US didn't have a consistent visa system nor a standard requirement of a passport for entry.Second, kicking people out of homes doesn't mean those homes suddenly go on the market (let alone are seized by the govt and then somehow distributed back to citizens). Kicking people out of rented units just causes apartment owners to go bankrupt--they operate on tight revenue schedules. There are also many local legal requirements that require landlords to do maintenance when units go on the market; Trump will have zero control over this, because it is not in the feds' jurisdiction. In communities with high populations of undocumented, the cost of such maintenance all at once will be excessive. Even if local govts waived such rules, the demand will plummet and thus the price, meaning that those landlords will, again, just declare bankruptcy. Trump says he's giving a blank check for deportation: does it include these costs too?Finally, for two years now, Canada, whose housing costs are even more out of control than in the US, has been doing an experiment exactly along the lines of what you suggest. It has turned out to be a complete failure in increasing supply and bringing down prices. All it has done is slightly decrease the rate of increase in average house sale prices. Of any country in the world, Canada is by far the most similar one to the US, so we should heed their negative experience. Things that sound good on paper don't always work out in reality.If we, say, throw out all of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented, then they are also not buying toilet paper, cars, food, anything. That would reduce demand and increase supply, and, yes, bring down prices a bit, but not by much because they only compose about 3.5% of the population at present. Even if we could neatly track that impact (which we can't, but for the sake of argument), we'd be talking about tiny reductions in pricing on the items most affected by inflation. I live in MA, where a dozen eggs currently costs $5.20 on average. That price would go down to $5.02. Let's say I buy 2 dozen eggs a week (that's way more than my family eats, but let's just say we got really into eggs for some reason)--after a year my savings would be $19 ($540 down to $521) or $1.58 a month. And let's say I spend $1000 on groceries a month (again, way more than we spend), the same calculation would mean I'd pay $420 less a year or $35 less a month.If anyone goes, but wait it will be more complicated than all of that: the whole point here is to illustrate that a simply stated claim can be refuted not just by complicated answers but by simplified illustrations. If someone insists that tossing out 11.5 million people will have clear and obvious benefits, then that is a simple argument. That person then can't turn around and claim that using a simple counterargument doesn't take into account all the variables, because their premise is literally that this is a simple example of cause and effect.And plus, we still have to think about the loss in economic output and taxes from losing undocumented people who were working and paying taxes. I know there's this myth that undocumenteds don't work, but I thought they were stealing American jobs--so, yeah, they work. I know there's also this myth that they don't pay taxes, but over the last few years the local, state, and federal taxes paid by undocumenteds is estimated by audits of govt revenues to be in the range of $100 billion a year. The highest estimates of the cost of having these extra people here is $150 billion a year. Sounds bad, right? But it is more of an offset than the elderly cost, whose ratio is more like 50% (i.e. they cost taxpayers twice as much as they pay in taxes), and if Trump ends taxes on SSI then goodbye to revenues in any place that has a high percentage of elderly (to say nothing of our rapidly aging population, but I digress).In a society, we shouldn't consider people's value defined by their ability to pay more than they cost, so yeah keep grandma alive and safe and warm. By the same token, if we kick out undocumenteds, then it should be argued as solely for ideological reasons because the economic reasons don't really stand up to even the most basic scrutiny.","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"To call it a \\"choice\\" would be simplifying it immensely, there's various shades of gray. Societal pressure and stigmas effectively made a higher education a requirement for the last 20ish years.The better questions you should be asking is \\"why is the federal government just writing blank checks for whatever the university bills?\\" (I know that's not how it actually works, but like 90% of my tuition all four years was covered by FAFSA) or \\"why do students need to take out loans to get a higher education?\\"Student loan relief also isn't just waving a magic wand and cancelling student debt for everyone. It's looking at the current loan program and restructuring it, forgiving loans to students who were defrauded by institutions and modifying loan payments, interest rates and putting programs like the Public Service Forgiveness program back on track. People always focus on the \\"all loans forgiven aspect\\" that never actually happened and conveniently forget about everything else that did happen.Under Bidens student debt relief plan (SAVE), my monthly payments were reduced from $305 to $90. I am fortunate and able to pay more than that but it's nice to have the ability to pay a significantly reduced payment if I have a sudden hardship. The entire system needs reform, but we shouldn't be pitting choice a against choice b. If you want to go to school, choose a public university (which should imo be fully paid minus cost of materials) via taxes or if you choose to go to private school, you're on the hook for the cost. If you decide to go to a trade school, that should also be supported by taxes. Why? Because the entire country benefits when you have the education and skills to succeed.

People blame this 22% inflation spike on the sitting president, Biden, who inherited much of the woes caused by excess liquidity in the capital markets in the US. The popular government Covid spending programs added massive liquidity to the capital markets, as this added spending (like the zero interest rates, $1,400 checks to every citizen, and PPP loan programs during the tail end of the 1st Trump Administration that continued well into the Biden administration) took time to work through the economy. The economic effect of government/Fed intervention is always measured long after the fixes are initiated, as it takes time for the gauges to see the results to show up in our inflation readings (inflation is classically known as a Lagging Indicator). We have yet to see the full effect of the Biden policies on inflation as the IRA and CHIPs act are just starting to get underway.We will never see prices go down to pre-Covid levels, this is not how inflation works. This concept,  deflation, would be considered a very rare isolated event that would only happen in extreme over-supply or under-demand situations that never last long in any market. The government intervention on tap with the next administration (broad tariffs) will also become extremely inflationary and likely result in reduced available supply. This will effectively raise prices on most household necessities we import from foreign countries that are targeted with tariffs.Banks know what will happen, they are already raising mortgage rates (long term loans) to cover their risk, even when the FED has just started to lower interest rates (inflationary)!!! We are at the beginning of a perfect economic storm. Basic economics, buckle up fiscally and batten down the hatches, shit is gonna get dicey in the next fiscal year.","title":"Get Ready for Trump-flation: Trump won the election in part because of a backlash against consumer price inflation on Bidens watch.

My life is about to be upended because of Trump and Kamalas actions this year.I want people to understand something. Even if Project 2025 does not pan out and Trump fails at branding us all as pedophiles who deserve to be executed, we re about to face an unprecedented amount of violence on the streets. We are going to suffer at the hands of every conservative that feels emboldened by Trumps rhetoric to enact violence against us. Even the ones who wont hurt us physically will start harassing us, turning us away from stores, and start turning us away from employment.I refuse to be told by anyone that I am being hyperbolic. What I described was the reality for my community all the way back to the early 2000s, and we are going to see a return to this, except probably wore this time.Because of Trumps victory, Im suddenly trying to prepare to leave Florida. I know Florida will become a hotbed for trans oppression, and I will not stick around to be shot at in the middle of my blue city. I suddenly have to figure out the quickest way to sell my home and leave to somewhere that Ill have a longer guarantee of my basic rights being protected, such as my access to healthcare.Not only am I scared, my wife is scared. She is afraid of what will happen to our marriage, and shes trying to navigate through the complicated feelings of knowing that theres a chance that she too could be branded a criminal for even being romantically involved with me. Because of a Trump victory, my very foundational family structure has a chance of being uprooted as we make emergency plans to figure out where our lives are supposed to end up at.I want to make something else very clear. I am extremely disappointed and upset with not only conservatives, but with the fucking liberals that let this campaign fall through. If you, at any moment, were on this subreddit or have expressed irl that Kamalas campaign was doing perfectly fine, with no flaws, and that Mamala always had this in the bag, I am talking about *you*. You let the Democratic Party feel complacent with many of its flaws that I saw coming a million miles away about how no working class American was going to give half a shit about her. As far as Im concerned, every liberal here who had their head up their own ass is the same white moderate that Martin Luther King Jr. used to write about.And I dont care if this part of my post is what gets me downvoted. I feel like I have every right to be upset with *everyone*, because not only is my life going to be ruined in the next 4 years, but so are the lives of every other queer person in this country, and also all the women who are about to also suffer. You have failed your mothers, your wives, girlfriends, daughters, sisters, the checkout clerk to the grocery store, the woman handing you your fucking garbage at the McDonalds window, your school teachers, and, fuck it, even yourself if you were a woman on that koolaid. Congrats to you all. You really nailed it.And before I end, here is my advice for any other scared queer person reading this post. Be active and do not let the fascists drag you back or keep you in the darkness. Leave your community if you must, but never be ashamed of the way you were born. Go move somewhere else where there is a community that will protect you. Get involved in your local queer groups. I wanted to be involved with volunteering for queer activism for years, but I was in college and I was on the verge of getting my degree, so I had no time. Fortunately for me, I graduated the same month Kamala lost her campaign, so now I have finally made my first appointment to go attend a session to see what my role will be in my local queer group. Create the community from the ground up if you must, and be there for each other and be kind. I would die before meeting a vulnerable queer person and letting them fall through the cracks if the next 4 years are unkind to them. We need to be there for each other, and we need to be our first line of defense, because this election has single-handedly proved to us that we cannot trust the cis heterosexual white man to ever make decisions for us that would align with our own class interests. If conservatives or liberals wont step up to bat for us, we need to do so ourselves.I want to believe there is hope still. We survived thousands of years of oppression. We survived the Holocaust and the setback that the Germans imposed on us when they destroyed Magnus Hirschfelds LGBTQ+ center. We survived the concentration camps. We survived 1950s America. We survived Stonewall. We survived AIDS. We survived the bigotry of the early 2000s. We survived Trumps first term.And we Ill survive the next 4 years of the Trump administration. We are a scientific inevitability. No matter how hard they try to exterminate us all, more of us will always continue to be born into the world with the fire to feel good in our own bodies. Even for those of us alive right now, there are thousands of us who would rather die than let them detransition us and shove us back into the closet. Im one of those people and I fucking refuse.And if you want to resist, go buy a gun. We have no choice anymore if we are to survive. I hate guns as much as the next leftist, but I will pick one up if I have to learn how to defend myself and my community.","title":"For transgender Americans, Trumps win after a campaign targeting them is terrifying"},{"text":"As any other time a state turns into a fascist state ??","title":"Left-wing millionaires flee America over Trumps victory"},{"text":"I grew up and have a house on the TX border.

One hour, 100k from some Russian oligarch. This is normal to the right. They are all getting paid huge amounts to influence people, and obviously it's working or else they wouldn't be getting paid.And then you have Kick and Adin Ross and the like. I don't want to even get into the W streamers, but they're unwillingly (or willingly?) doing it to.We're in a very bad position. The democrats have no good, digestible populist messaging. They lean on policy instead of narrative. What's better?\\"I will give first time home owners a $25,000 down payment assistance fund, because part of the American dream is owning your own home.\\"or\\"They have screwed you - out of owning a house, buying a new car, going on vacation. Screwed on all accounts. Constantly the 'invisible hand of the market' is just a republican holding you down. I will remove that hand and fix your financial problems.\\"Really ask yourself that. This is why we keep losing. We fall back on policy, policy, policy. **Yes, policy is important**. But that's not what the rhetoric should be. Keep the speeches to be aggressive, keep it to be digestible, and back it up with the policy that we could lean on because our side **has** it. We have to get hyperbolic, we have to overpromise. We have to get populist. That's why Bernie was so damn popular.Traditional Liberalism is dead. We live in a Populist time. The DNC will kill us all if they don't change.","title":"Special counsel Jack Smith seeks pause in Trump's election interference criminal trial"},{"text":"What Im saying is Im tired of the witch hunts if nothing is going to amount to anything.

I was lucky that my dad was college educated in Mexico and both my grandfathers were Bracero workers in the 50s and 60s and had been coming and going into the US on work permits for years. From my understanding, these were the reasons why my parents visas were approved. Im part of the lucky few who benefitted from legal immigration. I understand its a privilege and an opportunity to come here legally. I also never blame any person or family coming to the United States for a better opportunity whether illegally or not. The problem I have is that most of the family I have who support Trump were either illegal immigrants themselves who married a citizen or their parents (I.e. aunts and uncles) came here illegally and they were lucky to be born here. For example, one of My uncles and his children (my cousins) came here illegally in the 90s. My dad was able to sponsor them at some point and they got residency sometime in the early 2000s. After some years they finally became citizens. I shit you not, the first election my uncle was able to vote for, he votes for Trump. I truly believe that the majority of Mexican American Trump supporters have directly been a product of illegal immigration in their family. And I find that hypocrisy so damning that I can never wrap my mind around it. Again this is anecdotal and I cannot say the same for Latinos from other countries, just those in my immediate orbit.","title":"Trumps latino support shouldnt be surprising"},{"text":"Appeal what?

God, I wonder how hard it must be to be stuck watching a nightmare play out, unable to change the policy of a sitting fossil of a President that thinks what worked in the 70s still works today and unable to voice any commitments to Palestinians because you are still the sitting VP.

Palestinians aren't being allowed to leave. The abuse is going to accelerate to paving the west bank.

It was founded in 1953. It organized conferences, and worked with major corporations. Former president Barack Obama worked there as a financial researcher after graduating from Columbia University. In 1986, Business International was acquired by the Economist Group in London, and it eventually merged with the Economist Intelligence Unit. **Business International was linked to the Central Intelligence Agency.**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_CorporationBut, from pre-conception? One of the odd things about Obama's parentage is that his father was already married in Africa before coming to the US,  but married Dunham. According to 0bama's wiki, the marriage took place six months before Obama's birth.  That makes Obama's dad a bigamist in the US, despite his being a Muslim. Why Dunham married him anyway is kind of beyond me. Did he claim to be single? Just odd. Then a guy from Hawaii finishes law school and gets a three book contract deal?

He knows about the plastics too. Once he gets all the toxins out of our food we will prosper health wise as well.

I think I know why.Please hear my perspective with an open mind. As a white man with a shit ton of hobbies the far right circle for their pipeline - stocks, investments, crypto, ai, gaming, physical Fitness, entrepreneurship and innovation, I feel like I understand how they operate and how they have such a hold on people, better than most here within the leftist bubble. Its really quite simple, the Republican messaging is more potent, and people fall victim to misinformation easier because \\n1) the republicans dominate social media across a wide range of hobbies. For those of us into politics, we see how democrats dominate the political bubble, but if you play games, or think the new Star Wars movies are crap, or want to use ai, you will come across numerous right wing channels that are the mouth of the pipeline. They push you little by little, and then once you are susceptible to ideas, the algorithm takes hold. However, why are people susceptible to ideas from the right?2) because the leftist position on every single social issue is NOT the common sense position. Its NOT common sense that using ai is evil but using photoshop is not. Its NOT common sense that capitalism is pure evil (its how we build a functional world). its NOT common sense to say that we should allow illegal immigrants to exist in this country (yea yea they help our economy- sorry my fellow brainrots, thats the intellectual position, the common sense position is in the name ILLEGAL immigrants), its NOT common sense to say that trans women should be allowed in womens sports (sorry but there are biological differences between sexes that result in physical differences regardless of how early you start hormones). Its NOT the common sense position to say that a conflict in the Middle East that has been going on for hundreds of years with harm in both sides is just because of the white Zionist Americans. It NOT the common sense position that we can say Black Lives Matter but not ALL lives matter. (I get the intellectual reasons, but its not common sense). Its NOT common sense to say that all men are evil. Its not common sense to say women should be allowed to go toppless (because it ignores the fundamental reality of sexual arousal mechanisms in men). Its NOT common sense to use they as a non-binary person..(for fucks sake it confuses me every time, like whos the group we are referring to ??). Its NOT common sense that minorities are owed reparations, or that established countries should bay hundreds of billions to Haiti or other places as payback.  Its NOT common sense that if your not Asian you cant sell boba (the common sense take is their business was shit and they didnt understand their own market, but of course simu brought race into the discussion). Fuck its NOT even common sense that we need to completely shift to green energy right now (Im a huge environmentalist by the way, and even I can admit its not clear for people)I could go on and on and on, because I have seen every one of these issues push normal people a bit further right little by little, for YEARS. \\nAgain, while some of the above may piss people off, and may get the woke mob to attack me (thats kind of the problem lol), its clear that this is what America feels. And if we, all of us people who believe in social issues and progress want to make the world a better place, we must meet people where they are. So what are we going to do?  Am\\nI going to get downvoted to the end of the earth for trying to acknowledge reality?  Weve already seen people latch onto every reason but the core issue. Theyve identified wounds, and rightly so, wounds that must be bandaged, but they havnt identified the disease. I dont see the far left changing things. Its a cult as much as maga. But rather than have a cult leader at their helm, the lefts cult leader is a chip on their shoulder and hatred for the out group, for the establishment. Ive said this before, in fact, Ive said it all through the election cycle. Fuck the far left. They are disconnected from reality. Dont believe me?  Look at the gen z numbers. The progressive movement as we know it are dead. We must acknowledge that if we still hope to make the world a better place. And if you agree with me, please take this to heart, because as weve just seen in this election -the left and gen z and minorities will NOT get off their ass to help themselves, so its up to people like us, who might be more willing to play the game, to try and achieve real progress. We need a social media and media ecosystem like the right, and we cant do that if we dont meet Americans where we are. We MUST, for example, put ourselves down slightly to connect with people on a real level.  Ill close with a great example. If I watch the new season of doctor who (or Star Wars or anything), and I think that making the doctor trans or bisexual or non binary or whatever the fuck takes AWAY from doctor who, pulls you out of the universe, and is cringe, Im going to go onto social media and type the new season of doctor who sucks.   Every piece of content agreeing with that sentiment will be from the mouths of the far right pipeline. Filled with Conservative leaning influencers who are capitalizing on the anti common sense take, to get views. But then the algorithms take over, and eventually Im recommended a video (how wokism killed doctor who). And if Im not strong of mind, Im sucked in. If I have less exposure to leftist issues or people then I think  wow the left are crazy they must all be crazy. There is NOT A SINGLE piece of content about doctor who praising it, without ALSO saying how its such a big deal and such progress, how representative and diverse. THATS NOT THE POINT OF THE SHOW. The show sucks, the writing sucks, everything got worse, and everyone is saying how its a huge social success, and that makes people on the right, and people in the middle think the left are the wierd ones And this happens with every single issue under the sun (some of which I mentioned earlier). Its time for the moderate dems to play ball, because its fucking clear the leftists wont even lift a finger to vote, let alone self reflect.  Its time for moderate people like myself who feel the same way to stop hiding their views because of fear of retaliation from the far left. All this view hiding in service of progress has left a void, and the conservatives are absolutelt filling that void. We want change? The wounds are the minority vote and the inflation bullshit and the misinformation,the disease is the extreme leftism that leaves a void.

Driving up the price of imported goods in a capitalism driven country just means domestic producers will follow that price increase up, stopping just shy of tariffed options. When has an American company not taken the option to charge more? It makes everything more expensive.2. We simply dont have the resources for some things because they dont naturally occur on or in our land. The flip side is that in some cases we do have the resource but our demand would likely decimate what we have - timber for instance. Either way you look at it, saying we have the resources for everything is a lie.3. Declaring that other countries need us more than we need them is false. You could argue this based solely on bare essentials and it _could_ be true, but is America a bare essentials country? Not even close. The U.S. is a net importer meaning we dont have the luxury of flipping a switch to become a net exporter. America is a service based economy by close to a 2:1 margin. We simply do not produce goods at a meaningful level. You cannot stand up factories overnight and change that. Look at computer chips which are as essential as water these days. Fabs and foundries take years to build and bring online. Ultimately our economy is so interwoven with the world that trying to forcefully tear it out will simply inflict hardship on everyone involved.4. He wants to do away with federal income tax and give companies tax breaks to manufacture in America. That leaves no income stream for the government to operate. Trump saying tariffs would replace federal income would is a laughable claim if so many people didnt buy into it hook, line, and sinker. Tariffs fall to the consumer to pay, there is no meaningful income generated for the government.His entire plan is a house of cards that fights against itself.

They no longer have to be right or accurate, as long as they feel like they've won. Compare that to the thoughtful dialogue and trust in evidence based policy that millennials and Gen X grew up watching with Obama.The Overton window has shifted so far right for this young generation. I've seen comments on that sub that they voted for Trump because they are centrists and don't like the far left. In their minds Trump is now centrism and a middle of the road corporate Democrat in Kamala was somehow \\"far left\\". It is what it is at this point, and being angry about it and telling them they are wrong/dumb only entrenches them into their viewpoints. Is the entire generation lost?

It's honestly simpler than that. Clearly logic is not something we can argue, nor is facts Mental Inertia and confirmation bias are two things which are WAY too easy to manipulate with logic. No, we need to appeal to emotion. And the first step in undoing this mess is to acknowledge that no matter where your political affiliations lie, your emotions are valid and to not discount them. Here's what I mean. Lets look at the issue of gun control. A conservative voter might say, and I'm paraphrasing hyperbolically. \\"I need all the guns, It's my right!\\" I would ask, why do you need all the guns? And we'll get the answer of: \\"So if the government every comes marching I'll have something to defend myself!\\" but lets dig deeper. What's the emotion that fuels the opinion. Well that's fear, fear and anxiety of your way of life being changed, of not fully understanding the system and having it screw you over, of protecting your family.  Democrats have this same fear, we have this same emotion, we just choose to try and fix it differently, ironically on the opposite side of the issue. We want less guns and more controls to feel that sense of safety, and know our children are safe in schools. We can acknowledge that the emotion is valid, while disagreeing with the solution, and propose one of our own. If you distill every issue to an emotion and ALWAYS speak to that side, backed up with facts. That is how you win. This election was not about facts, this was about emotional validation. Trump does this naturally because he feels an emotion like envy, spite, hate, anxiety, animosity, and it's immediately channeled out of his mouth. Even the stupid fluff stuff, \\"Like we love Wisconsin, oh yes we love you Wisconsin\\" drums up an emotion. Dial up the stress enough and give someone any shred of emotional validation and they'll walk into fire for you. Even over their own self interest.","title":"\\"Misinformation works [...] There is NO candidate that can change this.

It could be lessened or delayed for companies who are making efforts to increase US production (such as TSMC, who is building plants in the US). Some of the assembly and parts sourcing that causes a tariff to apply can be moved elsewhere. We actually saw the latter example happen during the tariff implementations of Trump's first term, where some companies began to move assembly and production out of China and into other nations to avoid those tariffs.As it stands, we already know that the economic landscape is dramatically favoring China. Fixing that might incur some short-term problems, in the same way Milei warned the people of Argentina that there would be pain at the start of his plans to fix their economy.

However, NYC is a very different city from many of the swing states, and many of these things aren't applicable.I've lived in NYC for 12 years, and South Florida prior to that. Some of these issues are not unique to Democratic governance. For example, \\"the braindead symbolism\\" is something republicans are great at, just look at all the lawsuits Desantis passed against big tech and Disney to spite \\"the woke\\". Also, the state amendment on abortion isn't just symbolism, its added friction incase the federal government decides to pass a nationwide ban. We've seen this exact conflict of state vs federal law before with marijuana legalization. Broken promises are a constant theme of Trump. Border walls, Mexico paying for it, protecting womens rights... this is not exclusive to democrats, and i'd argue a bigger problem with republican leaders.Ill end by saying I highly agree with this paragraph: \\"Democrats are making too many promises;?\\". To be fair, Trump does the same thing, but hes not held to the same standard of integrity and people give him a pass for ranting. He also drives home 1 or 2 points, mainly immigration.

Midterms are hard enough in the best of years, like how there have been an entire 5 midterm elections since the Democratic-Republican party split up where the President's party *gained* seats in the House. And considering how they managed to cause two government shutdowns in a row, including the longest one in US history, the *last* time they had a trifecta, I *really* don't think 2026 will be a repeat of 2002.For reference: There have actually been 13 midterm elections where the President's party picked up seats in the House. It's just that the list includes 8 of the first 9 midterm elections. And considering how the Federalists managed to fade into such obscurity that James Monroe (D-R) even ran unopposed in 1820, with the pro-Jacksonian and anti-Jacksonian factions splitting into the Democratic and Republican parties respectively by 1830, I don't think it's really meaningful to count those midterms.

In the United States, around Donald Trump and his extreme brand of politics, a new model has emerged whereby a victory in an election is to be interpreted as carte blanche for subjugating and punishing the losing side.This is not the system that Americans signed up for, implicitly or otherwise. It is true that under the rules of democracy, no political faction is supposed to get their own way all the time. But defeat in an election, was never supposed to an event as monumental and catastrophic, as military defeat and occupation by a foreign power. And yet the feeling of most Democrats now, seems to be the same as that of the man in a famous photograph who watched the Nazis march into Paris.If Trump and his allies refuse to respect any of the norms, traditions and conventions of America, then why should other Americans feel bound by them? Why should they feel locked into a system that the Republicans have disregarded and reduced to a cruel mockery?The Democrats have a substantial power base in the blue states. They also have a lot of young, active, capable people. Isnt it time to divorce yourselves from these neighbours who *hate* you and define themselves around their hatred for you?Start a new country. Forward-looking, with a new and better constitution. Then there will be hope again.The mere threat of secession, if were serious enough and taken seriously, could have been enough to derail the Trump bandwagon.

There are also more trees in the northern hemisphere now than there were 100 years ago due to reforestation efforts. Society adapts in large part due to Capitalisms incentive to innovate. The fact that Trump won is not the end of the world. His main points of focus are on deregulation and increased energy production in order to bring costs down and increase the disposable income we have due to lower prices. That results in increased prosperity. In places like California, which is also becoming a desert, he talks about diverting the runoff water to supply farmers with sustainable irrigation.

But similarly to how the article points out all the split-ticket voters who put Democrats in a lot of state positions (e.g. resoundingly rejecting Mark Robinson), I *really* don't think there's going to be a lot of appetite for the doomers' worst fears, like canceling elections.Trump will *absolutely* be a threat with executive orders, which blue states will have to fight. But conservatives are too enamored by the \\"American Way\\" to do anything that would remove the threat of midterms. And if 2018 is anything to go by, we might even manage to top 1974 this time and make the *new* worst midterm elections for the Republicans. (Especially if Trump manages to cause stagflation, like also led to the 1974 blue wave)","title":"Trump has a destructive plan for America.

Harris maintained the Democratic hold on the prosperous, well-educated inner suburbs around major cities. But in most of them, her partys margins declined relative to its 2020 results  The result was that in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Harriss margins in these big suburbs were closer to Hillary Clintons in 2016 than Bidens in 2020. That wasnt enough to withstand what Ive called the pincer move of Trumps concurrent gains in the smaller, mostly white, blue-collar places and the much more diverse urban cores. The most apt precedent for this election may be 1980. Laboring under widespread discontent, including over a raging bout of inflation, Carter tried to use his campaign to shift attention to the risks he said his right-wing rival, Ronald Reagan, represented, with some success: Doubts about Reagan did keep Carter close in the polls. But in the campaigns final days, voters decided that continuity with Carter represented a greater risk than change with Reaganand flocked to the challenger in crushing numbers. Reagans victory in 1980 solidified a realignment in American politics that began under his Republican predecessor, Richard Nixon. Reagan cemented working-class white voters into the conservative movements electoral coalitionboth white southern evangelical Christians and northern industrial workers in places such as Michigans Macomb Countywho became lastingly known as Reagan Democrats. Those voters remain a cornerstone GOP constituency: Even four-plus decades later, they were the two groups that supported Trump in the largest numbers on Tuesday.Many Republicans believe that Trump now has the chance to secure an equally significant shift in the party allegiance of Black men and Latino voters of both genders, who voted for him in historic numbers this week. That opportunity surely exists. But realizing it in a lasting way will require Trump and the Republican Party to maintain the support of millions of voters of color and justify their faith in him on the economy over any concern about policies such as mass deportation and more aggressive law enforcement.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/O4hjDlAm](https://theatln.tc/O4hjDlAm)","title":"What Swayed Trump Voters Was Bidenomics"},{"text":"fwiw, good on you, but also shutting it down at 4 is a world away from managing it when they are teens.

You dont need to read anything else.  All these other articles are pretty much nonsense.  The other thing is there are much lower standards for Republicans.  Nobody is willing to say that but it is true.  Democrats mainly win when there is a big fuck up on the Republican side.  When Obama, Clinton, and Biden took office there was either economic slowdown, financial collapse, Covid, etc.  On the other hand Bush jr and Trump took office when a Democratic president had done very well for 8 years.  Republicans have always had the bigger and more reliable base.  With Trump that base has increased and he is their almighty god.  Trump has a floor of 30-40% that pledge allegiance to him. Democrats are probably at 20-25% as a floor and even that group is less forgiving than the republican base.  Trumps base turns out on his name alone.  Democrats need large scale get out the vote efforts spending millions of dollars.   I bet you exit polls would say they trust Trump more than Harris.  Any unbiased person would say that is ridiculous given how much Trump lies, but that is the environment Democrats are up against.  The only thing Democrats can do is find the right candidate, care more about optics/messaging, and take more normal stands instead of worrying about losing different constituencies. Look to Democratic presidents who won in the past.  Obama won Florida and deported more than Bush.  Both he and Bill Clinton were for border security without being racist.  Clinton was for lower crime while advocating for gun control.  They also lowered taxes for the middle class and protected or extended government programs for social security, Medicare, healthcare.  These are pretty general positions that should translate across states.","title":"More voters saw Trump as the candidate of change: Exit poll analysis"},{"text":"Hes not hurting the right people. \\nTrumps own supporters since like 2017.","title":"Trump campaign quietly distances itself from RFK Jr after new vaccine safety comments"},{"text":"Its extremely sad.
