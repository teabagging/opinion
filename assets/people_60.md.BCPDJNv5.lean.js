Rogan himself is as bad as the New York Times in his approach to 'Sane-Washing' Trump.  I have a feeling that more than 70% of his listeners support Trump.  He is the Bill O'Reilly of the Pod-Cast world and become a victim of his own fame.  I will never take him seriously again.  He is just endorsing a chump who believes the rich should not have to pay the same level of progressive tax that the middle-class have to pay.  While being able to hide most of his wealth in loopholes.  He is a member of the working rich who believe in promoting a class society based on wealth.  A society that allowing you more access to equal human rights and services, such as health, dental care and proper housing, the more wealthy you are.  There was a time in this country when being born an American meant something, above and beyond how wealthy you were.  This birthright, implied a basic care for all of its citizens, which was above and beyond all other countries in the world, and was once a shining example to the rest of the world pointing out that Democracy worked if you lived and supported a Democratic government based on the ideals of our Founding Fathers and the Constitution.  What has always been in opposition to those ideals, even in this country and among it own citizens, was the struggle between those who wished to rule others outside of government restrictions and those who wanted to change and reinterpret the Constitution to benefits themselves financially and those you didn't want that to be true, those who wanted all men to be equal.  At some point all of us have to decide what kind of person we want to be whether we support the Constitution in the spirit in which if was written or not.  There are only three different kinds of people in America.  Those who flat out honestly don't believe in equal rights, but still support the Constitution, (aka sometime assholes); those who do believe in equal rights completely, (aka are great Americans), and last are those who lie, who want us to believe they support equal rights, but they don't, (aka liars who don't support the Constitution).  It is the liars who believe that being born in America entitles them the right to change the Constitution, and take away the basic human rights of  Americans who they feel are beneath them, for their own benefit and financial reward.  I have to put Rogan in the first spot, he doesn't believe in equal rights.  I hate to say this but I believe this true, which sometimes makes him an asshole, and he is fine with that, which is why I can say it.  His support and endorsement of Trump just makes me realize he isn't intelligent enough to have earned the influence he has garnered, by pandering to those less smart than him.  He is one of those kind of people right on the cusp of being smart enough to not understanding he's not that smart.  Smart people, listen to people who are smarter than they are and change their minds.  This is a basic statement of fact, which is responsible for the evolution of all great changes in human history; changes which also make the world a better place to live.  Elections are not popularity contests based on the less intelligent making decisions which are not that good for the future of our country based on a flawed assumptions and an elementary understanding of facts.  They are based on what is best for a nation that leaves no one behind.  A Capitalist (POP) America, run and governed by Corporations and Wall Street, whose basic premise is (\\"Profit Over People)\\" is bad everyone as it is a class structure that benefits only the rich.  A POP Economy is based on 'Trickle Down Economics' which never works.  This is the government Trump supports.

No culture is inherently oppressive.On another CMV today someone even explained how there are progressive scholars within Islam, the most often touted \\"inherently oppressive\\" culture/religion. While they might be a minority within a largely conservative religion/culture(s) - they still exist, and they show how the religion/culture(s) in question could grow;[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gk33fs/comment/lvi8qg1/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gk33fs/comment/lvi8qg1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)Criticising conservative / oppressive aspects of cultures is not something that is genuinely taboo on the left. Sure there are some people who take it too far and will view any criticism as racism, but oftentimes those are the types who want something to weaponise. Most sensible leftists (including leftist commentators and news outlets) will criticise those aspects when pertinent.One example would be the recent Iranian protests over the hijab laws, which have been widely supported by the left, along with criticism of this oppressive aspect of Iranian / Islamic culture.But in the same breath they will defend that culture's right to exist against conservatives who will often use these aspects of these cultures to paint the entire culture as \\"barbaric\\". Ironically, often it is the right who want to replicate those same forms of oppression.And one key issue here is that of colonialism, which has set most nations apart from those in \\"the west\\" back in terms of both economic and social development. Is it a wonder that these nations are more conservative? The demand for them to change their entire culture is a continuation of that cultural colonialism. Is it not better instead to criticise certain aspects and encourage development of their own progressive movements?","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Its more of a dopamine addiction to be honest.

One is a unit of mass and one is a unit of force/weight, even if you convert one to the other the value is different.https://youtu.be/t705r8ICkRw?t=2162\\"why are you talking about thrust in tons, it's not technically a scientific thing.\\" - Dude who doesn't know every aviation/aerospace company in America uses aside from NASA Imperial units not SI.

It's also 9.81m/s2 not 10, no engineer would say g is 10.Then he talks about dividing by 10 thousand to get tonnes, clearly not knowing a metric tonne and an imperial ton he started with are different units. Even if it was it would be 1 thousand not 10.He makes several mistakes a 1st year undergrad engineering student wouldn't make.He's repeating things he's heard people say without understanding them.

I think you're assuming maybe that I support everything Muslims do. I do not. Banning face coverings for identity purposes are one thing but that is not what I am objecting to, I am objecting to hijab bans which are the scarf coverings.Also, when France bans all religious imagery all it really does is Force atheism.It would be like if there was a law that said that anyone who was pregnant could not hold public office, while it apply to both men and women equally it clearly obviously is meant to Target women. A law that says that it is illegal for people to sleep under a bridge May apply to both rich people and poor people but it clearly is meant to affect only poor people. That is the point of critical legal analysis, where you understand that just because a law may look like it is applying to everyone equally it can still affect only certain groups more than others and therefore it can still be targeted.A person wearing a hijab is a personal decision. I reject such a ban. All it does is prevent Muslims and typically Muslim women from being able to participate. Because if a Muslim woman had to choose between participating and not wearing the hijab they would choose not participating.It is not up to other people to the determine what the hijab means or whether or not it brings dignity to the person wearing it. It is completely arrogant to do so. I do not support everything that Muslims do neither do I support everything that Western cultures do. This is the problem that people have. They feel like it's an all or nothing thing, you either support a culture completely or you reject it completely and there's never any kind of nuance which is what I reject itself. I reject the idea that we should remove nuance but instead understand that culture is not a all or nothing thing but instead a thing that is alive and complex. It's not made by a single person but by a collection of people and that it is itself a human creation and so therefore should be judged as such.https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/india/schoolgirls-hijab-ban-udupi-karnataka-b2006773.htmlhttps://thermtide.com/14034/popular/my-hijab-is-a-symbol-of-power-not-oppression/","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"I'm slightly surprised I haven't seen ads like that in WI, but it makes sense why not: when Roe v.

I've seen the other side of things, and this is not a life worth having. But a democratic system of institutions?

It should be obvious. I wanted to make this post as I feel like I understand the language and mindset a bit more than someone who has never been in the community. Ive been part of many denominations within it, so I have a good (if outdated) insight of what have traditionally had more universal values of this faith. I wanted to challenge the logic with what is supposed to be the bedrock of evangelicals- which is the Bible. I remember learning how many Christian types have layered these other literature on top of the Bible - officially approved interpretations/ prayer / songs / lessons and that it is often older and lasting. And others have systems of saints and non-biblical authority figures.One of the weaknesses and strengths of evangelicals is they are free-forming, in organic subsets and communities. There is no oversight to the full evangelic faith, compared to say Catholicism or Episcopalians. There are denominations that would identify as evangelical, completely autonomous churches, and unaffiliated people. It allows them to adapt to different cultures quickly and to have local leaders being the ones who curate interpretations without heavy and disconnected  umbrella bureaucracy.So in one sense, they tend to value the text of the Bible strongly as their authority. In the other side, their leaders have strong local authority, limited accountability, and no official evangelic oversight (outside of denominations or coalitions) to ensure they are actually representing the message of the Bible and not pulling random verses to create a power imbalance and a disconnect from what the Bible clearly says are the most important things.So Im trying to be an interpreter to challenge the assumptions of a group that has limited communication with people who believe differently.Which, by the way, it was my Christian college experience way back when that taught me about listening and learning from others, so hopefully that ability has not gotten completely lost in the last 10 years.","title":"How faith is shaping evangelical Christian voters views of Trump and Harris"},{"text":"This is the courage steadfastness and genius he would bring to trump reign.

Cultural expressions differ based on gender, ethnicity, education, etc. Even in Saudi Arabia, for example, there are progressive political movements. Even in the South not everyone is an Evangelical Christian who believes in patriarchy. It's a diverse area with many different cultural and political expressions.And politics is very fluid. For example, I think today we will see many women in the South come out and vote against the Republican party based on the issue of abortion. They might have voted differently 8 years ago. Maybe this policy has shifted their outlook not just on the Republican party and Trump but also on other issues. So people move around a lot politically and a lot depends on how issues affect them and what they are willing to compromise on at any given moment (things like economic class and gender can overcome cultural indoctrination).It's also important to remember that the US throughout the post-war years has backed right wing movements and repressive governments in order to crush progressive social and political movements in the Middle East and Asia. The US funded the spread of radical Islam and armed right wing Islamic militias and governments from Afghanistan, Pakistan (General Zia), and Indonesia (General Suharto, who came into power by massacring a million people and crushing a millions strong Communist and feminist movement), to Iraq and Egypt, etc. The non-Western immigrants in the US come from these places and are influenced by these things. When a progressive movement is completely repressed, the conservative side becomes dominant. But we can see how culture and religion can shift based on people's environment. This is where Marx's theory of historical materialism is useful. A lot of Muslims in the US tend to be more progressive than many white Christians. I think it's a right-wing talking point that progressives just simply overlook bigotry by racial minorities. I don't think it's based in any reality. Progressives are simply standing up against oppression regardless of what someone's personal beliefs are. We want everyone to be able to live their lives. No one deserves oppression or suffering, even if they don't believe in gay marriage or whatever. What I see a lot from the right-wing with regards to Gaza is a justification for violence and genocide against Palestinians because apparently they are all homophobes (ignoring the illiberal aspects of Israeli society).

Covid was used as an excuse to force mail in voting on the US.  Every single metric established over the past 100 that shows the winning candidate was broken because we fundamentally changed the way we vote.  We added back in the insecure method of voting imaginable thats the easiest to fraud and the hardest to prove as the fraud votes used at that of registed voters that no longer vote for whatever reason.  They harvest their ballots and dump them en masse. No one ever contacts the mail in voters and verifies votes with identity so if they don't make it suspicous looking and just fill it out it will pass through and be counted and no one will ever be the wiser.  Course you can add in extras under the cover of darkness when you fake you water leaks and cover the windows send poll watchers home then restart counting.   Have your fake watchers that switched from D to R to vote for haley against Trump help run them through for ya in them important areas.. Then of course you set the machines to count trump votes worth .3 and kammy worth .7 like with old joe last time... then of course the 30 million illegals that they let in to vote as welll with 15 million registered over a month ago with no id (every civilized country in the world has voter id, not having it is only good for fraud) see tucker interviews catherine englehardt for more on illegals voting.     \\nThere is no way in hell I will trust the result of this election if Trump doesn't win it.

Once the dems have their mail in no one else gets in there and they make huge gains provided the margins aren't too big.  That is all we can hope for this time around.  That the margins are so large that a fraud would be too noticeable but I really don't think they care.  They will probably blatantly do it as they are hoping for civil war and unrest as an excuse to disarm America.   That is why they changed the laws and made it so the military can kill American citizens.

Nothing will be done again because there is no proof of those types of fraud. The democrats have been using it to stay relevent for many years...

We as a society cannot give them liberation, it must come from within.There is no way for us to do this without essentially exploiting them.This also makes the assumption that there aren't already movements from within the country attempting to liberate themselves. Those groups must be supported on their terms, not on ours. It is completely arrogant of us to assume that we have the answer for them.Liberation can never come from outside, it can only come from within. The Middle East for example is unstable partly because of Western involvement. Why would another country want to have to rely on some other culture to liberate them? That's not liberation. [In 1953, the United States and the United Kingdom orchestrated a coup to remove Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, primarily to protect Western oil interests after he nationalized Iran's oil industry, which had been under British control. The CIA, in collaboration with British intelligence, initiated Operation Ajax, employing propaganda, bribery, and orchestrated protests to destabilize Mosaddegh's government. This operation culminated in Mosaddegh's overthrow on August 19, 1953, leading to the reinstatement of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's autocratic rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)We removed a democratically elected leader from Iran because they wanted to nationalize their oil.

You do that when you register. The state of NC was found by a federal court to have audited ID ownership by race and wrote the law such that all the most common state issued IDs to black people are considered invalid forms of ID.Its not about having AN ID. Theyre against that. Its about them trying to pick and choose the electorate by selecting only IDs that are likely to be owned by Republican voters. The federal judge used the phrase near surgical precision to describe how effectively the NC government had invalidated all the IDs that were found to be most likely to be owned by black people. Theyre also against giving FREE IDs because  they want it as an unofficial poll tax that only IDs that have fees associated with them are considered valid. Thats meant to keep the poors from voting.Please look into my claims about voter id laws being targeted to exclude specific demographic groups, and the Republican opposition to giving free voter IDs to people who correctly register, or giving a free ID to all citizens upon their 18th birthday to register with.","title":"If Trump loses the election what will convince you it was fair?"},{"text":"Step 1.

You will see praise from some Western cultures and not praise from others. It is not an All or nothing thing. You'll see left-wingers or leftists or whoever praising a certain cultures which of course and not praising others as well as praising certain aspects and not praising others. When people who are part of the progressive or left-wing movement talk about non-western cultures, it is important to treat them as you would any other culture. A lot of times people just simply stigmatize non-western cultures simply because they are non-western which is what left wingers and progressives are trying to fight against. The idea that a culture is simply bad because it is non-western. Meanwhile the very people who are criticizing those non-western cultures do not make those same criticisms towards Western cultures which is where the problem comes about. For example, in France, the government enforces strict secularism in public schools, prohibiting the display of conspicuous religious symbols, including Islamic headscarves, to maintain religious neutrality. In 2016, police officers in Nice were photographed compelling a woman to remove her burkini on the beach, enforcing local bans on full-body swimwear. These actions are based on the principle of la?cit, as outlined in the 2004 law banning conspicuous religious symbols in schools. In places like Denmark, the government enacted a law in 2018 prohibiting the wearing of face-covering garments, including burqas and niqabs, in public spaces. Similarly, in Belgium, a nationwide ban on full-face veils in public was implemented in 2011, reflecting a broader European trend towards restricting religious attire in public areas.If it is wrong to force women to wear the burqa or hijab then it is equally wrong to force them to not wear it. Otherwise it is just bigotry. It is wrong to force women to wear or not wear a particular piece of clothing. That is what people who are progressive are talking about.If you found out on the news that a particular computer exploded in someone's house and you found out that it was a Chinese computer many people would probably just assume that it exploded cuz it's Chinese and therefore would stop buying Chinese computers however a person who is actually interested in computers would buy the computer as well as buying more computers from the company to figure out what exactly went wrong. Was it because the computers were Chinese and how did that contribute to the explosion? Were there certain parts that were used and are those parts in other computers from other countries? Was it because of something that the person who owned the computer did, did they stick something in there that they shouldn't or was it truly because of the manufacturing? A person who actually cares about computers would want to know the actual cause and the same goes for cultures. People who are actually interested in other cultures would want to know exactly what makes a culture a culture and if their truly is something bad about it then trying to explain it simply through biology just isn't good enough. That's not scientific. Biology doesn't make you a bigot. Simply explaining something as bad because it's non-western is just as much of a problem as saying that something is good just because it's non-western.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Good to hear.","title":"51 -  registered republican for 30 years.

We recognize that many \\"traditional cultures\\" are just as reactionary and oppressive as western reactionaries are. It's just that we also recognize that criticism of non-western cultures that comes from a place of cultural superiority and imperialism isn't going to help. The only people who can reform a culture are the people actually from that culture who understand it and can make meaningful change. There's a famous piece that anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod published shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan that summed up this position extremely well. She observes the focus in western media on the oppressed Afghani women as a justification for the invasion, but argues that westerners unfamiliar with Afghanistan didn't really understand what Afghani women wanted or needed. Moreover, nearly everything that westerners could do to intervene in Afghanistan would just end up making things worse, by making the lives of the few Afghani reformers  much harder, while causing significant backlash that just enabled and emboldened the conservatives. I think we can all agree that history has completely vindicated her: everything that the west did to \\"save\\" the women of Afghanistan has massively backfired and in the end just made it all worse. This isn't to say that it isn't always the place of westerners to criticize things that are bad, no matter where we see them. But it is to say that a lot of that criticism is counter-productive.

In many cases, this supposed evidence simply reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the basic functions of election administration, as is frequently apparent on Musks Election Integrity Community on X.Musk has requested that users submit instances of election integrity issues to this community, which features branding from his pro-Trump Super PAC, America PAC. It has quickly become an online corkboard for misinformation and conspiracies.Speaking about Musks effort to turn X into a Trumpist election fraud-watching machine, a Trump campaign official tells Rolling Stone that we  including the former president  are head over heels in love with what hes doing.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-election-workers-threats-1235153486/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-election-workers-threats-1235153486/)","title":"Election Workers Are Facing Immense Pressure to Back Trumps Lies"},{"text":"MAGA is so unlikable that theres not a single well liked celebrity on their side.

If she wins all confidence in US power will immediately drop , the markets will take a hit , and everything will quickly get even worse than they already are . She has no policy , she fakes accents and laughs when nervous or unknowing of whats going on (which is always) - she talks in circles and knows nothing at all about anything important . If she wins there is nothing - absolutely nothing that will make it seem like she won fairly . The democrats have also stated on multiple occasions that a) they will do ANYTHING , and literally ANHTHING to prevent Trump (that included cheating and lying) b) theyve floated the idea that even if he won they wouldnt certify c) theyre already saying theyll be counting ballots for days after the election (this means if Trump pulls ahead theyll find more votes- if this isnt obvious I dont know what to tell you) d) theyre already barring Republican poll watchers from counting stations and lawsuits have already been entered over this . Expect things like counting to be shut down in the dead of night to be resumed later and a massive spike for Kamala to come out of nowhere in a situation like - 100,000 votes for Kamala , 120 for Trump  statistically impossible results kind of deal - and then expect theyll have an excuse for it that also doesnt make sense but will be attached to every and any mention of it as a fact check immediately because people are stupid.","title":"If Trump loses the election what will convince you it was fair?"},{"text":"Im no polling or election result professional, but in my opinion, a win in Iowa would be a huge turnaround for the state and I feel like it would be unlikely that Harriss momentum and turnout would be limited to that state.","title":"Iowa Poll: Kamala Harris leapfrogs Donald Trump to take lead near Election Day."},{"text":"Makes you question what the meaning of life is to these folk.

It's possible for someone to disagree with you on a deeply felt issue like abortion and still be a good person in other areas of life.But if you *do* think this way, then voting for someone who disagrees with you on one of your key issues isn't just voting for someone who's got one bad position.

This is exactly where racists think Black people should be, serving white people. To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. To your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. *Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. Since Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about \\"those people\\" when Black people are around.

But II got a 66 2/3 chance of winning, 'cause Jill Stein KNOOOWS she can't beat me, and she's not even gonna try!So Kamala Harris, you take your 33 1/3 chance minus my 25% chance, and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning on Election Day. But then you take my 75% chance of winning (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 2/3 chanpercents... I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning on Election Day!Comrade Kamala, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you on Election Day!Edit: After posting this, I went back to look at the comments, and I'm glad I wasn't the only person who thought of Steiner Math.","title":"BREAKING: Donald Trump declares he has a 96.2% chance of winning the election tomorrow"},{"text":"Those who mirror their lives after Rogan are pathetic losers.

It operates on an inversion of logic and morality.We (the in group) are good by definition because we believe in our version of god and the resulting theology tells us that what we do is good. Therefore we can not fall for the anti-christ because, if we did, then we wouldn't be good people and that is impossible.Fundamentally, that's why they can support such horrible policies and people. They completely disconnect morality from words and actions and define it entirely in terms of identity. It's easy to do so, because that's what faith in general tells you to do, identifying what is good and moral with the will of a deity that never speaks, except maybe through them. That's why religion has nothing meaningful to say about morality: it reduces every moral question to a tautology based on an easily assumed authority. \\"because god says so\\", but god does not exist and therefore does not speak, so it's actually \\"because I say so\\" or \\"because the leader says so\\". By outsourcing morality to god, it becomes easier to also outsource choice and moral responsibility for those choices. The logical extension of this, and what separates them from most religious people, is to believe in a narrative where they have no choice or agency to do what they want to do anyway, either because they are merely following god's will or because their enemies are servants of the devil. This is a text book case of bad faith as the purpose of this narrative is that it absolves them of the responsibility of their actions.In short: By definition, anything and anyone they identify with can not be wrong or evil. Therefore they don't need to be afraid of supporting the anti-christ. They don't need to be afraid that they're doing evil as long as they believe in god, who is them, and follow god's will, which is their own.","title":"How faith is shaping evangelical Christian voters views of Trump and Harris"},{"text":"I can't get through the paywall.

It is impossible to assess or standardise the dose received with this technology, since you cannot predict or measure how many LNPs get into the cells, how much of the mRNA is assembled into proteins, or how much protein is produced in any individual vaccine recipient. You also can't predict or assess where in the body the material will accumulate, although it seems to concentrate in the liver and gonads.

There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  Another unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is \\"When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.\\"  So, no surprise there either.There were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out \\"What's going on there?\\"One pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as \\"Little Russia.\\"  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.Another red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.So... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.Edit: Some words and some grammar.Edit 2:  Apparently I made some very wrong assumptions about the demographics of Breezy Point.  Turns out it's not a super wealthy neighborhood (despite being a gated community on a private beach).

This is obviously not true, since the founding fathers, who understood liberty and democracy better than anyone, did not believe so. In addition, all people under age 18 cannot vote, although they too comprise a significant portion of the population. So we cannot say that women should be able to vote simply because they are a large part of the population.We conclude that increasing the size and scope of government is unequivocally bad, Gibbs added. And since womens suffrage has caused this to occur on a larger scale than any other cause in history, we conclude that the United States has suffered as a result of womens suffrage.SourceWhats ironic is, Gibbs is black, and the founding fathers did not grant him the right to vote either. Yet, Im sure he doesnt believe his right to vote should be removed.Edit to add:Republican Lt. Governor Mark Robinson:I absolutely want to go back to the America where women couldnt vote, Robinson said in a newly resurfaced video of his remarks at a March 2020 event hosted by the Republican Women of Pitt County.SourceEdit 2:When maps showed women overwhelmingly preferred Clinton, Twitter users started #RepealThe19th.Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEights editor-in-chief, tweeted images of the voting maps split by gender, which caused a grossly sexist trend to being on Twitter: #RepealThe19th. The 19th refers to the 19th Amendment in which women are granted the right to vote.SourceEdit 3:Peter Thiel, puppet master to VP hopeful JD Vance:The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to womentwo constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarianshave rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron.Thiel goes further than simply saying that voting itself is bad for business, postulating that women voters in particular have provided crucial support for social welfare spending and the regulation of industrySourceEdit 4:Ann Coulter:Coulter criticized Stefanik, a Republican representing New York, and several other women in a Substack post published on Tuesday, ending with the claim that it was time to reconsider womens suffrage because of their alleged actions against free speech.Source","title":"How the Republican War on Women Extends to Voting Rights"},{"text":"Buttercup?","title":"Trump at final rally hints at profane insult of Pelosi that starts with a b"},{"text":"Not an expert but have exp and had a need to read up on a lot of stuff to deal with a past partner.

At the end of October, Musk told his followers to inform an &amp;quot;Election Integrity Community&amp;quot; on X about election problems, even though Musk&amp;#039;s pro-Trump America Pac oversees the feed, which included some claims of election cheating that state officials in Pennsylvania and Arizona had debunked.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1gk5rf8/alarm_grows_over_trump_and_musks_blizzard_of/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~696107 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **election**^#1 **Trump**^#2 **fraud**^#3 **Musk**^#4 **claim**^#5","title":"Alarm grows over Trump and Musks blizzard of baseless voter-fraud claims"},{"text":"Economics and the slow implosion of the middle class, plus the lack of upwards socioeconomic mobility, is the root cause of so many of our societal issues.","title":"A pro-Trump influencer says a Russian agent paid him $100 to post a fake voter fraud video.

He comes up with these ideas and markets the hell out of them, and then he hires people and yells at them to try to get them to follow through and build the thing that he imagined. When it works, they do some interesting things. When it doesn't, it falls absolutely flat.    He promised the world a cheap autonomous vehicle that would revolutionize the taxi market. At his press conference he revealed a two-seat vehicle with a limited range that is likely to cost $60,000 new,  that doesn't even have a big enough trunk for two Airline size bags and Tesla still hasn't ironed out the bugs in their automated driving system enough to make it Road safe.  The assembled Tech press were profoundly unimpressed and Tesla stock price immediately tumbled a couple of percent, reducing musks paper net worth by about $20 billion.   The Cyber taxi vanished going back into whatever development hell produced those bizarre design compromises.","title":"Musk Immediately Quits His Super PACs Town Hall on X Because of Technical Glitches | \\nThe pre-election event started 20 minutes late but had 200,000 listeners  then couldn't get callers on the line to ask the billionaire Trump supporter a question"},{"text":"4 years of Trump were about 100x easier for us.  Had about 4or5x the money and my wife hadn't lost her job due to the democrat economy forcing a business our county had, had since the 70s to shut it doors forever.   If you don't make a lot I don't see how people survive.  If it werent for family we would be much worse off I really feel for people without that.    So now we are making much less and everything cost 4x more so forgive me if I think that TRUMP is a better choice after 4 years of democrats destroying what he had going.Its like this we put a new tire on in 2020 and got a flat we have driven on it for 4 years.  We have a extra one in the barn that we have already used.  May have not liked the tread but the best but it was a good tire and kept the car on the road.  Costs nothing to switch it out.  Electing Kamala would be saying, nope I think I will drive on this flat for another 4 years waiting on it to inflate again.\\nOr a cruder one would be electing kamala is like shting your pants and changing your shirt.Edit: watched this go from +8 as people browsed new organically, now the shills found it and im back to 1 within a few minutes...
