This is the one major point Ill take issue with. Why isnt it fair to hold a flaw in the polls against it? We use the polls to help us predict what is going to happen. We cant just discount factors that make the polls less accurate. I agree with you that polls have largely been more accurate than most people give them credit for. But I would also like to ask what is the point? If every poll is going to show a race within the margin of error what information is this actually providing. Is it just to drive clicks of nervous voters to news sites. Is it to provide CNN talking heads with a narrative to talk about every night. I have been very frustrated this year where story after story has made small changes into surges and plummets when besides the couple weeks before Biden dropped out the race has been within the margin of error.","title":"CMV: The unreliability of polls has been overstated."},{"text":"Didnt Hulk Hogan already do a 180 and regretted appearing at the event for Trump?","title":"Beyonc will appear with Vice President Kamala Harris in Houston on Friday at a campaign rally"},{"text":"Vote.

Can you not extend that same consideration to men? What if men are also constricted from going to college because of external factors or women simply dont want to have blue collar jobs. This goes back to a very common logical fallacy I see among people discussing gender issues. Mens issues are voluntary and self-inflicted, while womens issues are because of societal oppression. Furthermore, just because men are the ones oppressing men with the draft and the harsher sentencing doesnt mean that men as a group are not oppressed. Republicans are assholes, we know that. Men in power are terrible, however it doesnt absolve the rest of society from being complicit in that system. There was very little feminist *opposition* to the male-only draft.How do you think the patriarchy worked? How do you think Queen Victoria or Cleopatra got into power? Just because a woman was leading the country didnt mean that women werent being oppressed. Indeed, even in matriarchies the younger women are in fact bullied and harassed by their female superiors for not being the right kind of women, and for not upholding the standard of womanhood.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"A friend of mine in that category joked that CIS white gay men who are clean cut and straight passing whatever that means are the straight white male stereotype of the LGBT community, along with bi people in general.In other words, everyone and their mother is out here gatekeeping everyone no matter their background.","title":"Gay voters are smitten with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"https://www.kold.com/video/2024/10/24/suspect-arrested-after-mailbox-fire-damages-ballots-phoenix/?outputType=amp\\nThey've arrested someone but haven't released any details other than they're being booked into jail.","title":"They're Burning Ballots.

In the example OP gave, everyone else has multiple explicit declarations of support from others, and while OP supports those, they don't have a similar option for themselves. I'm fine with that, OP can live with that, and many other men can as well. However, I think at some point we must acknowledge that a lack of explicit support can lead to feelings of exclusion or otherness, even if you are surrounded by a majority of people who look like you.I would also like to add that I think most workplaces wouldn't be open to a support initiative for males, and there is an underlying fear of being further excluded by colleagues if they even tried (this is a general observation that I don't know is true outside of my environment, and I would like more input from others here).Even the best decisions made for the right reasons will have unintended consequences, and if those aren't willingly addressed, individuals will seek recourse and belonging where they can find it.

It won't help you at work or to make better friends. It's just a cheap thrill. I have spoken with a lot of male friends who have been honest that there are times in their lives with the incel-inflected misogyny that MAGA peddles had an allure.

There are few people harder to get along with them some leftists, and they make no effort to actually get stuff done and be successful. In fact, being successful seems to be a sin on the left!I also think all the privilege squawking doesn't help. It's a framing I would throw out. I would flip the script to say that white men exist as all Americans should exist, and others are held back. Instead of telling young men they are flawed and bad, get them to celebrate bringing everyone up. But even that is too facile. Looking at privilege through narrow lenses is how you turn off so many people. Telling a poor white person from West Virginia how privileged they are is not a great way to build a coalition. So, you could have white privilege and male privilege, but you could also have demerits from being poor and not having a great education.A good chunk of white people in the United States live pretty shitty lives, and it should be obvious that telling them how privileged they are is going to get them to hate you.I do think it is especially harmful and off-putting to tell teenage boys how they are inherently bad and not to expect a lot of them to rebel and be turned off by that.

The Nazis were true believers in their esoteric beliefs, and Trump doesn't really have any beliefs beyond racism and whatever he needs for power. He's very transactional.

However, I see a lot of people not wanting to do that. There are feminist groups that are purely focused on helping women and I respect them quite a bit, youll never hear a discussion of how awful men are or what men should be doing, or how men should hold other men accountable on behalf of women while at the same time saying men should help other men, its not womens job in response to male issues. All of those ideas are from mainstream feminists who want mens involvement in feminism while simultaneously resisting getting involved in male issues. They say that patriarchy hurts men too, but when you press on them, you find that they think the ratio of harm is 95:5 with women being the ones more affected, and that mens problems are more a secondary trickle down issue that will get solved as time goes on, rather than something automatic.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"I don't disagree about Harris, but I think you're understating the amount of evil Hillary would have committed.

Which gets a lot of resistance, but I think really it's more that Trump is trotting out a tired trick all authoritarians use of convincing followers that truth doesn't matter.

They have convinced themselves that empiricism is a weapon that progressive bullies use to make them feel bad, and they are entitled to the \\"opinion,\\" even if their opinion is the world is flat. The moral justification for this often comes down to arguing that everyone is a liar. So they don't so much defend Trump as argue that he's being held to an unfair standard. Hannah Arendt, who escaped Nazism and wrote eloquently about the psychology of totalitarianism described it with, \\"In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.\\"JD Vance saying he has to \\"create stories\\" about Haitians eating cats is a good example.

Its a PR thing instead of a real message.The one big exception to this as you mentioned was 2016 where the polls really underestimated the number of first time or infrequent voters that Trump was able to turn out (the so-called shy republican effect).

I know mine is not a popular opinion in the Beltway press, but all the alternative explanations for the rise in authoritarianism around the world don't make sense. It's not \\"economic anxiety\\" because it's not attached in any meaningful way to people's economic outcomes. It is social change, but that's been going on for a long time. I think what happened is that the explosion of social media allowed a lot of ugly, subterranean feelings to flourish and grow. It's also a firehose of disinformation. What one researcher into radicalism told me made sense: Radicalization is a matter of supply and demand. On the \\"demand\\" side, you have people who are angry, alienated or have grievances, whether justified or not. On the \\"supply\\" side, you have far-right recruiters making false promises that fascist politics will save them. Maybe we've had a rise on the demand side, but I find the evidence for that shaky. What we do have, indisputably, is a dramatic rise on the supply side because of social media. You can read more about that here: [https://www.salon.com/2023/06/30/shutting-down-the-right-wing-rabbit-hole-is-possible-first-follow-the-money/](https://www.salon.com/2023/06/30/shutting-down-the-right-wing-rabbit-hole-is-possible-first-follow-the-money/)I don't want to ban social media, at least most of the time.

It's women's rights and gay rights, for example. It's true that these have been tremendously increased since before the revolution,Wait you're telling me that women's rights and gay rights have improved since the 1950s. Wild. and seeing situations such as the coup in Iran, it's not unreasonable to think that any US-led replacement would be incredibly conservative.Explain what you mean by this.  But it is understandable given their situation against the US, and as someone in the west and currently living in the US, it makes far more sense to criticise the US's role in these policies. Why does it make sense? Why did turning against the US in the first place make sense?  If the US lets up the sanctions for example, there's no excuse to have these policies anymore.They're still going to have excuses for these policies even if the embargo goes away. Cool, that's good to know. Obviously Cuban censorship goes too far, far beyond either of these countries. But given your opinion about Ukraine, it is reasonable for Cuba to have some restrictions on their press given that they too have been at risk of an overthrown government since their inception.Well, no. There's a difference between policies implemented during a war a policies that have existed since the Revolution. Ukraine is in a war that's an existential threat to its existence as a state. Cuba might have some threats to the current regime. Those aren't the same thing. And obviously, this isn't just about press censorship but the whole authoritarian Cuban system.But if the US stops its antagonistic policy towards Cuba, there is no reason for censorship at all. Even if it continues, it can't be justified to the population.The reason for the censorship is to keep the regime in power despite its many and manifold failures. That doesn't go away with the end of the embargo. Cuba has never been on the level of the US or any country in Europe. My position is just that it's primarily due to the US sanctions.And I'm saying you haven't demonstrated that. It makes much more sense that its position is primarily due to its terrible economic policy, willingness to subject itself to economic vassalship of larger communist states, and the fact that its economy isn't very diverse. This just does not align with reality. What other option does Cuba have? They can't buy oil from essentially any other country due to the sanctions, so of course they rely on oil from Venezuela. Your implication is the wrong direction.Liberalize and buy oil from the US or any other capitalist country. Who do you think organised this operation?The DRF, with the financial support and backing of the United States. The invasion by the DRF was organised by the CIA, and given the green light by JFK. This was not some independent event.I never said it was independent, just the the US wasn't the one invading. There's a huge difference here. Cuba was not some state that organised a horrible war.They certainly sent their troops to a lot of horrible wars. Why were Cuban troops fighting Israelis in 1973? It was a colony where the population was already repressed under the Spanish.It stopped being a colony when the US freed it from the Spanish.

The problem we are currently having is turnout related.  If 90% of Americans voted in every election, the polls accuracy would be a non-issue. The statistical facts around how polling works would be clear and no one would debate poll accuracy.The problem is the last few decades the parties have pivoted heavily towards turnout over conversion. They realized that it is very hard to change people's opinions. Ads don't work very well. Speeches don't work. Debates don't work. People are pretty locked in on their opinion. So, what is easy to change is turnout. In 2000, only 54.3% of eligible voters participated. In 2020, 66% participated. This also works in reverse, which is why you saw a lot of pushes for Voter ID, rejecting votes, etc in the last couple of cycles.Do you know what is really hard to predict? Who will actually vote.**Example**  \\nIf I ask you if you **WOULD** vote for Trump, I can be fairly certain your answer is accurate.   \\nIf I ask you if you **WILL** vote for Trump, thats a whole different ball game. Maybe you'll get sick, maybe you forgot to register. Maybe you keep putting it off and then have to work a double-shift on election day. Maybe you aren't planning on voting but you lie, because you know that you SHOULD vote. So, the polls are accurate at predicting who people WANT to vote for in the election.

Ask me anything!"},{"text":"I am familiar with two of those writers and they are conservatives, so that's the first problem. They don't want to admit that the party they've supported their whole life has gone fascist. And even if they aren't for Trump, a lot of these squishy conservative writers (Ross Douthat comes to mind) are still sucked into false narratives about how liberals are \\"hysterical.\\" A lot of their friends and social circles are MAGA or MAGA-friendly, and so they can lull themselves into thinking it's not so bad. It's the flip side of what I said above about recognizing that MAGA are human. If you're already inclined to dislike liberals, you can tell yourself a story about how they're human so not like the Nazis or whatever. But Nazis were also human. That is what is scary. The larger problem is that the media infrastructure is not equipped to resist fascism. It's increasingly owned by billionaires who feel they would benefit from a fascist government, even if they \\"know\\" intellectually it's wrong. Like, I don't think Jeff Bezos is a fascist. But it's in his financial interest to feel that the Trump threat is blown out of proportion and to hire a bunch of people who have a history of hostility to progressivism and put it all together, and the rightward drift of the Washington Post makes sense.","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

No. But if you have multiple elections where you are consistently missing a group of voters, then I think it's reasonable to critique polls. Are they useless?  Of course not, but there are growing concerns about the ability to reach both low propensity and low trust voters. Specific to 2024,  the country is too evenly divided for polls to be useful for making predictions about the presidency. They can tell us the race is close, but they can't tell us who is going to win. If we were less polarized/less evenly divided, then I think polls could reliably predict who will win, but when races are this close, polls aren't a reliable indicator in the same way. So while they aren't nefarious, I don't think polling is going to be a useful indicator for the presidency beyond telling us the race is close.","title":"CMV: The unreliability of polls has been overstated."},{"text":"It's to gain control of the senate, even if she loses the state.Allred has a shot, and Harris coming to Harris county in Houston, where there's a history of under performance by Democrats, is critical to that potentially happening.I had been screaming for Harris to get down here to Texas and I'm thrilled her team made the trip.

Reagan dominates his polls, Reagan wins. Clinton dominates his polls, Clinton wins. But it isn't just that they were 'predictively' right in that they told you the winner, they were right in that their estimates tended to be very close to the end result. Reagan gets 59-41 in polls leading up to the election and the actual result is 58.77-40.56. Clinton leads 52-41-7 and the end results are 49-40-8. Not only do the results match polling, but the margins are very close to polling.Trump's 2016 win bucks this trend. He goes in expected to lose with the results 42-46-5-2 in last ditch polling, after trailing for months, and then when election day rolls around he pulls a victory with 46-48-3-1. A 4% jump like that is a drastic undercount, it means that basically every major poll was at the extreme end of its margin of error. Then you have 2020, trump overperforms again. Then you have 2022, where democrats shirk the polls and pull out an upset.Something is off with polls, it is just hard to quantify what, and how.","title":"CMV: The unreliability of polls has been overstated."},{"text":"Being a little circumspect with papers since I don't want to potentially imperil anyone else's career, I know she's not the only one at the VA using such modalities.

I was lucky enough to ask Kathleen Hanna how she felt about that:[https://www.salon.com/2024/05/14/songs-for-people-after-the-protest-kathleen-hanna-makes-clear-shes-a-musician-not-activist/](https://www.salon.com/2024/05/14/songs-for-people-after-the-protest-kathleen-hanna-makes-clear-shes-a-musician-not-activist/)Like Olivia Rodrigo is one of the biggest stars in the world, and she talks about being pro-choice the way you could barely get away with on an indie label in the 90s. Taylor Swift's political endorsements are funny and smart. Beyonc calling herself a feminist was a big deal at the time, but it's just normal now.

I'll leave aside the sturm and drang about her social media posts and focus just on her music.

More like a roll of firecrackers going off one by one.","title":"Phoenix man charged with shooting Democratic office had 250,000 rounds and a grenade launcher"},{"text":"I dont feel you cant fight hate with hate boils it down to whats best for men. I think people play a role in their own oppression when they interact with the world a certain way, regardless of what made them come to that point. I was sexually assaulted by a women when I was younger. I was also stalked by a woman. Ive been cheated on, verbally and emotionally abused by another. Ive had accusations made up about me from another woman. Ive had various traumas from men too. There was a time I was afraid and held toxic views of most everyone because of my life experiences. I was full on agoraphobic for a couple years. There were times I said hateful things about people, about men, about women because of what some men and women did to me. When people would hear my misanthropic views, it would understandably make some feel a type of way. It doesnt matter that I was traumatized. Its not okay to generalize people and it seems fair were either all accountable for only ourselves or were ALL accountable for ourselves and each other.  When a man hates women openly, he encourages some women who see that to hate men as a result. Same vice versa. I believe we have to show each other a better way and keep to our morals which includes not talking and generalizing men in the same ways women dont want to be talked about and generalized by men in regards to the worst women. We all can do better at being better people toward ourselves and each other. No groups have a monopoly on poor discourse or hurt people hurt people and how that cycle gets us nowhere. Words have a lot of power. We have to be careful how we wield them.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Yes, I think he will try.

I want to address some things in good-faith and am not looking to argue.You made some very good points, most of which I agree with. But I want to bring up a couple of things that stood out to me. On several occasions, you bring up the fact that these alt-right, Andrew Tate type figures don't actually care about men. Hard agree there.I agree that these people are alt-right, but I see it as more of slouching into that as a means to an end in their goal. They may have an incidental desire to convert these men to their alt-right thinking, but ultimately they are just run-of-the-mill grifters. Think about the actual goals they are trying to achieve through their content creation. It's to sell a product or a service, like you mentioned. Converting impressionable young men to their way of thinking is desirable only because it makes it easier to sell their bullshit product. That is how grifters operate. They're preying on boys that might often have some expected level of teen angst and signal boosting it until they are full-blown bitter, angry, entitled pricks that have gone from simple frustration to hopelessness, that they've been made to believe is only fixable with a $100/month subscription to someone they now trust, who puts on a facade of success. \\"You can be like me too, for only a car payment worth of money per month\\". That's the scam. It's successful because the market is cornered, and their only opposition is a group that, let's be honest, does tend to alienate them. It's subconscious alienation in a lot of cases, but there are also plenty of left-leaning circles that don't hide the fact that they think men are truly all to blame for most of the world's issues. The alt-right grifters honestly don't even have to try very hard to attract men to their cause when that's the alternative.I hope we can agree on that point, because as someone who can proudly say never got sucked into the alt-right pipeline, I do still see it everywhere, but I also see left-leaning groups, even ones that I wouldn't consider extreme, holding views that do shamelessly blame men as a whole for issues we see in society, as opposed to blaming the specific individuals responsible or talking about legitimate ways to change these issues for the betterment of everyone. I see it as the opposite side of the same coin. It's misguided anger and prejudice caused by heavily curated echo chambers. That's just political extremism though and it exists on both sides. Now you might be thinking that most left-wing groups aren't like that, but I would respond by saying that most right-wing groups aren't like the ones you described above either. Extremism is thing we need to eliminate. After all, these young men weren't born this way. They have been indoctrinated by a group that they feel welcomes them, even if there is an ulterior motive. If leftist groups do genuinely care about men's wellbeing, it would be done through combating this almost default gravitation to the alt-right by approaching men with compassion and understanding, instead of displaying the same prejudice and resentment that we see incels show towards women.Another thing you brought up is the claim I often see that men bringing up their unique struggles such as higher rates of suicide, addiction, violent crime victimization, incarceration, less-favourable outcomes in family court, etc. is just a reaction to women's struggles that are common feminist talking points. This might be the case for some, but there are also plenty of men out there who struggle just as much in different ways and just want to be seen and taken seriously in the same way that the feminist movement is by the mainstream population. But then they are usually dismissed through claims that these points are only being brought up in a reactionary way, when it is usually not the case. Then these men who started off having good intentions for raising awareness for men's issues are ridiculed and dismissed for bring uo valid points. And from there, unsurprisingly, they are driven further into the men's rights circles since that's the only place they feel they're taken seriously, but now they feel hurt and marginalized, and will tend to seek out more and more extreme subsets of a movement that does really seek positive goals, but if you go deep enough down any rabbit hole, you're bound to only find the most miserable people of that group there with you.We could have a completely seperate in-depth discussion as to what causes political extremism. But my point boils down to this:\\nYou focused a lot on the phenomenon of extreme right-wing parties and their goals/tactics, but you seem to be genuinely unaware of any way that the left can compete with that. I urge you to take what I said into consideration and think about how there is a lot the left-wing groups can do online to attract young men by welcoming them instead of ostracizing them.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Re: Trump never dying, is it possible that Trump could continue to serve as the focus of devotion after he dies, allowing less personally charismatic politicians to continue to harness the feelings that he inspires in people?","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

Another friend is in an abusive relationship with a man that's sucking the life out of her and as her friends we just have to support her until she sees what we see and leaves. I was just reading data showing that domestic abuse has spiked with the rise of sports gambling because of course it has. I know SO MANY women who have lost years of their life to abuse at the hands of the man. I have friends who are single and plan to stay that way not because they can't get laid or men have too high of standards, but because there is an inherent safety risk in dating today that they don't want to take. So many times I have started out thinking a guy is \\"one of the good ones\\" only to later learn he's actually distressingly scary and manipulative. Actress Anna Kendrick just spoke out about getting out of an abusive relationship this week, and her story sounds disturbingly similar to so many I have heard before.

And now, in the final days of the U.S. election where abortion is on the ballot across the country, the dominant conversation is about whether the left has done enough to placate men's feelings.

Sometimes it's because they can't square the hateful views with their values o r with the love they have for another person or themselves. There's a reason that the LGBTQ issue is a major one in causing people to leave conservative Christianity. People often realize a person they love is gay or trans, and they decide to value that person more than they do their religious beliefs. Or a lot of people, women especially, suffer so much from sexist systems that they can't lie to themselves anymore.

The closer you are to the archetypal Straight White Man, the more you are accustomed to a particular, SWM worldview. You view it as normal. A bunch of white people? Normal. A bunch of brown people? Not normal. A bunch of gays? Not normal. We all grow up with societal notions of what is normal and not normal, and internalize those biases. Because Straight White Men have always had the power, the world has shifted itself to fit into their specific sensibilities. The problem comes from the fact that, among demographics, your Straight White Men have the strongest belief that *their* worldview is *objectively right*. Black people might *know* that white people are over represented, but they don't feel it's correct because that's rediculous. But because SWM have been catered to forever, they get conditioned into believing that their worldview is actually correct. Which is the problem. Reactionism. SWM see the world is different, have a gut reaction that opposes it, and are then convinced they're correct because they're *supposed* to be. WWhy are there so many gay people in this movie? Maybe it's because gay people actually exist, and just haven't been represented. But the SWM sensibility is to assume that something is *wrong*. You can teach this out of people, but you can't get rid of the emotional knee-jerk that causes it.And to top it all off, other groups of people have had to present themselves to the sensibilities of SWM for so long, most are not happy having to continue doing it because it inherently takes power away from them. It contextualized their own story in a framework of belief that carries with it lots of bad messaging, which just makes breaching the gap even harder.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Hunter Biden/Kennedy Jr. is the ONLY GOP ticket that can beat a Liz Cheney/Mitt Romney Democratic unity ticket in 2028","title":"Trump says hes open to pardoning Hunter Biden"},{"text":"Become a junkie, consume them all.

That's standard in all fascist arguments, that there was a glorious past that has been robbed by the racial minorities, intellectuals, feminists, and queer people. And the authoritarian crackdown is recast as self-defense. But if you examine their claims of oppression, it tends to fall apart. They feel oppressed because they feel entitled to dominate others, but that's intellectually indefensible, so they tend to spin off into lies or bad faith to justify was is not a justifiable feeling. One good example of this is the Moms for Liberty and their war on library books. They went after a lot of different books, but let's focus on the LGBTQ titles, which got most of the attention. It's clear to me what they object to is the winding down of compulsory heterosexuality and the acceptance of queer people. But instead of saying they want to control how you identify and how you live your life, they instead spun out this narrative that \\"groomers\\" were \\"indoctrinating\\" children. To be the heroes, they recast their victims as villains. Now, this all falls apart if you think about it for five minutes. Books don't turn kids queer. Queer kids just are who they are, and books tell them that's okay. The books are freedom, the book bans are anti-freedom.  But the word games of MAGA allows them to hide behind the claims that it's somehow liberty for straight people to shove queer people back into the closet. The good news is I do think most Americans see through this. The bad news is just enough people buy into the lies in the swing states that Trump may win.","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

Tech is one of the industries that serves literally everyone and when there are no women in the room that means that the products being made are not being made with them in mind which has huge real world consequences.The good initiatives in DEI also work to prop people up as mentors or role models.

The frustration of liberal democracy, which is sharing power in a democratic system with groups that the fascist movement feels should be excluded from the definition of the nation, is supposed to be solved by a fascist leader that promises to suspend democracy and seize control of everything in the name of the true (usually ethnically-defined) nation. Fascist leaders invoke history to define the true nation, usually an imagined history in which the nation was ethnically pure.Firstly the fascist is not just defining a true nation of the past to return to, they are utilising history and culture to paint a picture of a idealised nation that they concede has never existed. For the fascists the past was feudalist kingdoms, liberal and socialist nation states. They explicitly did not want to return to these but defined themselves as a progressive future from them.Moreover the fascist is able to say the nation must be ethnically pure becuase the fasicist state says that the state is the source of morality within the nation.

The scary thing to me about MAGA is that it's become a pathway to radicalization for secular conservatives.

The assumption most people have is that this is because women were aborting those pregnancies. But the abortion rate didn't actually go up (if anything, stats show abortion rates go up when it's banned.)No, the reason is single women started keeping their babies rather than giving them up for adoption, which is one reason there was a spike (and a panic) in single motherhood that never really abated. I spoke with historian Rickie Sollinger about this and she said she thought Roe was about more than abortion. It was a signal to women that they had full autonomy, including the right to keep their babies.

Continuing that, I find it odd to limit ourselves to Mussolini's definition. Mussolini called upon the image of the romantic feudal society of times past because the fascists of that era specifically wanted to evoke those images. His definition is nonsense.  \\n...  \\nThere are quite a few other, more minor, indicators. More deference to the highest form of command, fewer opinions, more male dominated.Were the Republican party to militarize, I would absolutely characterize them as fascist. Presently however, I would say they're on their way there.Firstly idk what grounds you are calling Mussolini's definition nonsense, it logically follows given the premises he sets out.Secondly you say that we shouldn't be limited to his definition, but then your sources for a definition of fascism are just you looking at fascists and then backwardly rationalising what their ideology must be. This sort of thing is only appropriate for people who lived like 1000 years ago and who we have basically no sources for, fascist dont fall into either of these two camps.

They think that they are in some sense \\"better\\", as they eat their arugula and sip their Chardonnay. *Quod erat demonstrandum.*Trump certainly has one thing in common with the dems: he also believes in and stands for nothing whatsoever, other than the thrill of fame and power, and the associated ability to copiously line his own pockets. The difference is that everybody *knows* that, already. We've seen it in action, and he's never attempted to claim otherwise. If nothing else, he is breathtakingly honest about his pathological dishonesty.We had to learn that with Obama, and that learning process was very, very painful.

Also, the claim weakening of the state and its institutions is the opposite of fascism is somewhat of a misdirection or context is missing. In reality, it would be more appropriate to state it is a transfer of power and authority by weakening other institutions of the state - a consolidation of power to an executive. In reality, fascism is difficult to nail down with an all-encompassing definition due to the fact there could be considered flavors of fascism. The flavors develop when they absorb individual characteristics of the country it is propagating in; but overall fascism is essentially about power (and not necessarily a belief) consolidated into an executive and is considered a type of authoritarianism.The term fascism comes from the Italian word fascio, meaning a bundle or group, and is considered a term for a militant brotherhood. That said, the best generic description Ive seen regarding fascism would be a form of political practice that arouses popular enthusiasm by sophisticated propaganda techniques. Its not a definition, but a good description. While there are flavors of fascism so to speak, there are common traits amongst fascist regimes:- anti-liberalism; rejecting individual rights, civil liberties, free enterprise and democracy- anti-socialism, rejecting economic principles based on socialist frameworks- exclusion of certain groups, often through violence; or innate inequality and social hierarchies- nationalism that seeks to expand the nations influence and power- skewed or distorted view of progress or modernization: only accept the the term to apply to technological and economic advancement, military superiority, and the glorification of speed and machines- use of propaganda to spread false ideas where whether or not the fascists believe the propaganda is true or not is irrelevantSo yes some of the actions, claims, proposed policies, and so on by elements of the Republican Party are aligning very well with fascism - including the evolved notion of what is unitary executive theory.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"As a man when I went into emergency for what turned out to be bad ingestion it was assumed if I was there it must be serious because it was assumed my complaints were legitimate same with whenever I get depressed it's assumed it must be \\"intense\\" if I say anything about it because of the stereotype of men as stoic people think I must \\"really hurt\\" if I let it out, whereas my sister almost died from a tumor the size of grapefruit because Drs dismissed her claims as hypochondria and I l had a good friend who killed herself after several failed suicide attempts that were treated as cries for attention.Women attempt suicide at three times the rate as men but are less likely to own firearms which is the most common and deadly method of suicide https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4009420-more-women-attempt-suicide-more-men-die-by-suicide/I remember when Terry Cruze talked about being the victim of sexual assault by a guy in management and how he got nothing but support from women he spoke to online and off but he got a lot of shit from men like 50 cent.

I dont believe she is, as she has actually been a lot softer in her rhetoric than Biden towards the plight of the Palestinians. \\nRhetoric is rhetoric, so it's not actual policy, but that's the best argument I have. \\nI dont like Kamala. She HAS run away from her popular 2019 policies in order to appeal to the moderates, who are largely uninformed and stuck in a cultural Islamophobia. \\nHowever, down ballot is where we can push the party left if we show up. Kamala is a holding pattern because we need to at least lock the country in place, not deliver a backward slide that we may never recover from under Trump. I'm in California, a safe blue state. However, my district, 27, is hotly contested. It's been a herculean effort for my local leftists to organize because so many leftists here are in our way, demoralizing their uninformed moderate friends and family. We lost our primary candidate BECAUSE OF THE LEFT not showing up. Now we have a moderate Dem to run against an incumbent GOPer, which is a way worse fight than it needed to be. So if I have no patience for leftist tears, that's why. I've had to phone bank for a corporate stooge because he doesn't want my family and LGBTQ+ friends dead and has the money to largely fund his own campaign, like the current incumbent does. I'm not happy about it, but that corporate stooge is the holding pattern. In the next election, I'll have more coordination and hopefully a good chance with a better candidate. The fight will never end, and there will always be compramise. I do actually think Kamala is better on pretty much everything than Biden and has some limited evidence to support that, but that's ultimately irrelevant.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. I speak up about sexual violence because I survived it, and I think that emotional component adds wisdom instead of subtracting it.   \\nThat said, we see with MAGA how identity and emotion can be exploited to send people down very dark paths.

I recommend Naomi Klein's \\"Doppelganger\\" book on this front. She argues, persuasively I think, that  a lot of MAGA is an evil funhouse mirror reflection of progressive politics.

And I support more or less all of those programs.But it's also extremely notable that where men get the short end of the stick, typically nothing whatsoever is done. It's a MARKED double standard. And the impression this gives, is that the left de-facto don't give a fuck about mens problems, or perhaps do not even believe them to be genuine. (or if they're genuine, they believe men themselves have the entire blame, and there's nothing society overall, or women, could or should do)Some examples to illustrate what kinda things I mean:* We've had a concerted campaign to root out and get changed all laws that discriminate against women. So successful that no such law remains where I live. (Norway) But we've not cared to do the same for men, so it remains the case that at least a dozen laws remain that explicitly discriminate against men -- mostly in the area of parenthood. (One example of such a law: When parents aren't cohabitating at birth, by law, the mother alone gets sole custody if she informs the government that she wishes it. She doesn't need to state any reason, \\"I prefer it\\" is sufficient. The fahter then gets full parental obligations including things like child-support, but zero parental rights such as getting to be part of making decisions about his children, getting to actually parent them, or even being informed about them from for example school and healthcare providers.\\n* We've had tons of concerted campaigns to try to improve the fraction of for example engineers that are women. My daughters have attended probably around 10 programs specifically designed to stimulate interest in untraditional choices for girls. Meanwhile there's near-zero gender-reversed examples, very close to nothing at all is done to try to increase boys participation where they're underrepresented. My son has attended zero programs tailored specifically for boys. Apparently few female engineers is a problem, but few male nurses is not. And this is in a country where OVERALL and in sum total, women make up over 60% of the students in higher education, and they've been a majority of students for over 35 years.\\n* Essentially nothing is done to try to solve the suicide-problem, and what is being done doesn't tend to be specifically taylored to men and boys, despite more than 70% of the dead being men or boys.\\n* We recently had a thorough and large commission tasked with exploring specifically challenges to womens health. We had no equivalent for men -- that's assumed simply not needed. And that happens despite men being a solid majority in 9 of the 10 top cases of early death. (as in dying before you turn 65) I don't mean that men are doing horribly. We're not.But my honest impression is that it goes a bit like this:* In some areas of life, women do worse. This is a sign of discrimination and/or cultural problems and we as a society need to make an effort to fix these things!\\n* In other areas of life, men do worse. Men themselves are to blame for all of this, we as a society should simply entirely ignore these problems. Not our fault in any way!This doesn't strike me as a reasonable or balanced or fair framing. And yet it's my impression that it's the dominant one.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"I agree.","title":"3 Delco town hall participants tell CNN theyre now backing Kamala Harris | If I had to pick right now, I would pick her, said Lauren Holden, who said she voted for Trump in 2020."},{"text":"as a reminder, this is what the left thought of Kelly just a few years ago..gosh I wonder.... why the chage of heart guys?https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/kelly-exit-interview-773739/https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/john-kelly-s-lies-about-dem-rep-frederica-wilson-1269644355946https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/02/john-kellys-liar-file-keeps-getting-thicker-and-thicker/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/how-a-two-year-old-video-cost-john-kelly-his-credibilityhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/10/john-kelly-is-not-an-honest-man.htmlhttps://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-official-describes-john-kelly-big-fat-liar-msna1068216","title":"Video: Kamala Harris Wheeled Out to Push FAKE Atlantic Story and Compare Trump to H*tlerIs This Dangerous Rhetoric Fueling Assassination Attempts?"},{"text":"\\"Now keep your mouth shut and clean my toilet!\\"","title":"Average Redditor tells immigrant woman we didnt let you in just so you can destroy democracy in response to her simply saying that people should vote for whoever they want"},{"text":"And a MAGA hat","title":"Phoenix man charged with shooting Democratic office had 250,000 rounds and a grenade launcher"},{"text":"Same.","title":"Gay voters are smitten with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"The right meanwhile has a very empowering message for men.

It's gotten better since 2016, when \\"Clinton's emails\\" got bigger billing than Trump's myriad of scandals, but we see it throughout the coverage of this election. Part of it is that journalists still mistake false equivalence for \\"balance.\\" Part of it is they assume Republican voters are a bunch of morons, so they don't cover Republican politicians critically under the assumption their own voters don't care. And part of it, like sane-washing Trump, is just failing to adapt to the moment. Our job is making sense out of events for audiences, but you're failing to tell the truth when you try to bang Trump's nonsense into sense-shaped forms. But let's face it, part of it is that journalism is a capitalist business. We see this bluntly with the LA Times, whose rich and Musk-sympathetic owner interfered with the editorial board endorsing Harris. It's usually more subtle, but there's little doubt to my mind that the knee-jerk centrism and both-sides stuff is shaped by pressure from management at a lot of outlets. Journalists are called \\"elite\\" but most of us are middle class and can't afford to lose our jobs. 2) I don't know that the fairness doctrine would work today. I watch a lot of CNN and I don't think audiences are served well by panels where a normal Democratic op is \\"balanced\\" by a lying Trump apologist.   \\nIt's easier said than done, but I just want journalists to be truthful. A lot more of what is said off-screen could be brought onscreen, and I think that's fairer to our audiences.","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

As a straight cis white male I've been through the gamut myself in various areas, so I don't want to come off overly cruel of anyone's struggles or trauma or justifications. With that precursor though, I think you very heavily need to question your opinions of what constitutes things such as 'failure' in the area of both prioritization as well as overall success.Many terrible people alt-right has had much success getting lost young men to come to their side. But in acknowledging that it is a 'bad' world view to get caught up in, why would you see fit to call that a failure of 'the left' rather than a failure of 'young men'? Men under 30 still identify or lean 'democrat' (which I'll use as the closest thing I have for 'left') by almost 2:1 compared to republican. This is compared to a pretty equal distribution between 30-49, and typically a higher distribution identifying as republican at 50-64 and 65+. Most young men seem to be getting the message just fine that there is a social advantage to not adopt a world view of denigrating women.Now beyond that, you speak of alt-right groups more actively engaging and recruiting young men. Why would this be a surprise to find out though? If the left is attempting to appeal to 'everybody' with their message and the alt-right is primarily catering to a particular subset, they only have so much energy and resources to put towards their efforts. An alt-right speaker is never (well, maybe for controversy and ragebait) going to walk into a 'Celebrating Women in STEM' lecture and try to convince them how they are all ruining society and would be happier as home-makers, because they will get better results putting those resources towards areas where young men make up a larger percent of the population.Not only that, if a message is pushing an 'us vs them' type argument, why do you think areas exist in the first place that are ideal hunting grounds for such predatory messaging? Women regularly have faced abnormally high levels of hostility in some of these hobbies, professions, and social settings that the alt-right has chosen to prey on. If a majority of their recruiters are men or, and i hate this phrase, pick-mes appealing to men, they often face no or few uphill barriers in initially integrating to those communities. On the other side, if a leftist messenger is a woman, and women in general are treated with more hostility in such spaces, it doesn't really make sense to say THEY are the ones at fault for not tolerating the opposition and abuse they may face attempting to spread their message in those spaces. Again resources, whether its time or money or mental health or anything else, are limited and going to be put towards where can be applied most effectively and strategically.I can tell you one specific data point that I know shifted me from left leaning to really getting more empathetic and introspective. I was talking on the phone with my girlfriend and made some kind of douchebag comment, not anything crazy bad or offensive, but something I was expecting her to probably call me a jerk or some insult over and instead she was quiet for a little and calmly said \\"You know, sometimes you can just so insensitive.\\" I have never been rocked by a realization that what I considered just my somewhat juvenile sense of humor was capable of being flat out hurtful to the ones I loved. Not someone I hate or barely know or a stranger being 'overly sensitive'. Just someone I cared about being hurt in exchange for something that didn't really benefit me at all. If anything the goal was somewhat entertainment which it obviously failed at.Anyways, away from all that, I know you already gave out a delta and this is a whole lot of blah, but I just want to rephrase that I don't think 'the left' are failing to reach out to young men. I think we have an issue of being ignorant and naive and socially awkward, and tend to self-identify and isolate ourselves into social groups of people similar to ourselves rather than have the humility or deal with the embarrassment of learning to communicate with people different than ourselves. Young men need to quit prioritizing only the opinions of other young men. They need to care about and learn the social norms of the groups they want to be part of and not get individually upset that they aren't being exclusively catered to. Because the reality is you do have some control over what environments you are going to expose yourself to. And if you choose to go with the one that is friendly and coddles you and says everyone else is wrong instead of wanting to deal with the uncomfortable suggestion that the problem might be yourself, you're going to limit yourself to peers who get whatever they want out of you in exchange for some basic ego stroking instead of people who have the ability to contribute so much more to your life.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Sure he did.

Their actions are lowering costs in key areasfrom health insurance premiums and prescription drug prices to utility bills, groceries, and gas. And their Administration is fighting to further lower costs by taking on price gouging by big corporations making record profits and special interests like Big Pharma that are charging prices two or three times higher than in other countrieswhile successfully calling on grocery chains to lower grocery prices.There is more to do. The President and Vice President will keep fighting for hardworking families with an agenda to lower housing and child care costs, and give tax relief to working Americans and middle-class families while making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.While Congressional Republicans side with special interests and billionaires to keep prices and profits high, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take action to lower costs for the American people.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Funds to Strengthen Early Childhood Programs"},{"text":"I would say corporate statism is totally a form of fascism.

Its why people like Marx, King and even FDR (not a leftist but you get what I mean) are once-in-a-generation talents whilst every idiot can and will make a decent wage podcasting about how feminism caused the 2008 financial crash or whatever.There's also the money angle, as to be blunt for every cent of a Nebula subscription some Breadtuber gets for their lovingly crafted 3 hour video essay, $1000 is spent by Putin, Rupert Murdoch, Erdo?an, Elon Musk, Xi Jinping, Peter Thiel and other billionaires and CEOs and dictators in order to pay professional propagandists like Tate and Fuentes and Alex Jones to churn out slop and to support unpaid ideologues on sites like Twitter and 4Chan etc etc and even just pricks in real life clinging to the tiny little bit of power over others the system gives them to abuse (like your teacher) to spread the hate so far and wide that they can run everything, forever, whilst we the people hate ourselves and everyone else.This means that people of nearly all situations are exposed to more right-wing content in general, and a lot of the left-wing stuff one is exposed to (ie Jill Stein, 'this feminist hates all men' stuff, tankies saying the US should be destroyed etc) is actually put in front of your eyes to discredit its more reasonable counterparts/divide-and-conquer tactics by the right.TLDR:\\\\- The online left is like a few hundred video essayists, hobbyists and journalists, who don't really have any responsibility or ability to pick up the slack of a sick society\\\\- The online right is a billion-dollar industry with backing from some of the world's most powerful people and organisations\\\\- Targeting lies at vulnerable young people is easy, but immoral\\\\-  Thus the right does this extensively, as the far-right is evil and lazy\\\\- The left by its very nature as a force ostensibly for good can't really target those vulnerable to right-wing propaganda with its own 'left wing' propaganda since **the act of targeting the intellectually vulnerable (young men or anyone else) in order to convert them to your own extremist political views is an inherently immoral act**There we go, that's my info-dump. how accurate is this truly?

So I've got some basis on what you're talking about.My basic way of thinking about this is that its an issue of communication and receptiveness to communication, in which the deck is pretty heavily stacked against the online left.Put bluntly, convincing anyone to change their mind or to share your opinion is relatively difficult, regardless of context. Now, lets look at who specifically the alt-right targets:If the person you're targeting is younger, they'll be more ignorant (simply from having less life experience) and thus less aware of any falsehoods they're told. If they're poorly educated (ie 14 years old and half way through secondary school, or as an adult having been educated in a poor school/not gone to university/college) they're less likely to be swayed by statistics or complex logical or philosophical reasoning. If they're male, they've been raised in a society which teaches men to interact with the world physically not emotionally and idolises simplicity, conflict,, strength, patriarchy etc etc. They'll want an enemy to oppose, a contrast to their own self-identified virtue (we've all been 14 once).In addition, if they've been treated poorly by life (such as being attacked by an authority figure who should be in a protective role over your part in a wider system you can't control) this person will be feeling angry and hurt and will want an emotional response to their own (however legitimate) feelings.Thus, they're naturally going to be responsive to an appeal to emotion rather than logic, they will want simple and understandable solutions which fits their preconceived subconscious notions of manhood and they aren't in the right state of mind to critically engage with the lies or propaganda which is giving them easy solutions to their problems. This isn't because they are bad people, it's because the circumstances of their life at that time (and the society they live in) leads to them being an easy target for Alt-Right propaganda.  \\nIf we look at what they online left is providing, in contrast, we have to understand that it's not trying to target 14-year-old boys. (Because, disregarding all other reasons, trying to get other peoples' children to swallow all your political opinions is kind of skeevy, IMO). Most online leftist content I'm exposed to feels oriented at young adults and older, and intellectual, dry, even academic in style. This is true even for the content that feels aimed specifically at men, or about masculinity, or by an author one could consider a male role model for leftists. The left may appeal to emotion, but a lot of what you'll see will have facts, statistics and theory as integral parts of the reasoning. Leftist lie less. And when they do lie, other leftist will usually call them out.**This is because we (both the audience and the creators themselves) hold left-wing figures to ethical and factual standards which don't apply to their right-wing counterparts.**This all makes it difficult for left-wing ideas to be used as rage-bait talking points of quick and easy solutions to all your problems.Reality is complicated and is full of complex problems with even more complex solutions (and the 'having a solution' bit isn't even guaranteed).

It was that the election was being *stolen*.  Not that democracy itself is fundamentally ineffective and needs to be eliminated, not that we need to return to a mythological feudalistic past where a single ethnicity was united under a powerful king - it was that democracy needed to be *rescued*.This is the fundamental difference I am trying to get at.  Because, again, what does the MAGA base believe will happen after Trump wins?  It is ambiguous.  A good portion of his base believes that Trump will fix democracy, while other more extreme portions of his base believe that Trump will be something like a white nationalist authoritarian.  I mentioned Trump's response to Charlottesville as an example of the tightrope he is forced to walk, but another great example is Project 2025.  The fascistic bureaucratic take-over proposed by Project 2025 is only implicitly associated by Trump.  The people that want Project 2025 believe that it is Trump's plan, the people that don't want Project 2025 are free to pretend it has nothing to do with Trump.  This is intentional, I think Trump or at least his advisors understand that this ambiguity is what holds their base together.  Being fully and explicitly fascist would not work for Trump, and this was a problem that Hitler and Mussolini never had.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Great conspiracy here","title":"Kamala Harris Chickens Out of Joe Rogan Interview"},{"text":"It is.

These investments build on the billions of dollars the Biden-Harris Administration secured over the last three years to help families pay for child care and keep child care businesses open in the aftermath of the pandemic.  \\n...  \\nAn April 2023 Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-quality Care and Supporting Caregivers reinforced the Biden-Harris commitment to improve care and working conditions for early educators. In continued support of these efforts, ACF awarded Head Start and Preschool Development Grants in 33 states, eight tribal communities, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia  a strategic distribution across the country to ensure broad impact and serve those with the greatest need.  \\n...  \\n This latest investment comes after the Administration published regulations earlier this year that will reduce co-payments for families participating in the child care subsidy system, improve financial stability for child care providers, boost pay for most Head Start staff and improve mental health services for children and adults in Head Start programs. The Administration also previously secured $2.5 billion in increases for the Head Start program and nearly $3.5 billion in child care investments, on top of $40 billion to help early childhood programs stay open during and after the COVID-19 public health emergency.  \\n...  \\nACF awarded approximately $115 million in Head Start funds to 55 agencies that will expand Head Start services to about 5,000 additional children. About two-thirds of these funds will expand the availability of Early Head Start services to infants, toddlers and expectant families. About one-third will serve 3- to 5-year-olds in Head Start preschool programs. The funds include awards to Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, programs serving migrant and seasonal farmworker families and American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.   The Preschool Development Grants Birth to Five (PDG B-5) awarded approximately $86 million to 11 states. This is the first round of new PDG B-5 grants since 2022, when ACF awarded over $300 million to 42 states and territories. This new funding allows states to invest in and test strategies that will improve access to early learning experiences for young children, strengthen the early childhood workforce, and continue to improve the quality of early childhood programs in states and communities.   Recipients will use funds for services that benefit young children and their families, including supports for the early childhood workforce, efforts to promote the mental health and well-being of children and their caregivers and improved coordination that makes programs easier for families to access.The list of recipients is in the press release. Statement from ACF Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Jeff Hild:Affordable and quality early care and education is essential to child development and a parents peace of mind, said ACF Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Jeff Hild. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to lead improvements to reduce costs for families in the child care subsidy program, boost pay for Head Start workers, enhance the quality of early childhood programs through preschool development grants and, most recently, expand Head Start to an additional 5,000 children through investments in early childhood systems.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Funds to Strengthen Early Childhood Programs"},{"text":"Yeah its pretty obvious the Dems just completely ran a smokescreen for Biden with all the videos out there of him touching children literally at presidential meetings and such just on national tv.

CPAC had Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn as a speaker, a leader who has dismantled Hungarys democratic institutions. This shows the GOP isnt just flirting with authoritarianismtheyre openly aligning themselves with it.And lets not forget the way the GOP and right-wing media work hand in hand to spread propaganda and control the narrative. Trump has repeatedly called the media the enemy of the people (Twitter, February 2017), echoing authoritarian rhetoric used to discredit independent journalism. Right-wing outlets like Fox News and OAN amplify these claims, spreading misinformation and conspiracies to support the GOPs agenda.The GOPs authoritarian shift was cemented by the creation of Fox News by Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch in 1996. Ailes, a former media strategist for Nixon, designed Fox to push conservative ideology under the guise of fair and balanced reporting, creating a platform to promote GOP propaganda and polarize the electorate. As Ailes said, People dont want to be informed; they want to feel informed. Fox News became an essential tool for controlling the narrative, spreading fearmongering and conspiracy theories to build unwavering support for GOP interests.Simultaneously, right-wing organizations like the Heritage Foundation, Federalist Society, and State Policy Network (SPN) have worked to entrench conservative power. The Heritage Foundation promotes radical cuts to social programs and deregulation, while the Federalist Society focuses on filling the judiciary with conservative judges, aiming for long-term control of the courts. Leonard Leo, a key figure in the Federalist Society, stated, Were going to have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the next 40 years. The SPN targets state-level policies, weakening labor unions and public services to suppress progressive movements. Together, these groups form the backbone of a strategic effort to embed right-wing extremism across all levels of government and society.To further understand the roots of the GOPs shift, we can look back to the Reagan era, which laid the foundation for many of these authoritarian tendencies. Reagans policies and rhetoric fueled racism, homophobia, and economic inequality, while undermining public trust in government institutions. Reagans failure to address the AIDS epidemic until it was too late is a stark example of his administrations disregard for marginalized communities. He remained silent for years, while tens of thousands of Americansmostly from the LGBTQ+ communitywere dying. In 1986, a frustrated White House staffer resorted to mailing pamphlets directly to households because Reagan refused to acknowledge the crisis. His administrations homophobia was evident, with Reagans communications director, Pat Buchanan, famously calling AIDS natures revenge on gay men.Reagan also popularized the myth of the welfare queen, a racist stereotype targeting Black women as manipulative abusers of social welfare programs. He painted an image of lazy, fraudulent individuals taking advantage of government assistance, which helped to erode public support for these programs and further marginalized vulnerable communities. This narrative fueled racial division, which the GOP continues to exploit.Reagans economic policies, often called trickle-down economics, promised that tax cuts for the wealthy would benefit everyone. In reality, these cuts widened the gap between rich and poor, as the benefits never trickled down to the working class. Reagan compensated for these tax cuts by increasing spending elsewhere, particularly on defense, while cutting social programs that working-class Americans relied on. This redistribution of wealth upward became a cornerstone of GOP economic policy.Reagans administration also sought to make higher education less accessible. His Education Secretary, William Bennett, argued that access to college was leading to student activism and increasing demands for civil rights. By cutting education funding and increasing tuition costs, they made it harder for working-class and marginalized groups to attain higher education and advocate for progressive change, stifling social mobility and dissent.Whats happening today is a continuation of these regressive and authoritarian tendencies. The GOP is using the courts, media, and voter suppression to dismantle democracy, and theyre borrowing tactics straight out of Putins playbook. This isnt just about some elements of the partyits the entire GOP moving in lockstep toward fascism.","title":"Mayor Of Wisconsin GOP Stronghold Says He Will Vote For Kamala Harris"},{"text":"That's not what the registrations show.

They are just mask-off.The GOP has been systematically shifting toward authoritarianism, and its not just fringe elementsthe entire party is complicit. Theyre using many of the same tactics that authoritarian regimes like Putins in Russia have used to consolidate power and dismantle democratic institutions.For starters, the GOP has weaponized the courts to cement their agenda. Trump boasted about the importance of the judiciary, saying, We need nine justices. You need that, with the unsolicited millions of ballots theyre sending (Fox &amp; Friends, September 2020). Thats why Mitch McConnell blocked Obamas Supreme Court pick and pushed through Trumps appointees like Amy Coney Barrett. Decisions like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and Shelby County v. Holder (which gutted the Voting Rights Act) are clear examples of how theyre using the courts to control outcomes that benefit their agenda, restricting voting rights and eroding civil liberties.This isnt just a coincidenceit mirrors what Vladimir Putin did to take over Russia. When Putin came to power, he quickly restructured the judiciary, replacing independent judges with loyalists who would rubber-stamp his decisions. He used the courts to legitimize extending his rule and prosecuting opponents, just like the GOP is using courts to undermine voting rights and dismantle progressive gains. As Putin said back in 2007, Everything is decided through the courts.Beyond the courts, the GOP has been undermining faith in democratic institutions altogether. Trump repeatedly attacked the legitimacy of the 2020 election, claiming, We had an election that was stolen from us (January 6 rally). His lies led directly to the January 6 insurrection, and even after that, many GOP leaders continued to spread election fraud conspiracies. This deliberate undermining of trust in democracy is a classic authoritarian move.Theyve also been scapegoating and demonizing minority groups to create division and distract from their real agenda. Trumps infamous comments about immigrantsWhen Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best Theyre rapists (June 16, 2015)are a prime example of how the GOP uses fear and hate to rally their base. We see this again in their attacks on transgender rights and in bills like the Dont Say Gay law in Florida. They target vulnerable groups to stoke division, just like past authoritarian regimes.","title":"Mayor Of Wisconsin GOP Stronghold Says He Will Vote For Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Grab your sledgehammers boys and girls.

Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has marshalled a whole of government effort to reduce all sources of lead exposure, issuing a comprehensive Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan that guides federal action to achieve a lead-free future.Today [October 24th], as we continue to mark National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to further reduce lead exposure by issuing a final Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule to strengthen requirements for the removal of lead paint dust in pre-1978 housing and child care facilities.Lead is a neurotoxin that can irreversibly harm brain development in children, lower IQ, cause behavioral problems, and lead to life-long health effects. There is no safe level of lead exposure. Yet, due to decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color.Todays final rule sets new standards for lead abatement activities that will better protect children and communities from the harmful effects of exposure to dust generated from lead paint. The rule will help protect people in communities across the country from these harms, and is expected to reduce the lead exposures of up to nearly 1.2 million people every year, providing public health and economic benefits up to 30 times greater than the costs. Although the United States banned lead-based paint in residences in 1978, an estimated 31 million houses built before 1978 still contain lead-based paint, and 3.8 million are home to one or more child under the age of six, putting them at risk of lead exposure.Since the announcement of the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, the Administration has taken hundreds of actions across more than 10 agencies to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in drinking water, paint, soil, food and household products, the workplace, and to combat lead exposure internationally C including more than 100 actions in the past year alone. Some of the actions since the latest Action Plan progress update in November 2023 include:Each of the following has additional bullet points with details in the press release:**Reducing Exposure to Lead from Paint and Dust in the Home** C Lead in household dust originates from indoor sources such as deteriorated, lead-based paint on surfaces. In the last year, the Administration has worked diligently to identify, help tackle, and eliminate these exposures in several ways:* Earlier this month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced more than $420 million in awards to remove lead hazards from homes, including HUD-assisted homes, ensuring the safety of children, residents, and families. This includes $2 million to remove other housing-related hazards from homes in conjunction with weatherization efforts, and nearly $10 million to facilitate research on better identifying and controlling lead and other housing-related hazards. These awards are part of President Bidens Justice40 Initiative, which seeks to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. ...  \\n**Reducing Exposure to Lead from Drinking Water** C Millions of buildings still receive their water through a lead pipe. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to meet President Bidens commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a decade:* Earlier this month President Biden traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to announce a final rule that requires drinking water systems nationwide to replace lead service lines within 10 years. This rule will protect children from brain damage, prevent up to 900,000 infants being born with low birth weight, and protect 1,100 adults from premature death from heart disease every year....  \\n**Reducing Exposure to Lead from Air** C Major sources of lead in the air include emissions from manufacturing, waste and metals processing, and aircraft operating on leaded aviation fuel. To tackle these emissions, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken the following actions:* In January 2024, EPA released the Integrated Science Assessment for Lead as part of its review of the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This technical document, along with additional technical and policy assessments, will provide the scientific foundation for EPAs decisions as it regulates air lead exposure....  \\n**Reducing Exposure to Lead from Soil** C Lead contamination at legacy pollution sites from past industrial operations, like lead mining and smelting, can accumulate in soil and poses a threat to human health and the environment. Reducing lead levels in soils can reduce exposure risks.* The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $5 billion to clean up legacy pollution, including lead contamination, at Superfund and Brownfields sites. In Fiscal Year 2024, EPA completed 63 Superfund cleanup projects that addressed lead contamination in soil to protect families and children from the harmful impacts of lead. In addition, lead is the environmental contaminant most commonly reported by EPA Brownfields cleanup grant recipients. In fiscal year 2024, Brownfields grant recipients completed 63 brownfields cleanups that addressed lead contamination....  \\n**Reducing Exposure to Lead from Food and Household Products** C Lead may be present in food when it is in the environment where foods are grown, raised, or processed. To reduce the risk to children of ingesting lead in food, the Administration is working to addressed lead hazards in processed foods.* In September 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a new study on dietary exposure from lead in infants and young children. This action is part of the agencys Closer to Zero effort, which sets forth the FDAs science-based approach to continually reduce exposure to lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and other contaminants to the lowest levels possible in foods eaten by babies and young children.**Protecting People from Lead Exposure in the Workplace** C Workers can be exposed to lead as a result of the production, use, maintenance, recycling, and disposal of lead material and products. In 2024, the Administration sought to protect workers through a number of actions.  * In April 2024, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) released Trends in Workplace Lead Exposure, monitoring workplace lead exposure trends through the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program....  \\n**Accelerating Innovations to Improve Blood Lead Testing** C Testing blood is the best way to determine if a person has had lead exposure, as there are often no immediate symptoms when someone is exposed to lead. Based on blood lead test results, healthcare providers can recommend follow-up actions and care.* In March 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Phase 2 of the Lead Detect Prize on challenge.gov, inviting selected Phase 1 participants to develop their winning concepts into detailed designs. This challenge provides a $1 million prize pool to accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-care blood lead testing technology. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FDA support the challenge, and it spotlights the urgent need to identify and foster new or existing breakthrough solutions and products for optimal lead testing in children.**Establishing Domestic Partnerships to Reduce All Lead Exposure** C The Administration is engaging stakeholders in a number of ways to reduce community exposure to lead in the United States.* In July 2024, the Presidents Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children published the Progress Report on the Federal Lead Action Plan, a comprehensive update on the governments progress since 2018 toward reducing childhood lead exposures. HUD, EPA, and HHS, as co-leading members of the Task Forces Lead Subcommittee, are leading aggressive actions to combat lead exposure. The Federal Lead Action Plan promotes a vision that the United States will become a place where children, especially those in communities with environmental justice concerns, can live, learn and play and remain safe from lead exposure and its harmful effects....  \\n**Spearheading an International Effort to Reduce Global Lead Exposure** C Amidst historic actions taken domestically to combat lead exposure in the United States, the Administration has built an unprecedented global coalition to tackle lead exposure in low- and middle-income countries, where one in two children has elevated levels of lead in their blood.* In September 2024, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) joined UNICEF and over 60 partners and 26 countries to launch the Partnership for a Lead-Free Future, the first-ever public-private partnership dedicated to tackling lead exposure in low- and middle-income countries. The Partnership committed $150 million toward this effortat least 10 times the average estimated annual investment to combat lead exposure internationally over the past five years.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-Harris Administration Strengthens Standards to Protect Millions from Exposure to Lead Paint Dust, Announces New Actions to Address Toxic Lead Exposure"},{"text":"Yeah, but just remember the people attacking you and laugh.

Undisclosed product placement is already illegal, and that doesn't seem to have been a very controversial decision.?\\nMore than that though, the FCC itself did recommend that the laws be made more strict back in 08. This was because production companies would use props without saying they were sponsored.?\\nSo part of what in am saying is that we should be enforcing the existing law that no one seems to really oppose, except for those who make money by skirting around those laws. I don't think this is very controversial, hopefully we're on the same page here.?\\nAs for an outright ban, that's just my personal opinion. Personally I think deceptive ads are a real problem, as is advertising in general. I think there's a lot of product placement in kids shows for example, and in that case kids don't know what the disclosure means so a disclosure doesn't work and it should be banned. Perhaps you agree with that too.?\\nI also think product placement in general is just bad for people. The most common forms are always junk food and soda, things that kill people. I don't think disclosure really works because people don't really see it. I think we are subjected to too many ads as it is, and that making it less obvious what is and isn't an ad is very dangerous. If it were up to me (and it isn't obviously), then I'd ban a lot of forms of advertising. I'd ban it in public spaces for example, because I think you should have to opt in on some level to ads, and we can't really opt out of driving on the highway, or looking up at the sky at the beach.?\\nIt's complicated, I don't think it will be banned but I do think the rules need to be considerably more strict and that's a belief that is echoed by experts including the FCC.","title":"CMV: If I pay for YouTube premium, the web/app should automatically skip all sponsors within the video"},{"text":"True, but if americans were a majority republican we wouldn't be having this discussion at all.

Strengthening Americas domestic HALEU supply chain is essential to supporting the demonstration and deployment of advanced reactor technologies, creating new good-paying, high-quality jobs, and reinforcing Americas leadership in the nuclear industry. Todays announcementfunded by the Inflation Reduction Actis another critical step by President Biden and Vice President Harris to bolster Americas energy and national security, achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, and build a strong, reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply chain free of influence from adversarial foreign nations.  \\n...  \\nHALEU is uranium enriched between 5 and 20 percent, which increases the amount of fissile material to make the fuel more efficient relative to lower-enriched forms of uranium. Many advanced reactors will use HALEU to achieve smaller designs, longer operating cycles, and increased efficiencies over current technologies. Under these contracts, selected companies will bid on future work to produce and store HALEU in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas to eventually be made into fuel for advanced reactors. Advanced nuclear reactors are key to our nations clean energy future and meeting our nations ambitious clean energy and climate goals. The United States currently lacks commercial HALEU enrichment capabilities to support the deployment of advanced reactors. These contracts support the buildout of a robust HALEU supply chain in the United States and complement last weeks announcement of contracts to support HALEU deconversion services. Four companies have been awarded contracts funded by the Presidents Inflation Reduction Act, creating strong competition and allowing DOE to select the best fit for future work. All contracts will last for up to 10 years and each awardee receives a minimum contract of $2 million, with up to $2.7 billion available for these services, subject to the availability of appropriations.  \\n...  \\nTodays announcement also advances the Biden-Harris Administrations ?Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  The HALEU that DOE acquires through these contracts will be used to support reactors like those under development through DOEs Advanced Reactor Demonstration ProgramTerraPower's Natrium reactor and X-energy's Xe-100.List of contract recipients are in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to advance nuclear energyensuring the nations largest source of carbon-free electricity is positioned to slash harmful, planet-warming emissions and power our economy for generations to come, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Todays announcement represents the Biden-Harris Administrations latest efforts to build a secure domestic HALEU supply chain, which is essential to bringing advanced nuclear reactors online and meeting the growing demand for clean, reliable electricity.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Four Contracts to Boost Domestic HALEU Supply and Reinforce Americas Nuclear Energy Leadership as Part of Investing in America Agenda"},{"text":"*Sighs*Damn it, why can't people just for *once* live up to the basic standards of decency?

What the left could do to better attract men in regards to sex/dating is a) acknowledge that there are problematic behavior by both genders that create issues in dating, and b) acknowledge that women can be as superficial as men and that \\"self improvement\\" is not a silver bullet to guarantee success in dating.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Theyre no longer heels.

Therefore, at least on the surface, many will play the good subordinate in order to keep their base voters and any new major donors happy.To the framers mind the people who would be more appropriately on the hot seat for legislative direction should be the Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader, since technically the Presidents job is not legislative, but the overseer of enforcement of the law and the main point of contact in foreign relations/emergency powers. The thing with Trump however is that no one who acts like him in down ballot races ever gets the same numbers he does. They get a solid chuck of the vote, but struggle to win in same party primaries as well as competitive districts. They seem to mostly survive in already deeply red areas. This is the opposite of when the Tea Party movement was on the rise, though there is a lot of sameness to them.If there is any difference to Trumps appeal vs others it might be boiled down to the screw nuance Ill do what I want approach to everything. There is a good chuck of voters who only understand policy at a surface level, and spend even less time understanding how the sausage is made. It takes a lot of time and research to understand how legislation may or may not move forward simply because the chair of a committee is going to have issue with a line of the text that could hurt their district, but they wont say that directly. They will however use their position to stop the bill from ever coming up for a hearing. Same goes for possible circumstances where one legislator didnt trade favors with another enough, so out of spite they wont support whatever in the early stages. By the time a bill hits the floor for a full vote all of these chess moves have played out behind the scenes, most of the time.

There can and should be more compassion for young men when they voice their issues with dating. We need more room for them to express themselves in a healthier way. However, we're all strangers and entering into conversations that aren't moderated well at all. I can't control the comments here and yet people will take the worse comments as the example of the left. They will also distort my comments to have the worst interpretation too.This sub is a great example. The purpose of the sub is not to help young men, but often young men come in here looking for help. The problem is the frame of mind of others posting is this is the 10th post ranting about this or that they've seen over the past month or two. People don't want to argue the same talking points, especially since sometimes it ends with them talking to someone for hours and the person digging in their heels. But when it comes to the issue that these young men find themselves struggling with -- how to form and strengthen relationships, how to start a family -- a lot of leftists all of a sudden adopt a markedly right-wing stance that \\"no one owes you that\\", \\"invest in yourself first\\", etc.I have to pushback a little here. Policies that reduce costs, increase housing supply, add a social safety net, increases services to deal with mental health, etc. These all help men. Online there is talk of third spaces nowadays too. Which is something that would help everyone socialize more. The other aspect of this convo is there are places to date and meet people IRL.Often when men talk about struggling they are told to join clubs, pick up hobbies, practice good grooming habits, exercise, etc. This can be met with dismissal. It's the whole point of the blackpill. That men are naturally in a hierarchy and women fuck around until they find a beta cuck to settle down with. That's the content a lot of these teens and young men are exposed to. The flip side is these convos don't start at a place where these teens are ready or capable of opening up. I mean I certainly wouldn't open up to random internet strangers either. I am just not sure what we can tell young men when it comes to dating that will get through to them if they're in a state of anger online. While I think the left needs to do better at positive content geared towards men, cynicism is popular online. Being mad is a drug basically. Dunking on someone or something feels a lot better than searching through how you feel and coming across something you don't like. I am not against the left doing more for men. But I don't think right wing content does much for men in the long term and maybe not even in the short term. These streamers and content creators find a new thing to rile people up daily because they need clicks and views.I think we need to extend more empathy and compassion to teens and young men online. However, that is not easy to do. And frankly anyone who makes fun of them online will be seen as the enemy despite them maybe being just like them, right? Go to IG comment sections or Youtube or other places online and you see very mean teen boys and young men attacking other men and other people. They're not leftists. So part of this is you can't change the internet. The other part is spaces for men to explore how they feel in a healthy way need to be created regardless of politics.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Yeah, for my poli-sci classes, I read a few of his books.

He also advocates for accelerationism (or at least defends it) in a few of his books and is an anarchist personally. All interesting points. \\nHowever, I fundamentally disagree with his conclusions, tho that the Libs are just the republicans *NOW*. IN 2008, SURE Obama and the Clintons were basically 1980s Republicans on economic issues, but certainly not anywhere close to the Republicans on social issues. Hedges blatantly ignores social issues in the majority of his work, and I think that's a MASSIVE blind spot for the left in general. \\nRight now, the Right are using genocidal rhetoric against a large minority of the country, and Trump himself is a unique threat to our democracy.

I think a lot of the perspective in those circles is that men collectively are guilty, or don't matter, or the suffering of men causes less if it's caused by other men. It would be helpful to more meaningfully recognize that people are people, and collective guilt or ignoring one person's suffering because you think another's is more important is not going to be constructive. To use a very specific example, I saw a lot of rhetoric like how men dying younger and committing suicide more is really a toxic masculinity problem and therefore a feminist issue. But when the actionable item based on that isn't to free up men to be open, or to get us help when we need it, or to recognize that real issues are issues no matter whose they are, that just pushes people away. The argument that we don't get to deserve help because of patriarchy or even that we're somehow collectively guilty is simply not going to resonate.I appreciate and agree with OP's disclaimers - this isn't everyone, the internet is a vast place with every combination of nutjobs, etc - but I also almost fell down the frustrated white man rabbit hole, and got out because I was horrified by the rhetoric on the other end of the spectrum too.What I'd *like* to see is less of a team-based approach. We all want to fix gender/race issues. But I think part of that is shifting the rhetoric from who has it worse, or who's causing it, to simply this is the problem and this is how we fix it. It's still offensive to me that domestic violence is basically synonymous with violence against women by men - even if that's 90% of it (which it isn't, but I digress) why leave the other 10% suffering in silence? Instead of shifting everything from \\"well actually that's a toxic masculinity thing and really a women's problem\\" how about a \\"yes this is real and terrible and we need to address it too?\\" It's not OK to be basically get told to sit back and shut up until all the other problems are addressed first.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"As a Republican politician, how does a show of integrity benefit them, when the Republican voter base has shown they don't really care about integrity?","title":"CMV: Republican politicians would benefit from denouncing Donald Trump"},{"text":" effective unconventional (yet EBP) groups using D&amp;D.

Despite hiring a first-rate advertising agency, initial sales were very disappointing. The agency was fired and a new agency and a new campaign was launched. Sales continued to disappoint. If anything, they fell even further. In desperation, the CEO called in all of the top executives for a brainstorming session to analyze what had gone wrong with the two campaigns and how a new campaign might revive sales.The meeting went on for hours. Sophisticated statistical analysis was brought to bear on the problem. One VP argued that the mix of TV and print ads had been messed up. Another argued that the previous campaigns had been too subtle and had failed to feature the product with sufficient prominence. Another argued that the TV ad campaign had focused too much on spots during sporting events and not enough on regular programming with a broader demographic. Another argued the oppositeCnot enough sports programming had been targeted. After the debate had raged for hours, the CEO felt they had accomplished very little. He asked if anyone else had any theories that might explain the failure of the new product.

My own experiences as a 45M left me feeling pretty confused and whiplashed when it comes to \\"woke\\"ness.  Just spitballing ideas here:  \\n  \\n1.  I'm a nerd.  Literally none of my nerd friends have any interest in Andrew Tate and the \\"manosphere\\".  We enjoy the non-MMA episodes of Joe Rogan from time to time, because we get a kick out of edgy comedy, talking about aliens, talking about DMT, and the lead singer of Tool.   We enjoy Sam Harris when he talks about free will or science.  We love the Huberman Lab because it's cutting edge science that we can implement without government interference in our self experimentation.   All of the right wing stuff, we avoid like the goddamn plague.  So, I wonder, is this a \\"men\\" problem, or a \\"dumb men\\" problem.     \\n2.  Before Elon bought Twitter, I left Twitter because it was fucking toxic.  What Sam Harris calls the \\"Blue Haired Taliban\\" would brigade even the most mild of insensitivities.  And they would make idiotic comments all the time which showed they did not even understand their own positions on things.  And almost all of that behavior I saw was from young women and young men who did not identify as cis-gendered.   I never ran into issues when I posted something about Cheney being a literal war criminal - the right wing would either not engage at all, or a few people would debate me in a way that was confrontational but not cruel or ignorant.  Since he bought Twitter, I have returned to using it, and have not once encountered any of the behavior I used to see that made me leave.  Most of my critical posts on there are direct replies to Elon's tweets, and basically no one engages with my comments, which is fine and not pushing me away.  \\n3.  Throughout my life, I have seen what at least appears to me like a gender gap when it comes to sensitivity.  Men, by and large, saying awful things about each other tends to roll off our backs like water on a duck, while women, especially college educated ones, seem to be way more sensitive to such comments.  The exceptions sort of prove the rule - a lot of the female comedians that Rogan has on for example are no holds barred jokers, who can roast and be roasted with the best of them.  In social media, you can't \\"turn off\\" for example just women so that they don't see your posts (unlike real life where you can direct your comments to \\"only the boys in the locker room\\").  So things you might say comfortably in a real life setting, saying on social media can get you flayed in a way no one likes.  \\n4.  I am ECONOMICALLY leftist.  I am not convinced of woke cultural ideas (though I see some merit in some of them).  I do not want to be seen as a member of the Blue Haired Taliban.  I would rather be compared with Marx, Guevara, Malcom X, Lina Khan and Bernie.   I do not want to be put in the same bucket as angry lesbians who want to cancel JK Rowling.    \\n5. Socially, I am way more libertarian.  Meaning, I grew up at a time when George Carlin was doing the words you can't say on TV.  I got suspended once for using obscene gestures during a high school marching band event.  I enjoy GWAR concerts where they dismember political figures on stage and we all dance in their blood.  Having fun breaking social norms is excellent, and I do not understand how it came to be that the \\"liberal\\" team became the enforcers of social norms, when \\"conservatives\\" have been the Gestapo of social norms my entire life.  What the fuck is going on here?I don't understand what is happening or why it is happening, but these are my feelings and observations for what they are worth.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Wait I thought you were talking about democrats attacking capitol hill in 2017?? thousands of them rioting and crushing shit?!?!I also do not remember anyone storming the White House or trying to remove Trump but I'd genuinely love if you could please send me a link or educate me in any way about any of this because right now it seems pretty obvious you are either out of touch with reality or talking completely out of your ass.","title":"the left/dems/media have successfully convinced millions of Americans that (1) Trump is Hitler and (2) Trump will commit mass murder and (3) Trump will take complete power over America and make it a fascist state."},{"text":"I'm wondering what my ballot is going to look like.

So what do you propose the online left does? Which sounds more enticing to an angry teen; a message of compassion and empathy or a message of anger?I'm a man in my mid-40s, and I've been married for almost 20 years, so my experience here isn't first-hand. I've literally never used an on-line dating platform, and I haven't been on a date with a new prospective partner since the very early 2000s.I do see some empathy for young men, but what I see *much more* is that when they complain about their lack of success, people on all sides tell them that the world doesn't owe them anything (and specifically that no one owes them sex). While that may be *valid*, it's an incredibly adversarial and unempathetic way to put it.The more general form of it (that the world doesn't owe you anything) is also *anti-leftist*. The leftist worldview includes that communities *do* have obligations to their members (although in varying forms and degrees, depending on the flavor of leftism). So what these men are seeing is that leftists look at a person struggling with unemployment, and the leftists universally say that society should help them in some way, whether it's providing job retraining (honestly that's more liberal/neoliberal) or monetary support or restructuring society so that everyone who wants to work *is* provided a job.When a person complains about struggling with acquiring healthcare, leftists say that society should provide hospitals and *incentivize* healthcare workers to work in underserved areas to provide care *where the people are*. I've never seen a leftist say, \\"The people in poor underserved communities should just move if doctors don't want to work there,\\" or \\"OK, but first let's talk about what you've done to improve your health. Maybe you haven't *earned* healthcare!\\" I've certainly never heard, \\"Yeah, but a lot of people like you are dangerous, so it's understandable that health care workers might not want to help you.\\"But when it comes to the issue that these young men find themselves struggling with -- how to form and strengthen relationships, how to start a family -- a lot of leftists all of a sudden adopt a markedly right-wing stance that \\"no one owes you that\\", \\"invest in yourself first\\", etc.Of course no woman should be told, \\"You must go have sex with that man because he's feeling bad and it will help him,\\" but *fuck* there's a lot of room in between.My point here isn't that the right-wing is  good or justified (I do not believe that even a little bit).

I have read a decent amount of what took place, but it takes a lot of prior understanding and many articles to piece together all of what happened and I still believe the picture is incomplete. I was wondering, what are the set of articles/stories that you would recommend that provide the most comprehensive understanding of what actually occurred?What would your estimate be in percentage terms of how much these public articles cover of what actually happened? Are there other significant aspects to the story that havent been covered publicly that is very alarming? Do you think our existing system is too weak to stop a coup? How would the active duty military stop him from illegal unconstitutional orders? What do you think they learned for next time for increasing their likelihood of success? Lastly, what would you say are the biggest parts of this story? Pretty broad ask in the sense your perspective and intimate knowledge. For instance, significant breaks in protocol, failures in the system that still exist and need to be remedied, single critical points of failure for the coup attempt that was dependent on one person holding true to their oath, general charles Flynn and his unofficial involvement, the coordinations that took place, guardrails that did and did not work, missteps, ways the military and national guard were or attempted to be used by each side, etc. I think you likely understand what I Im getting at. I think a lot of people on the outside can hear something that occurred and it doesnt register with them the significance of that event or action because they have no idea of the processes or operations to understand significant of a departure it is from the norm or how grave it is. Thanks so much! It is only that actions by people like yourself, the retired generals in his cabinet, and White House legal council that held that thin line that halted this.","title":"Here we go!

Or, at least, not entirely. Progressivism seeks to dismantle power dynamics in traditional gender roles as they've been practiced. This absolutely does take a certain degree of power away from men. What it gives back to men--the ability to be a whole emotional person who can form real, meaningful emotional connections with others and participate in equal partnerships in a fair and sustainable way--is of more value. But if you've bought in to traditional versions of masculinity (or have had them shouted at you so long at such a formative age that you can't see the world a different way) then you're not allowed to believe that these things have value. And to gain this \\"valueless\\" thing, they have to give up the position of authority or \\"leadership\\" in the family unit that traditional gender roles promises. These men might not be able to put a finger on what they're losing, but they sure as hell can feel that they've lost *something*. All the rhetorical softening in the world isn't going to change that.It's not a coincidence that the inability for these men to get into a romantic partnership is front and center in this conversation. It's not about sex, but if you're unable to admit the value of relationships on an emotional level, and you can't necessarily face that you've been promised dominion over another person as payment for emotionally crippling yourself, you don't have a way to describe it except to say the issue is sex. So they're left in this weird place. Men who \\"can't get laid\\" really can't find a woman who wants to participate in that traditional power dynamic with them because it's easier for women to see that it's a bad deal. Men get fed a lot of answers about how to meet someone, or how to superficially attract women, etc., but it's never going to work because the thing they need to do to get into a relationship is change their expectations of power dynamics so they stop waving (accurate) red flags at all the women they meet. You can join all the clubs you want, and go to the gym and make more money, but it isn't going to change that you're offering women something they don't (and shouldn't) want. There are two ways out of this problem for men: 1. Accept this trade (sacrificing relational power within the family unit for full personhood and equal relationship) that doesn't seem like a good deal because of your gender role indoctrination, even if you can't put into words why.2. Force society to change back so you can still give up your emotional personhood for the chance to be in control somewhere. Make women *have* to be with men to survive so they *have* to go back and accept the bad deal for them. But it turns out that number two is not, in fact, an option. At least, not without a huge degree of push back from women and men who have learned to see that the value in what they gain from dismantling traditional gender power dynamics is greater than what they lost. This is an adapt-or-die-alone moment, and it never feels good to be forced to take a deal that feels bad to you, regardless of the rhetoric around it. I don't think the solution is a soft landing space for men that plays down what they're giving up. There's nuance around the concept of privilege that's impossible to hear when you're being forced to take a deal that feels like a bad one, no matter how it's framed.I think the solution is helping them see the value of what they'll gain if they can let go of the expectations of power and control that the old system would give them. And I think, by and large, this is happening. Modeling healthy, equal partnerships. Men talking openly about their feelings in a way that doesn't diminish their power or the respect others give him. If there's rhetoric that should be changed, I think it's in women being more vocal in how much they love and appreciate the men who have made the switch. To a man sitting there alone, seeing a woman talk about how much she loves, values, respects, and appreciates a man who does not fulfill the expectations of traditional masculinity may make what's on the other side of the bargain not seem so bleak. It's harder to tell themselves she's \\"settling for beta bucks\\" if she's talking genuinely and openly to anyone who can hear her. about how much she respects her husband. If it no longer feels to men like they're being forced to take a bad deal, but being offered something more valuable instead, the nuances in conversations around privilege and all that become much, much easier to see, and they won't feel so much like they're being attacked.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Yes, he did.

Etc.?\\n?You can, sometimes, use your privilege to be a dick. Especially when you're not careful.?\\nYou can also, sometimes, use your privilege in helpful ways, especially when you're aware of it.?

However, its a problem without a structural solution.  \\nI disagree. The structural / social problem arises because we, as a society, are not interested in teaching our children how to have healthy sexual relationships. Sex is taboo and the only real messages we give kids about sex are that adults don't want them having sex and if they do have sex here are the mechanical steps to ensure a lack of disease and pregnancy. We teach our kids that sex is an impersonal act. When in reality, because it is very personal, trying to seek out sex for the sake of sex is inherently narcissistic. A trait that tends to make one not particularly socially accepted. Responsible adults need to do a better job of providing examples about this kind of objectification and why it is problematic. And the benefits of not engaging in that sort of behavior.Learning how to build relationships with women as people requires good role models. Providing motivation to do so is also essential. As long as young men seek relationships with women primarily for sexual gratification, they'll struggle to be sexually gratified. Regardless of age, the fastest way to get laid is to be interested in women for who they are as people without much thought to any sexual benefits that may arise. If one engages women with genuine caring and curiosity about who they are as individuals, if one pursues friendship and companionship for its own sake, if one seeks first to be a good friend. Well, getting laid just happensa lot.I was a chubby, rather plain-looking teen. I wasn't a football player or otherwise remarkable. I had no special social standing. I had way more sex than several people I knew, including popular athletes. Oddly, I never went looking for it either. As now a 50-something, aging single male, I listen to other single men complain how they can't find dates. How they can't have sex. How women are overly picky. How women have all the power on dating apps. How they will forever be alone because they aren't tall, handsome, rich, etc. And I move along through my life having great dates, amazing sex, and never really trying to do so. Simply because I go onto these sites looking to meet interesting people and engage them as people rather than as someone I want something from. Young men need well-adjusted adults (men and women) to teach them how to have satisfying relationships with others, to include an explanation that having healthy friendships often turn into healthy sexual relationships, and how those relationships and events should be handled to ensure the underlying friendship and mutual respect that allowed for the friendship to become sexual can be navigated well. And as a society, we don't teach that to young people, men or women. And that is a structural problem.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Very clear signs of dementia.

Men have, what, sports? Even then, I knew that in middle school that my female teammates had a better chance to go to college on a sports scholarship than I did. Everyone did. Title IX pushes for equal scholarships across all sports, and football eats up all the scholarships for men, so in every other sport you were probably half as likely as a woman to get one. So then when their teachers say they have male privilege, they aren't just not including things like class.  They are basing it on a lot of societal factors that they have never seen or experienced. They haven't even been passed over for a promotion in mid-high level tech position or not been taken seriously in a board meeting. Its just not their reality. Any push back is met with hostility, they are privileged and any refutation is a sign of toxic masculinity, stupidity, or malice.

If you start to point out the facts that they're missing, they start to wake up and realize that they need to pay better attention.","title":"Lifelong Republican, just voted democrat down the ballot.

Things are not all black and white. There have to be compromises. The middle of the road is all of the usable surface. The extremes, right and left, are in the gutters.\\nI read that back in middle school and it always stuck with me. Compromise has to exist for our system of government to work.

I think this post shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the economics of YouTube and I want to clear some things up - hopefully in a way that changes your mind. First of all, ads on YouTube are placed inside videos on a manual and semi-random basis. Creators can place ads in their video manually, they can let YouTube place the ads automatically, and sometimes even if you place ads manually YT will add in more of their own. YouTubers don't control what ads play, nor do they control how much money they make from these ads. Nor is YouTube transparent about ad revenues per ad. Every video on a channel is summarized into a single number that determines the video's average revenue per ad. And we can't change or even affect that. This number can swing wildly from video to video, and it can swing wildly from month to month as advertisers increase or decrease ad spending. The key here though is that monthly revenue for YTers is wildly outside of our control. YT Premium on the other hand is a stable income - somewhat. The details of how it works are a bit shaky, but in effect we receive a portion of your subscription cost spread out over the videos you choose to watch, in place of ad revenue. That money is guaranteed if you watch a video.\\nSponsors work very?differently. Sponsorships are often flat fee deals to include an ad inside of a video. Sometimes they include riders in their contracts for performance - that is, how many people watched the video? Did viewers watch the sponsored ad? Was there a large viewer drop off during/before the ad, etc. These performance riders are not guaranteed, and sponsors can be notably stingy about them. YouTube Premium is amazing because it prevents disruptive ads from playing in the middle of your videos. It's also something that is split between YT and it's creators. Sponsorships go 100% to the creator, and in many cases skipping them can actively hurt a YTer's income. I've had performance riders fall through because of a 1% viewer margin for a sponsorship. If only 1% of viewers had continued to watch 10 seconds of footage, I would have earned a few hundred dollars more.\\nI'm not saying it's your responsibility to watch ads on a creator's behalf, but doing so can be the difference between a creator being able to hire a new videographer or editor, or make their next video that much bigger, or reach whatever goal it is they have set for themselves. I *do* think there's some merit to the idea that joining as a paid member of the channel should skip sponsored ads. That membership can make a BIG direct impact on a creator's bottom line. I also think what you're talking about about is why many creators have ad-free patreon tiers as a way of circumventing sponsors and ads all together.\\nBut I also think that in general, viewers expect too much for too little. Ad blockers actively hurt creators. Skipping sponsored segments can hurt creators.?And the realities of the economics on YT is that running ads is more profitable than even patreon or premiun memberships where a very very very small number of viewers ever engage. All of this is at the expense of the person who's putting out that content you enjoy and clearly see value in.","title":"CMV: If I pay for YouTube premium, the web/app should automatically skip all sponsors within the video"},{"text":"Lmfao","title":"The DNC apparently sent talk radio host Tavis Smiley a series of questions to ask Dr. Jill Stein on his show.

YouTube does not know what/how a creator earns from a sponsor slot in a video, so they cannot compensate creators fairly when a user pays for skipping them. Since they cannot fairly compensate creators, they don't take that monetization away.For example, maybe a creator gets a flat fee rather than one that's contingent on the number of views the video gets. Or maybe they get paid based on conversions (number of people using the promo code) rather than views. Maybe there is some other condition (amount of views within in a specific date range). Or maybe the sponsorship isn't tied to the particular video. Maybe it's a sponsorship that covers the combined performance of several videos or even multi-platform performance (e.g. combined views across YouTube, TikTok and Twitch). Not to mention that the value of the sponsorship may vary by creator... sponsors will pay more to be in a video that very accurately lines up with their target audience compared with one that is just a broad hit (e.g. a company that helps you study for the bar exams will pay more to advertise on a legal education YouTube channel than other channels). Or maybe it's not even about views per se but the brand benefit of a particularly trusted creator associating with a product. So, put this all together and YouTube has no way of knowing how much a creator should be compensated to be fair for taking out their promo.Also, a major reason that YouTubers add other revenue streams is to avoid being at the mercy of what content YouTube demonitizes. For example, I know medical channels that have had certain videos demonetized because they (legitimately) mentioned drug use or had (appropriate) graphic content. For YouTube to take over these other revenue streams would defeat the entire point of why they are there in the first place. These non-YouTube-run revenue streams help the platform support a more diverse set of content.","title":"CMV: If I pay for YouTube premium, the web/app should automatically skip all sponsors within the video"},{"text":"Another fine MAGA boy goes down.","title":"Phoenix man charged with shooting Democratic office had 250,000 rounds and a grenade launcher"},{"text":"Federal minimum wage is barely enough to live out of your car.","title":"Kamala Harris labels current federal minimum wage as 'poverty' pay"},{"text":"With YouTube premium you can see where people skip so why not take the minimum effort to move your mouse and skip past the ad?You pay for your video to not get forced into viewing an ad by YouTube, not for the video creator's decision to get a sponsorship and include it in their video. For some, it's the only way they can make revenue from a video so why not look at it more positively for what it is.  \\n\\\\Imagine that you go to a cafe, you pay for the coffee you are going to drink, but to drink it you have to listen to an advertisement that the waiter is going to tell you.  \\n\\\\Nobody would go to that cafe!Define ad. Is she suggesting a coffee? Is she talking about a promotion? That's her job so why should I let that affect me negatively. I'll just take my coffee and forget about it. If I'm in a hurry I'll cut her them off and just ask for my coffee (like skipping the sponsored part). I don't think a server doing something like that would be a reason a cafe closes. If they have a good enough product, people will still give them business. It's like a YouTube video with sponsors, if they put out good content, most people won't care about the 30 second sponsor as much as they care about consuming content from their favorite creators.","title":"CMV: If I pay for YouTube premium, the web/app should automatically skip all sponsors within the video"},{"text":"Semper Fi, Sergeant!","title":"Here we go!

A lot of men are granted favorable rights because they are men, and that is 100x if you are white instead of black.  That's a problem and a fact. A random white 14 yo boy is not responsible for those problems. Their parents might be, but they are not.How you frame the issue despite saying exactly the same things makes all the difference. And yes it is tone policing. No one wants to be told they are responsible for something just by association, it's entirely counter productive, and often times just untrue. If I started a new job and was told \\"oh btw you are being punished for this thing that a person before you did\\" i would get up and leave!The problem OP is trying to target is that while YES young men are the same biological make up of many men who commit atrocities and cause pain and suffering for many. Those specific young men DID NOT DO ANYTHING. And yet they are being treated like monsters and creeps and given undue hesitance because of an ingrained fear. That fear and the subsequent treatment of young men is the exact thing that is pushing young men away. The answer OP is loking for with regards to how do we change the narrative/online presence is that you need the counter to these other influencers but on the left. For every Shapiro or Tate we need a leftist (broadly speaking) male counter part who can give the same young men the kind of space those other brainwashing fuck heads give, and to help actually try and fix the inherent issues. And to end, yes, turns out men are fucking human, and do not like being told that they should fucking kill themselves because they are white men. They have their feelings routinely hurt by the nasty looks they get and the automatic titles given to them from accidental or unintended things that occur. They are then told to man up, bottle up and that they should not have those feelings because they are men. Unless you're gay then congrats you're allowed to have feelings. If your bi go kill yourself still. There's a very good reason that \\"In 2022,?men died by suicide 3.85 times more than women.

Those are great qualities and certainly important for men, but they're not masculinity.When a boy seeks a masculine role model, the only ones who exist who promote traditional masculinity (assertiveness, leadership, discipline, etc.) are the Andrew Tates. Any traits, masculine or feminine, can be part of any man or woman. Any of those traits are damaging at the extremes. The masculine extremes (toxic) tend to be more outwardly focused, whereas the feminine extremes (being overly humble to the point of becoming a doormat, for instance) are more damaging to the individual, so they get less attention as a problem for society. Since any traits can be present in any human, the typical response is, \\"Why do we have to make some 'masculine' and some 'feminine' then?\\" Which I generally would agree with, except for the fact that we've deliberately moved AWAY from trying to dissolve gender as a defining characteristic over the last decade or so. That used to be the goal, but now gender has become more important than ever, so it feels disingenuous to claim it's an important defining characteristic of a person on the one hand and irrelevant on the other hand. I'm not saying we've moved in a bad direction. Maybe dissolving gender is impossible. I just think we need to accept that different approaches create different challenges to address, and this is one of the challenges our modern gender focus creates.Many boys are attracted to the idea of a disciplined, assertive leader model for men. We need to promote positive examples of that and celebrate it so that we have a masculine counterpoint to Andrew Tate.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"That would hurt the creator of said video, i think it's fair even though you pay youtube premium if you don't like ads built in from the creator you should just avoid said content.

Why do these tough conversations, which should make you uncomfortable to an extent, have to be lessened for you to participate?A lot of conversations around privilege may lack nuance. Im a white woman, who grew up very poor with disabled parents. I can acknowledge certain things may have affected my life negatively, but I can also acknowledge as a white person, race is not going to really be a factor there. It doesnt lessen any other struggle Ive been through. Ive had conversations with my POC friends, where theyve talked about feeling unsafe, having to go against their religious choices, just to avoid harassment. That makes me, as a white person uncomfortable, and it should. When people say youre privileged because youre a man, they are saying you wont face the same barriers as a woman. Take the abortion debate for example. That is something that will never affect a man. A man will never die because he cant access the correct medical care. Thats privilege. It doesnt lessen the fact you grew up poor. The right dont welcome young men. They perpetuate the ideals that hold the patriarchy up. The high rate of male suicide? Just man up. You must achieve x y z goals to be considered a real man, you have to find a wife who matches these very specific archetypes. Whenever I see men come out with stories of abuse, take the recent P Diddy / Meek Mill / Usher / Justin Bieber situation, its men mocking these victims.

And yet the support to get people into higher education has been focused on women all the time. Who's being coddled here?All initiatives to achieve gender balance in education should base themselves on *actual* gender balance in education, rather than a fixed worldview where one gender is forever a victim, an the other an agressor.It sucks that men are dealing with the realization that women have the educational &amp; financial opportunities to not need a man. We no longer have to get married right out of high school, we no longer have to get baby trapped into bad relationships, we no longer have to silently stay with abusers. This means that for the 1st time in history, men have to actually bring something to the table &amp; theyre incapable of doing soThat's hate speech. While the role patterns in traditional relationships were very restrictive for everyone, it very much meant that men did need to bring the entire income to support a family to the table, mostly likely in a way that was actively harming their health. And then wage their lives again when war broke out. And if they weren't able to, they couldn't get married. In fact, during history, most men died childless, while trying to amass the savings to get the chance to get married in some kind of highly risky job.

And then the left wonders why men aren't interested in the left? really? The left is also filled with hypocrites when it comes to white feminism. Yet, when left leaning men, especially men of color call this out, they are immediately shut out. Oh you dared to call out Taylor Swift for being a white feminist?

What we are saying is that all things being equal, being a white man gets you more opportunities and \\"rights\\".For example, there have been several studies that show that you can take two resumes that look identical but give one a white sounding name and one a black sounding name and the white name will get more callbacks. This is an example of privilege. A white man walks into a store with a gun and at worst, someone may roll their eyes, call him an idiot, ask him to leave. Black person enters a store with a gun and it is \\"he's got a gun! Shoot him!\\"Both people were engaging in their so called second amendment rights in an open carry state.

If a boy were exposed to (b) first *before* they might be able to relate to/empathise much with (b), would they be less willing accept (b)'s ideas in that initial moment and therefore less likely to return to those ideas even if exposed to (a) some time later??\\nIn my opinion, it'd be effectively impossible to *not* have folks in (a) and (b) exist, i.e., people who can't help but express very extreme and one-sided rhetoric (in part because of natural tendencies toward human tribalism, in part because of folks who stand to gain by stoking division).?\\nWhether socially left or right leaning, I think it's the responsibility of the more moderate of either 'side' of the spectrum to be more loud in expressing that nuance exists; spreading moderate and tactful sentiments may go a long way in protecting individuals from *only* feeling safe on an extreme 'side' of the spectrum.?By which I mean, a subset of those extremely left (to the point of hostility against those 'non-left') may only harbour extreme views due to feeling threatened by views of those further to the right, and inversely a subset of the extreme right may only have reached certain views due to feeling estranged or uncomfortable by those further to the left.?\\nTL;DR - I don't think it's just the socially left's responsibility to change per se to ensure someone isn't pushed right - but rather the responsibility of all those who are moderate (whether socially left, right, centric or mixed) to help prevent against people *only* feeling safe or accepted in either extreme.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Literally saw a poll today with a fucking 9 point margin of error.?Completely meaningless at that point.

But I don't think your political opinion should be that tied into your personal romantic success. You shouldn't follow a political philosophy because you are angry about not being laid but because the arguments make sense to you. Dealing with those issues shouldn't  relate to your personal romantic life. Even the suggestions in this thread that they need to redirect their hatred of women into a hatred of the rich is not healthy or something I'd recommend. Congrats you hate rich people now instead but you're still an angry virgin...The four names you hold up Andrew Tate and his derivitives don't imo meaningfully engage in politics. They are certainly right wing but they are focused on manosphere content rather than political content. Compare that to Ben Shapiro who actually has an understanding of policy and political philosophy but doesn't really engage himself as an alpha male example for young men.

She can call herself whatever the hell she wants but if she is judging you based on your gender (or whatever else) then this is classic right wing behaviour. In this instance, she is also displaying incel ideology which is concerning for a teacher.As for your issue in terms of the alt-right, this is because these communities and some of the people you mention offer men (and women - there are many alt right communities for women, including some sub-reddits) an empowering \\"club\\" of similarly minded men and all the talk is about how to become a better person, etc.The issue is many of these people are borderline insane - look at Andrew Tate as a prime example. He, and his rhetoric, is so incredibly bizarre that I'm still convinced he's some kind of Sacha Baron-Cohen type character.On the flip-side, people like Jordan Peterson talk perfect sense (or did until he had a breakdown and went all quasi-religious) but their fanbase twist everything they say and become extremely toxic. Peterson's book \\"12 Rules For Life\\" might as well have been called \\"How Not To Be An Incel\\" but plenty of men and women who read it, and I suspect didn't read it properly, completely flipped the meaning behind it and did the exact opposite of what Peterson was saying - blaming society/everyone else instead of themselves.Frankly we need strong left-wing figures that teach young men and women that you can be a strong valuable person by being part of society and helping others, espousing left-wing ideals for a greater good. Socialism is impossible to enact at government level at the moment (and it is insane it was tried in pre-industrialised countries in the 20th century, doomed to fail) but it can be enacted at a personal and community level.If we had an Andrew Tate type figure (who could speak normally and not stutter everything out in a monotone robotic voice at 100mph) who said \\"be a good strong person, look after yourself, be someone people can look up to, and be good to other people, volunteer your time, listen to people's problems, share their problems to empower them to be better, make time to understand things from the perspective of people of different races, genders, sexualities, ages, etc etc\\" then we'd probably be onto a winner.Unfortunately no such person exists because the left has been overtaken by the type of liberals I initially described.We possibly came close in the UK with Jeremy Corbyn, unfortunately the man is utterly useless when it comes to any kind of mainstream media interview and pulls his punches like a madman, so he's no bloody use in a world that gets so much information from mainstream and social media.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"This would matte if Trump were doing any hard hitting interviews.

OP is also right, the much more affluent girls in his class probably had *class privilege*. Both probably had privilege related to race, being able bodied, being citizens, and speaking the language of instruction as a first language. Neither of these individual is \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than the other, they simply exist at different intersections of privilege and oppression (like we all do). Somehow, the left does a really poor job of explaining this concept (even though we reference it constantly).Edit to add: One thing OP's teacher could have done, if she wanted to introduce the idea of male privilege, is to first introduce the ideas of intersectionality/privilege/oppression more broadly before getting into the specifics of male privilege. She would also be smart to point out that, even though she is a woman, she likely has some other privileges related to education, possibly race, being able-bodied, citizenship, language, etc. and then say, if you're interested in class privileges or race privilege, these are some materials you can read on your own, but today we're addressing male privilege.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Republicans have been telling their voters to vote early this year when in the past they told them only to vote on Election Day.

SO when a lot of people are complaining about not getting laid, I would suggest they are really complaining about a lack of emotional connection, a desire for a relationship, etc... Further I think, as do agree with many of OP's points, that young men are not being given healthy outlet for their sexuality. Like, and this isn't me complaining (I am married and have kits FWIW) woman or gay men are allowed to kind of celebrate their sexuality, where it's often treated as \\"dirty\\", or objectifying fo young men to express being attracted to women...That said, I mean we need *healthy* way for men to express that, that isn't objectifying, and doesn't reduce a woman's value to her appearance, and teaching about consent and being respectful.

You are more likely to come across blue-haired liberals in academic settings and in that setting they are far more likely to be vocal and either sharing their beliefs of targeting you with them. I would argue thats a very small percentage of the population with a limited reach that likes to use academia for their soapbox. Treating a child like that is highly inappropriate, but there are jerks everywhere in life. On the conservative side it also seems to be a small group with a big microphone, but better funded and with a far better scheme for luring young men and keeping them in the echo chamber. The most important aspect for both is that you drink all the koolaid and dont think too much or ask too many questions. A lot of what they do are classic propaganda techniques. The right wing side seems to have perfected the online side of this to reach the largest possible audience. You seem to think that nothing can be done about this. I grew up in a time before the internet, but well after these propaganda techniques were invented and regulated into irrelevance.  When the internet came along most governments were persuaded that regulation of any kind would kill the internet before it began and shortly after you saw most social media taking advantage by allowing the controversial propaganda to drive engagement on their platforms. News papers and magazines were once allowed to do the same. Mein Kampf was and is a very dangerous piece of propaganda that is still banned in many parts of the world because it had a very similar radicalizing effect on young men that led to the biggest war in history. To be clear it wasnt only Mein Kampf. They used all mass media, radio, television, you name it. After the war many common Germans had no idea about basic facts, they didnt know they were losing or had lost until the allies told them. They didnt know anything about what was done to the Jews at the concentration camps. They didnt know that most of the information they had was a series of lies. After all that free speech was re-evaluated in the context of preventing lies, propaganda, and building these propaganda networks. Strong editorial boards and laws to allow suing or prosecution for these types of offenses became common in the western world. Those still apply, se the Dominion lawsuit against Fox News as one example, but none of that applies to the internet and the corporations that allow propaganda, which is where most of the young people are getting exposed to propaganda and becoming radicalized. There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way we allow information to be filtered and posted on the internet. Right now its a popularity contest fueled by controversy and shielded by law. In my opinion these companies generating billions in revenue can provide at least some editorial oversight, especially on posts designed to rack up views and radicalize people, or make it possible to sue them in some circumstances. At the very least its time to rethink blanket immunity from consequences for posting propaganda on social media.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Him calling her \\"comrade Kamala\\" is just one example.","title":"Is the left putting a larger target on Donald Trumps back with Nazi, Adolf Hitler smears?"},{"text":"RemindMe! 14 days","title":"Why does the Turkish government have a press release on its website condemning a terror attack that hasnt happened yet ?"},{"text":"Throw the book at him.No place to this, ever","title":"Arizona man charged over three shootings on Democratic office"},{"text":"It won't be global then.","title":"Russian Maintainers Dropped By the Linux Kernel to comply with Biden Executive Order Sanctions"},{"text":"Control over the majority by making it seem that they are under attack by those at the bottom of the social hierarchy.Highlighting and dehumanising those at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

However, because of how the underlying algorithms work, it quickly becomes an all encompassing echo chamber of the most extreme views on the subject. Further, changing the stuff you see in your feed is very difficult. When my feed starts doing this, I start doing a week or so deep diving on puppies and flowers or jumping off social media for a bit to clear my head.Second, the real issue is how young men are influenced in the offline world. What are the messages they are receiving from their parents and others in positions of authority. What role models are they being encouraged to follow? What is their exposure to other young people who are being raised by people with similar values and beliefs?For sure there are horrible teachers, coaches, parents, etc. out there who are willing and capable of deeply hurting others. However, there are plenty more who are capable of talking about the systemic discrimination women still face and how society can change that without making men feel like they are the cause of all evil out there.As a white woman, I have come to understand that there are many white women, especially on the far left, who have this savior complex and believe that to be a true ally to those in society who have been marginalized in some way, whether that be because of the race, sex, ethnicity, etc., it is necessary to continuously shout out the injustices  and point fingers at the perpetrators of societys ills. These are the people who feed the echo chamber, just like the Tates feed the echo chambers on the right.Most of us understand that for thousands of years, men have set up societal structures and ways of belief to benefit them BUT that they way to change these unwritten rules is not by blaming todays men for the sins of the past but by raising boys and helping men to understand the underlying impediments to equality and engaging them in identifying and implementing solutions. We all have unconscious biases against others that we learned very young in life from the people around us and the types of things we interacted with like television shows, our toys, the books we were read, the things we were encouraged to do or not do, the people we were encouraged to play with, etc.The trick is to question these biases by getting to know these others and then actively overriding them on our brain. Eliminating systemic inequities involves understanding our own prejudices and then when you are out and about and see or hear someone engaging in a prejudiced way, question their behavior and model a better one. Studies have shown that left leaning people are more open to change and more willing to question the status quo. Right leaning people are more fearful of change and are more defensive of the way things are or want things to return to a mythical time.In my experience there is a 10-80-10 rule always in play. Whatever the issue there are always 10% of the people at each extreme of an issue. In the online world these are the people who drive the echo chamber. In the real world these are the people the media focuses on.But, it is the 80% who have the ability to make real change. You reach these people not with blame and accusations but with respectful questions and challenges and actively modeling your beliefs with your actions.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"I need to know as well.

Related, large Leftist movements actually speaking out loudly against women who explicitly minimise men's issues or men who try to talk about them would also go a long way. It's obviously far from all women who do this, but you see it online every now and then (was a video of some british morning show I think where this happened a while back, literally the \\"what about women\\" twist on the otherwise \\"what about men\\" behaviour). Just seeing that large online feminist groups really disagree with that behaviour consistently would also likely be helpful.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"I can maybe see one or two of each general kind if you're a recreational shooter, checking out different brands, but hundreds?","title":"FBI finds hundreds of weapons at home of suspect in Arizona Democratic Party office shooting"},{"text":"Please make a post about this!

They have (as a group) little understanding of how they ended up in their current position in a way that is concrete and not scapegoating. In contrast, when young women articulate their grievances, they are genuinely identifiable (abortion, disparities in pay, barriers to enter certain fields) that are both sociocultural discussions AND addressable by policy. Women have written tons of literature discussing individual topics that have held women back by centuries. There isn't as much coverage and knowledge on male social development since the 1960s. Men are essentially going off the same playbook as the last hundred years - \\"become breadwinner\\" and \\"have wife that takes care of the home\\", with the latest update being \\"have a wife that takes care of the home (sure she can work but ideally family would be her first priority)\\".","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Yup.

I think we can discuss how the online left doesn't reach out to men enough or in ways they need. This can vary by group and issue. However, we also need to discuss how online content is served up to teens and young men. We also need to be honest about what most of these teens and young men care about, which is sex/dating. And often basic advice is scoffed at. These teens/men isolate themselves in echo chambers that tell them no matter how much they improve themselves some woman is going to reject them or hurt them. Then they pull up child support stats or false rape accusations or tons of different things that just create more fear and resentment rather than help these men build stability, emotional introspection, and true confidence. Let's back up a bit though, I want to start with your HS experience. Your primary antagonism came from a teacher right? You mention 2016. It begins farther back. Let's go back to when reddit was starting to gain more popularity in the late 2000s/early 2010s. The Red Pill was a lot bigger on here. People like Tucker Max were still relevant and we had the same issues. I was 18 and fascinated by Red Pill culture in 2010 because I couldn't understand why these dudes were so mad. Keep in mind, I was a person ripe for falling into right wing content and that type of thinking. I often ask myself why I veered left instead? And I think part of it is actually how we're served content. In 2016 or today, right wing content is attached to almost every hobby teens and young men can pick up. It's hard to avoid it. It preys on insecurities and issues teens and young men face. The other part of it is that despite my anger towards the world and lack of self-confidence, I saw such bitterness and I thought it was a horrible way to live. I thought to myself, I can improve my standing in my life and need to work on myself. Blaming the world for my perception of myself wouldn't fix anything. Ultimately a lot of these young men need a positive role model and from a young age end up seeing streamers who look cool, but are pretty lame. I do question how much they're actually reaching to these teens and young men to help them. Almost always there is a product or idea they're selling for their own personal benefit. I also am curious to how the online left can reach out to these men in your opinion? The alt-right online offers a punching bag, a counter culture feeling, and a power fantasy. I think the online left can do more, but what specifically? We often discuss some societal trends, but the root issue tends to be sex/dating and resentment from that.In general, it's very hard to teach young people to think outside of themselves. This is why dating is so shallow at 18 and people think being 25 or 30 is like being a senior citizen. It's hard for young people who are mad to practice empathy and compassion for themselves and others. Especially when their hobbies are filled with people pushing negative thinking. A lot of this sub for example argues right wing stuff and complains about getting laid. I am not sure what anyone can do besides tell these young men to work on themselves as well as provide empathy for them. Empathy can only extend so far. Day after day of the same talking points is not going to met with compassion the same way the same question on a tech subreddit will get met with annoyance. Keep in mind that people who are opposing any belief someone has can be attributed to the opposing side even if they aren't. My point being is that part of the problem is when young men come into contact with other people who don't share their beliefs they end up looking for an argument. You can see people who post on this sub also post the opinion to other places first. The other aspect of this is that will the teens and young men wanting to discuss issues impacting men actually care about what you brought up? Very rarely is it acknowledged in leftist communities that men see disproportionate rates court conviction, and more severe sentencing. Very rarely is it discussed that sexual, physical, and emotional abuse directed towards men are taken MUCH less seriously than it is against Women.Do these apply to most 15 year olds who fall into the alt-right pipeline? I'd say no. And the thing is the left can talk about these things more. These things also should not be used as they often are, to dismiss issues women face or say \\"see men have it harder!\\" Plus these convos need to bring up race for context. And young men who fall into the alt-right pipeline aren't going to want to hear that stuff. They want to hear women are hurting men. And yes women do hurt men. But if we're looking for more compassion towards everyone, this is not going to solve anything. Teens and young men who fall into the alt-right pipeline are angry. They are usually upset about things in their personal life. They don't care about men overall. They care about their standing in the world or perceived standing. And a lot of it is tied to sex and dating. Let's not brush that aside for the lines about statistics of men dying in wars or on the job. You can find countless right wing content that is popular and it's strictly around sex/dating. The whole men suffer from XYZ is used to make the other stuff about sex/dating feel legit. But these right wing influencers don't care about men. They don't advocate for policies to help men. They only bring it up against women. The pushback to feminism and the left by right wing figures online has existed since the internet message board days. It's existed before that offline too. I sympathize with young men who feel lost and are struggling, but the right wing content works because it is seeped into so much of their hobbies and focuses on their major insecurity, which is sex/dating. The rest of the stuff isn't impacting these kids and young men to the same extent. And rarely do these influencers have any sort of policy proposal or push to have Republicans enact a law to help young men unless it's something to punish minorities or women. So what do you propose the online left does? Which sounds more enticing to an angry teen; a message of compassion and empathy or a message of anger? The latter seems more compelling since it is seeped into a lot of their existing hobbies and allows them to be angry to the full extent. Empathy and compassion requires you to stop being angry at some point and reflect. To think and learn and grow. That is hard to do. People from all walks of life struggle with that.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"Nate Silver is pro Trump, so that makes sense.

Consider this situation. You're young, going through puberty, and people start telling you that you are a part of some problem with society. That it's your responsibility to fix some problem from nearly 50 years ago and across the country... But you're a teenager. You can't do anything. It's a problem that's being heaped on you and you can't solve. So when you are offered an out, something that you can point to and say \\"See! These horrible things from the past aren't my fault and I dont have to fix them!\\" You take the opportunity.This is how cults recruit new members. They look for the disaffected, the people who are burned out by society and they offer them peace and community and a place where they aren't torn down because of race or sex. Things that are out of your control.And now we are watching Andrew Tate videos online. Then as you continue learning you start having these beliefs reinforced by seeing injustices towards men. These are things like men having the cops called on them for taking their own children to the park or how men usually get shafted in divorce court. You also have issues that affect men like pregnancy and abortion that get blown out of proportion. As a specific anecdotal example of my high school graduating class of 9 people 3 of the 4 girls were pregnant or had kids for the explicit purpose of securing a husband. They got pregnant to force their boyfriends to marry them. There are also women out there who genuinely argue to kill all men of to keep men in cages. To a misogynist they will point to all of those issues and go \\"see! Look at how evil feminism is! They took equality and turned it into misandry!\\" So now when someone describes themselves as a feminist what does our hypothetical person see? Do they see someone who is looking for equality or someone who wants to denegrade them? Do they see someone with a nuanced opinion or do they see \\"kill and/or enslave all men?\\"Now, what's the escape route? How do we get someone out of these bad ideas and away from people like Andrew Tate? The thing is that you don't just tell people that Tate is evil and to not listen to him. Because then you become that evil \\"feminist\\" and they stop listening to you. Think of it like a cult. Just telling someone the evils of Scientology won't convince someone who was accepted by Scientology to see the errors of the ways and drop what they have probably spent years of their life on by that point. Instead, you need to approach it from a point of solving their initial problem. No it's not their fault specifically that society has a bias towards men in the workplace but they need to take steps to ensure that women are welcomed. No it's not their fault specifically that men SA and violate women at a higher rate but telling a random stranger that they would rather a violent predator than them is not going to bring them over to your side. Yes, men sometimes get the cops called on them but that was a wierd exception with a Karen rather than the expected norm and I've done [this] to help men feel more welcome in spending time with their kids at the park.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"No idea, person gave no actual details for their comparison.

Honestly, I sound a lot like OP growing up.  I was into Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity.  I started voting Democrat in 2004.  The Iraq War was my \\"red pill\\".  I realized that while the mainstream media has a minor liberal tilt, the right wing outlets -primarily talk radio and Fox News at the time, are full-on propaganda machines.  By 2024, you see it clearly - they are no longer just stretching the truth about Iraq, they have resorted to full-out reality denying lying.  What sucks about politics today is that extremism is rewarded.  All the things you wrote about \\"the left\\" can be said in different ways about \\"the right\\".  I would argue the extreme right is more dangerous and crazy than the extreme left, but that's for a different discussion. The bulk of people voting either way are mostly \\"in the middle\\" and care primarily about their personal pocketbook.I have lots of Republican-voting friends who are very reasonable.  They think Trump is an absolute buffoon and are embarrassed by him and the entire clown show GOP. They believe Republicans are better for the economy. I disagree, but oh well.  I have lots of Democrat-voting friends who are very reasonable.  They were dismayed over Biden staying in the race, but are quite enthusiastic about Harris.  They think abortion should be legal, they fear the crazy-talk on the right. They think Democrats are better for the economy.  The fact is we live in a country where a white male has significantly more power than any other demographic.  It is fading as we become more equal, and people impacted naturally feel resentment because they feel someone is \\"taking away from them\\".

Transition staff used Control+F, a keyboard shortcut, to search through Project 2025s 900-plus-page policy blueprint for the names of potential hires.Even a brief mention of a name in an authors note at the end of a chapter was enough to prevent that person from getting a job on the team.

In Jewish law a fetus has a legal standing of potential life, and the life of the mother is always considered first up until birth. This has been interpret d both narrowly and broadly depending on who is doing the interpreting and when, but even in communities most dedicated to following the literal word of Jewish law, many women get abortions for a variety of reasons. (Important to note that the Bible doesnt mean the same thing to Jews. Torah is not just the 5 Books of Moses but includes the entirety of oral Torah which was written down in the early rabbinic period as the Mishnah, which is the Hebrew part of what you may know as Talmud.

It's their fault that things aren't perfect yet (the people pushing equality).I'm imagining a scenario where an authority figure walks into a room with two people and it's a messy situation.  Let's say two kids fighting.  Kid #1 starts a fight (clearly and obviously).  Kid #2 defends themselves.  Both kids get hurt.  If we walk in an are adjudicating blame, it seems to me like you're wanting to say that Kid #2 failed Kid #1.  Remember, in this scenario, Kid #1 clearly and obviously started the fight.The left didn't fail young men.  Young men were failed by an oppressive system.  The patriarchy was never for them.  The patriarchy was for the wealthy elites who structured a hierarchy that pushed down on everyone beneath them... and as some of the benefits were removed from that system those who lost the most were those lower in the hierarchy (since the wealthy have managed to preserve most of their privilege regardless).In the 1980's, the left wasn't promising kids with fast cars, hot babes, and easy wealth.  This was something that was promoted by those who wanted unfettered capitalism.  The privileged lifestyle promoted by music, movies, and advertising is not something the left promised anyone.  Young men have been lied to about what they deserve... and those lies didn't come from the left.The problems you are describing are the unrealized expectations of those lies.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"The title is tricking you.

A total Internet stranger would presume to understand this interaction better than the person who went through it by virtue of.

Gaslighting young men, blaming them at ridiculously young ages by virtue of immutable characteristics, they were born with. Assigning blame as a group to all men and holding them equally in contempt. So many online spaces much like Reddit where people on the left refused to use more succinct or accurate language when they are expressing grievances C instead, they paint with broad swaps and expect men to just know who they are or are not complaining about. If you were one of the good ones you would understand - i mean, you said ALL men, how am i supposed to know what you actually meant?It all comes off as just flat out hating men in every possible way. Especially as a young man, growing up in this environment Do you think they are going to flock to the people that are telling them they are basically Hitler? They are all responsible for all of these and all of these sexual assaults that have gone on for all of human history because they are a man (they say to the 14 year old with a SpongeBob backpack). Remember, prejudice + power = racism or something idk - fuck that kid though hes the problem for sure.That they have more power and therefore somehow impossible to be racist. Like what? All of that, I mean, I could go on for a long time. Its plain as day to see why men gravitate to these strong man personalities that actually take a moment to extend the olive branch and say  hey, we understand how youve been treated and we dont think you are a problem by virtue of the way you were born - you are not guilty of the sins of men youve never even met.Problem is, that leads to more insidious ideas because the personalities doing this ultimately have a goal to achieve as well.
