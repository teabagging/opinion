Trumps efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election. It covers actions taken by Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators to overturn election results, legal charges filed, and prosecutorial decisions.The investigation found evidence of widespread attempts to interfere with election processes, involving multiple co-conspirators and false claims of election fraud. Although initial indictments were issued, the case was ultimately dismissed after Mr. Trump was re-elected in 2024, citing the Department of Justice's policy that prohibits indicting a sitting president.\\n---Key Details and Insights1. Scope of the InvestigationFocus: The investigation targeted efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, including:Pressuring state officials.Creating fraudulent elector slates.Misusing Department of Justice resources.Pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to obstruct certification.Inciting violence on January 6, 2021.\\nLegal Basis: The investigation was carried out under 28 C.F.R.  600.8, which governs the appointment and duties of special counsels.---2. Charges and IndictmentsOriginal Charges (August 1, 2023): Mr. Trump was charged with four felony offenses:1. Conspiracy to Defraud the United States (18 U.S.C.  371).\\n2. Obstruction of an Official Proceeding (18 U.S.C.  1512).\\n3. Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S.C.  241).\\n4. Other criminal violations related to election interference.Superseding Indictment: After the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump was immune from prosecution for certain actions while in office, a revised indictment was issued focusing on non-immunized conduct.Dismissal of the Case: Following Trumps re-election in 2024, the Department of Justice moved to dismiss the case due to longstanding constitutional prohibitions against indicting a sitting president.---3. Findings on Trumps ActionsDeceptive Strategies: Evidence showed Mr. Trump knowingly spread false claims about election fraud. Examples include:False Claims About Voting Machines: Allegations of vote switching were widely disproven.Baseless Fraud Allegations: Trump claimed dead or non-resident individuals cast votes, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\\nCo-Conspirators: The report identified several unnamed co-conspirators who assisted Trump:Co-Conspirator 1: A private attorney spreading false claims.Co-Conspirator 2: Developed a plan to leverage Pences role.Co-Conspirator 6: Helped create fraudulent elector slates.\\nJanuary 6, 2021: Trump encouraged his supporters to disrupt the certification of electoral votes, culminating in the Capitol riot.---4. Legal and Ethical DecisionsThe Special Counsel adhered to the Principles of Federal Prosecution, ensuring decisions were impartial and evidence-driven.The decision to prosecute was justified based on:Protection of the electoral process.Prevention of violence against government officials.Ensuring the evenhanded administration of the law.\\nThe teams work was guided by the mandate to uphold the rule of law, regardless of political consequences.---5. ChallengesSupreme Court Ruling: Limited prosecutorial scope due to immunity for some of Trumps actions.Public and Legal Scrutiny: Intense political polarization, threats to witnesses, and legal complexities related to executive privilege and presidential immunity.---Specific EvidenceFalse Fraud Claims: Evidence from Trumps own advisors and campaign officials showed he was aware of the lack of election fraud (e.g., Arizona and Georgia election audits disproving his claims).Pressure on Officials: Trump directly pressured state legislators and election officials to alter certified results (e.g., Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger).Misuse of DOJ Resources: Trump worked with a DOJ official (Co-Conspirator 4) to promote baseless fraud investigations.---ConclusionThe report underscores a systematic effort by Trump and his allies to subvert democracy and retain power through illegal means. Despite sufficient evidence to prosecute, Trumps re-election halted legal proceedings under DOJ policy. The investigation reinforces the importance of upholding the rule of law and accountability, regardless of an individuals political status.","title":"Read Jack Smiths final report on Trumps Jan. 6 case"},{"text":"What's the difference between exploiting a loophole and getting away with something because the whole system is corrupt and let's you break the rules??\\nThat's the fun part- there isn't any.?","title":"Justice Dept. sends Congress Jack Smith's report on Trump's effort to overturn 2020 election"},{"text":"Yes all the MAGAt traitors in Congress do obviously, so FUCK Merrick Garland for refusing to hold anyone in power accountable in the least little bit.

We earn enough collectively that we could afford a universal basic income for everyone. If the billionaire class just paid their fair share.The GDP per capita in 2023 was $83k.

Imagine how game changing that would be to people who are homeless, people living in poverty, people living paycheck to paycheck trying to make rent, buy groceries, and raise a family. Imagine how that would impact people working 2 or 3 part time jobs. Imagine how that would change the financial situation of households paying off credit card debt, student loans, or medical debt.

This even benefits those at the top: businesses can take on more risk because their employees can take in more risk, have a greater safety net. People earn more so they can spend more, pay for professional services instead of trying to DIY everything, travel more, invest more.We'd really be able to bootstrap this economy by guaranteeing a basic income to every adult.

These issues are, to a great extent, the fuel on which dis / misinformation feeds, or the stick to dis / misinformation's carrot - a source of instability and stress and frustration in people's lives, which in turn makes them less trusting and certain and rational and thus more open to lies and manipulation.

She was the only national democrat who had worse favorability ratings than Biden in those three weeks between his debate and when he withdrew from the race. And think of all the momentum she generated for herself just on the basis of being Bidens replacement. She was taking the place of one of the two very unpopular eldery candidates. Those very poor favorability numbers trippled almost overnight when Biden endorsed her and she became the de facto nominee before the convention. I believe she ended up with a 49% or 50% favorability rating at some point. And none of thats because she all of the sudden became this extremely popular person by herself, but because she was the new choice.As risky as an open convention would have been, if that same momentum and popularity boost was applied to a completely new face, one who was an actually talented and skilled retail politician, a person who had the kind of charisma and passion that made people like them, theres really no telling how high their possible peak could have been.

(remember, she dropped out before the Iowa caucus; democratic voters rejected her overwhelmingly when they had other options)You could say that having an open primary and giving the nomination to someone completely new to the game on the national level is risky, which it is for sure, but thats really not any worse than handing the nomination on a silver platter to someone who we know lacks the ability to win over voters on the campaign trail. And if we did have an open convention and Harris was able to beat out people like Newsom and Whitmer for the nomination, that wouldve made her a much stronger and confident looking candidate.","title":"Biden says Kamala Harris competent to run again  and could have beaten Trump despite crushing loss"},{"text":"\\"waking up\\".. this is becoming insanity!the \\"Elite\\" control absolutely everything.In their books, before the roll out of the Internet, they were talking about manufacturing evils to unite humanity and bring us into a new religion.This \\"waking up\\" is literally part of the plan to trick us into thinking the evil is gone and then trap us in a religion that unites all monotheism.. why isn't anyone reading the books ?","title":"Kinda crazy how many people think the fires are intentional"},{"text":"I think thats entirely possible I also think having a primary could have caused more dem infighting, we could have had another Bernie Hillary situation where the people whos candidate didnt win the primary just sort of drop out and dont vote or switch sidesI think just because a dem candidate would have fared better I still doubt we would have won","title":"Biden says Kamala Harris competent to run again  and could have beaten Trump despite crushing loss"},{"text":"To be fair, Harris caused those hurricanes with her hurricane machine to disrupt the election and get access to lithium mines.","title":"'Conditions' should be placed on California wildfire aid: House Speaker Mike Johnson"},{"text":"Odd but that's Lex Luthor for ya","title":"MAGA Texas governor orders states flags raised to full-staff for Trumps inauguration"},{"text":" we just need less adults reading at an under 6th grade level.And that's when they shut down the department of education.

Magically Trump's bullet ballots in that county didn't exist and cost him a flip of the county by nearly a total 180, over 10,000 votes didn't actually exist and the bullet ballots for Trump not only couldn't be counted, the physical ballots themselves didn't even exist, those numbers only existed on the tabulator machines. Must be why Elon musk and the trump lawyers were threatening to sue anyone who hand recounted in the swing states, to the ground and would literally bring \\"the retribution of justice,\\" on them if they did. I feel like we all know why, and the recount that flipped the county by proving more than 10,000 bullet ballot votes not only didn't physically exist but we're enough on their own to go over the threshold and surpass the mandatory hand recount - something that happened in every single major county in every single swing state, simultaneously. The only reason the recount even happened was a clerical error on reporting the numbers. Then the hand recount showed that over 10,000 of the votes for trump didn't even fucking exist. Every time they find election fraud, it's Republicans all the way down. They stole this election and they know it it's why Trump and Elon both were so adamant the election was being stolen when Kamala was in a lead for a bit, and Trump was panicking and tweeting that it has to be stolen, then Elon said, on a live podcast \\"I think things will turn around, I got an app like, you know on my phone, that lets me uh - uh you know see the election results, like 3 or 4 hours before they are called because starlink is on the tabulators, and I can read it on my phone, and I think we are going to see a huge, red wave come through in the swing states yeah, I think it's gonna be all of them. They will turn just watch.\\" Then in the last 2 hours over 1,000,000 bullet ballots for Trump in the 7 swing states suddenly \\"came in,\\" at the last call for voting in poll booths. In our entire nations history, all elections combined, there have only ever been 340,000 bullet ballots cast in ALL elections. Donald Trump had over 500% more bullet ballots in a single election than our entire nations collective voting history combined, and 99.98% of bullet ballots in this election were for Donald Trump.

The sub just didnt want to accept the reality that Trump was the projected winner months before the real thing.","title":"Special Counsel Report Says Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case"},{"text":" A riot is not an insurrection.Okay let's break this down real quick. it wasn't a mere \\"riot\\", these people broke into the capitol building, they stormed through the hallways, looting, defacing the building, to try to get into the Senate Chambers where the Electoral Vote was being certified in order to try to interrupt the count and stop it. They had been talking about hanging all of Congress and had been chanting \\"Hang Mike Pence\\" because he refused to reject the legitimate slate of electors and accept the alternate slates as Trump wanted. The whole thing was planned and organized by Trump and his allies. This was an attempted coup full stop. Trump directed these people to do this, he sought this out. This wasn't a protest turning into a riot because people got really angry, this was all planned out. The reason it didn't happen was because the Capitol Police Officers stopped them. This is why I do not buy that Trump 2 is just going to be like Trump 1. Beyond the fact that he's much more experienced and competent now, as are his advisers and the Project 2025 people that he \\"didn't know about\\", there's also no adults in the room like Mark Milley to hold him back too.  All anyone talks about is putting trump in jail.If we have laws on the books for treason, insurrection and abuse of power, and they do not apply to Trump, then who do they apply to? Because so far, you can try to lead a self-coup, you can knowingly steal classified government documents and store them in your home, withhold government aid to force a foreign country to help you win an election etc. and it's all legal.  He hasnt claimed to want to start any wars?So far he's talked about:\\n- How far he wants to invade Mexico\\n- Annexing Canada\\n- Annexing Greenland\\n- Annexing the Panama Canal, explicitly saying he is NOT ruling out using force to do so.  See, and you wont believe this, I voted for Kamala. I am just realistic with whats going on and dont spend my days hyperventilating and sending myself into a frenzy.Trump 1 was absolutely horrible. Trump 2 by all measures will be worse. The only hope is that he can't get what he wants. Here are the main reasons I think it will be horrible:- First and foremost, RFK Jr in charge of health policy. Reducing vaccinations and all the other weird shit he wants to go after will likely cause a disease outbreak, especially was we watch new diseases getting ready to jump to humans and cause a new pandemic. He's already gotten people killed with his activism, now he will bring it to the whole country. \\n- Many of of his other nominee's also have no business being nominated to their respective positions, namely Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth. They do not have any relevant experience and are only there because they're stooges. \\n- Trumps economic plans are ruinous. Trying to use tariffs to replace income taxes is the stupidest and most regressive form of taxation. Musk ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL admitted that altogther it will cause a recession. \\n- Trump's plan to fire career civil servants and replace them with stooges will cause a far more incompetent and inefficient bureacracy. Look, the overall point is this; Trump got away with Jan 6th, he got away with stealing Classified documents and treason, he is unhinged now, he is vindicated in his beliefs and he has no reason to hold back. All his opponents within the GOP are dwindling, and now some Democrats are starting to play ball. This was different from his first term when Democrats were steadfast against him. If you think that all of his promises are just exaggerations, then I think you're just coping.","title":"Fetterman Accepts Trumps Invitation to Meet"},{"text":"\\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\\" - Some guy (quoting some other guy)","title":"'Conditions' should be placed on California wildfire aid: House Speaker Mike Johnson"},{"text":"So what happens?

My brother and I against our cousin. And the three of us against the world.These differences will obviously point towards different parts of American history that either side will hold up as greatness.The Liberals see the equal rights amendments as America being great. When we as a society expanded the melting pot.Conservatives see the revolution as America being great, because that's when the American culture became its own through the courage of its people.Liberals see forging your own path opposed to the following the instructions of the powerful as a major virtue, so naturally, the aptly named progressive era where workers violently fought for more rights from the wealthy is America being great.Conservatives value tradition more, so the times those traditions were made and the people who made them are to be held high. Take for example how many people in the reddist part of the nation hold up the confederacy. It's obviously not the slavery part, but because they held to the traditions set up by the founders that if there's a preceved tyrant, you shoot at them. That's America being great.Liberals and conservatives are both big fans of WW2. The liberals see it as humans helping humans, with a united world pushing back the worst of humanity. America being great.Conservatives see it and the resulting cold war after as undeniable proof that our system is the best. That it stood strong, even under constant threat until those threats had been neutralized. America being great.So you see. All sides want America to be great, but in different ways based on their values. This obviously changes person by person. Few are completely in 100% agreement with their party all the time.I hope this answers the question.","title":"Why do they hate MAGA"},{"text":"Us Canadians welcome California with open arms.","title":"We're walking a dark path.

People seem more considerate, they're chatty, and we've had a positive experience of being here.I don't really pay much attention to politics (I'm not from Ireland originally, and I don't vote). I have my opinions on US politics, but no say in anything. There's not much point being that into another country's politics.I tend to avoid toxic people, and I just don't know many who are angry much or negative. I spend most of my time creating things (I'm a writer and graphic designer), doing admin for my business, watching shows and reading, and spending time with my partners and my pet rabbit. I also spend a lot of time online, but I try to avoid negativity and arguments, and focus on positive experiences. It seems to be working.I think it was Marcus Aurelius who said the soul is dyed by the colours of its thoughts? If you want to avoid negativity in your life, I think the only way is to stop dwelling on negative things and focus on the positives. Avoid toxicity and try to bring your reality in line with the kind of life you want.I tend to avoid advertisements (like TV advertisements, which is why I don't have a TV. I stream things and have a dvd and blu ray collection). Advertisements make you want things and give you a desire to compete with a certain standard of living. I make an effort to avoid them and instead focus on living life on my terms, and determining what I really want.

As I live in one of those Republican dominated western states I won't be in support of this because it will inevitably hurt me and my family as a knock in effect and so you can be dam sure I'm writing my congressman and senators and explaining this fact of life to them.Whatever vengeful spirits these Republicans think they've summoned won't do anyone any good and if they expect me and mine to pay a price for their revenge fantasy they'd better think again coz that ain't happening.","title":"Republicans see the LA wildfires as an opportunity to punish California"},{"text":"Theres a type of Dem that seems to think milquetoast and credible are synonyms and its baffling to me.

Since May, I've been applying to hundreds of jobs for half a year and hardly scored the one I have now as SWE. Mind you, it was during the start when companies started announcing mass layoffs due to outsourcing abroad.   Now, H1B visa is something employers provide for their foreign employees so they can legally come and live in the US. Once the employment ends, the visa is revoked, and the former employee has two options - leave the country for legal reasons or hastily find a new job with a new H1B visa. The latter would be rather impossible I can imagine.  Thus, it has a potential to be abused by employers who don't want to pay a living wage and, instead, hold the H1B visa employees hostage if they want to remain in the country. It has connotations of a modern-day slavery.  To the point now -  in 2016 Donald Trump claimed that \\"they [illegal immigrants] are stealing our jobs\\". It now seems that if they are legal and paid less than a US citizen would want, it suddenly is okay for them to steal our jobs. That is very likely the reason why Elon Musk is on the forefront of supporting H1B visa: to massively layoff US citizen employees and hire much cheaper H1B visa employees which in turn would give him more power over his employees.","title":"Bannon or Musk; Whos going to have President Trumps Ear?"},{"text":"Concerned?

These groups have historically expressed concerns about certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that impact their operations and profitability.Health Professionals: Senator Marshall's campaign has garnered substantial support from health professionals, with contributions totaling $618,485 between 2019 and 2024.  Many healthcare providers have raised concerns about the ACA's reimbursement rates and regulatory requirements, which they argue could affect their financial sustainability and the quality of patient care.Pharmaceutical Industry: The pharmaceutical sector has been a notable contributor to Senator Marshall's campaigns. For instance, during his tenure, he received approximately $102,000 in campaign contributions from pharmaceutical interests.  Pharmaceutical companies have often opposed certain ACA measures aimed at reducing drug prices, fearing potential impacts on their revenue streams.Insurance Industry: The insurance industry has also been active in political contributions, seeking to influence healthcare legislation. While specific figures for Senator Marshall's campaign are not detailed in the provided sources, the industry contributed more than $60 million during the 2023-24 election cycle across various campaigns.  Insurers have expressed concerns about ACA mandates and market regulations that they believe could affect their business models and profitability.It's important to note that while these industries have vested interests in healthcare legislation, including potential rollbacks of the ACA, campaign contributions do not necessarily dictate a legislator's actions. Senator Marshall's policy positions are influenced by a combination of factors, including his professional background as a physician, the interests of his constituents, and his personal and party ideologies.For a comprehensive overview of Senator Marshall's campaign contributions and the industries supporting him, resources like OpenSecrets provide detailed financial data. Understanding the complex interplay between campaign contributions and legislative actions requires careful consideration of multiple factors beyond financial support.","title":"GOP Senator Blames Americans for Most of Their Health Problems"},{"text":"They are literally the polar opposite of one another.?

I was the guy at the office following every developing detail of the Malheur Refuge takeover and the ensuing prosecutions  which the government fucked up six ways from midnight. It was really an absolute travesty how many of the Bundy clan and their followers managed to skate.A big problem here is that a lot of these laws have never been fully tested in court before, so theres no precedent to various things. The cases involve a lot of legal jousting over definitions to terms theres never been any litigation over before. And sometimes theres not even any one single law that covers what these people did, so the DOJ is having to be creative in choosing the law to prosecute over. In the Malheur case, these anti-government assholes took over a wildlife refuge and barricaded themselves in expecting a Waco or Ruby Ridge style massacre. They destroyed millions of dollars of property. They did this to protect some people who were being prosecuted for attacking federal agents in another standoff years before.But the law didnt really foresee someone doing this for that reason, and the best available law to prosecute them under was something like interference with a federal official in the execution of their duties under the theory that they were stopping all of the park rangers and researchers from doing their jobs.The problem though is that it was off season for this refuge and there wasnt anyone on duty at the time - thats why they picked this park, because they knew no one would be there!So in the end most of the successful prosecutions were for felony vandalism and shit like that. Really astounding, and a huge failure of the DOJ. Then there were a couple of things they might have gotten better convictions for, but there was an FBI informant in their ranks and the dude was just a bit too active in their planning and execution of the takeover, leading to claims of entrapment.A lot of these people should be rotting in jail somewhere and instead they walked free because of these things.","title":"Special Counsel Report Says Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case"},{"text":"People down vote you but honestly it true because dems unironically too kind.","title":"'Conditions' should be placed on California wildfire aid: House Speaker Mike Johnson"},{"text":"Actually black families were doing well and showed greater social climbing than after Johnson's destruction of black families.? ?And women were able to lay all debt at the feet of their husband and be stay at home wives and mothers.??\\n2) it means something.?

The Office was aware that courts have struck down and limited various prongs of the Anti-Riot\\nAct, see United States v. Rundo, 990 F.3d 709, 716-717 (9th Cir. 2021) (per curiam); United States v. Miselis, 972\\nF.3d 518, 535-539 (4th Cir. 2020). And as to Section 372, the Office had strong evidence that Mr. Trump and his coconspirators agreed to use deceit to defeat the government function of collecting, counting, and certifying the results\\nof the election, to obstruct the certification, and to injure the right of citizens to vote and have their votes counted.\\nFurther, as explained above, **the Office also had strong evidence that the violence that occurred on January 6 was\\nforeseeable to Mr. Trump, that he caused it, and that he and his co-conspirators leveraged it to carry out their\\nconspiracies.** But because the investigation did not develop proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspirators\\nspecifically agreed to threaten force or intimidation against federal officers, the Office did not pursue a charge under\\nSection 372. After considering the facts, the law, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office concluded\\nthat the charges ultimately pursued would fully address Mr. Trump's criminal conduct, allow the Office to present\\nthe full scope of that conduct to a jury, and avoid unnecessary litigation. As a result, the Office decided not to seek\\nany of these other potential charges.","title":"Garland hands over special counsel report on Trump and 2020 election subversion to Congress"},{"text":"Garland dragged his feet for years.

CONCLUSIONOn remand from the Supreme Court's decision in Trump, the district court set a litigation schedule whereby the parties would submit briefs regarding whether any material in the superseding indictment was subject to presidential immunity. ECF No. 233. The parties were in the middle of that process when the results of the presidential election made clear that Mr. Trump would be inaugurated as President of the United States on January 20, 2025. As described above, it has long been the Department's interpretation that the Constitution forbids the federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting President, but the election results raised for the first time the question of the lawful course when a private citizen who has already been indicted is then elected President. The Department determined that the case must be dismissed without prejudice before Mr. Trump takes office, and the Office therefore moved to dismiss the indictment on November 25, 2024. See ECF No. 281. The district court granted the motion the same day. ECF No. 283.The Department's view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not tum on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind. Indeed, but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.","title":"Special Counsel Report Says Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case"},{"text":"Interestingly these people will also believe that if their wife or daughter needs an abortion theirs is valid because they have some sort unique circumstances, but every other woman wanting an abortion is ho.","title":"Republicans Considering SNAP Benefit Cuts As Part Of Deficit Reduction Plan"},{"text":"153 billion of California budget comes from the federal government that is 33% of the state budget.

Some Republicans, including GOP leaders themselves, have threatened to abuse their power to investigate and jail those involved. Members of the January 6th investigation have also received threats of violence. And keep in mind, these are the same Republicans crying about the \\"weaponization of the justice system.\\"We all know this is yet another retaliation from the MAGA crowd that's trying desperately to discredit Trump's opponents while also attempting to absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. Once again showing us that their obedience to Donald Trump puts party over country.They have, time and time again, showcased their allegiance to the Trump brand and image, and so much so, that they not only fail to hold him responsible for his crimes and misconduct, but also try continuously to make him out to be the victim of every circumstance. Here's the simple fact, if you take Trump out of the equation, January 6th never happens, it really is that simple.For months leading up to the election, and since thereafter, Trump has promoted election denying propaganda, lies, misinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, his lies, his denial, his disruptive behavior, his excessive lawsuits, his violence inciting rants, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that day.And this is just one aspect of the January 6th investigation's findings.The investigation showed that many Trump supporters did indeed bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers in place prevented hundreds from bringing those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters weren't \\"here to hurt him,\\" and that they should \\"take the fucking mags away,\\" he continued, \\"let my people in, they can march to the capital from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.\\"The investigation also revealed Trump's inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.During this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump could have stopped the violence but chose not to.Before I continue, let's address the right wing narrative that accuses Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for what happened.Barry Loudermilk's recent report attacking the Jan 6th investigation conveniently blames Nancy Pelosi for everything that transpired.Nevermind the fact that those truly responsible are the people who incited the violence and facilitated the Capitol riot, as well as those that took action that day to clash with police and storm the Capitol.These claims that accuse Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for January 6th are not supported by the facts. Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.In fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement has continued to scapegoat Democrats and so called \\"radical leftist\\" groups, while whitewashing and downplaying the events of that day and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories.  Fox contributor Monica Crowley posted on social media last January, 3 years ago today, the System manufactured a riot at the Capitol to crush the powerful America First movement, frame President @realDonaldTrump and prevent him from winning again.Instead of holding Trump accountable, the recent report targets members of the January 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular: What caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA? What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and reinforce far right conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting some of these deranged theories. In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.Republicans also claim that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.Trump called Hutchinson a \\"total phony\\" and \\"leaker\\" because she spoke out against him. The entirety of their case against Hutchinson is based purely on Republicans simply not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following: - Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to \\"defraud the United States\\" and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.  \\n- He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results. Justice officials threatened to resign if Clark was given the position. \\n- Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.  \\n- Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.  \\n- He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.  Now, Trump and his defenders often focus on a couple of lines delivered by Trump on January 6th during his rally outside the Capitol. They claim that moments taken from this one speech absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. But this is disingenuous to say the least.Months leading up to the election, Donald Trump made a number of violence inciting speeches, posted a collection of meandering, emotional tirades to his social media accounts, and repeated over and over again false claims about a stolen election. His rhetoric was incendiary, he spread countless lies and shared a never ending stream of misinformation, he incessantly promoted election fraud propaganda and conspiracy theories, he intimidated and condemned election officials, he tried to disrupt the transfer of power, and he invited his enraged supporters to the Capitol. All of these actions and more incited his supporters to violence, mobilized organized extremist groups, and set the stage for January 6th. To think otherwise is beyond ignorant.And to have the audacity to blame anyone else for what happened, can only be contributed to MAGA insanity and fanaticism, to the blind idolization of Donald Trump, and to downright senselessness.","title":"Justice Dept. sends Congress Jack Smith's report on Trump's effort to overturn 2020 election"},{"text":"Wheres he gonna go, the makeup counter at Macy's?

They make up about 19 percent of the total workforce, we're talking about tens of millions of workers. Certainly the economic impacts are going to be felt, said David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute. Theres going to be supply chain issues. Theres going to be increases in prices, decreases in services. Experts are concerned that deporting such a large number of undocumented immigrants at once could leave a hole in the labor force. A 2023 study in the Journal of Labor Economics found that 44,000 U.S.-born workers could lose their jobs for every 500,000 immigrants removed from the labor force. Immigrants, especially unauthorized immigrants, are much more likely to work in the types of jobs that create the goods and services where were seeing the prices go up, Everyone should be concerned, and not just about the economic impacts of the MAGA \\"mass deportation plan,\\" but the logistical challenges and the impracticality of it, the resources it will ostensibly use up, and more importantly, the humanitarian crisis and human rights violations it will create, not to mention all of the legal and ethical issues that will arise.Immigrants not only contribute considerably to our economic growth, but they take on work in sectors that are crucial to the economy. And when these sectors face labor shortages, the economic consequences tend to be more severe. This means that the loss of even a small portion of this workforce will lead to outcomes like increased prices and inflation, supply chain issues, unstable wages, reduced GDP and purchasing power and volatile fluctuations in supply and demand, even things like fewer businesses and patents because believe it or not, immigrants are also more likely to start businesses. Then there are issues like unemployment and job vacancies that are likely to be more permanent than temporary considering how the people complaining most about immigrants, are either the ones exploiting a portion of the immigrant workforce for cheap labor, or they're the type of people who would never consider filling those vacancies themselves.Now, these conservatives cheering on this plan for mass deportation sometimes argue that they're only interested in \\"going after\\" the undocumented, which they usually describe as \\"illegal.\\"But while the undocumented make up a decent portion of this workforce, we all know, based on their rhetoric, their xenophobic attitudes, their constant fearmongering and stigmatizing of the immigrant community, and the fact that they've antagonized and targeted \\"legal\\" immigrants in the past, that these bigots and MAGA fanatics don't care to discern between \\"legal\\" and \\"illegal\\" migrants. Actually, they're more likely to discriminate based on skin color and ethnicity more than anything else.And keep in mind, just because Trump's mass deportation plan seems unfeasible, doesn't mean there won't be any effort to target anyone perceived as a foreigner in this country, and in ways that are morally, ethically, and legally dubious at best.","title":"Trump's plan for mass deportation could have a big effect on prices"},{"text":"Misinformation check^","title":"Will Trump Actually Deport Millions?"},{"text":"So long story short if they'd jumped earlier like people were begging we could have avoided a lot of shit","title":"Garland hands over special counsel report on Trump and 2020 election subversion to Congress"},{"text":"Absolutely insane how Biden didnt see that Netanyahu was playing with him","title":"Trump Says Very Close to Getting Israel-Hamas Hostage Deal"},{"text":"I haven't had a new hero in a long time, it's a nice feeling.

Trump. The investigations focused on his efforts to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election and his alleged unlawful retention of classified documents after leaving office.Key points from Volume One, which addresses the election case, include:1. **Election Interference**: After losing the 2020 election, Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results using false claims of election fraud. This included pressuring state officials to change vote tallies, organizing fraudulent slates of electors in states he lost, and attempting to obstruct the certification of electoral votes on January 6, 2021.2. **Fraudulent Electors Plan**: Trump and his co-conspirators developed and implemented a plan to submit false certifications of electors from seven states, misrepresenting them as legitimate. These fraudulent slates were intended to disrupt Congress's certification process.3. **Use of Federal Power**: Trump attempted to misuse the Department of Justice to legitimize his false claims and pressure state legislatures to alter election outcomes. Despite repeated rejections from DOJ officials and evidence refuting his claims, Trump persisted.4. **Violence and the Capitol Attack**: Trump directed his supporters to gather in Washington, D.C., on January 6, encouraging a \\"wild\\" protest. The report links his rhetoric and actions to the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, which sought to delay or prevent certification of the election.5. **Legal and Procedural Integrity**: The report emphasizes adherence to the rule of law and Department of Justice policies in the investigation and prosecution. Despite the politically sensitive nature of the case, the Special Counsel and his team maintained impartiality and followed established legal guidelines.The report underscores the unprecedented nature of Trump's actions and concludes that prosecution was necessary to uphold the rule of law. However, charges related to his official conduct as president were dismissed following a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, and further proceedings were halted when Trump was reelected as president in 2024. The case highlights significant threats to democratic institutions and the rule of law.","title":"Justice Dept. sends Congress Jack Smith's report on Trump's effort to overturn 2020 election"},{"text":"I suspect theres not much doubt about the evidence, rather the ability to convict given the general fuckedness of the republic","title":"Special Counsel Report Says Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case"},{"text":"While I am a Christian (specifically Lutheran), ever since Covid I've been struggling to find the time to attend church on Sundays.

The people pushing this international \\"one world government\\" idea are firmly convinced that they will be given a position of power when they take over.

They described him as \\"the most patriotic man we know.\\" Rich was drafted, and considered going to Canada because he didn't believe in the war, but he didn't qualify for an exemption as a conscientious objector because his objections were specific to that war rather than to the existence of a military. Rich was also a believer, and he believed God told him what to do to keep his beliefs and not take lives in an unjust cause.He convinced the Army at intake processing to assign him to medic training. Before deployment he was issued a rifle like everyone else... which he refused, saying he was trained as a medic so he didn't have experience with this firearm, so he really should carry another twenty pounds of medicine and bandages instead. Strictly speaking this was true, but he was also from Wyoming and had been rifle shooting since he was five. His logic seemed convincing though, and he was issued a smaller sidearm instead.In Vietnam, he always remembered to take extra medical equipment on patrol but forgot the pistol. The soldiers he was deployed with didn't mind his idiosyncrasies though; he would be awarded Bronze and Silver Stars for gallantry because he regularly risked injury and death to recover and treat wounded men in a conflict where medics were seen as priority targets.Like many veterans, he didn't talk about his experiences; his wife and close civilian friends found out because others later bragged about him. He used GI Bill money to go to school, and became a lawyer. A relatively poor lawyer though, because he felt compelled to be a public defender. He saw it as a patriotic and moral duty to protect people's constitutional rights.","title":"I'm actually surprised she's performing for Trump.

It's pretty much a political hostage situation when smaller states with barely any income continue to fuck over enormous, economically wealthy states for handouts. Same thing with the rest of England and London. Or western Germany and Berlin (which has 86% of the population and 85%+ of the income) and the five eastern states that are destitute and wanna try fascism again.It's just unfortunate. I believe in helping where helping is due. But if one side funds the other, and the other actively cheers at their suffering, that's what you'd call an abusive relationship. And you'd try to leave that. Helping smaller states in your country is a *moral* obligation, I strongly believe so, but what if the other state just does *not* want to play nice and wants to actively hurt you?

The fact these folks scream about their Christian values while taking any opportunity, even a major crisis, to create a political circus shows how deeply sadistic they are and have zero intentions of actually helping people that cannot do something for them in return.  Americans elected an unserious party of anti-Democratic science deniers, religious fanatics, culture warriors, and criminals simply because they are so easy brainwashed into being fearful idiots. Whats enraging is that we know how stupid, shortsighted, and illogically partisan American voters are now, so in the future the Republicans will never truly pay for what MAGAism has done to the US. Republicans can pull this shit without long term punishment since their voters have been brainwashed to think that hurting Democrats is the point of gaining power, they have a very influential propaganda machine, and there are always enough non-politically engaged Americans to spread fear and propaganda to. Conservative voters have shifted to a culture based on hate, fear, and revenge and this is the type of politics they will engage in forever, even once Trump is gone. Even though Democrats will still win elections and there will be shifts back to the center, they will never win by large enough margins to change the now permanently MAGA party. Conservatives, even my own friends and family, will continue to shift the Overton window, ignore facts and trends, engage in bad faith comparisons, and minimize just how out of control MAGAism is.

This bias leads individuals to favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs while disregarding evidence that contradicts those beliefs. For instance, a person might continue to believe that smoking is not harmful despite overwhelming scientific evidence indicating its dangers. They may selectively seek out information or anecdotes that support their belief, reinforcing their harmful behavior.**2. Cognitive Dissonance**Another relevant concept is?**cognitive dissonance**, which occurs when an individual experiences discomfort due to holding conflicting beliefs or engaging in behavior that contradicts their values. To alleviate this discomfort, they may rationalize or justify their actions, convincing themselves that the negative consequences are exaggerated or irrelevant. For example, someone who knows they should exercise but chooses not to might convince themselves that they are too busy or that exercise isnt necessary for health.**3. Optimism Bias**The?**optimism bias**?also plays a role in self-delusion regarding harmful behaviors. This bias leads individuals to believe they are less likely than others to experience negative outcomes from risky behaviors. A person might think, I wont get addicted, while engaging in substance use, underestimating the potential risks involved.**4. Illusory Superiority**Additionally,?**illusory superiority**, where individuals perceive themselves as better than average in various aspects (including decision-making), can contribute to self-delusion about harmful behaviors. This can lead someone to believe they can handle excessive drinking better than others without facing consequences.**5. Anchoring Bias**Finally, the?**anchoring bias**?may influence how individuals assess risks associated with certain behaviors by fixating on initial pieces of information rather than considering broader evidence. For example, if someone hears one anecdote about a long-term smoker who lived a long life, they might anchor on this story and dismiss statistical data about smoking-related health issues.In summary, these cognitive biasesconfirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, optimism bias, illusory superiority, and anchoring biasinteract and contribute significantly to self-delusion regarding harmful beliefs and behaviors.","title":"Why Trump is getting more popular"},{"text":"You're talking to a guy who can't walk and chew bubblegum at the same time.","title":"Gavin Newsom and California Democrats reach $50M deal to Trump-proof the state"},{"text":"I guess because the media has this Stockholm Syndrome thing going on now.","title":"Why Trump is getting more popular"},{"text":"It isn't even 50 bucks a week.

Israel does this every few years. Israel does not kill tens of thousands of civilians every few years. The majority which were children. The Kafr Qasim, Khan Yunis, and Rafah massacres in 1956. The Six-Day War and Ras Sedr massacre in 1967. The War of Attrition and Bahr El-Baqar elementary school bombing in 1970. The Lebanon War and Shabra and Shatila massacres in 1982. Numerous massacres during the occupation of Lebanon from 1984 to 1996. The First Intifada in 1990. The Second Intifada in 2002. Multiple mass civilian deaths from 2006-2009 in the Gaza and Lebanon wars. Bombing children again from 2012-2014 in Gaza.The current death total may in fact be more than all these combine. The targeting of children in particular is heinous. Those incidents were major international news. The US remained an ally of Israel through all of it. Numerous presidential administrations helped Israel in various ways, even as they were accused of genocide multiple times. But the average Redditor couldn't name any of these events, or name which President they happened under, because history has shown over and over again that this is all virtue signaling and nobody actually cares. It's exhausting. Literally nobody in the US is going to remember/care about this a year from now (certainly Trump will not be held to the same standard -I'll asphyxiate if I hold my breath waiting for these accounts and media outlets to start punching Trump over Israel).\\nThis is the most cynical and wrong argument I've read in a while, and even if it were true, it doesn't really matter does it, from your own perspective. Its a self-defeating view. Young people will remember what Biden did. Millennials will. I will you. You will. The videos of IDF soldiers committing atrocities will never leave the internet. When was the last time a Redditor thought about the Uyghur genocide in China? I did like a day ago when talking about the fact women's lib never made it to China in a different thread. The difference is always the US is backing the genocide in Gaza. The US is not paying for or backing the genocide in of the Uyghur people. Without looking it up, can you honestly even remember which President was in office when we first learned about the Uyghur genocide? Genocides happen all over the world, all the time, and none of it sticks in Americans' minds, so it doesn't stick to our leaders. I know when you're young it seems like this stuff is new and exceptional and that you can do something about it, but it's ancient and common and you can't.I was a government and history teacher. I have a grad degree. I've forgotten more about American atrocities than you've ever known. Your argument is incredible silly when directed at someone significantly better educated than you are about this topic and all the related topics here. I've lived through like a dozen genocides so far, and I'm only middle aged. I'd never be able to vote on issues that actually affect Americans if I always voted based on whatever crimes against humanity Israel was getting up to at the moment,I'm most assuredly older than you are. This is just your cynicism and not a good argument. Plenty of history has already been written about the actions of the Israeli government already, that is how you know about all those things you listed. None of them are what we are currently seeing Gaza, though the Nakba is close in some ways.  let alone every other country in the world. Do what good you can with your vote in the US, for the people in the US who need your help, because you're not going to change 70 years of Israel being Israel by throwing your vote away.What does my comment have to do with voting? I've probably taken more game theory classes than you have history classes. I understand voting better than you do. I understand how the American voting system works better than you do. Go lecture someone else with hilariously cynical view on the work that does in no way correspond to reality. Biden will take the blame for this.

In Trump's narcissistic brain, he's a transformative leader and wants to leave his mark on the world.  Greenland would be a fairly easy first step for him.  The U.S. already has a military base there, and the population on the whole island is less than 60K people.  He could build up the base, declare Greenland U.S. territory, and it's unlikely that a shot would ever be fired.  Sure, Europe would be outraged, but Trump doesn't care, and he'd be a hero to his MAGA minions.  It would embolden him to move on to Panama, and again, who would stop him?  Are we expecting Pete Hegseth to be the voice of reason?  Or maybe he'll go to Panama first, to demonstrate his willingness to use military power?  Who knows.

The two areas that were burned will need a lot of help. The trash that is being thrown here is unimaginable and full of Class A bs. 1st Water Management - This dumb talking point should not even be a point in this conversation. All our reservoirs are full after two rainy winters. **We have water!** Water shortage is not the problem. The fish is not even a problem related to our water. We get our water from the Eastern Sierras snow melt via the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Another source is the Colorado River and the California Aqueduct. As for the reservoir that is pointed out that is dry. The reservoir has a cap to keep contaminants out for drinking. It was ripped and thus placed out of service. The fire hydrant problem was due to the high demand placed in the lower elevations of Palisades at the same time that water was needed in the upper Palisades area. The water migrates from the lower elevation to the higher elevation to three tanks that hold about a million gallons. Because of the demand in the lower elevation, the tanks were at a deficit of water and thus could not provide water pressure to the fire hydrants via gravity. One by one each tank ran dry. Even with the reservoir eventually it too would have run dry and the same problem would have happened. 2nd Forest Management - the ignorance here is outstanding. Los Angeles has a chaparral environment in its mountains and hills. It is not pine trees that can simply be resolved with \\"controlled burns.\\" Two things here. Invasive Grasses - are aggressive, hard to eliminate, and outcompetes the native species of chaparral. These invasive grasses like the Black Mustard plant dry up quickly and are prone to be fuel for fires. This can cause multiple fires throughout the decade in the same area. This is a problem when drought conditions keep happening in Los Angeles like right now with the start of the year having the lowest amount of rainfall since the 1800s. Native Plants - Chaparral has a bad reputation especially since its cycle requires fire. Before the human establishment in Los Angeles, chaparral would burn 20-50 years. The plant if it has proper moisture from the rain can stop a fire. It is drought tolerant, often seen as the only green plant in the sea of invasive dry grasses.  The plant propagates once it matures by the same timeline and it is here when it is more fire fuel prone. If the plant is burned frequently before it matures, it will eventually die. There are hillsides that have chaparral and others which are swamped with invasive grasses especially after fires. 3rd Santa Anas - The Santa Anas that we experienced were the most severe winds I have seen besides the ones from 2011. Usually the Santa Anas we see come from the high pressure system that parks itself in Nevada. These winds bring 35-65 mph in our canyons, mountain sides, valleys, and passes. They are often dry which worsens the vegetation fire fuel. The winds from 2011 and 2025 came from a strong high pressure system in the Pacific Northwest while a low pressure system moved east from Los Angeles. These two systems escalate the wind speeds. The 2011 winds are of record breaking speeds of 100+ mph in some areas. If a fire would have happened then, it would have been catastrophic. That time it was only a windstorm which brought down power lines, trees, and tree limbs. The winds of January 2025, were severe with the winds of the Eaton Fire reaching 80-90mph. These winds were felt throughout the city not just in the locations that the Santa Anas usually target. A note, if the Sunset Fire that happened north of Hollywood the would have happened during these heavy winds it would have destroyed Hollywood and the areas around it. The reason is that the embers that come from these fires can travel far and hit structures 5-10 blocks away. All it takes is for the ember to reach trees or an attic or full rain gutter. The speed of the fire is life threatening and requires rapid evacuation. An example is what happened in Lahaina. Lastly, this can happen anywhere. It can happen anywhere that is experiencing a drought and severe heavy winds. All it takes is a down power line, lightning,  or an arsonist.","title":"Mike Johnson Vows to Hold Aid to California Hostage After Deadly Fires"},{"text":"Trump also disparately wants to keep quiet his draft record, his college grades, his weight, his affairs, his taxes, his cosmetic surgery, his golf scores, his two sets of business records, his hush money payments, his inability to use a computer, email, or type, and complete lack of knowledge of anything of substance.","title":"Trump appears desperate to keep Jack Smiths findings under wraps"},{"text":"I can't imagine a major country label signing off on \\"We Shall Be Free\\" today.

We have clearly, by now, been shown exactly why that's the case. Trump's ONLY \\"strategy\\" is to delay things or push things out as long as possible, suffer the arrows that wind up making their way through, but then getting back out on the other side of things with **more** *opportunities* even if he's at a net-negative of meaningful gains.

So, Trump saw the end goal of getting elected again as a way to smooth over his obvious crimes. It worked.The justice department and the nation's law enforcement at large cannot *afford to \\"go slow\\" on a timed issue such as this wherein a given goal could in fact halt real results that need to occur after such blatant crimes against the literal position of the Presidency itself.*Cannon never saw any personal legal liability with her (intentional) complete fuck up of a real case and as such she, too, decided to do anything she could to just delay, delay, delay.

That's more motivation to actually invade Taiwan. Finally, China does a ton of military exercises in the SCS and commits constant territorial incursions (at least into Taiwan's EEZ). The idea is to make that such a common thing occurrence that when they actually invade it won't seem any different at first to an exercise.
