The U.S. power elite in this scenario clings more and more to the Monroist philosophy and, faced with a state of imperial oversizing that prevents it from maintaining control in much more distant geographical areasCas has occurred in Africa and the Middle EastC, it is logical that its attention should be focused on the area that for 200 years it has considered its vital space of reproduction and hegemonic expansion: Latin America and the Caribbean. From the imperial logic, what is at stake is to recover the lost ground at any cost in the face of the advance of China, Russia and the progressive and leftist governments themselves. Latin America and the Caribbean continue to be the top priority in U.S. foreign policy. The head of the U.S. Southern Command, Laura Richardson, recently reaffirmed this when, in a conversation with the Atlantic Council think tank, she said:If I talk about my number two adversary in the region, Russia, I mean, I have, of course, the relations between the countries of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua with Russia. But why is this region important? With all its rich resources and rare earth elements, you have the lithium triangle, which today is necessary for technology. 60% of the worlds lithium is in the lithium triangle: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, you have the largest oil reserves, light sweet crude discovered off Guyana more than a year ago. You have the resources of Venezuela as well, with oil, copper, gold. We have the lungs of the world, the Amazon. We also have 31% of the worlds fresh water in this region.

Not a good person or good leader or anything, but he's very successful as a candidate. It's not as if downballot Dems were really offering much different from Kamala. It's just that they weren't against Trump.That all said, I think the problem was less the candidate and more the lack of a sustained, emotionally salient vision party wide. There were policies in mind, wonky bits and pieces here and there, but there wasnt a clearly articulated future. It was about preserving what we had and fear-mongering about Project 2025 and the state of democracy. Trumps campaign offered a clear (but vindictive) vision of the future, whereas the Kamala campaign didnt. Beyond that, my challenge to your view is less that a Democratic loss was inevitable due to the candidate, but because the party itself lacks messaging cohesion and morale. It can raise a ton of money, thats a strength (ostensibly), but it cant build a sustained campaign out of it (think funding year-round podcasters, content creators, &amp;c.)  and campaigning isnt a sprint, its a marathon.So this goes beyond the scope of this CMV, but I'll address what you're saying here. It's clear that the Democrats tried to make the Biden presidency and the 2024 election about a return to general normalcy, and a decrease in destructive partisanship. They followed a \\"big tent\\" strategy, courting \\"sensible Republicans,\\" and part of that strategy required doing little to rock the boat. This strategy didn't work at all. 96% of Republicans voted Trump, same as 2020, and 3 points higher than 2016. So it's clear that this strategy doesn't really pay electoral dividends in the way they hoped. My concern is that any real cohesive message about a Democratic future will inevitably push some people out of the big tent. There are plenty of moderate Dems out there that might be dissuaded from voting blue if the Dems go too progressive. If they go in a more populist direction (for example, by focusing on deporting illegal immigrants) then they'll lose some on the left side of the tent, similar to how they lost some of those voters due to the position on Gaza.Ultimately, I think you're right that they need some stronger message. But unlike Republicans, who tend to \\"fall in line,\\" left-leaning voters are finicky. The message about the future must be very well tailored.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Dont forget the billionaire family and son of the president.

There were few catastrophes. He wasn't moving from daily controversy to daily controversy. In short - things just hummed along in the boring kind of way that's reminiscent of Obama's term. That leads to the lovely buzzword: voter complacency. I remember after Trump won in 2016, the looks on a couple coworkers faces who had previously been talking about \\"Ehh whatever, they're all the same. I'm not gonna vote.\\" Suddenly, whoopsie - turns out they aren't all the same. And they kind wish they had voted. People turned up in force in 2020 to vote because there was no feeling of \\"everything is fine.\\" Suddenly complacency actually felt like the wrong choice. No, it's not gonna be fine. It's not fine. And millions more people voted. But after 4 years of boring Biden? People forgot the chaos. Everything's gonna be fine. Trump lost last time, there's no way he'd win this time, right? Other people have got this taken care of, right?Anybody who turned up in 2020 to vote Trump out of office who DIDN'T also show up to vote against him again in 2024 nullified their own vote.

The Chinese leader will continue to pressure Musk in an attempt to win concessions from Trump on issues such as tariffs and Taiwan (just two examples). Musk will fail to influence Trump on these matters as it was central to Trump's platform that, if elected, he would be \\"tough on China\\" in regard to tariffs and imperialistic aggression. Recall in Trump's first administration he did impose tariffs on China and funded defense to counter the perceived CCP military buildup.When Musk fails to win the concessions, Beijing expects Musk to win from the incoming administration, Musk will be out of favor with both the Chinese communists and the incoming Trump administration. In relation to China, Musk will be revealed as having acted with a conflict of interest and to have placed his business interests over the interests of the U.S.Is one to believe that Beijing is going to carry water for Musk in an environment where the U.S. is engaged in policy Beijing perceives as hostile? Musk bet on extensive manufacturing in China and that makes Tesla economically vulnerable. Musk's China business interests make him subject to Chinese influence and perhaps blackmail. Musk is a pawn for Xi Jinping the leader of the second largest economy. Xi will crush Musk's Tesla the moment Musk ceases to be a good and obedient ambassador for Beijing.","title":"Trump: Musk Will Put US Before His Companies"},{"text":"I think Gavin Newsom could have beaten him.

There were policies in mind, wonky bits and pieces here and there, but there wasnt a clearly articulated _future_. It was about preserving what we had and fear-mongering about Project 2025 and the state of democracy. Trumps campaign offered a clear (but vindictive) vision of the future, whereas the Kamala campaign didnt.Beyond that, my challenge to your view is less that a Democratic loss was inevitable due to the candidate, but because the party itself lacks messaging cohesion and morale. It can raise a ton of money, thats a strength (ostensibly), but it cant build a sustained campaign out of it (think funding year-round podcasters, content creators, &amp;c.)  and campaigning isnt a sprint, its a marathon.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Smoke em while ya got em.","title":"As Trump escalates war on facts, scientists warn we are going to get screwed"},{"text":"didn't he try to start a war with Iran on his way out the door last time?","title":"Joe Biden under pressure to take away Donald Trump's nuclear war power"},{"text":"So death penalty for rapists/sexual offenders/child molesters too, right?

While primaries are often the best way to pick the best candidate, they often result in beating up the eventual winner before the race. Hilary and Biden, for example, came out of their primaries with far more baggage than they entered the primary with. Imagine if Dems recognized early on that Biden should be a one term president due to his age, and decided to run a primary. Bernie, Kamala, and let's say Newsom run. Kamala and Newsom would attack Bernie for being old (the reason Biden dropped out), Sanders and Newsom would attack Kamala for inflation under \\"her\\" administration, and Bernie and Kamala would attack Newsom for his smug fucking face. No matter who won, they'd all come out of the race a bit weaker.I'm not supportive of the way Dems decided not to run a primary. Biden and those around him should have been more forthright about how his age was affecting him, and he should have been willing to step down and allowed a primary to pick his successor. But even though I think what occurred was ultimately undemocratic, I think it was probably the best course of action for beating Trump, even though it didn't succeed..","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"That's literally his plan.

It was going through a transition period of relative instability and ceding territory would create a dangerously unstable image among the citizenry of what the country is and who belongs to it in terms of borders or cultural identity.The war has strengthened the national image of Ukraine both internally and internationally as well as given a politically expedient method to root out some corruption in government and the military. While the war has done enormous damage to Ukraine economically and in terms of human lives it has made positive impacts on less tangible fronts.That said, a peace deal is the only option as at the current rate Russia will win eventually however any peace deal that doesn't contain security guarantees for Ukraine from the West is in effect pushing for an eventual win for Russia. Without a security guarantee Russia will almost certainly invade again once they have built up enough stockpiles and will have the knowledge and experience of the first attempt. A Russian victory over Ukraine would be hugely destabilizing in Europe and the world more generally, especially in a climate of increasing US isolationism. Military conquest would be well and truly back on the menu.Thus we're stuck between a rock and a hard place as Russia would never agree to any peace deal that gives Western security guarantees for Ukraine (nor would the West generally be willing to extend those guarantees) and Ukraine would likely fall in a future invasion that is extremely likely based on Russia's current actions but Ukraine is also slowly loosing. The only real solution I see to this (that is fully beneficial to Western interests) is a risky gamble on heavily increasing support for Ukraine to push Russia out entirely but the risks of nuclear escalation are tremendous and I also don't see the political will to do such a thing in any Western country right now. All other solutions are compromises that plant seeds of major future problems.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

The West must understand that, to Russia, Ukraine can never be just a foreign country. Russian history began in what was called Kievan-Rus. The Russian religion spread from there.

I talked my fiance at the time into joining me which I wholeheartedly regret. Three months later, he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism that had a 30% chance of killing him. Doctors thought he had contracted covid but he was negative with positive antibodies (assuming they came from the vaccine). We tried to report the incident to Pfizer but after leaving three unreturned voice messages to the head person running the study, we gave up. We ended up contracting COVID a month later so that ruled out that possibility. We were told the dose we received was the same dose that was given to the public later in 2021.

Everyone does. What matters isn't whether you agree with Nazis, it's which parts of their ideology that you agree with. I don't see the problem with that part really.You know what else Nazis did a lot? They breathed oxygen.

I never said they only hated Jews by the way, only that they hated Jews which is of course true. That doesn't exclude others from being hated.The whole thing is Totalitarian.

And I was taking a pay cut from the handouts, but I saw this as a good reason to stay out of work (a gap of unemployment using covid as the excuse), and didn't work the rest of the year.  So I was paying attention to all the bullshit since I had no job.  Well Dems was always trying to get more handouts, which anyone with a brain could see injecting trillions would cause inflation.  I was always against every single hand out.  Every handout the Dems wanted to give more trillions than what was actually given.  Dems even wanted a 4th handout.  The more money you dilute the money supply with, the worse inflation gets.  Dems knew what they were doing here.Then they were also wanting to keep the economy shut down the whole time.  The Michigan governor whitmer, or whatever her name is, keep calling for keeping the economy/business shut down.  But as soon as Biden won the election, she did a 180 and was saying we must open back up.  Wonder what made her change her mind.  She wasn't the only Dem to do this, but the main name I remembered.    This is just so fucked up.  To put your state through such fucked up covid rules and keeping business shut down only bc of it's some political game to you, is extremely evil.  The best way to destroy a top tier world power is not through direct conflict, but rather from the inside, undercover.  The politicians are most definitely sold out and they represent corporate America and not the American citizens.

Its co-founder, Josh Abbotoy, once called for an authoritarian to seize power  a protestant Franco, as he put it  in order to reestablish order in America.Last week, we learned the magazine had been the victim of a prank. James Lindsay, a prominent right-wing pundit, had submitted the aforementioned adaptation of Marx and Engelss work and gotten it published. The essays publication, per Lindsay, is proof that the far right is basically the same as the far left: that it is, in his words, part of a woke right corrupting conservatism from within.The Manifesto prank was fairly silly, as is the woke right concept in general. But it points to something bigger and more important: a struggle over what exactly the Trumpist revolution in conservative politics is supposed to accomplish, and how philosophically ambitious its war on the American status quo ought to be.Fundamentally, this a version of the same fight the right has been having since Donald Trump entered the Republican primary back in 2015: What defines true conservatism? Yet the difference is that Lindsay, American Reformer, and almost all of the other right-wingers who eventually weighed in on this are all Trump supporters. This is less about whether Trumpism should be the reigning ideology of the right than about what Trumpism actually stands for.And the tensions between the sides here show just how unstable the Trump coalition truly is  and how divided it may become when forced to make actual choices while in power.**Anatomy of a hoax**When Lindsay revealed the hoax in a December 3 essay, he made the stakes plain: His aim was to vindicate the concept that his enemies inside the broader right-wing tent are best described as the woke right.?These enemies include, broadly speaking, a series of radical right-wing factions of a more religious or collectivist bent, such as Protestant Christian nationalists, Catholic integralists, and white nationalists. Lindsay believes that they threaten the American project in much the same way as the left  treating citizens not as individuals but as groups to be pitted against each other.Calling something woke on the right is to delegitimize it. And Lindsay wanted proof that his enemies deserved the insult.I suspected that the so-called Woke Right really is Woke; many people disagreed; and I wanted to test that hypothesis instead of arguing about it to very little effect, he writes.So he picked a prominent target  American Reformer is a well-known magazine on the Protestant far-right  and got it to publish an adapted version of what Lindsay considers the most woke text in history.I figured theres nothing more definitively Woke than the Communist Manifesto, so I think we can  get on with calling them the Woke Right after this, he writes.Of course, The Communist Manifesto was written nearly 200 years before the word woke came into wide use. And many modern Marxists are deeply opposed to the social justice left, which they see as a form of shallow identity politics that distracts from the more fundamental class struggle.But Lindsay, like many on the right, deeply believes that wokeness is a species of communism (he wrote a bestselling book titled Race Marxism). This is because he sees them as structurally similar doctrines, in that both define society by antagonisms between oppressed and oppressor groups. Lindsay terms Christian nationalism a woke right doctrine because it sees the world in a similar fashion. The only real difference, he claims, is who they treat as the oppressed and the oppressor.The edits to the Manifesto are designed to underscore this point  to show how easy it is to take a left-wing worldview focusing on group conflict and restructure it to fit the Christian nationalist narrative of a white Christian uprising and liberalism.Like much of Lindsays output, this claim is more than a little simplistic. Take his adaptation of the Manifestos famous preamble about the specter of communism haunting Europe:A rising spirit is haunting America: the spirit of a true Christian Right. Moreover, all the existing powers of the American Regime since the end of the Second World War have aligned themselves against it and its re-emergence from the shadows of American civic life, politics, and religionthe Marxist Left and its neo-Marxist Woke descendant, the liberal establishment, the neoconservatives, and their police and intelligence apparatuses.Sure, the texts are similar: Both argue that the status quo political establishment is aligned against an insurgent alternative. But any ideology that sees itself to be the enemy of the political status quo will make such claims. When you swap out enough nouns, the actual meaning of the text changes so much that its hard to say the ideas remain all that similar.**Why the hoax matters**Despite the problems with Lindsays approach, it generated a huge response among online conservatives  with prominent voices weighing in on both sides.Chris Rufo, the rights leading anti-woke activist, argued that Lindsay and his allies were expanding the word woke beyond any reasonable definition. There is nothing necessarily woke about identity, grievance, and oppression, which are universal concepts in politics. Americas founders, for example, completed their revolution using those concepts, he wrote.Seth Dillon, founder of the Babylon Bee, responded with a defense of Lindsays position.Wokeness doesnt accurately identify legitimate, real-world oppressionit points instead to intangible, unfalsifiable, elusive systemic oppression and calls for deconstruction or revolution on a false premise, he wrote. There are some clear examples of this on the right, and saying so doesnt mean were expanding the definition of wokeness so broadly that it would apply even to a justified revolution.Dillons comment is revealing because it points to the real stakes of the woke right debate. His definition of woke  basically any revolutionary movement whose aims he doesnt agree with  is less a rigorous intellectual argument than an effort at boundary policing.In the Trump era, the right is self-consciously revolutionary. It believes that the American political status quo is rotten, and that some kind of transformative political change is necessary in order to save America from a vicious, dangerous left.But there are profound disagreements over just how far the right-wing revolution should go.People like Lindsay still describe themselves as liberals in the philosophical sense, committed to limited government and individual rights. For them, the Trump movement is about defending the founders values against an overreaching left (even if the means they employ in this fight are themselves illiberal). By contrast, the woke right they oppose are all avowed opponents of philosophical liberalism. Protestant Christian nationalism, integralist Catholicism, white nationalism  all of these doctrines see Trump as the tip of a revolutionary spear.Yet merely labeling these factions illiberal carries little weight on the modern Trumpy right. Therefore, Trump-aligned liberals have to reach for a nastier term one hated by everyone on the right  to try and push their foes out of the coalition.Hence, woke right.I would expect this kind of infighting to get more intense, not less, as Trump returns to government. Governing requires policy choices, and policy choices have a way of forcing these kinds of fundamental splits to the fore. So while the American Reformer hoax may be a silly, low-stakes affair, it points to some fairly fundamental divides in the broad-tent Trump coalition  ones that will only assume more significance in the coming years.This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.","title":"A far-right publication just got tricked into publishing Communist Manifesto excerpts | A silly prank that actually says a lot about the rights internal fault lines."},{"text":"Times has never changed.

Swing voters and conservatives wont believe us and essential members of our base would abandon us.Im sure that the OP knows this, but I want any other denizens of this thread to imagine it this way. Imagine if in 2010, a year that was a smashing success for Republicans, they just co-opted Obamas platform or large parts of it and ran on that instead of what they did historically. That wouldve been a bloodbath for them because Obamas platform was meant to appeal to Democrats. Both parties have different bases and will continue to have different bases, and abandoning commitments to equality is not only morally wrong  it will be an electoral loser.We can talk about changing our messaging or some of our policies, but marginalized people around the country are counting on us. When we talk about shifting a position or emphasizing something else lets avoid putting a marginalized group on the chopping block. This applies to more than women, as we need to continue to support groups like immigrants and the LGBTQ community too.I know that we can do this and I am counting down the days until we see that house majority in 2026. Lets get to work!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 12, 2024"},{"text":"I have family that lives a stone's throw from Greenville, and they consider Trump to be too liberal but voted for him begrudgingly.Maybe they are just mad that the business is supporting someone who is too liberal?","title":"Redditor says local business is extremist and should be shunned for holding a Trump rally.

You're talking about a country that does a trillion dollars of trade with the US, and can actually turn the lights off.Trade is not charity, there is no subsidizing here and trying to act like a trade deficit is a bad thing is insane. It just means you import more than you export; which for America makes sense since you moved all your production overseas or into foreign territory.This is also a dangerous thing for the US to do, there are a lot of countries that would love to have a trade relationship with Canada like the one the US enjoys. Other countries, notably China is already offering to invest in Canadian Oil in the wake of current hostile posturing from the US.EDIT: With the new policy from China restricting the trade of strategic rare earth metals to the US, Canada is also now a primary supplier of things like Gallium. Bear in mind tariffs will only make people in the US and Canada poorer. It's not a tax in Canada, no president can levy taxes on Canadians. It's a tax paid by Americans on imported goods. It's only a good strategy to tariff if you are trying to protect a domestic supply. if you have no supply, it just makes things more expensive.","title":"Ford threatens to cut off Ontario's energy supply to U.S. if Trump follows through on tariffs"},{"text":"I love how we fought for him because we didn't want Oz in office and he just turned into another magtard AND Oz was still put into an office lmao tf is this timeline.?","title":"John Fetterman Joins Truth Social, Calls for Trump Pardon"},{"text":"A problem common amongst the wealthy.

Going from ideas to action.  And it should be clear that our larger goal - electing Democrats - goes hand in hand with lessening bias against women in politics.  We've decided to stand with marginalized people, and we shouldn't let November's results scare us away from that.  But it means we've also got to confront sexism, and defend our values more explicitly.  And when I say 'we', I'm not talking about any elected Dems (though they should as well).  I'm talking about you and me.Reading this series will give you a good overview of the barriers women face in politics, and in general, and we've also discussed some general solutions.  Now let's get specific.**Keep learning**The ideas I put forth in this series aren't revolutionary - they're 101-level feminist concepts applied to politics.  And while knowledge isn't a substitute for action, it never hurts to learn more.  You'll also be better-equipped to talk about this stuff with others.If you like reading, [Everyday Feminism](https://everydayfeminism.com/) has some great articles, and they go into more detail about related issues like racism and anti-LGBT sentiment.  There are many excellent books as well - I rather like *Everyday Sexism* by Laura Bates and *Here We Are*, edited by Kelly Jensen.  If you're more into podcasts, [Stuff Mom Never Told You](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stuff-mom-never-told-you/id304531053) has some good episodes, particularly their older ones (I don't know the new hosts as well), and the [Sixteenth Minute of Fame](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/were-talking-about-the-manosphere-the-wrong-way/id1743960803?i=10006798416890) podcast just started a series on the Manosphere, and the first episode was excellent.  I don't really do Youtubers, but I've heard good things about [Feminist Frequency](https://www.youtube.com/@feministfrequency/featured), which breaks down gender and sexism in pop culture.  If you have any other favorites, drop them below!But the best thing you can do is **listen when women talk about the shit they face.** Don't be so quick to write it off as coincidence or circumstances.  You can learn a surprising amount just by listening with an open mind.  You'll also be showing that you're a safe person to listen to.**Find like-minded people**Two reasons here.  First, you can teach each other a lot.  Second, once you see how much sexism poisons everything, you'll find the denials more aggravating than ever.  There's a reason I don't bother reading the comments on popular Reddit posts anymore.In keeping with the themes we've talked about, offline relationships are great for this, but online works well also.  If you're serious about doing something about this issue, you're going to need support.  I certainly didn't do this series alone; Mrs. Fireplace proofread every one of these posts, and your insights and awesome questions kept it going.  Just like in elections, it's never a one-person show.**Bring these ideas into your political activism**You knew this one was coming.  I'm not suggesting for a second that you give up on winning elections, because clearly we need that more than ever.But I'm sure you've seen that Democrats are scared right now.  We're getting a disappointing number of people who want to downplay or drop our commitment to equality so we don't lose.  Sometimes you have to read the tells, like when we're called on to 'ditch identity politics' or 'focus on economic issues and nothing else', while some have come right out and said we should ditch our allies.I want to win elections more than ever.  And I don't think giving up on our commitment to a fair world for everyone is the way to do that.  Instead, let's double down on inviting everyone into power and not letting the GOP strip our rights away.  We can do that and talk grocery prices.  But that fight for a better world only happens if we, the activists who get things done, demand it from the leadership.Though honestly, I don't think you'll be the only one talking about this.  The pundits have one opinion, but the mostly-female activists and volunteers in the party have pretty strong feelings of their own.  They'll probably be glad to have an ally!**Be ready when there's backlash**The anti-woman folks are feeling pretty bold right now.  They're going to say horrible shit.  When they do, make the decision whether to block, report, or call it out - whether it's online or in-person.  But don't be a bystander.  If it's someone you know, a simple \\"Hey, what do you mean by that?\\" or \\"Come on, man, that's not cool\\" can do the trick.  Especially if you're a guy.  You have a strange, mysterious power that makes guys like this take you more seriously than women.  It's a deep mystery.And Republicans are going to do the same thing, and back it up with proposed laws.  Time to dust off the old [Indivisible Guide](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide), now updated for 2024 and beyond.  Call their offices, protest, raise hell in person and online, and above all volunteer and vote so we get rid of them at the first opportunity.  The fight against Republicans and the fight for women's rights are going to be pretty closely linked for the next while.**Above all: It's not all on you**The manosphere is a big problem.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*The GOP is a big problem.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*Patriarchy is as old as society and ingrained in all of us.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*But you've got a friend who's on the fence and starting to give Joe Rogan a listen.  Or a City Council member or State Rep who supports these larger forces, and is trying to pass laws to advance them.  Or you're taking those first steps yourself out of implicit sexism.  Or you've known this stuff for a while, and need a nudge to keep sharing it against the backlash.The point is: **None of us can fix this ourselves, but we can all do something.**Way back when this sub was BlueMidterm2018, someone shared a video they made to promote voting.  I'm going to re-share it here, because it tells a story that's one of the guiding ideas for my own activism.  And, bonus, it explains what my weird title means.[Watch it here, and think about what it means for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnY9VTASNLU)We can stand up for women in politics - and win.We can reject sexism - and win.We can build a better country and world - for everyone.And none of us have to do it all.  We've got starfish we can toss, and we can clear this beach together if we work together.Now is the time to be smart, and brave.  We know progress can win - it has for so long.  But every step women took was resisted furiously.  Every win came because a lot of people had the courage to keep going, and lots of individual victories added up to legal and political ones.  And that's the lesson we have to re-learn in this moment.As Kamala Harris promised, we're not going back.  I'm committed to defeating Republicans, without throwing women to the sideline in the process.  If we all do that, we *will* win again.  And we'll create a world where \\"Madam President\\" is a reality.  And where every woman from Madam President on down enjoys more and more freedom from sexist bias.Let's dream big and make it happen, together.**Questions to consider*Note:** Tomorrow, I'm going to make a short post asking for general feedback on this series.  If you have general thoughts, please share them then, so we don't miss out on discussing the ideas from this post.  Thanks!1. I suggested a few sources that are good for learning more about feminist ideas.  What are some other sources you like - videos, books, podcasts, etc?2. Which of these action points resonated with you the most?3. Do you think being an ally to women and a Democratic activist necessarily go together?  Why or why not?4. Any other thoughts?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 12, 2024"},{"text":"wow this is neat.  i welcome that chaos!","title":"Newsmax tells staff to stop bashing Hegseth after Trump call left CEO \\"shook\\""},{"text":"Truthfully Biden should have had them arrested on charges of supporting insurrection.

The idea of him becoming president would sound even more ludicrous than for Reagan, who was at least involved in labor organizing as SAG president before entering politics. The idea of Trump running for president (with his brain in the body of a cat) was lampooned in the comic strip Bloom County as an absolutely ridiculous idea and symbolic of the decline of America.

He mismanaged COVID at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans took advantage of both opportunities to blame their opponents for the economic consequences.- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge.- The Trump admin crippled the labor movement and made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.- Trump shirked responsibility for the pandemic and encouraged his supporters to politicize everything pandemic related, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*To elaborate more on Trump's tariffs:Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency.And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression.The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations, things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved, and risks that Trump failed to take into account. Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources to manage the fallout. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesAnd yes, when all is said and done, Trump's tariffs will disproportionately affect farmers and agricultural workers, groups that, ironically, vote for him in droves.Trump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the outcomes are estimated to be costly for most Americans. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \\"national sales tax.\\"Trump is not an \\"economic genius,\\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. Trump has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:- Trump Casinos and Hotels \\n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\\n- Trump Magazine\\n- Trump Airlines\\n- Trump Beverages\\n- Trump \\"The Game\\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\\n- Trump Mortgages\\n- Trump Steaks\\n- Trump Travel Site\\n- Trumpnet\\n- Trump Tower Tampa\\n- Trump Vodka\\n- Trump Fragrances\\n- Trump Mattress\\n- Trump Network\\n- Tour de Trump\\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\\n- Truth Social (why not call it \\"Trump Social\\" at this point?)Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.He has profited off of screwing over people who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties for decades, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money from his father and from banks, avoiding paying income tax for many years, amassing unsustainable debts, then dumping them onto others.Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. By the show's premiere, Trump had squandered his riches, but the show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.Trump is not a financial guru, his admin's \\"economic achievements,\\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.The next Trump admin, which is already the richest in U.S. history, will destroy what's left of a labor movement that's been in steady decline ever since Reagan's presidency. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of union workers, when he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.And over the next four years, Trump's MAGA coalition will continue their efforts to redistribute wealth to the top.Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \\"mass deportation\\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.","title":"In another Trump trade war, farmers could lose billions in export sales"},{"text":"Even bigger news:  they will fall for it.

Youve had an up-and-down relationship with the incoming president of the United States who, among other things, has threatened to send you to prison for life. Do you (a) use your platform to warn against said president-elects authoritarian tendencies and use your considerable influence to strengthen organizations fighting to uphold democracy, (b) keep your head down and hope for the best, or (c) whip out the company checkbook and make it clear youre prepared to spend the next four years kissing ass like youve never kissed ass before? If youre Mark Zuckerberg, the answer is apparently a resounding (c).The Wall Street Journal reports that Zuckerbergs Meta has donated a cool $1 million to Donald Trumps inauguration fund, the latest effort by the tech CEO to bolster his once-fraught relationship with the incoming president. To be clear, Meta and Zuckerberg do not regularly give out political donations of this kind; according to the Journal, neither Zuckerberg nor the company donated to Trumps first inaugural fund or to Joe Bidens fund in 2021. Meanwhile, federal campaign-finance reports show Zuckerberg has supported congressional candidates in both parties over the years and has largely stayed out of presidential races.But this time around things are different. And by different, we mean that some of the richest people in the United States of America have decided that the best way to approach Trump and the threat he poses to their companies, their freedom, or both is to kiss the ring. In addition to the $1 million donation, Zuckerbergwhom Trump has threatened with prison time on at least two occasionsvisited Mar-a-Lago last month to dine with the incoming president; before the dinner, Zuckerberg, per the Journal, did a private demonstration for Trump of Metas Ray-Ban smart glasses, which he gifted to the president-elect, according to people familiar with the matter. After Trump won the election, the Meta CEO congratulated him on social media, and said he was looking forward to working together.Zuckerberg is, of course, far from the only CEO to kowtow to the former and future president. Following the election, Jeff Bezoswhose Washington Post very conspicuously chose to break with tradition and not endorse a presidential candidatepraised Trump on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory, and later said he was actually very optimistic this time around. And Elon Musk has effectively become a member of the family.Even before Trumps November win, billionaires had signaled that they would absolutely not be standing up to the guy, despite clearly believing him to be a threat. Bill Gates reportedly donated approximately $50 million to a nonprofit that supported Kamala Harriss run, attempting to do so in secret, and did not publicly endorse the VP. Similarly, The New York Times reported that Jamie Dimon, the typically outspoken CEO of JPMorgan Chase, made clear in private that he supported Harris but chose not to announce his stance publicly out of fear that if Trump won, he would retaliate against the people and companies who publicly opposed his run.","title":"Mark Zuckerbergs Meta Donates $1 Million to Trumps Inauguration After Trump Threatens Zuckerberg With Life in Prison"},{"text":"fuck how do people not see how corrupt this is","title":"You have got to be kidding me.

The money Ukraine was pouring into that civil war could have been spent to significantly improve its failing infrastructure, including roads, healthcare facilities, and energy.My take on corruption/aid is that, as long as the war is going on, the aid is indefinite and less monitored. Once the war is over, there will be stricter time limits on aid, it will dry up, and it will be more closely monitored. So, while it won't immediately go away, it will be harder to pocket a portion of it and it will come to an end / have a deadline / have requirements for continuance (whereas war support is \\"here's a bunch of money don't let the country crumble).But yeah, hopefully peace can be achieved soon so people stop dying.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

We must take action now to protect our children from this insidious influence before it's too late.This statement demonstrates how easily innocuous subjects can be weaponized through the use of emotive language, fear-mongering, and the creation of an \\"us vs. them\\" narrative.

Honestly, I think Russia realizes this and has been trying to escalate to either get a faster victory or scare the West into pushing Ukraine to the peace table. My hot take is that Putin is actually more likely to be willing to take a limited peace than Zelensky is. I personally don't think Russia ever wanted this war - they wanted sanction relief and a general weakening of NATO + a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO. Putin tried to use the build-up/potential of an invasion to pressure the West. When the West didn't cave and called Putin's bluff, he acted on it and invaded since he had already put a large number of resources on the border. I'm still pretty divided on this train of thought and need to do more reading but I think overall, Russia is tired of this war and wants out.While Ukraine is tired and in a weaker position, I think their leaders are less incentivized to reach a peace deal. Ukraine has a long history of being a corrupt country and it is currently getting billions in aid. I think Ukrainian leaders want to leave that tap running as long as possible before peacing out and having it put under scrutiny.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

The way the American political system works, all those years of experience doesnt equate to competence.Biden was always a milquetoast candidate with little to show other than not being Trump, which is mainly what got him elected in 2020. All his previous attempts to become president went nowhere for good reason.Its also important to realize there are two kinds of VPs. There are those that are pivotal to an administration and get stuff done, and those that are just a showpiece.Cheney is the most obvious example of the first kind. Like him or not, he was obviously competent enough to run the Dubya administration, and we all know he made the most important decisions during George W. Bushs 8 years. Because Dubya himself wasnt that competent (and knew he wasnt competent, unlike Biden).But thats rare. Your typical VP is someone like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris or Dan Quayle (remember him). They are added to a ticket simply to shore up a few extra points with a particular demographic, or to make particular supporters/donors happy. They arent expected to be competent at all, and in fact their job is to stay out of the spotlight except to be a cheerleader for their running mate.And America has shown its fine with that, so long as the front runner isnt so old that theres a realistic fear of the VP becoming President. Which is why this VP selection strategy backfired for McCain, because McCain was old enough to make people question whether Sarah Palin was competent enough to be President. Most of the time that question doesnt even come up, which explains there being a lot of lackluster VPs.","title":"The 2024 Person of the Year: Donald J.

The US and Western Europe were helping them deal with issues before they could officially make any alliance; specifically, they needed to deal with corruption, especially the Russian and pro Russia Ukrainian oligarchs. Russia invaded Ukraine because Ukraine was trying to have a closer relationship with the US. That's a very good reason for the US to aid Ukraine. It's good if countries want to democratize and liberalize and become allies with the US. But sure, we've also been able to cripple a major adversary on the world stage without ever putting US boots on the ground, so that's good too. And Europe is aiding Ukraine, a lot.

You cannot simply pressure politicians to adopt position X by not voting for those who dont hold X when any candidate adopting X would lose election. It's a lose lose situation. What you have to do is change the minds of enough of the electorate to make X not a losing position. Then, and only then, can you can pick between the X believers and not X believers. It's a bit ironic that one of the most important lessons from possibly the most well-known civil rights activist in history is lost on so many groups left of center, regardless of culture or race. It really makes you question how many people actually care about solving problems vs just looking like they're solving the problem for social clout. This probably goes double for convincing white progressives to stop pushing actively harmful policies (e.g. dumb education policies or dumb zoning policies). It doesn't matter if their heart is in the right place if they're incapable of separating intent from outcomes.

You need to appeal to the anger Americans feel or youll always lose to the person that does while you sit on your high horse of decorum. You can do that while still being practical and explaining - you just need to focus on what actually *gets people motivated to support you.* FDR got the entire New Deal, the most socialist set of reforms in American history, codified in law because he marketed it in a way that average people could understand and resonated with.

While it might not be universal, there seems to be a growing distaste for giving unquestionable support to and welcoming Ukrainian refugees that is touted by the right-leaning parties (at least in countries hosting large amounts of refugees). This impact will most likely be lessened with a decrease in refugees, but overall is a normal political trend (that being the more immigrants/migrants a country has, the more anti-immigrant, anti-migrant sentiments will increase over time).However, I don't live in Europe so my understanding comes from a mostly US facing media market.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

I'll break it out by country (also sorry for the lack of sources in the post - Reddit was being buggy w/ sources since my post got so long lol). Let me know if you have any other questions.**Poland**: Poland has had a lot of issues with Ukraine throughout the war, primarily coming from two points of contention - trade and migrants. They also, aside from Germany, have the most Ukrainian refugees in the EU.For trade, the Poles feel like they're getting ripped off and that they're losing out to Ukrainian trades/goods because of favorable EU policies meant to support Ukraine during the conflict. This has led to [multiple wide-spread protests](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-ukraine-alliance-frayed-anger-dorohusk-yagodyn-border-farmers/) that resonated with a lot of Poles. This is probably the best covered of the issues.Similarly, during the past Polish election (which the right ended up losing) a common talking point was the influx of Ukrainian refugees and general war-weariness from the Poles. In October 2023, [CNN reported](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/13/europe/poland-ukraine-tensions-election-cmd-intl/index.html) the Poland's support for Ukrainian refugees \\"is now eroding on two fronts. While hostility fills some public squares and airwaves through an election campaign, even among those more sympathetic, fatigue is creeping in.In October 2024, [Euractiv reported](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/polish-support-for-receiving-ukrainian-refugees-reaches-new-low/) that a Polish government survey found that only about 1/2 of Poles were in favor of taking in Ukrainian refugees. The survey noted that \\"fewer right-wing supporters were in favour of accepting refugees than left-wing supporters.\\" This article reports a bunch of other interesting points and is worth a read.**Germany**: Germany is the EU country with [the most Ukrainian refugees](https://unric.org/en/ukraine-over-6-million-refugees-spread-across-europe/#:~:text=Nearly%201.3%20million%20Ukrainian%20refugees,to%20services%20within%20the%20country.&amp;text=More%20than%201%20million%20are,with%20notable%20differences%20between%20countries). In this years elections (which the incumbent liberal government [barely won](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/europe/germany-election-results-brandenburg-scholz.html)), one of the policy areas the far-right and center right [ran on was getting tougher](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-center-right-gets-tough-on-ukrainian-refugees/a-69413179#:~:text=Germany's%20center%2Dright%20opposition%20parties,don't%20find%20a%20job) on Ukrainian refugees. Specifically, as per the aforelinked article, they wanted Ukrainians to get jobs and not be as welcomed. Similar to Ukraine, in July 2024, [Euronews reported](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/07/24/ukrainians-face-decrease-in-support-from-germany) that \\"42 percent believed Germany had done too much for Ukrainian refugees.\\" This is getting long so, having covered the two countries with the most Ukrainian refugees, I'll leave it at that. I'll add [this article](https://balkaninsight.com/2023/10/12/attacks-on-ukrainians-in-czechia-are-on-the-rise/) about the Czech Republic, which while its population still seems fairly friendly to Ukrainian refugees, does have some issues.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

Likely a result of gain of function experimentation. Many people did die from catching it. What the pandemic showed is that the people who govern us have no idea what theyre doing, and rather than express uncertainty, they pretend as if they have all of the answers and proceed to use draconian policies to try to convince the public that they arent in fake it til you make it mode. I think a large part of the botched response was that we are governed by people who really have no interest in the public good. They serve the public to advance their own careers and fill their pockets. When real things happen that require a cohesive approach that incorporates some degree of uncertainty, they have no problem overcorrecting and jerking the wheel right so that we all go flying off of the road.We are not being led by reasonable people.","title":"I'm a liberal, but one thing I have to agree with conservatives on is that covid was absolute nonsense"},{"text":"I remember when it used to be a big deal to be on the cover of Time magazine.especially man of the world.

Its certainly neither the republicans or the democrats. Maybe you arent willfully pulling the wool over your eye. My apologies.

Raising the minimum wage? Housing security for folks below the poverty line? The Clintons, Soros and Pelosi are directly responsible for increasing the militarization of our police force, thats certainly not a leftist act of policy. So please, what party am I tied to? Ill wait.While Im waiting, maybe you should consider that these people are complicit for making every working class persons life worse, just as your lovely republicans are.

Gratuities are payments made after an official act, without an agreement beforehand, and are not the same as bribes.So basically the Supreme Court said you can still receive money for your vote, it just has to be finessed a little.

Trump will weaponize the judicial system and throw innocent people in politics into jail, *especially* those who oppose him.  They will become felons merely for standing up to far-right authoritarianism.2. Felons shouldn't be allowed to run for president.If you take premise 1 seriously then I don't see how premise 2 is anything other than extremely short-sighted.","title":"Missouri Introduces Donald J.
