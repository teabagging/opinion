Roger Stone took a bunch of middle aged campaign staffers out into the streets of the county in question and started a fake citizen's \\"riot\\" (look up Brooks Brother's Riot. So called since they were all wearing Brooks Brother's suits pretending to be normal people) The Bush team used this \\"chaos\\" to argue that the supreme court needed to end the recount and decide the election to end the division, which it did, putting Bush in the Whitehouse and giving us two horrific wars. A few days later the recount was finished and Gore was the actual winner and should have been president. Stealing the election through the courts.In the case of Trump, on Jan 6 he had a mob of goons storm congress on the very specific day that they were certifying the election results. The goal was to stop the certification, then use his faithless electors (all of this is well documented) to create enough legal confusion that once again the supreme court could step in and appoint the loser of an election as president. This election cycle, we have seen countless examples of Republican attempts to muddy the waters and confuse the legal processes of counting and certifying the votes, the ultimate goal of which, again, will be to cause enough confusion to throw it to the courts where a loser can be installed as president.It has already happened once (at least), Trump already attempted it himself once, and has show clear sign of attempting it again. If it happens it should not be allowed to stand.edit: If I wasn't clear enough on the specific scenario I was talking about. I am referring to a situation where the verified vote tallies show that one candidate (in this case Harris) has received enough votes to be awarded sufficient electors from the electoral college to become future president, have their election results certified by congress on January 6th and Sworn in as President of the United States of America on January 20th. In this scenario, at any point along that chain of events from election to swearing in, some group of people successfully sabatoges that process to prevent to legitimate election winner from becoming president, then we should in no way stand by and let that happen.","title":"CMV: If Kamala wins in November but Trump still manages to steal the election through the courts it would be better to scrap the entire constitution and start over than allow him to be sworn in again."},{"text":"The party's mascot is a jackass, which is what Democrats make of their supporters.","title":"Democrats Spend Millions to Kick Third Parties off the Ballot"},{"text":"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush\\\\_v.\\\\_Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore)","title":"CMV: If Kamala wins in November but Trump still manages to steal the election through the courts it would be better to scrap the entire constitution and start over than allow him to be sworn in again."},{"text":"Most Republicans on Roy Moore in 2017: These accusations are horrifying and he needs to drop out or face expulsion if elected.\\nMost Republicans on Mark Robinson in 2024: Sure this stuff looks bad but who can tell if the overwhelming evidence means it's true and what even is truth anyway?

If the question is if the State is killing people regardless, what's the best method to go about it, as far as I can tell, the guillotine by far has the best track record for quick, clean executions even under the operation of prison personnel.Obviously, there's not much point in executions; we're not small localities with heavily restricted justice capability.

People make informed decisions to vote Republican just as they make informed decisions to vote Democrat. I don't really think that you can reduce *every single* Republican vote to uninformed or stupid people. Studies suggest that educated and intelligent people are just as susceptible to disinformation/misinformation as uneducated people. Having a college degree does not necessarily mean that you are any more immune to propaganda as someone who isn't and vice-versa as much as we'd like to believe that it does, at least not by a considerable margin. You've *really* got to consider disinformation in the current political landscape because lots of very smart people are \\"informed\\" by outlets that present the facts in a totally different way from what you may be used to; platform algorithms feed into this, you may currently be presented with more facts on one topic than someone in the conservative-leaning sphere would be and *oftentimes* this can be disinformation but *also* may just be more of a specific subject that you're not exposed to as much, and both disinformation and omission of information can serve to reinforce those political leanings. Both sides omit information that isn't conducive or relevant to their ideological goals, really. Right now of course the right-wing emphasis on certain things and omission of other things is the *largest* and most dangerous in our country for a variety of reasons I won't get into in a comment. I think another thing we often overlook when we're psychoanalyzing someone's political affiliations are the aspects of self-interest and the instinct of preservation. We don't like to admit it but we fall into political categories fairly easily when the issue of what benefits us on an individual level best is at play, and there are many people who vote based on this inclination alone. The political divide in this nation is not determined by \\"smart\\" vs \\"stupid\\" people. It's not even always \\"I want this\\" vs \\"I want that\\"; it is the result of an intentionally orchestrated disinformation campaign spearheaded by the right and unfortunately sometimes very intelligent people fall victim to it. It's easy to try to blame fellow voters for these things, but really I think that feeds the lack of unity we have in our country already.

The NPRM would reduce the significant financial strain that high copayments can cause for families receiving child care assistance by capping copayments at no more than 7% of a familys income. Nearly 80,000 families would see their child care payments reduced due to the 7% copayment cap. The proposed rule also encourages states to waive copayments for families at or below 150% of the federal poverty level.

She frequently mentions cracking down on bad actors, like price-gougers and unscrupulous corporate landlords, a broad set of goals she can tackle through the executive branch as well as Congress. On the other end of the spectrum, Harris has also scaled back a Biden-proposed capital gains tax increase that had virtually no chance of becoming law.There seems to be a method to this  its an achievable looking agenda, Jim Kessler, Vice President for Policy at center-left think tank Third Way, told Semafor. Theres a lot that could be done in a reconciliation bill, or a tax package, which can take on a life of its own.Its a shift from the 2020 cycle, when Harris and other Democrats platforms were orbiting Medicare For All, while competing to find other moonshot policies for just about every domestic issue. Even President Biden, who was more hesitant to chase the lefts support, took office with an ambitious legislative and executive agenda on numerous fronts  which he pursued, with mixed success, in office.Biden dreamed of an FDR-sized presidency when he ran in 2020, with hopes hed secure large Democratic majorities that would enact sweeping changes and transform the welfare state. Harris approach suggests shes preparing for a situation more like FDRs successor, Harry Truman, who battled a do-nothing Republican Congress that bottled up his domestic agenda.The broader Democratic party has scaled back its ambitions somewhat too, but the specifics of Harris plans also reflect the partys near-term electoral chances, an underrated factor in how politicians decide on their platform.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/25/2024/joe-biden-wanted-an-fdr-sized-presidency-kamala-harris-is-after-something-else?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Joe Biden wanted an FDR-sized presidency.

That was an embarrassing oversight. However, this incident doesnt undermine the overall strategy. The U.S. continues to increase military and economic support to Taiwan in the face of Chinese aggression. Bidens administration has also taken steps to bolster defense ties with key regional allies (like Japan, South Korea, and Australia), which strengthens Taiwans security as part of a larger Indo-Pacific strategy.**Middle East**:   \\nThe Middle East is never simple, and Biden inherited some deeply rooted conflicts. The attacks on Iranian leaders were actually under Trumps administration (Qassem Soleimani in 2020). Biden has used targeted airstrikes in Syria and Yemen in response to Houthi militia attacks on U.S. personnel, but hes also focused on diplomacy, like working to broker peace talks in Yemen. Iran is still difficult, no doubt, but the broader approach Biden is taking, prioritizing diplomacy while maintaining strategic deterrence, shows hes trying to walk that line between conflict and diplomacy.**Iran**:   \\nYeah, Iran isnt happy with the U.S. but theyve been a thorny issue for decades. Biden has made attempts to revive the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA), which was meant to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, but thats a hard sell with everything going on. Still, the focus remains on preventing escalation, and even if Iran remains antagonistic, diplomacy is still preferable to an all-out conflict.**Ukraine**:   \\n100% agree with you on Ukraine. This should be a bipartisan issue, and its sad that its become so divisive. Biden has done a lot here to rally the West in resisting Russian aggression, which is no small feat.There are definitely places where Bidens foreign policy isnt perfect, and some mistakes (like the Taiwan shipment) do happen, but overall, the administration is navigating a complex global environment. Its not easy managing situations with Iran or China, but diplomacy, military preparedness, and coalition-building are all part of the strategy.

The strict laws are injecting chaos and hesitation into the emergency room, Wyden said during Tuesdays hearing.A federal law requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care for patients, a mandate that the Biden administration argues includes abortions needed to save the health or life of a woman. But anti-abortion advocates have argued that the law also requires hospitals to stabilize a fetus, too.

While I don't necessarily agree with the article, it is clear (if you read between the lines) that her thoughts don't necessarily line up with Biden's.

That is a very tight rope to walk, as she obviously takes supporting Biden seriously, but also as any major break from the President would open up a whole new front for attacks.Personally, I would *never* want to run for reelection as a the VP of an unpopular President.  On a random flip side though, way back when Gore tried to distance himself from Clinton, who was actually relatively popular at the time.So basically, Harris, has to balance supporting Biden's positively received policies, while also trying to distance herself from his unpopular policies, all while trying to make it look like your are not undermining the current President.Again, I don't envy her this balancing act.","title":"Harris promises change  but poll shows voters see her as another Biden"},{"text":"A comment in a previous posting literally called his execution a lynching and stood at +46 upvotes before a moderator deleted it (which I personally find unwarranted).  \\nBesides they don't even have any evidence even for this lessened claim that it was racially biased, as far as I can tell, everything went exactly according to the rules set in Missouri law.  \\nThey just accept the false framing that is being spread by the media to confirm their own priors without actually looking at the evidence.The second comment is literally sitting at +29 karma, and both of the people actually pushing against the notion that he is innocent are lower than that. How is that disproving my point that the majority of this subs puts their priors before any evidence. (And will even drive facts that they dislike into negative karma, although it has not happened here).And the top comments are not saying \\"I hate the death penalty but this is the perfectly normal result\\". They've been leveraging personal attacks at the AG and the Governor for this situation in which they did exactly what they were supposed to. Or uncritically reposting the completely fake claims made by the defence when selectively editing the statement of the former prosecutor. Or implying that this case must be a wrongful conviction because there have been at least one case of wrongful conviction. The list goes on. Your framing of the allegations made in top comments are somewhat disingenuous.Meanwhile the only two comment that go in depth into the evidence of what actually happened, why the conviction had to be upheld and why the last moment gamble by the Prosecution should not have been considered are both sitting side by side, at the bottom of the page.The guy is probably guilty, and it doesnt particularly matter - this is still a miscarriage of justice. Unless you can somehow say that its a certainty that he did it, which you cant based on the facts of the case.No it is not a miscarriage of justice, you're spouting the exact same nonsense. The Supreme Court goes into depth about it, there is no claims of innocence being made, even the prosecutor has retracted this claim.  \\nAll the evidence collected at the time clearly pointed to Mr. Williams being guilty, no DNA evidence was part of this finding as touch DNA did not exist at the time. Furthermore, the Prosecution had already demonstrated that the murderer was wearing gloves, so there was no expectations that anything would be found on the knife.  \\nAfter all tests had been conducted and no evidence could be found on the knife, it was handled without gloves by the prosecution, which again, had no notion that touch DNA would become a thing in the future.Years later a DNA analysis of the knife found touch DNA belonging to someone that was not Mr. Williams, that the new Dem. Prosecutor and the Defence both jumped on to prove that someone else was the murderer. A Knife that was not expected to carry any of the murderer's DNA in the first place since he presumably wore gloves.The evidence used to secure the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt was at no point in question. But this unexpected touch DNA suddenly birthed all the wildest theory o an unknown suspect that would be the real murderer and had escaped Justice all these years, ... Except Womp Womp, it was the prosecutor and some investigator's DNA. So this complete hailmary of an unknown suspect vanished and we were back to square one, with an overwhelming amount of evidence against Mr. Williams.The notion that the completely accidental damaging of evidence, at a time when everyone involved did not expect such evidence to even exist and had conducted all the test that were available to them, is ground for dismissing a conviction on due process grounds is laughable.We are doing stuff to pieces of evidence right now, that is considered best practice, and might be compromising evidence that we don't even know exists and that we might be able to exploit in 30 years, should every single prosecution conducted today be thrown out in 30 years because defendants argue without anything to backup their claims, that \\"had the investigators preserved that evidence with modern standard then it would have revealed evidence of my innocence\\"?  \\nShould every investigation, where *any* piece of evidence was accidentally dropped, chipped, damaged, misplaced, tainted, ... be immediately rendered moot, simply because the defendant claims that by sheer luck, a disculpatory piece of evidence just happened to be exactly on the part that happened to have been chipped?  \\nThis would obviously be a ridiculous standard.Right now the destruction of disculpatory evidence, regardless of intent or circumstances is grounds for a dismissal of the case for due process violation.  \\nHowever the damaging of elements such that *some* evidence cannot be recovered that *might have been* disculpatory, is only grounds for dismissal if the defence can prove bad faith.  \\nOtherwise, the evidence is just accepted or rejected during prosecution and jury is instructed to take those caveats into account.  \\nMr. Williams defence is completely incapable of proving bad faith, because the evidence that was destroyed was not even known to exist at the time the knife was handled. And since DNA evidence on the Knife or lack thereof was never relevant to the conviction, there is no reason to assemble a new jury to reconsider the decision.","title":"Supreme Court allows Missouri to execute Marcellus Williams"},{"text":"Just hope she can get as much done as Joe did as President.

This is partly due to policies originally meant to protect coastal residents from disaster costs, but over time, wealthy developers and individuals buying second homes in high-risk areas have driven up those costs. These homes are expensive to build and replace, and the burden of insuring them trickles down to all residents, making premiums unaffordable for many.As for your real question, how to communicate these issues to conservative friends, its tough. The key is to meet them where they are. Acknowledge their frustrations and validate their feelings, because people are more open to listening when they feel understood.

They are solely focused on enacting Christo-fascism and criminalizing all dissenters. This is not scaremongering, this is really happening.You are doing absolutely nothing for the people of Palestine by enabling a Trump victory. Zero.

Health centers are now serving one in eight children across the country, more than 9.7 million patients in rural areas, over 6.4 million patients who live in or near public housing, and over 1.4 million people experiencing homelessness. Health centers have also expanded their preventive services, screening hundreds of thousands more people for cancer and infectious diseases and caring for patients with substance use disorders.The Biden-Harris Administration has been quietly, but *aggressively*, expanding this organization over the last couple of years because they believe this organization offers a path towards free healthcare in the US.

Health centers are trusted community providers and a primary source of care for individuals across the country who are uninsured, underinsured, or enrolled in Medicaid C making them well-positioned to respond to the urgent need for behavioral health services that are high quality, stigma-free, culturally competent and readily accessible.  These grants will help expand access to needed care to help tackle the nations mental health and opioid crises C two pillars of the Biden-Harris Administrations Unity Agenda for the nation.HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson made the announcement today at the Mental Health America Conference in Washington, D.C. attended by thousands of advocates, clinical leaders, people with lived experience, and their families. Mental Health Americas The State of Mental Health in America 2024 report demonstrates the need for this important expansion of services, finding that the vast majority of people with a substance use disorder in the U.S. are not receiving treatment, 1 in 5 youth had at least one major depressive episode in the last yearwith over half not receiving treatment, and 10 percent of adults with a mental illness are uninsured.  \\n...  \\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has called for requiring and funding mental health and substance use disorder services in all 1,400 HRSA-supported health centers nationwide that together serve more than 31 million people. Today, health centers are only able to meet about 27% of the demand for mental health services and 6% of the substance use disorder treatment demand among their patients. Last year, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee passed bipartisan legislation to enact the Administrations proposal to make behavioral health a core health center service. The Administration looks forward to further congressional action to secure this critical expansion of mental health and substance use disorder treatment as part of a multiyear extension of community health center funding. HRSA has made expanding access to mental health and substance use disorder services a top priority. In addition to todays announcement, recent HRSA activities include:* For the first time, making mental health a required component of HRSAs initiative to expand school-based community health centers;\\n* Funding partnerships between pediatricians and psychiatrists to allow for mental health tele-consultation, giving pediatricians real-time mental health clinical support in caring for their patients behavioral health needs;\\n* Expanding HRSAs primary care/psychiatric care teleconsultation partnerships to schools and emergency departments;\\n* Training thousands of new mental health providers including psychologists, psychiatric nurses, licensed clinical social workers, and counselors;\\n* Securing Bipartisan Safer Communities Act funding to integrate mental health into primary care physician residency training programs;\\n* Supporting rural communities in creating new rural access points for opioid use disorder treatment including providing medications to treat opioid use disorder;\\n* Building behavioral health care services for children in rural communities;\\n* Providing loan repayment for unprecedented numbers of mental health providers in return for their practice in high need communities;\\n* Launching the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline at 833-TLC-MAMA to support the mental and emotional health of expectant and new moms; Training community health workers, peer support specialists and others with lived experience in supporting patients with behavioral health needs; and\\n* Proposing an innovative new peer-to-peer program in the Presidents Fiscal Year 2025 Budget to train young people to support one anothers mental health needs while building an early pathway into the behavioral health workforce.  ...Statement from HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson:In the Biden-Harris Administration, more people now have health care coverage than at any point in our nations history. With todays announcement to establish and expand behavioral health care in hundreds of community health centers, we are further demonstrating our commitment not only to health coverage but to access to care, said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment are essential elements of primary care, and there should be no wrong door for families to get the behavioral health care they need.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Historic Investment to Integrate Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment into Primary Care"},{"text":"In terms of the Israel - Gaza conflict she has basically been a continuation of the Biden administration's ineffective handling.

Other people have commented on this, but police are having a hard time recruiting people. This decline started during cuts made in the 2008 recession, but the force just hasn't recovered and continues to shrink.According to the [Public Policy Institute of California](https://www.ppic.org/publication/law-enforcement-staffing-in-california/#:~:text=In%202022%20there%20were%20116%2C000,about%2040%2C000%20were%20civilian%20staff), \\"The number of patrol officers per 100,000 is at its lowest point since at least 1991, while the total number of sworn officers per 100,000 residents is at the lowest level since 1994.\\" In fact, I believe every large city in California has a roughly 10% or higher staffing shortage right now.This isn't really/necessarily an issue with the defund movement (though it most likely plays a role) but also includes things like the cost of living and danger associated with being a law enforcement officer.But, because of this, I think your argument that the reason crime is out of control in CA is because cops aren't doing their job is incorrect. As others have pointed out, CA arrest rates are increasing and cops are doing their jobs. The problem is simply there's not enough people to do the job effectively. You're right in saying the primary cause of that is not defunding. It's a variety of issues stemming from the risk, to public perceptions, to cost of living.As an example, lets says that you're at a restaurant. That restaurant needs 10 people to run effectively. You know this. You also know there are only 7 people working and the restaurant is packed.

Rural areas are fine - there is never a line, plenty of volunteers, etc.But in urban areas, the vote suppression machine is in full operation.  Republican politicians use the media to attack individual poll workers and, in essence, sick a mob of violent crazies on those people.  When a video of a polling place showed poll worker Ruby Freedman handing her daughter a mint inside the polling place, the Trump campaign came up with a bizarre theory that she was actually handing her a flash drive with fake data on it or some other conspiracy.  On J6, at the same time a mob was storming the Capitol building in DC, a different Trump mob had found out where Freedman lived and surrounded her house intending to lynch her.  Fortunately, the FBI had already warned Freedman and her daughter that a Trump-inspired mob was likely to seek them out and they had time to go into hiding before the mob arrived.That is what it means to volunteer in an inner-city polling place; a target is put on your back - and if the president calls for the mob, it isn't even illegal.  Giuliani only ended up in trouble for a civil judgement because the flash drive false claim was classic defamation, but nobody will likely end up in jail over it.","title":"Warnock: Georgia hand-counted ballot rule is effort to turn the democracy on its head"},{"text":"Not migrants, they are Illegals that illegally are allowed to vote D in US elections.

And Trump presided over a quintupling of the federal deficit, while Biden has nearly halved the federal deficit.1) Does the President or Congress write the budget?2) We've generally had a pretty divided government for the most part in this country's recent history. Isn't another way of saying that \\"Republican Presidents increased  deficit spending the most\\" something like \\"Republican legislators have generally reduced government spending the most\\"?3) Any statistics about Trump increasing the deficit or Joe Biden \\"halving the deficit\\" are radically influenced by the Covid crisis. Trump (while imperfect on spending) was generally better throughout his presidency than Biden. Biden has presided over the reduction in the deficit from the Covid peak, but it's still nearly twice what it was during pre-Covid and the rate of increase is accelerating. We're going to be back to Covid spending levels in a few years even without an epidemic. This is because Republicans cut taxes on the wealthy, while Democrats restore taxes on the wealthy.Hey OP. You seem to be highlighting this as a government income problem, when isn't the deficit really a spending problem? Whether or not some specific tax on the rich was theoretically set at 0%, 1%, 5%, 20%, 40%, 57%, 75%, or even 99%, wouldn't it be fair to say that politicians are just going to keep spending more money, the more money they get access to? If they can't spend within their means, then taxing every rich person even at 99% would just result in a deficit again as soon they can gather together and decide how much of it to shovel to different lobbyists, Ukraine, Israel, etc. Do you disagree with that?  Republicans say the tax cuts pay for themselves, but the economy's actually stronger under Democrats as well. And this issue is also a good opportunity to tout that Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy didn't boost the economy I'm calling major bullshit on this. Besides inflation and high housing cots, finding good jobs and many other things is much rougher today than it was under Trump.  \\n because GDP growth has been 3.4% under Biden and 1.18% under Trump (2.4% under Trump before covid).That's not the flex that you think it is. I've said this a billion times, but GDP is a shit statistic for measuring general prosperity. You know that government spending increases GDP? So the piles of cash they set fire to every day count towards that statistic even when they do nothing measurable to help Americans.   \\n  \\nReal things like finding jobs and the costs of stuff are big economic problems. We're doing much worse today.    \\n These are big wins on major concerns to the American public that Democrats should get credit for.?I genuinely hope that Democrats focus on the economy, because it's unfortunately a total shitshow right now.","title":"CMV: At Oct 1 VP debate, Gov Walz should pitch Dems track record advantage on fiscal sustainability"},{"text":"He's like the Beatles because he's half dead.","title":"On the View today biden got a rock star welcome from the hosts, who fawned over him, and the audience, which gave him a standing ovation. \\"It's like having one of the Beatles at the table\\""},{"text":"They should eliminate the filibuster, or make it a real standing filibuster.

They have hired 100,000 \\"poll watchers.\\" People don't think poll watchers do anything but they'll be creating affidavits/declarations in court cases to create fact patterns (like they did last time). What is new is Mike Howell at the Heritage Foundation has funded, recruited, and helped install the candidacy of these loyalists at election boards across the US. In the primaries in Georgia, as a dress rehearsal, they got 2 out of 5 Fulton County election board officials to refuse to certify an election. They also got Georgia officials to admit that these election board officials have unlimited discretion to request \\"inquiries\\" prior to certifying; using this discretion to not certify an entire county is a bigger win for them than the last time.Since 2020, there have been 8 other instances where election officials refuse to certify election results. If we see this, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Detroit, all may have entire counties not certified, or have enough fact patterns to survive a motion to dismiss, or have enough inquiries after inquiries to resolve, to throw off the election.

But, they don't always discuss what people now call the \\"fake elector\\" scheme. The more Trump and people in his orbit can create the legal trappings that there is an actual legal case, the more they can make their supporters become enraged.Since 2020, Trump and his team have essentially campaigned and gotten true believers on the election boards across the country. So, in Fulton County, Georgia, in 2024, even though Trump won the primary, two of the five election board refused to certify the elections. This lead into election board members to conduct undefined inquiries before they have to certify election; if Kamala appears to win GA, I guarantee Fulton County is going to create 'undefined inquiries' and refuse to certify. How can the Governor certify the election if an entire county doesn't certify?Mike Mitchell has spent the last 4 years, as head of an \\"election oversight\\" committee of the Heritage Foundation. In that role, he's said there's a 0% chance of a free and fair election. He's spent time and money and organizing to get Trump loyalists installed on local boards of elections. The RNC is formally hired Christina Bobb as its chief legal council and was a huge election denier. The difference in 2020 is Christina Bobb will have had 4 years to create a legal strategy with an unlimited amount of money to create cases. We laugh at them now because we say \\"you had no evidence\\" but they will create fact patterns with loyalists in the boards of elections TO sign declarations in their official capacities about their inquiries and findings.  The RNC is hiring 100,000 \\"poll watchers.\\"The media is not prepared to cover court cases in election denial cases that survive past a motion to dismiss because a judge will find there's a factual dispute. You see time and time again, for example Bush v. Gore, that the media's obsession with \\"both sides\\" framing will not push against facts alleged in a law suit that survives to trial.66% of Republicans believe that 2020 was stolen. That means there's more than 100,000 people out there that will want to create fact patterns the lawyers can jam up the election. It means there's more than Fulton County that were driven to be on an election board because they have the believe the Dems can only win when they cheat.Nearly 1 in 10 Americans lack easy access to proof of citizenship. Why do you think so many GOP groups have pushed such a requirement to prove citizenship to vote? This means that there's more grounds to challenge more ballots giving more election denying election board members to find a \\"there\\" there.They already are doing these strategies and are continuations of past strategies. The RNC, Public Interest Legal Foundation, United Sovereign Americans, to name a few, are filing lawsuits to create impressions that voter rolls are not being maintained, so they're ALREADY sowing seeds of distrust.The next January 6 may succeed before they feel the need to storm a building with a critical mass of supporters. They may get an entire county to refuse to certify and create a huge show down. Then as that takes time to unwind and creates confusion then animosity is heightened and the negative partisanship that Republicans feel about non Republicans CAN create a critical mass of supporters to storm a federal building.You can see events like Cliven Bundy who forcibly took over a federal building and then got jury nullification to avoid any consequences. I don't think an event like that is far fetched.","title":"CMV: I do not believe a second January 6th type event would be as large as the first if Trump is to lose"},{"text":"Only ones I can find are Austin (150 million cut and redirected to social services) and SLC (2.5 million).

Liberalism is flipping everything upside down and that makes feminine men and bossy women. There is a lot wrong with that, such as the fact that a man is useless when hes a feminine, it is a weakness for a man to be overly feminine and nerdy. Women who want to be bossy have some kind of lack of confidence within themselves, because a confident woman has no problem with being feminine and owning her feminine traits. The need to be bossy comes from bad intentions to make men smaller than men. Its not equality, its trying to make men lesser than they are and that in itself is a crime just as it is making women lesser than they are. If feminism was truly equal rights driven I would have no problem, but it normally entails having men be like women and women be like men in how they act.

Everyone is entitled to a fair trial by a jury of your peers in this country and the vast vast majority don't ever get one. Why? Because prosecutors tend to overcharge defendants in hopes of them pleading guilty to avoid a trial and for many they are stuck sitting in jail not able to afford their cash bail so a guilty plea is their only hope. If your two options are to plea out and receive 2 months of jail and then 18 months probation vs sit in jail for upwards of 4 years awaiting a trial and then face a possibility of 5-10 years in prison for that same charge if convicted, which one would most people pick? Even if you are innocent the prospect of pleading guilty is inherently better. At what point does innocence not even matter to you anymore if you would lose your job and freedom and have to miss your family and friends while waiting behind bars for your trial to even start?I think most people would be shocked to find out that in New York in 2021, 82% of felony charges never resulted in a conviction for that original felony charge. About 50% were dropped outright and the rest were plead down to misdemeanor charges or fines. A similar study was done in Boston and the number was around 80% as well. So 4 out of every 5 people charged with a felony are never even convicted of that crime and courts are *still* backed up years","title":"CMV: Police haven't been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that's why crime has got so our of control in California."},{"text":"#Let's NOT talk about the debate!","title":"'Offended': Lauren Boebert sparks argument on House floor claiming Dems 'hate Christmas'"},{"text":"I heard that if you vote for Trump, you can vote twice!","title":"Shoutout to Kamala Harris, who I understand is personally responsible for egg prices now.

The petrodollar is the only thing that has been propping up the dollar as the world reserve currency since Nixon took it off the gold standard (France called our bluff and showed up with ships to get their gold, lol). There's a very real chance that removal of that system leads to global financial collapse, since currencies world wide are already suffering due to Triffin's Dilemma and the actions required by the FED to prop up the dollar (see Yen in the news).We have what economists call a TINA solution: There Is No Alternative. BRICS nations have been trying, but failed to bring anything meaningful and the US wouldn't get on board with something that removed its primary source of economic power over the rest of the world. That means it would almost certainly be doomed to failure, since a **world reserve currency** kind of needs to be global by default, with how interconnected everything is now.TLDR: there are serious global stability issues that lead the US to insist on having an ally in the middle east to secure control of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, even if they happen to be genocidal maniacs.Our leaders are crunching numbers, the victims are just collateral damage to them.

He has merely tried to undermine the death sentence that he personally dislikes, when both the Jury and the People of Missouri chose it as the relevant punishment.  \\nA prosecutor does not get to pick and choose the penalties that the Justice system hands out. Finally, without making any explicit statement about this case, the overwhelming majority of the comments, including all the top comments in all three reposts of this story have run away with the BS sensationalized version of this poor innocent black men being prosecuted unfairly by KKKonservatives (of course as professional journalists they wrote all this nonsense using conditional, they wouldn't want to be caught lying, while they actively disinform the people).   \\nAll these comments about racial bias, whataboutism, death cults, \\"pro-life hur durr\\", ... are completely inconsistent with the facts as they happened and must necessarily rely on the conspiratorial framing of this story as presented in the media (social and press).Mr. Williams has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at every step of it's prosecution, all its appeals have been used and all its arguments have failed. According to Missouri law, and after conviction by a jury of his peers, the penalty for his crimes is death.   \\nIf you hate the Death Penalty go run in Missouri, and convince the people of Missouri to abolish it. If you hate the AG and the Governor for their idea or previous actions, be my guest.   \\nBut don't manufacture confusion about a clear cut case simply to make shit up for political and electoral purpose.This should be a non-story, it only gets engagement here because people get to project their own prejudices and feel good about themselves regardless of the facts at hand.

I don't think there's a single magic point that will solve the issues of policing. I also view policing as just another job.

Tight labor markets are great for wages, but if you know your company is actively trying to hire an additional 30% of labor, you have no worries about losing your job. If there aren't economic incentives to perform like bonuses, why perform? Economic conditions like price instability always effect crime rates. If you make it easy for people to obtain the things they need, they won't steal. Inflation made everything more difficult to obtain for everyone. You don't see high crime rates in affluent areas up the peninsula. They can still get what they need.So if I were a cop, I'd have a few thoughts. The economic environment appears to promote more crime and homelessness making my job more difficult. My friends are making a killing in other ventures. I have little worry of being fired, but also little incentive to produce results. My job performance is recorded and scrutinized so the best way to keep the job is to not do anything.

First, one can resist evil without resorting to violence. Second, nonviolence seeks to win the friendship and understanding of the opponent, not to humiliate him (King, Stride, 84). Third, evil itself, not the people committing evil acts, should be opposed. Fourth, those committed to nonviolence must be willing to suffer without retaliation as suffering itself can be redemptive. Fifth, nonviolent resistance avoids external physical violence and internal violence of spirit as well: The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent but he also refuses to hate him (King, Stride, 85). The resister should be motivated by love in the sense of the Greek word agape, which means understanding, or redeeming good will for all men (King, Stride, 86). The sixth principle is that the nonviolent resister must have a deep faith in the future, stemming from the conviction that The universe is on the side of justice (King, Stride, 88).It has worked before.

IMHO should Harris prevail, the thing history will most single out as the defining moment of the election and what most visibly contributed to Trump's downfall will be the \\"They're eating the cats\\" moment from the debate. It was caused entirely by his running mate being caught in the Right Wing echo chamber and bringing him the fabrication he had seen online. They most likely did not fact check it because it was too juicy of a racist dog whistle to pass up. They *knew* that saying \\"Haitian immigrants\\" would fire up the white supremacist core of MAGA because they are both Black and \\"illegals.\\" Vance proved the latter by claiming later that he does not recognize their asylum status as legally obtained so therefore they are in *his eyes* just more illegal immigrants her to take jobs and steal social services.

Vice President to the first Black president, balancing the historic ticket but never trying to steal the limelight. 3. Advocated for gay marriage at the start of the re-election campaign, forcing the President to adopt the position as a campaign pledge. 4. Abdicates VPs role of heir apparent by not running out of deep personal loss, while also giving way to another historic, albeit unsuccessful, candidacy. 5. Returns from retirement to provide a statesmen alternative to a populist demagogue, returning the country to some semblance of normalcy after four years of chaos. 6. Nominates the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. 7. Provides free vaccines and covid tests to help get us out of the greatest pandemic in a century. 8. Spends nearly all of his political capital on boring, unsexy projects that will largely not see major benefits in his lifetime, such as infrastructure, inflation reduction, and green energy investment. 9. Ends US presence in Afghanistan. Establishes a ten year plan to evacuate Afghan allies long after public interest has abated. 10. Codifies same-sex and interracial marriage into federal law. 11. Rallies international support for Ukraine ahead of the Russian invasion, pre-empting what would have been a major military blitz and effectively giving Ukraine the hope for continued sovereignty. Also pioneers an unprecedented executive action to parole hundreds of thousands of displaced Ukrainians. 12. Puts aside his pride and terminates his candidacy for re-election when facing troubling odds. Immediately endorses the first female Vice President, effectively annointing her as a candidate to be the first Black female president. 13. Champions Supreme Court reform as his swan song in light of historic reports of corruption. 14. Uses his final speech at UNGA to speak to the importance of the peaceful transfer of power and necessity of relinquishing the role of head of state during a time of increasing dictatorships and fascism.","title":"Biden: Some things are more important than staying in power"},{"text":"and racists","title":"Democrats keep calling us Nazi, but why?"},{"text":"*That's just how we print \\"S\\"'s, you ftupid fhitheads.*","title":"Shoutout to Kamala Harris, who I understand is personally responsible for egg prices now.

How do you go about ensuring that the people executed for these crimes didnt merely run afoul of the wrong people?

While speaking, they must have an audience of 3 or more other Senators physically present within the chamber, and within 100 feet of their center of mass *at all times*, or the round is declared to have ended. \\n* After each round ends, the number of Senators necessary to end the filibuster decreases by 1... and the decrements don't stop at 50, so at some point, after an absurd number of filibuster rounds, even a *minority* will be enough to end it. \\n* After a round ends, the next round must commence within 60 minutes. Every 60 minute period that elapses without re-commencement administratively ends the current filibuster round and makes it easier to end.\\n* During the filibuster, participants are chosen in random order, with the next speaker chosen by the Speaker (or his/her designee) when the current one begins speaking (just to really keep them all on their toes and nearby, and effectively start the commitment-clock for the *next* chosen speaker when the *current* speaker starts). If the next speaker isn't physically present and ready to take the floor within 90 seconds of the current speaker finishing (or 5 minutes of the current speaker being unconsciously removed from the floor due to something like a medical emergency), the current round of filibustering is declared to have ended.\\n* While speaking, the Senator must clearly speak at least one English word in 30 seconds, and utter at least one complete grammatically-correct sentence per minute (or at least, some portion of a sentence that lasts for longer than a minute must begin within the window of time). Violations of this rule may be called by any Senator physically within the chamber, and an adhoc committee of 3 Senators may convene (virtually, if desired) to review the recording and vote (with escalation procedure if they don't agree, or if challenged by the speaker, that would be too long to write here). If the Senator's time is declared to be over, he or she will have 5 final minutes to wrap up (during which time there is no need to continue speaking). \\n* The microphone must be live at all times. Should the microphone fail, the speaking Senator's staff (or other assitant) shall have a maximum of 30 seconds to get a working megaphone or equivalent temporary means of amplification ( with some prescribed range of acceptable amplification power) into the Senator's hands, or the speaker's turn will be declared over.\\n* While speaking, some portion of the Senator's body must remain within 60 inches of the dais' center of mass at all times, and the dais itself may not be moved. The microphone is *not* part of the dais. \\n* Senators are allowed to make use of diapers, catheters, and other adhoc means of dealing with elimination... but their use does not waive the continued-speaking requirement, allow the microphone (and video, if livestreamed) feed (and subsequent recording) to be silenced or censored, nor waive the requirement that at least 3 other Senators be present within the chamber at all times.

For instance, administration officials have attached stringent labor standards and Buy America provisions to money from a bipartisan infrastructure law. The child care requirement will be flexible for chip makers, but it will almost certainly divert some subsidy dollars that are meant to expand factory capacity and create jobs. in a speech last week, Ms. Raimondo called efforts to attract more women to the work force a simple question of math for industries complaining of labor shortages. We need chip manufacturers, construction companies and unions to work with us toward the national goal of hiring and training another million women in construction over the next decade to meet the demand not just in chips, but other industries and infrastructure projects as well, she said. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. manufacturing workers are women. Ms. Raimondo said the CHIPS Act would fail if the administration did not help companies change those numbers, by bringing in women who have children. You will not be successful unless you find a way to attract, train, put to work and retain women, and you wont do that without child care, Ms. Raimondo said in an interview. The Commerce requirement would represent a relatively small step toward Mr. Bidens much larger, and as-yet unfulfilled, child care ambitions.These are admirable goals but uh for a business that just wants to make semi conductors these are bad provisions.","title":"Kamala Harris set to outline pragmatic and capitalist economic philosophy"},{"text":"This, the budget has nothing to do with the last 5 years.

The earliest time someone can get parole is after 15 years but there is no guarantee that this has to be granted. If someone is convicted and a particular severity of guilt has been established then the court decides towards the end of those 15 years when that person can actually apply for parole. This can lead to people not being able to apply for parole for much longer.There's also the possibility that a court can order preventative detention after the actual imprisonment has ended. So you could have someone get life in prison, get parole after 15 years but still stay in prison only in a lower security part.Parole includes a five year probation.","title":"Is the Death Penalty illiberal by default?"},{"text":"I'm just glad THCa got through the loopholes.","title":"Kamala Harris is the first major party candidate who wants marijuana legalized"},{"text":"The Mariano's (Kroger) by me is still selling a dozen for $3.49.

A $2 billion electric truck factory is taking shape in South Carolina. And in Colorado, a three-square-mile field of ink-black solar panels is powering a steel mill.  \\n  \\nThe US is mobilizing so much investment into clean energy that it now tops even the peak of Americas fracking revolution in the 2010s. The wave of spending triggered by Joe Bidens signature climate law is set to be the presidents biggest and most-enduring domestic achievement  yet it barely registers in Kamala Harris campaign.  \\n  \\nFrom stump speeches to the Democratic convention and her debate with Donald Trump, Harris has largely shied away from touting the success of Bidens green initiatives, despite the staggering size of the private investments the policies have sparked.  \\n  \\nHer motives are clear. Fighting climate change may win voters in her home state of California. But the topic is far more divisive in natural-gas rich Pennsylvania and other states pivotal to the election.

I'm posting it for others to read up on.Since you phrased your post as if this was an actual conspiracy to uncover let's try to look at this from a logical perspective. The picture is in her book on page 246 (at least in the pdf I found). It does say that this is her paternal grandmother Beryl and that the picture was taken in Jamaica. So from it is not the great grand mother like in the other picture. From what I can see there are two possible answers here: 1. Kamala Harris is lying about standing next to her grandmother and this is in fact a different person. Why would she lie about that? I'm honestly not sure because what even is that question. 2. There is a mistake with her grandmother's death certificate. This is the only source I really find that has more details: https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/272680650/beryl-christie-harris. The name in the second picture is written as \\"Beril Magdaline Finegan\\", born 1917, signed by Iris Finegan (name of Harris' great-grandmother). The first picture is from a different person, who was 39 when she died. That name should be the same as the person pictured, Beryl. Though it is kind of hard to read the handwriting. The website itself is apparently confused about who died as well. Since Iris Finegan is apparently the mother of the woman from the third picture, my best assumption is that these were sisters. I'm not sure we have enough to go of because the first and second picture on the website should be unrelated to the third. [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.de/search/?name=Beryl+Christie_Harris&amp;birth=1921&amp;death=1960&amp;geo_a=r&amp;o_iid=41023&amp;o_lid=41023&amp;o_sch=Web+Property) has this (likely) mistake as well. I watched a part of the Owens video and thank you OP for making me sit through that one and ruin my algorithm. She calls this a scandal? She also ignores that there are multiple different names for the apparently same person? Could it be that there's a mistake with the death certificate and the grandmother was still alive at that point? Or that Harris told the people who put the picture in that this is her great grandmother and they made a mistake that no one spotted? Shit like that happens all the time.I'm gonna give you some answer that make no sense: This was a housekeeper, discended from slaves who was forced to sit in for pictures. How would one arrive at this? Or call this a scandal? Also why do you relate this to her racial identity?Interesting side note: The website now writes her name like in the death certificate instead of the way her grandmother's name is written. A google search showed \\"Beryl\\" five minutes ago.EDIT: Also please someone help me out, the second [picture](https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2024/269/272680650_7e233d32-4596-428c-9b46-405fab472daf.jpeg) says Beryl Christie I think. I'm not sure where \\"Finnegan\\" or \\"Harris\\" is. Is it normal to not put the last name? Because This woman might just have been called \\"Beryl Christie\\" and might have had nothing to do with Kamala Harris at all.","title":"Kamala Harris, pictured next to her Grandmother, Beryl, who allegedly died 4 years before Kamala was born."},{"text":"This whole situation is fucked.

You've broken away from the hive mind. They claim to know Jesus, but I'm skeptical that they really do, because they spread hate, fear and constant lies. They claim that loving thy enemy makes you weak, and loving thy neighbor does nothing for your own interests, yet these people claim to be devout followers of the LORD. Do they really think Jesus died for ALL of our sins because it served his best interests? Do you think he healed those people and performed the miracles he did to get something out of it? No, he did this for our own benefit, to save us from eternal damnation and it cost him his own life.Just remember this, you cannot get better in the place that makes you sick.

The gate has been in place since 2008.\\nIn 2017 The Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), said an arbitrator has ordered the resumption of a lottery that gives workers a chance at becoming a casual member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.* For the first time since 2004, the longshoremen's union opened up the Job and Over 80,000 applied for a chance to become a casual member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.\\n * Only 2,400 individuals will be chosen to the roster of eligible casuals, after they pass a screening process.Casual workers must report to a union hiring hall each day to see if there is work available that is not being filled by full-time positions pulling in more than $100,000 a year. They may only get occasional work for years, but the PMA said the draw is in response to significant workforce needs at the Southern California ports.\\n   \\nAs regular longshoremen retire, casuals are promoted to their ranks, and the lottery winners will be used to replenish the ranks of the casuals.\\nLongshoreman on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are threatening to strike demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container movements that are used in the loading or loading of freight at 36 U.S. ports.* Top-scale port workers now earn a base pay of $39 an hour, or just over $81,000 a year. * But with overtime and other benefits, some can make in excess of $200,000 annually. \\n* A 2019-2020 report by the Waterfront Commission, which oversees New York Harbor, said about a third of the longshoremen based there made $200,000 or more.\\nThe Container Port Performance Index Accordingly, how a maritime port performs is a crucial element in the cost of international trade for a\\ncountry. Unfortunately, ports and terminals, particularly for containers, can often be sources of shipment delays, supply chain disruptions, additional costs, and reduced competitiveness.

It even beats out Canada, despite the vast majority of Canada's population bordering the world's richest large country and Canada having considerably more natural resources\\n* This is **despite** Germany subsuming an utterly bankrupt and broken communist country of 16.4 million people just 30 years ago. I can only imagine cutting East Germany out of the average would close the gap between the US and Germany considerably - to say nothing of the fact that West Germany had to spend a ridiculous amount of money rebuilding East Germany much of which would have otherwise been invested in West Germany. (Also, while an imperfect metric, [look at how well East Germany performs on the subnational Human Development Index](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/maps/) - beating not just every other former community region, but even the average for Western Europe)\\n* And this is **despite** Germany taking in around 3 million refugees in the last 10 years - 3.6% of its population. This was morally the right thing to do and something Germans should be proud of.\\n* And this is **despite** the fact that Germany has one of the best work-life balances in the world. I cannot overstate how surprised I was moving to France at how few rights and entitlements French workers enjoy compared to Germans.\\n* And this is **despite** Germany having virtually no natural resources (unlike the US which is comparably energy independent)\\n* While Germany could and probably should taken on more debt, its economic track record is all the more impressive when one considers that many of its economic peers saw their debt to GDP approximately double in the last 25 years (France, US, UK). It seems at least plausible that had its deficit spending tracked with the US, it would be as rich as the US is today[- Like 100 walkable cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population). Many of which are really pretty affordable* People complain about its trains, which admittedly are slower than in France with more delays.

Oh well, I suppose we are winning the abortion argument anyways, but I feel like it could be a bit cleaner.

NATO blew up the Nordstream pipe and shot down that flight over Donetsk, blamed it all on Russia. ISIS is a CIA/Mossad front.But I believe Putin is a WEF agent, put there to drag Russia into a war with NATO. His biggest enemy is the Russian people and oligarchs that don't want this. He's been lubing up public opinion for a year now, to the point that they'll accept the use of a nuke, just in time for Ukraine to invade Kursk with a big \\"nuke me\\" sign.Russia can survive long range NATO missile strikes, but it'll hurt like hell. The depot explosions this weekend might already be the first launches. Then the political cost of dropping a nuke will be cheaper, if it deters NATO from allowing further strikes.I think this will end up in a Korean war meatgrinder in Ukraine, where NATO and Russia send their people to die by the millions. It explains why NATO has been pushing the idea of women in the military for years now, and is now suggesting conscription for women.I think this will end up in WW3, with East vs West, NATO vs BRICS. If Russia drops a nuke the West will demand all countries cut off all trade with Russia, forcing countries to pick a side, and most of the BRICS will refuse, so they'll get sanctioned too.In the end both sides will release virus bioweapons that target the Covid vaccines used by the other side.

If you want to be with someone but being with them makes either you or them unhappy, that's not a healthy relationship and you should either work on your behaviour or end this relationship and look for someone more compatible with your needs.
