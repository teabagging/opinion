With team sports and tennis, the athlete needs everything a formula 1 driver/ team needs to do but there are far more physical components involved. That's not to say that Formula 1 isn't a highly demanding sport and more difficult in some specific ways. It's just different.   \\n?They also need to be able to stay focused for around 2 hours at a time. No breaks.Pit stops? Yellow flags? There are breaks. Formula One drivers, need to be constantly making adjustments and analyzing. They are one of the most important bits of data the team could get. And they have to make adjustments on the fly.This is literally all team sports. Watch a rookie in a team sport. They don't make adjustments. I assume this is the same with racers in lower tiers of Formula 1 racing. The difference is that there are far less drivers than players in team sports.Precision. Formula One is all about precision. Drivers need to be extremely precise when they drive.So are all team sports. Quarterbacks have like a 6 inch window to throw the ball and hit a moving target typically. Soccer players have to position their body, beat a defender, jump at the exact right time, hit a moving ball with their head, and get the ball past a goalie that is waiting for the ball.

If Hitler was alive today, hed be a Republican."},{"text":"First, this should be rephrased/remade because \\"tough\\" is subjective. ANYTHING can be tough. NURSING is a very tough job that many extreme sport athletes can never survive 1 shift of; I've seen ex marines break down mid shift. And the typical nurse is your average 5'-5'6\\" girl who loves boba tea and snapping cute selfies.Take for example how tough it is to be a jet pilot. The g force as you say is ridiculous and something average people cannot endure without training and prolonged exposure to high g force will pop a blood vessel and cause a stroke. That's obviously no joke. But that's ONE subjective view of tough where the skill is difficult and what's at stake is high. When you shift the view of tough to \\"masculine\\" or w.e. then what's tough is no longer things like piloting but more like marine corp, army, infantry. Being in the front lines. Even when talking about just that, definition of tough gets convoluted. Some people think what's tough is what they are capable of. Some people think what's tough is what they can endure. Some people think what's tough is how many people can accomplish it.These are all valid points of being tough.But when you're comparing a category that doesn't necessarily fit with another category and try to claim this is tougher, there's a major fallacy here. How do I prove to you a person who might believe masculine tough is what tough means that piloting a PT boat is tough (because it is) when all you tunnel vision on is that it's tough to be infantry? How do I prove to a baseball hater (this is me actually) that baseball is tough because the hand eye coordination skills required is insanely difficult? Like to someone like me, you will never ever convince me baseball is a tougher sport than football or MMA.I can already see a lot of arguments coming in with the mentality \\"If a kid who plays video games can pick it up, then it's not that tough.\\" And that wouldn't be an accurate or fair statement, but it would still be an opinion that has some validity because again the definition for toughness is broad.First, define the type of toughness you're talking about. Then compare it to other tough sports that fit in that category. I don't see you convincing any hockey or football fans motorsport is tougher. But you might convince people who are fans of other sports that place value on precision, hand eye coordination skills that's extremely difficult to obtain, etc that it is indeed tougher. Friends of mine into football will just say \\"It's tough to take a shit in public, it doesn't mean I want to watch people compete over it\\" for example. The concept that people don't place that much concern over contact sports like football is jarring because of culture but there is a reason why the sport has gradually become more boring to avoid liabilities with brain damage, especially on special teams.","title":"CMV: motorsport is much tougher than traditional sports"},{"text":"My guess is 20000 in the permit space and maybe another 10000 outside.","title":"20,000 people expected on Ellipse for Kamala Harris speech on Tuesday"},{"text":" Instead, it urged Democrats to focus on the vice-presidents proposals on the economy and abortion rights, and to set up a contrast with Trump on these topics.Not wrong","title":"Democrats tell Kamala Harris to drop controversial tactic in last week of presidential race"},{"text":"Exactly.

She keeps talking about working across the aisle, when the other side of the aisle has become so unhinged.

I dont think their votes will transfer to trump, but I think she will be losing some of those votes.?She has made too many political miscalculations of her own. When 80% of Dems want a ceasefire why is she not changing her policy to indicate that truth??Its also interesting that you are framing Arab-Americans, a relatively small minority, as somehow more consequential than white women. Why are white women voting for trump when hes taking away their rights, but when an Arab simply decides to abstain because he has too much self-respect to vote for someone who sees them as subhuman its all their fault? When is it time to blame white women?She doesnt even want their votes. She literally kicked out a prominent Arab democrat at an event in michigan when he wasnt even doing anything.

To name a few:* Conservatives tend to limit political discussion to political groups, while leftists want to inject politics into every topic/group/workplace.\\n* Moderators control this more than anyone else, and they tend to be leftist since to do that unpaid labor you have to have excessive free time. This tends to be college students and unemployed people.\\n* Almost all large subs on the site have the same ~10 \\"powermods\\". These people are supposedly unpaid, but they spend literally 16 hours a day on Reddit, stifling conservative ideas and amplifying leftist ones.\\n* Advertisers are part of a coalition of leftists who will refuse to advertise in the presence of conservative ideas like guns and actual free speech. It's called GARM: Global Alliance for Responsible Media. I believe they just got sued and forced to disband, but I'm sure it will happen again. Plus the damage is done on this site anyway.\\n* The structure of reddit makes it snowball:Everyone has a unique tolerance level for being treated unfairly. Imagine a diverse group, with one moderator in control. If that mod has a liberal bent (which they usually do), he will say the rules are applied evenly but in reality mostly ban conservatives while letting it slide with liberals. Some people's tolerance for this will be very low, so they'll leave. Now the group is 60% liberal and 40% conservative. People continue to talk, but conservative opinions, regardless how reasonable, are now always downvoted. It starts to feel like leaving a thoughtful comment is a waste of time because it will be downvoted so nobody sees it. Conservatives start commenting less, or leaving after they try and find their time wasted. It now seems like the sub is 95% liberal because you never see conservative comments, even if it's actually still 30% conservative.

Even though his role was purely ceremonial, the idea is that his actions would force things to be brought before the right (corrupt) courts with fringe (false) enough legal theories to overturn the results.Mike Pence refused to do this, because he correctly assumed he did not have the authority. Which is why, even minutes before speaking at the rally, Trump was trying to convince Mike Pence to refuse to certify. However, Pence's still insisted he could not so Trump decided to send his mob to the Capitol to disrupt the Certification process instead. The idea being that whatever destruction could have happened, either destruction of the ballots, the slaying of Mike Pence and others in Congress, complete takeover of the building, etc would delay the Certification and open a desperate legal pathway.This time, he is going to challenge results and try to delay certification at local levels more. And at the state levels. He's installed Election Denying trash humans all over the place.

People don't connect raises with the same forces that create inflation. What is extremely puzzling to me however is that Reagan in the 80s was able to rally support and make some grand \\"Morning in America\\" speech when inflation was still at like 3%+ unemployment was worse, GDP growth was worse, houses were relatively unaffordable etc just because the recession ended. This economy didn't even include a recession, had strong growth and GDP numbers and Biden couldn't get a win out of it. I attribute this to a few things. Biden is at his age a terrible communicator. Reactionary social media is extremely powerful and is convincing to many people. Republicans regarding the economy are more nakedly partisan. A lot of their entire pitch to more moderate less tuned-in voters relies on the economy being perceived as bad. If you look at polling Republicans are more partisan with the economy than Democrats. So, because of this Democrats have a baked-in disadvantage regarding the economy and it's kind of hard to make an election not about the economy.","title":"For many US voters, the economy is personal and they blame the Democrats - Reuters"},{"text":"So people should just give up their ideals and vote for the diametrically opposite party, right?They should be doing it because they value their ideals.

Do you have to budget for luxuries like travelling? When you're on a plane, do you take first class, or economy? How often can you fly? What sorts of hotels do you book?\\nDo you need to think about debt, credit card payments, auto insurance?\\nThese things don't exist to Donald Trump. The money you'll use in *your entire life*, including retirement (~$4M), to him, is like you paying 3 months rent.\\nIf he wants to go somewhere? He has private jets, drivers, luxury hotels.\\nIf he doesn't feel like working? He can retire, spend lavishly every moment of every day and still not run out of money.\\nLook at TruthSocial. He started a Twitter clone - do you know how many of these there are? Except unlike the others, it took off, because he has leverage, and because he has sway. If you launched a product that was a worse version of something that was free, how many people would start using it? If you launched an NFT collectible card with your face on it, could you collect $500,000+?\\nAny relatability he has is an illusion.\\nKamala Harris' net worth is ~$3.5 million. Still very well off and comfortable - but not completely mind boggling. She too, though, is not relatable for most Americans, who are struggling with grocery prices, etc.\\nSo, judging candidates based on vibes alone is a horrendous, misleading mechanism. It's like going to a strip club, and thinking the girls on the stage are interested in you. They're pretending, so that you give them money. Trump is pretending so you hand over the most powerful office in the world.\\nAs for \\"honesty\\" - I'm not sure how Trump is honest to you. He blatantly brags about tax evasion, draft dodging, and lies through his teeth. Even tiny things, like crowd sizes, set him off. Do you remember during the Women's March, where he posted a picture saying that it was actually one of his rallies, because the turnout was better than his rallies by far?\\nRemember COVID? While the rest of us were cooped up at home, risking death, and the hospitals were saying they couldn't keep up with demand? Donald Trump had a personal set of doctors, the best of the best equipment to keep him safe. He got the vaccination before it was available to the public.\\n*And throughout that time he lives through his teeth*. He advised his followers to drink hand sanitizer. He thought that you could use lasers to shoot down COVID.? Is that really a level of competency suitable for the leader of the free world?\\nMaybe you CAN feel at home with Trump's followers though. But do you want to? Their photographs blatantly flash Nazi SS signs.\\nI'm not going to encourage you to vote for Harris. She's hand in hand with the same billionaires that Donald Trump is with. But people being willing to? vote against their own self? interests, because a billionaire put on a 3 month show where they pretended to know what the common man needs, is why Harris' milquetoast policies are something that can even be considered as a lesser evil.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"They don't think white immigrants count, even when they come here illegally.

Henry said people who would believe that guides and masters were leading them should be guided by masters, and he considered himself one...A whole business was made of the New Age to the slave community. As books and items were created for those searching for truth, the self-appointed 'enlightened ones' who were 'in the know' manipulated the spiritual ideologies in order to hide many of their mind control realities. What was behind much of it was really a group of men, controlling [mind-controlled robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/15vqlrk/comment/jwysg8c/) and herding them in the direction they wanted them. I was programmed to deliver to a famous Los Angeles channeler, the words to say just before a Whole Life Expo event where he channeled the message to a very large group of people in an auditorium who were in an altered meditative state. Henry gave me the exact words to say. They were targeting high-level slaves and it encompassed those programmed with whales and dolphins, angels, ascended masters, eastern religions, energy, quantum physics, UFO's, aliens, channeling, and listening to your guides and angels. They felt if Los Angeles failed then the rest would because most were patterned after Los Angeles. I have met persons suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder that felt they were channeling entities, when in fact they were channeling parts of their own personality structure. One day a woman 'channeler' named Shirley graciously offered to channel privately for me. Earlier, other people had paid her $50 to channel for them, but I was not among them. I told her I would be glad to ask any questions she had of herself while she was in a channeling state of mind. She agreed. The answer to the question when posed about 'if Shirley had been involved in any of this [ritual abuse stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1g00p9a/comment/lr606ib/),' was, 'Shirley is not ready to face that reality yet.' Channeling can be a very clever way to cover the reality of Multiple Personality Disorder and offers a way of covering up when personality systems break into conscious awareness, explaining it away as 'an entity.'*\\"\\"*The New Age was used to help usher in the New World Order. It was part of a miniexperiment on total and complete mind control. Henry created lots of concepts to use. It was implemented in Los Angeles as the pilot experiment using a new form of philosophy to direct the people into mindlessness until the higher technologies could take over creating by the year 2000 'the perfect utopia.' The New Age was the formula for complete takeover - a way to lead many in the ways they needed in order to be in total control of Los Angeles by the year 2000. While I still lived in California, I was given instructions for New Age things to read, watch, and places to go, etc. They were beginning to get people to identify with 'globalism' as associated with love, peace, and good feelings. Many songs also readied people for this one-world, global reality with powerful love harmonics. I, too, believe that the earth and the people living on it in harmony is a beautiful idea, but we need to insure that we don't loose the freedoms that we all hold so near and dear to our hearts, especially the freedom of our own minds and to know where our thoughts come from.*\\"- [Brice Taylor](http://www.whale.to/x/ThanksfortheMemoriesbyBriceTaylor.html)See also [here](http://www.hopegirlblog.com/2016/01/23/wow-new-age-mk-channeler-wakes-up-greg-giles-channeled-messages-are-government-mind-control-programs/), [here](https://www.hourofthetime.com/majestyt.htm), and?[these 3 posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14ueiba/alien_abduction_mind_control_programming/).","title":"The new alien religion"},{"text":"He said what he said.

How strongly we have to fight to get equally shouldn't really matter, and you're honestly downplaying the issue of LGBT rights. It's not usurping the spot of the civil rights movement, it's an extension of it. We've still got the a part of the majority trying to prevent a minority from having equal rights.

It was so powerful that we had a surplus for a short time.Gorge Bush - 2008 The economy was going pretty well then the housing market collapsed near the end of his presidency taking a lot of the rest of the economy with it.

All sections of society are more visible today because of the internet: therefore you see more dumb takes or uninformed people. My belief is that in the past you just wouldn't have heard these people as they would've gone about their daily lives without talking about politics at all.There was some polling done which was frustratingly I can't find now, but it compared the public's answers to basic political questions (eg. who is in X post, does the supreme court have the power to do Y, are you aware of Z event, etc.) and in the last 30-40 years people have got *more* well informed, not less. It's just before the people who knew nothing weren't visible in the public discourse.This also explains political pessimism, extremism and polarisation in my view. In the past, the small cores of informed, partisan supporters could each kid themselves that they represented the general will of the population, and that once everyone else realised that, their dream society could come to pass. But as more and more people are politically engaged, both sides have realised that about half the population supports them, and there are genuinely a lot of people that oppose them in the other half. This (my theory) makes people more focused on putting down the other side than genuine attempts to debate or convince people, as they become pessimistic that there isn't some easy pool of people to convert to their views. It also destroys the idea that either side is ever going to \\"win\\" and build their dream society, which makes partisan people more frustrated and angry.All this also contributes to the idea you must have your side win at all costs, which explains the trend towards authoritarianism (obviously this is much worse on the Right in the US, but I think this manifests itself as cancel culture, privilege discourse etc. on the Left).TL;DR: the drift to authoritarianism is real, but is driven by *more* political engagement, not less.","title":"CMV: The alienation of politics from the minds of regular people moves democratic countries closer to autocratic rule."},{"text":"Yes I know it's the same businessmen controlling both parties.

Florida has a fluid population that is not particularly political or calcified in its beliefs. Beyond all of that, I don't think polling is particularly accurate right now.

In 1919, the Treaty of Versaille disarmed Germany. Fearing inability to hold the state together during the depression, the German government adopted a sweeping series of gun confiscation legislation. This was long before Hitler came to power.In 1928 this legislation was relaxed. Germans could possess firearms, but they were required to have? permitsFurthermore, the law restricted ownership of firearms to persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a permit.' Again, this was before Hitler came to power.In 1938, Hitler relaxed the law further. Rifles and shotguns were completely deregulated, permits were extended to three years, and the age at which guns could be purchased was lowered to 18.Now, hitler did effectively ban Jews from owning guns in 1938. However, this is highly unlikely to have affected the fate of the Jews even slightly. The Nazis were considerably better armed and organized, and if Jews had taken to shooting them it would have accomplished nothing except giving Joseph Goebbels some terrific propaganda opportunities","title":"What's the difference between Lincoln and Trump?

As an organization, it's fully capable of thriving if only it appeals to the people's needs. In the 2016 election, both Trump and Hillary scored the lowest \\"favorability\\" ratings in the poll's history. It was the Democrats' election to lose, as the Republican party was in shambles and only Trump making a mockery of the other candidates was capable of getting any excitement in the party, and Trump was only trying to boost ratings for his reality tv show, not running a serious campaign.Hillary literally said, with enthusiasm during the campaign, to a crowd: \\"Medicare for All with never come to pass!\\", like that's a great thing to say to left-of-center voters. In fact, running on Medicare for All, the opposite of Hillary's stance, would have gotten a whole lot of people to show up. And that's just one issue she could have picked.I think the desperate ones inside the Democrat establishment are the businessmen behind the party. They're the ones making the decisions about Russiagate and all the deflecting of blame and responsibility.And we see now that the U.S. has been trying to steal Ukraine from Russia. Companies have been purchasing land in Ukraine and Moldova for discounted prices, but need the Russian military far away to actually control what they bought. Of course the U.S. businessmen are going to concoct a scheme to blame Russia for their own failed election. And this election didn't matter to them anyway as they control both parties. It was just an opportunity to ramp-up the anti-Russia hate to mentally prepare Americans for a war against Russia.The desperate ones are American businessmen who control both parties who are losing control over the world.The Democrat party can win majority votes just fine, if its politicians just ran on traditional Democrat policies that historically got them elected.","title":"Joe Rogan: \\"The rebels are Republicans now...you want to be a rebel?

When you mentioned Trumps appearance on JRE, you didnt say a single thing about any policies Trump said or alluded to. You just talked about how he came off.If you truly value certain policies, you owe it to yourself to educate yourself about candidates up and down your ballot to see if any of them support what you want. You owe it to yourself not only just to understand the cynical games of politics but also the actual hurdles in the system that can make it difficult to achieve what you want to see. You owe it to yourself to figure out how best to cast your vote in the context of the system in which we currently live and how you feel some politicians may either work toward those goals or serve as lesser opposition to those goals.I think you need to think about what it means to you when you say some issues matter to you, because the way you currently go about choosing political candidates doesnt demonstrate to me that you **practically** care about those issues. Its the shallowest of lip service. Youre willing to take a punch to the gut if the person who punched you is very likable to you (even if the punch isnt a likable act), but if some boring person shares their lunch with you because you forgot your own, youll reject them simply because theyre boring.I know some of that was harsh and condescending, but Im trying to make you see that youre not actively working towards empowering people who advocate for what you want or something close that you and others can maybe push politicians on.?I dont expect you at this point to do the level of research and acquire the amount of background context to understand both Harris and Trump before the election, but at the absolute very least, read both of their official campaign websites to get an idea of where they stand of various issues and if they have some degree of a plan in mind.

One important aspect of Jewish Americans historical favoring of Democrats, though, is rooted in liberalism in general. Jews are a diasporic population and the United States offered them a home *no matter* their religion, so much so that it was baked into the Constitution itself. Historically this might have translated to, I am welcome here as a citizen with inherent rights vs I am merely tolerated by my host country.

If you're bar is set *that high* you're setting yourself up for disappointment.There's no shortage of parties.

There are people alive today who remember the Democrats as the party of racial segregation and the KKK, although there were regional differences. The political platform of the DNC has changed substantially since then and will continue to evolve. Same with the GOP.If you feel underrepresented by both parties then start local. Identify which party you feel the most closely aligned with and work to support local candidates that best align with your views for down-ballot races like state representative or state Senate.

Despite not being pressed whatsoever, Trump still managed to discuss a white supremacist and traitor (Robert E. Lee) in glowing light as a wink to his neo-confederate base and he could not answer the question when asked to present evidence that the election was stolen in 2020, despite still insisting it was. Trump has made his living off of bullshitting people. From apartment leases to Trump University, his life is about scamming people and so that is what he does. He is a sleazy salesman. Like Trump and every other politician, Harris wants power. However, when you look at the life of Harris, her life was not centered around scamming people through shady business deals, but rather civil service. Why did Trump run again? It could be that he has lust for winning, but it could also be that he needed campaign funding to pay legal bills and he needs to pardon himself if he is found guilty of pending federal crimes. Harris has no such baggage. The idea presented by Rogan in the podcast, that Trump is a victim of the media establishment and that they turned on him after it appeared that he could win is conspiracy nonsense. The truth is that Trump has only been consistent on law and order and he has taken many different stances on everything else. His positions changed as he began contemplating running for office. For example, he became pro-life after being pro-choice for most of his life and during the final stages of the 2016 campaign he began saying that he favored overturning Roe v. Wade. Trump became a different person during the 2016 election. His politics changed and his rhetoric changed and that change was reflected in the media's view of him.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"Harris's willingness to take a cognitive test emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in leadership.

People also just don't answer calls they don't know much anymore even if they do get through. People also don't open their doors to talk to strangers much anymore either. Online polling is a wash because nothing can stop trolls or bots. Email is a wash because it'll almost definitely get filtered and, as far as I am aware, there is no reliable database of emails of potential or likely voters to pull from. The only person I personally know who has been successfully pulled, Republican or Democrat, is my 83 year old father with just an old school flip phone. He still answers every call because he used to always have to for his business. I've asked everyone I know. No one has been polled. So who can still be reached somewhat reliably? Very old folks. Folks in very rural areas. Uneducated poor folks. And even those demographics will become increasingly difficult to poll in the near future. How can pollsters reliably poll people then?

I personally feel it started because of social media and smart phones.  I recall quite vividly sitting outside with my husband sometime around 2008 or 2009.  I had been on Facebook for about a year and discussing the I-phone and internet.  We both agreed that while there were benefits to the new technology it would probably lead a downfall in society.  \\nPrior to social media life was definitely more calm when  it came to politics.  Unless there was a tax levy or bond issue people rarely even talked about general elections.  It was only during presidential elections that you might feel some pressure from friends. Conversations might have become a little awkward or slightly heated but at the end of the election it was over.  With the invention of the internet and on-line platforms, chat rooms and social media the extreme left banded together  and started using platforms to voice their opinions in their echo chambers and their extreme positions started becoming normal to those listening. (In the beginning I feel there was  a larger number of liberals using these platforms than conservatives.). When the stupid phone became basically more expensive than the smart phone more conservatives started having access to these platforms became aware of what was being said on-line.  The conservatives woke up and realized that they too could voice their opinion the left didnt like that and decided to cancel anyone that didnt follow their lead.  One afternoon I came across a billboard that stated requiring voter identification was racist.  To me I couldnt imagine why anyone be against voter ID.  I genuinely wanted to know so innocently asked my friends on Facebook.  Oh, the backlash I got from just asking was incredible.  I tried to rebudle  but they would have none of that.  My friends reacted the same way a lot of users do when an innocent conservative post or comment is made on most  Reddit subs. Now almost 20 years later this mentality has trickled down from on-line to the real world and it has become the norm.  What did we expect?  Our phone is with us every single moment of our life. People rather text one another than have a real life conversation or Heaven forbid meet up for coffee and meet in person.   I know hypocritical after all I am on Reddit using my smartphone but this is the world we have to live in.

Dems need to look at candidates through the lens of football.  Which candidate will advance your team's ball (ball aa a metaphor for your political views) further down the field toward scoring?  Even if the candidate doesn't score, it still moves the ball in the right direction and perhaps the next candidate can move it even closer to the goal.  Not voting because a candidate isn't perfect is a huge fumble.  Your basically giving the opposite ideology a chance at grabbing the ball and moving it further to their goal. In this election one goal holds an increase in protections of civil liberties and bodily autonomy, multiple plans to help middle class workers and families, polocies to protect unions and raise the minimum wage, and opportunities to lower healthcare costs.  The other goal holds the passing of policies that aim to harm people of color, policies to further restrict women, policies to harm gay and trans people. policies to bust unions, policies to deport or imprison mass number of people, and policies to make the rich even richer.","title":"Republicans will vote for their candidate if they align on a single view, democrats won't vote for their candidate unless they align on 100% of views.

As far as i'm aware, the last time the US did a poll, about 50% of the people indicated that they are happy there. I'm not diminishing, discrediting or denying that there definitely are problems, i'd have to see very compelling evidence that the people who feel unhappy aren't voting. You are also begging the question: \\"things must be going well because the discussions are more shallow\\" - \\"the discussions are more shallow because things are going well\\"It was just a thought.. There are so many reasons for political alienation that listing them would be a fools errand. You could talk about disinformation, political slime-baggery, prevalence of entertainment, hostile rhetoric, enormous amounts of information, shorter attention spans. You could go on forever. But what you suggest is downright naive, I'm sorry to say.And i'd agree, what makes you think these things cancel eachother out? My stated factors might very well be contributing among yours.Peace only lasts until it suddenly and violently ends. The world is not safer today than it was 40 years ago. War is back, and more vile, ingenius and present than ever.This doesn't take away from the fact that we can measurably conclude that we live in the most peaceful times ever across the western world, It might end, abruptly even, but the fact that we've come so far already isn't because of pure chance.Happiness is not a measurable, nor tangible item. This is more wishful thinking, and the declining birth-rates suggest exactly the opposite of comfortable lives being lived.I'm definitely not saying we live outright comfortable lives. I'm saying all of this relative to times prior to this era. It's a measurable fact that we've made tremendous gains in terms of living standards even for the poor people among us. Besides, i believe these people probably still vote. I'm saying that there are simply more people living above the poverty line than ever before.Extreme poverty defined as living on less than $2.15 a day, fell from around 36% of the world's population in 1990 to about 8.5% today, equating to approximately 700 million people?.Like you say, there are probably lots of factors at play that affect voter turnout, but i believe this is also at play.

You seem to think that the establishment wouldn't waste resources abusing random citizens for no reason, but if you look into the MKUltra program documents (they were released in the 1970s) that's exactly what they did, drugging and torturing people (often high ranking government agents or researchers) and then just throwing them in the garbage.

This is a bit of an oversimplification, but pretty much his theory was that one only need look at what the economy is and who has the money in order to figure out pretty much everything important you need to know about a person that could ever have any effect on the outcome of history. According to this theory, there are two groups -- oppressors/capitalists/bourgeoisie, and oppressed/workers/proletariat. Bourgeoisie = bad. Proletariat = good. Bourgeoisie alienate the proletariat by disconnecting them from the fruits of their labor, which according to Marx is taking away their worth as a human being because human worth is defined by being connected to labor production.Many other theories have taken direct inspiration from these basic ideas -- instances of modern feminism and Critical Race Theory most notably. For Critical Race Theory, replace \\"Bourgeoisie\\" with \\"White people\\" and it's pretty much the same thing. Except where for Marx human worth is defined by material relation to the economy, for CRT anti-racism is defined by material relation to the economy. So CRT doesn't look at laws or actual instances of racism, what they do is look at economic outcomes, and if there is a racial disparity, they claim to have found an instance of racism. When this instance of \\"racism\\" is found, White people or White supremacy are blamed (no matter what races are involved). This is like Marxism, where they don't look for actual instances of human rights abuses, they simply look for disparity in economy outcomes and that in itself is the human rights abuse, and the Bourgeoisie are always at fault no matter what because they are the only ones in a position to commit human rights abuses. You get some funny claims, like you'll see a non-white person commit a hate crime against a non-white person, and people will claim this is because of White supremacy -- CRT and Marxism are why they do that. In classic Marxism, this would be akin to a worker murdering a worker, but Marx steps in to say their boss is at fault because he doesn't pay them enough.This can lead to some pretty bonkers racism. I come from an ethnic group very famous for being oppressed all throughout history. We had probably the biggest genocide in the entire world committed on us in the name of White Supremacy. It was so bad that even almost a hundred years later, we still have not recovered our numbers from before the genocide. However, according to many on the left who buy into CRT, I am actually a privileged White oppressor who benefits from White supremacy. This is because my ethnicity does not follow Marx's theory -- even though we were oppressed all throughout history, we also managed to succeed in various areas, usually economically. In fact, I'm almost positive Marx's entire theory is literally just [him being butthurt at my \\\\(and his\\\\) ethnicity.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/) A lot of the concepts I talked about in this post -- including alienation, but more generally just anything to do with money -- Marx goes out of his way to blame on my ethnicity.But it's not really complicated. It's incredibly black and white thinking. There are two groups, the baddies are in power, everything bad that happens is the fault of the baddies. That's pretty much it.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

If you aren't already aware of any number of total deal-breakers at this point, I don't know how much more can be said, but I'll try I guess and call it my last attempt. If the racism, the sexism, the gross ignorance and buffoonery, the endless outpouring of lies, the repeated reneging on contracts and commitments...if all that isn't enough, then him attempting to undermine our election process by falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen should settle the issue. Not even getting into his culpability for January 6th. Just him refusing to accept the results and acknowledge he lost. It's destabilizing to our democracy and proves him incapable of properly wielding the precious responsibility of managing the wellbeing of an entire nation. The man is a lying liar. This is fact. The lying liar lied about the election being stolen, and a significant portion of the population gobbled the whole lyingshitpie right up. Either you believe the election was stolen and you're lost to us, or you don't think that's an end to it right there, and you're lost to us. It's cut and dry, to me at least, and it feels like it ought to be for any rational person.A vote for Donald Trump is a fuck you in the face of a reasonable world. I have no great love for Democrats, but this isn't a question of party. It's a question of patriotism.

Our current political climate is not normal or acceptable. He has dragged us all into the shit, and we've all become more deranged for it. If this election isn't an overwhelming win for Kamala Harris in both popular and electoral vote, my last thread of faith in this country will be snipped. Watching us slowly tipping toward the dark maw of authoritarianism is fucking with my head.  So idk man, if you need just one reason to vote for Kamala, do it for me?

He was engaging and charismatic for the whole three hours which was impressive, far better than I thought he would manage. Sure, he did a bit of incoherent rambling but that's what we've come to expect at this point.Unfortunately, the substance of his policies is severely lacking. The main policy he talked about with Rogan was to increase tariffs, seemingly thinking that this was some sort of infinite money glitch. Tariffs are paid by the importer and the increased cost is then passed onto the consumer (which also contributes to inflation). There is a reason serious economists moved away from this approach a hundred years ago.More important though, in my opinion, is Trump's character and the threat that poses to democracy itself. This man tried to overturn what all investigations have shown to be a free and fair election because his ego couldn't stand the fact that he lost. Everyone knows that he lies constantly (I had a good laugh when he was telling Rogan about his medical exam, saying he could run on a treadmill all day and the doctors were all amazed). This is not someone who should be given any sort of power. You were aware of this in 2020 when we didn't have half as much evidence as we do now.I would encourage you to give Kamala the same chance and listen to her in interviews to get a sense of what she's like as a person.

Even now, people will commonly use 'socialism' as an insult of sorts, despite not having the slightest idea of what it actually entails.Even in America, the conversation on politics is increasingly shallow: immigration, abortion, lgbt etc. Not that those topics are not important, but they are shallow topics on their own.Quite the opposite. All of those are at face value just simply things, but they represent a significant aspect of society: freedom. What does it say about a society when people are discriminated against for being different in a rather arbitrary way? You can easily draw a parallel to the Civil Rights Movement.Right now, abortion is mostly about the reproductive rights and how much control women have over their own bodies.

That's indeed what they're trying to do.The thing that I am almost completely certain of though, is that the part where you feel like you are being individually targeted is a result of a broken ego with a gap rationalizing something that can't be rationalized.They do this through mass manipulation of media, news, overflow of information, riling the people up against eachother etc, meds indeed also. But there's no reason for them to target individuals, especially insignificant ones in relation to what they're doing.Whatever they're doing is working plenty well without needing to put in the effort and resources to target one guy just graduating from university. There are limited resources available for every type of organisation, and with what they're doing, never would those resources be spent at this time on some random guy.Aside from that, it's way too much risk to do that as they would be doing it too many people and people would start talking about it etc for really no benefit in their plans. There's no shortage of mentally ill people being created just by the state they have society in right now.But, for your ego this is the most rational thing it could think of at that time. And you just came back from fully gone, so it's one of the first things it learned in it's re-arrival in this reality, which can work a bit the same way like the first things kids learn about the world. Very hard to shake.Add to that that a lot of suspicious things are happening, and it's a very strong confirmation that your conclusion is the correct one. But while you're seeing those clearly, i think your lens used to view the situation related to your dissociative experience, is malformed.Also, depending on why that dissociation happened, it s not out of the question that you were, or are being manipulated by something that can influence all kinds of things you perceive. And feeds of the misery that is produced by that. In our current time most people aren't vulnerable to this, but in specific circumstances it is possible. The meds could certainly open you up a lot more to it.But a being like this is not in human form and for the most part, of a much subtler nature and can't do any harm to you except make you cause harm to yourself indirectly through influencing you in subtle ways.I'm not even sure if it's a good idea to tell you this right now as I don't want to make you more worried, but it's important to know.

I am diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder with Psychopathy, meaning for all intents and purposes - I'm a psychopath. And I'm also the person you would gravitate to in any room. I am very charismatic in person, funny, kind, understanding, patient, and I can convince people to go against their best wishes without them ever realizing it.You would vote for me. You would be swayed by me. And for no reason other than I can manipulate you using little more than charm and relatability. Now to be fair, I have very high intelligence and strong cognitive empathy, meaning at the end of the day - I'm not a bad person but a pretty good one. However, you should know that I know you are an easy target if that weren't the case.The very fact that you don't care about policy or real issues and are swayed more by emotion and relatability tells me everything I need to know to have the upper hand against you in any situation. And were I to exploit or manipulate you, you would leave the exchange thinking I am an incredible guy. Period. Full stop. You would look forward to seeing me again.If for no other reason, you should vote for Harris because she is the moral and ethical choice. And consider that for a second. That someone who doesn't know what it is to feel deep love for their wife, kids, dog, parents, and so on. Who cannot understand morality from an emotional POV is telling YOU how to make moral decisions. This is the problem with our political system in American politics. It takes otherwise good people and turns them into monsters far worse than the likes of me or my lesser developed kin.And beyond that, Trump is divisive by nature. He accomplished significantly little in his presidency. But more, he and his followers believe that the Democrats are part of a huge cabal that has incredible power over every waking moment of the American people. The Deep State. And yet, in four years, he couldn't uncover this supposed Deep State, he couldn't prevent some supposed massive \\"fraud\\" in voting even though he talked about it massively before the election. A massive investigation uncovered nothing for voting fraud. And didn't he just say, \\"But I have massive papers. Tons of papers.\\"  Bullshit.He couldn't touch Hillary and put her in jail (Because he never intended to when he said \\"Lock her up\\"). He couldn't dismantle the media empire that he says is rigged against him. His narrative relies on a cycle of perpetuating victimhood and helplessness under a supposed all-powerful opposition  one that he ironically claims to be uniquely qualified to defeat, yet has consistently failed to do so.Consider, then, how the people who follow him have become invested in these ideas, not because of their truth but because they appeal to their emotions and beliefs, regardless of the facts. By using rhetoric designed to evoke loyalty and enmity, Trumps tactics center on painting opposition as existential threats rather than competitors in policy or ideas. This isnt a strategic oversight but a manipulation tactic.Ask yourself: if a person who prides himself on outsmarting others constantly claims to be thwarted by an \\"invisible hand,\\" does it mean hes fighting it or benefiting from the narrative it supports? How does a self-proclaimed fighter of corruption remain untouched by it and accomplish so little against it when in power?So heres a strong, deeper takeaway: manipulation works on the emotions and identities weve tied into our political beliefs. And if a self-aware psychopath is pointing out these vulnerabilities, maybe it's time to recognize the strings pulling public sentiment in politics. Your vote is a tool  don't let it be used by anyone else's hand but your own.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"-Osho enters the chat-","title":"For many US voters, the economy is personal and they blame the Democrats - Reuters"},{"text":"It doesnt help that many conservatives promote the idea of tradwives and stay-at-home moms.

The people let them do it because rather than offering hope for the future with powerful plans for people living their lives (high wages from collective bargaining, low healthcare costs through the same, etc), they pretend people's current problems are because of something. Doesn't matter what that something is, as long as people believe that their lives will get better after that something's removal is accomplished.So for now, the 'other' is the Haitian immigrants who moved to support the jobs that the town was having trouble filling. Rile everyone up and pretend things like that are making their lives worse and the people vote accordingly. But then let's say all the Haitian immigrants move away from the US. Now what? No one's lives are better. In fact, those jobs that were being filled at lower wages are now unfilled. So either other locals take the jobs they wouldn't take before for those same lower wages, or the cost of goods goes up so higher wages can be given. People then complain the cost of goods went up, so the people in power have to find a scapegoat. They need a new 'other'. Maybe Puerto Rico just had an influx of people moving here. Maybe Jews did. Or Italians. It does not matter who the next scapegoat is. They have to pick some group or else offer tangible plans to improve lives. Much easier to pretend it's the fault of some \\"other\\", rather than actually invest time and money into the people.But yeah, I'm liberal. I believe we should have liberties like healthcare not only for the women's rights recently stripped from them, but an affordable option for everyone. I believe we should have the rights to own guns, provided we can ensure the safety of their use (eg, think licensing for driving cars but applied to guns). I believe we should give people the liberty to love who they love no matter the gender, or be whatever gender makes them happiest. You know, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

So I swayed back to him. It seems to me that you're basing your voting choice entirely on how someone manages to come across. But you make no mention of the context of his words or how true they may or may not be. The first president I got to vote for was Obama. And it was over Mitt Romney. And let me tell you that I struggled for a moment. Because I really wanted to vote for Obama and had every reason to, but for some reason Mitt Romney came across as such a  great guy. I mean, he is. To some degree he's always come across as someone who means what he says and follows through. But here's the thing, so did Obama. I needed to look at what Mitt Romney SAID. And you already made mention of what made you vote for Biden for 2020. Let me tell you, if that was your reason, none of that has changed about DJT. He's still very loudly clamoring for revenge on his enemies. And you saw what he did in 4 years in office and how bungled a pandemic, starting with severing the relationship with WHO and withdrawing funding from them. This was all prior to any mention of an outbreak. He's very clearly told the American people time and again that he's only concerned with what serves his bottom line. If people from his own party taking a step back and endorsing Harris isn't enough for you, I don't know what would sway your vote towards a common sense candidate.

He has always been skeezy and abusive of his position. Which is why when he ran for president the first time, so many of us thought it was a fucking joke, because who TF would want him as president? Who would want this perverse excuse of a human to hold the keys to nuclear codes, to have access to US secrets, to have conversations with dictators that he has expressed time and again that he admires them?Your choice is a vain Cheeto who's lied in your face about any topic he can muster, and stolen his way to \\"success,\\" or an accomplished public servant who has dedicated her life to making real good in this world, and this isn't her \\"I'm bored, let me run for president\\" era.

If the election is really close, how do you do a recount? Does every single county and precinct in the country do their own recount? Youd basically have a thousand bush v gore sized lawsuits simultaneously.  The only way to make a national popular vote work is to fully federalize election administration.  If everyones vote counts as +1 to a national tally, you really cant have separate rules for each state, and you cant trust each state to be trustworthy.The issues with the EC really come down to one thing: winner-take-all.  Thats why there are swing states, because all that matters is whether you win or lose a state, because then you get all of its votes (except for Nebraska and Maine).  If each state allocated its EC votes some other way, this would mostly go away.  What if each state just said you get a proportional share of the EC votes? If a state has 10 EC votes, and you win 40% of the vote, you get 4/10.  You could also have ever state switch to the Nebraska/Maine model and allocate electoral votes by congressional district (+2 for winning the state overall), though this would probably only be OK if paired with a federal ban on partisan gerrymandering.  If you do that, the coincidence that a state happens to be close to evenly divided wouldnt matter at all to the campaign, and every state would matter equally.  I dont think the slight malapportionmemt in favor of smaller states should really bother anyone.  Even the current partisan advantage from it is really small (the GOP advantage in the EC right now is more due to the fact that the biggest safe GOP states (TX, FL, OH) are still way closer than the biggest safe Dem states (CA, NY, IL), so Dems end up wasting way more votes due to winner-take-all.  Sure, the GOP gets 6 votes from the Dakotas, but Democrats get Delaware and Vermont and Hawaii and DC etc.; it doesnt even out, but its not like all the small states vote Republican every year. The issue is that the marginal voter is totally irrelevant if they live in a state where the winner-take-all outcome is predetermined, so if arbitrarily assigns maximum importance to certain voters for no real reason.  The urban voters of LA and Houston are just as worthy as the citizens of Philly and Atlanta, and the rural voters in Vermont and Wyoming are just as worthy as the rural voters in central PA and western NC.  But only the voters whose overall state is near 50/50 matter, and *thats* the problem.","title":"The electoral college sucks"},{"text":"I'm so mad about prices so let's drastically raise prices to solve the issueI just don't fucking understand.","title":"For many US voters, the economy is personal and they blame the Democrats - Reuters"},{"text":"You say \\"perceived honesty and relativity\\" are yor main factors.

The reality is that relatability never really translates into enacting policies that help the common man. Its really just code-switching where they can speak to the common man when they need to and then switch back over to talking to/like high power people when they are doing things. Basically they are faking you out with relatability. I would encourage to pay more attention to how they actually govern. Kamala is a bang average democrat.

But if we are focused on answers, your base assumption is wrong. Trump is the least honest person you know or have heard of. Even on JRE he couldnt keep it straight whether he won or lost the election, which is a pretty big thing. Is a golden toilet, failed businesses, stealing from charity, rape, cheating, and thinking you can nuke a hurricane more relatable to you than a career oriented, non-felon? You talk about working to make the nation greater, but that you arent familiar with policies, so how do you know that Trump is the one that would make the nation greater over Kamala, should they spend the same amount of time doing so? PLEASE familiarize yourself with policy. Anyone can hold a conversation, it doesnt qualify someone for president, and Trump can barely do that.The problem is youre voting based off of essentially nothing. These two candidates are radically, radically different, so switching back and forth means you have no position. Youre not basing your vote off of anything. You need to familiarize yourself with at least a few issues. Here are some examples: \\n- economy: economists have said that Harris plan is overwhelmingly better \\n- women: Trump is a multi-time offender for sexual assault, and was pivotal in repealing roe v wade, which has already caused death &amp; injury. Harris is pro-choice federally and has not raped anyone. \\n- climate change: Trump said he would give oil companies reign to do whatever they want if they give him a billion dollars. He doesnt understand solar or wind power, and rolled back many environmental and other regulations that help keep us safe. Harris is pro renewable/green energy \\n- international relations: Trump has been open about his affection for Russian &amp; North Korean leaders, and wants to withdraw support for our allies. Harris believes in strengthening relationships with other countries. Why is JRE so important? Harris has done plenty of events where you can hear her speak.Does it concern you that a huge amount of people that have actually worked with Trump, have endorsed Harris?

Feel free to read through all 15k words of it and tell me that you still think the same way. If you don't have the time or desire to do so, here are some of the highlights:One of the main things they want to do and has also been covered in other places is remove terms and definitions such as sexual orientation, gender identity, SOGI, DEI, gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender sensitive, reproductive health, abortion, reproductive rights or any other term out of every rule, regulation and grant regulations.They plan to do this and other things through changing OMB guidance documents. These are documents designed as interpretive guides for agencies when taking certain actions such as handling grants. They want to change these or completely remove said documents. This is not only easy to do but bypasses the need for notice and comment that is usually need for the passing of new regulations.Schedule F is a core component of taking over. The goal is to instate political appointees while simultaneously eliminating existing positions. Here control is taken in the PPO and OPM in order to fire present personnel and replace them with political appointees.On one hand, this is a problem of their own making but the working conditions would be terrible for many employees. This highlights just how far they are prepared to go as well as what their views are on work generally. Appointees are likely expected to work 18 hour days with barely any weekends or personal time while working on this project. (Very pro-family values, right?) Appointees are encouraged to interact and follow allyships but simultaneously be very cautious. This would likely lead to a very stressful workplace with a paranoid atmosphere.Only the most enthusiastic bootlickers are chosen to occupy the positions of political appointees and other staff. In order to be a part of this, staff is expected to be willing to make whatever personal sacrifices are needed such as loss of future career prospects.Staff are encouraged to \\"walk down the hall\\" rather than communicate via e-mail and other communication methods. All this to keep communication out of writing and thereby make oversight more difficult.While at some point they try to refute this, throughout all video's there's a lot of corporate language in the videos. They often refer to the president as the \\"CEO of the government\\". As much as they say it's different, they sure don't act like there is a large difference in how they think about it. There is also a huge emphasis on hierarchy. Efforts and accomplishments are recognized for superiors, while failures are blamed on inferiors.Chevron deference is mentioned multiple times and how the way they envision government is to fully rely on political appointees rather than subject matter experts of their respective agencies to make interpretive decisions. They are looking for ideologically driven people. There's a few instances throughout the videos that they have to explicitly tell only people with expertise in specific subjects to apply for respective jobs. While ironic, this means that the appointees have at best a chance to be incompetent at the subject matter they work with and at worst people who put ideology above well substantiated decisions.A lot of the contact and relationships, and the advice given about building and maintaining them is often phrased as being able to be leveraged. Especially with relationships outside government, with organizations, media and even ideological allies but also within agencies with other colleagues. Appointees are encouraged to investigate their colleagues and map out who is aligned and who is not. Manipulation and blackmail are not mentioned explicitly but these methods do seem to imply those.Background checks and oversight go beyond just what you would expect for government jobs and have additional ideological components. Additionally, agencies can turn against their own employees. This means that appointees need to lay themselves completely bare in order to be part of this, as another example of making personal sacrifices. Again, the possibilities for blackmail, even for those who are ideologically aligned with them are there.It seems like from some snippets, especially those talking about Chevron deference, that some of these videos were made 2 years ago at the very least. Also because it talks about passing resolutions and actually making efforts in working on constructing and passing a budget, something the GOP has failed to do for a long time.They are clearly opposed to equity and instead want to focus on individual liberty and all the other rights described on the founding documents. They go as far as likening equity to factionalism.While notice and comment are requirements for passing regulations but loopholes have even been found in APA definitions that allow for internal agency rule to overwrite these requirements.In order to make litigation more difficult, injunction bonds are going to be imposed on new regulations. There are basically fees that need to be paid in order to litigate. These obviously make reversing new regulations or new rules overturning old ones much more costly and, therefore, more difficult.Now tell me with a straight face that this *is* what the US needs.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"Hulk Hogan has been ripping his shirts off since the 80's, so nothing new there.

His chief of staff (the person who runs the day to day operations of the White House), his secretaries of defense, state, and freaking transportation.I would suggest you listen to Kamala Harriss interview with Howard Stern to get a sense of her personality. She is warm, smart, strong, and funny. Look at a clip of her talking about making a turkey.

Sure, the most ethical clothing to own is clothing made in an ethical manner but Id say if budgeting is your concern it is clearly a viable, more ethical alternative to fast fashion. The other point Id make about buying secondhand is that it is reducing waste - most clothes that are donated to thrift stores were going to be disposed of regardless, so in purchasing them I am both keeping them out of a landfill; if a thrift store cant sell its stock it gets thrown out anyway, so that impact is direct. To your point about it being a pain, to each their own but I find it to be less of a pain than shopping retail. Im almost certainly spending the same amount of time in either store, because in either store most stuff is not going to be appealing to me. At a thrift store, the benefit of variety is that theres likely to be something that fits my interests and is affordable, and I personally have more fun looking through a diverse array of items. Theres always a chance that Im not going to find the particular thing I was looking for if I have a particular purpose in mind, but if I go to a mall thats also quite likely and then I have to go to 3 or 4 shops to find something that will work.","title":"cmv: there is no viable ethical alternative to fast fashion brands as of right now"},{"text":"To the matter of degree that your weak analogy is correct, yes","title":"Florida Democrat Blasts Republican Sen.

Harris, I read her platform when she released it as well. Haven't look at it again since, thought some was a bit vague, and she for sure doesn't represent all of my positions.The point I was trying to make isn't so much that Trump doesn't have any policy, it's that he doesn't talk about it and there's no conversation of policy. We can point to a few times lately where he's been asked specific questions and goes on some crazy tangents or talks about a global tariff. So it's more that he has little policy, and what he does have doesn't seem to matter.

Polls indicate the race between her and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, remains extremely tight and is likely to be decided by the smallest of margins in crucial battleground states.But while Obama has been rallying voters to turn out for Harris, some of his former aides have criticized the vice presidents campaign.Van Jones, who was once an adviser to Obama, said Harris campaign has gone from brat to flat since she entered the race in July, referring to the Democrat campaigns embrace of a social media trend inspired by pop singer Charlie XCXs Brat album over the summer.During a recent appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Jones suggested that Harris loss of momentum is partly because her campaign is now not as much fun.When Kamala was rising, she was fun, he said. Remember, it was the politics of joy, it was fun... and then we went from brat to flat and its just not as much fun.Jones, who served as an adviser on environmental innovation and green jobs in the Obama administration in 2009, also praised Trumps recent visit to a McDonalds location in Pennsylvania as a brilliant move.I think weve got to acknowledge that this guy is beating the pants off of us with these so-called publicity stunts, he said.It gets into everybodys feeds and people who are not looking at politics will look at that. I think we just have to be have more fun ourselves. We were having a great time during the Democratic convention. If we have more fun, if our, if the Democratic Party is a party of fun, people will join in. We should we should be doing crazy stuff, too.Newsweek has contacted the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email. Obamas office has also been contacted for comment via email.Jones comments came after David Axelrod, a former top aide to Obama, called out what he described as Harris habit of going to word salad city when answering questions.Axelrod, a CNN political commentator, said Harriss town hall with CNN on Wednesday had been a mixed night for the vice president.I think she was very strong coming out of the gate and she obviously came with a purpose, he said, adding that she was prepared to seize on comments by Trumps former chief of staff John Kelly that the Republican nominee meets the definition of a fascist and that Trump, while in office, suggested that Adolf Hitler did some good things.She was very strong, as she has been on abortion rights because she feels passionately about it. She can be clinical on some of these economic issues. She was great on the long-term care for the elderly, to help people.The things that would concern me is when she doesnt want to answer a question, her habit is to kind of go to word salad city, and she did that on a couple of answers.He said that Harris had responded to Anderson Coopers question about whether she would be stronger on Israel than Trump with a seven-minute answer, but none of it related to the question he was asking.He added: On certain questions like that, on immigration, I thought she missed an opportunity because she would acknowledge no concerns about any of the administrations policies, and thats a mistake. Sometimes you have to concede things, and she didnt concede much.Axelrod on Thursday addressed his criticism, saying that Harris is facing additional pressure since she only entered the race in July after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection.Shes in a more difficult position because she has basically had to introduce herself to the American people in 90 days (...) Her answers are being scrutinized more closely because people are looking for clues to who she is and where shes going, he said.","title":"Kamala Harris Criticized by Former Obama Aides: 'Brat to Flat'"},{"text":"I think these are being pushed as boogeymen deliberately to distract from the actual evil pricks behind the scenes.","title":"Why isn't the Left more anti-WEF?"},{"text":"It's what happens when you skip history class","title":"What's the difference between Lincoln and Trump?

I don't think we need to dread about it.  Trump did get more votes the 2nd time around and he may again. The key though is that Kamala has a lot of non-voters to convert. Trump has very, very little. This election is about momentum for Harris. Not assholes. She needs as many votes as we can to show the world USA is not totally lost. As the article says,  \\nWe undertook a new survey in September, and we asked the same questions and the positive responses doubled, almost across the board. Women feel more positively about their own futures, they feel more positively about the future of the country and they feel that although government doesnt work right now, it could in the future. That hope is crucial to engaging in civic participation.Don't worry about votes for Trump. Work towards getting Harris as many votes as we can. If she wins I guarantee she is going to ask her voters to back her up on important issues. She will call on public support to help make the daily lives of people better.   Trump is now +41 points among white men without college degrees, essentially matching his showing in this group in the 2020 ABC News exit poll, and also +41 points among rural voters.\\n \\n The shift toward Harris among likely voters relies in part on consolidated support among Democratic base groups, notably Black people and liberals. While Harris has a 70-point advantage among all Black people, that widens to 83 points among Black likely voters, 90-7%. Ninety-six percent of liberal likely voters support Harris, vs. 91% of liberals overall. Additionally, she goes from 53% support among all suburban women to 59% among those likely to vote. Trump, by contrast, doesn't see significant bumps in support among likely voters.","title":"Democrats see female ghost voters as best chance for Harris victory"},{"text":"Trump and Elon?

But imagine if every country did that.Is it, in fact, not Britain that was at fault for colonizing India, but France - rather, the Normans? After all, Britain was conquered by them, and in the end, that led them down the path of colonizing.If everybody keeps arguing with that, then there's no hope for the future. If people, *today*, don't create a better world for themselves, making excuses of past wrongs against them, then we're never gonna get anywhere. If we keep thinking like that, Germany and France would never be able to be allies because of how much damage they caused each other through the centuries.India is rife with castism and discrimination based on skin colour. Sure, those might have been amplified by the British - but the concept of caste predates the British colonization. India has shit labour laws, high corruption, high crime rate.Sure, we can argue that the British are at fault for that.

All you did in your example was bring in the aspect of class. I dont see the problem in not seeing the individual. Or to use the analogy: In a forest we do not have problems seeing trees. The problem lies in seeing the forest and how its interconnected. I agree with you that classism is an important aspect and it happens more than enough to recognize it. The fact of the matter is has your approach even made anything better? Your approach is currently the most popular one, and despite the insistence that its necessary to combat all these issues, has it really made anything better?No, my approach is not the most popular one. I LIVE in a leftist bubble and i would not say that over 50% are activly antiracist. And no consider how my leftists bubble is like 20% of the population in my country. So im really interested why you think that view is popular among the people? I can tell you that it made at least one thing better in my personal experience. Being active is important here.Maybe i can give you an example were i realized that its important to be conscious of my privilege and to use it activly. Lets say i see 2 people fighting. 1 is obviously stronger and has a small weapon. I also hear them say \\"fck you immigrants\\". So they are some ways of reacting to that. Obviously i should call help to stop the fight; no matter if racist or not. After that i could hide. I could also watch it and choose a safe distance. I could stay silent or say something. And lastly i could intervene myself or look for close people  first. THe interesting thin here is that the signal of my action can vary depending on how im identified as. If i have the same color as the oppressor and i just standby and watch, then the victim might think that im a collaborator. If i have the same color has the victim then the victim would more likly to see me part of their group. Same difference happens, when shouting something. Depending on how the oppressor will identify me, they will react differently. Obviously, being the same color as the oppressor won't make him friendly towards me, but if he is really racist then he will give less value towards people he is racist against. Also the victim will realize that not only people with the same color as the oppresor are bad. They will be able to diversify their view a little bit. Long story short. If i were simply to not think about race at all then i would not know about this information above. I would not be able to make an informed choice. I would be missing important aspects about the consequences of my actions. You don't have to agree with the exact consequences i described in the example. If you at least agree that there is value in creating more understanding, then i would say that there is at least some value in thinking critical about race. Sure there is hyperfixating and there is this benevolent racism and all the other forms that shoot over the goal or simply miss the goal completly. But that does not mean that we should throw away any progress we had. It just means that we should tell people the right way to be antiracist. Remember that i learned from my previous generation that \\"not seeing race\\" is not enough. Thats my experience. ANd hte next generation will find an even better way. Im sure of it. We should not fight to much against each other because then the real racists win! I see this as a process. I simply prepare the ground for the next step. We can't simply act as if we are at the end goal. We must stay in reality. And reality has racism in it.Its not enough to be not racist. You have to be openly antiracist and use all your power to help lift people up but only people with certain skin color. Like how do people not realize how gross this attitude is?Thats a bit of a misinterpretation of what it means to be antiracist.  its not about lifting up people. ITs about emancipation. I am not standing up for the others as if they are weak and useless. Thats just benevolent racism, but still racism. I am trying to include the attacked person into this and show them the posibility of active dissent. Also its about questioning some forms of humor and storytelling. YES humor has more freedom and yes there is legitimate discussion to be held about whats ok and whats not. And yes i dont have to annoy everyone of any slightest racist touch in their speech. Its about balance. Its about seeing racism were it is and acting in a way that is socially annoying enough to change the status quo but not too annoying so that people find it too much. Because in the end its about convincing people that being racist is not a character trait. Its ok to let go of old racists habits just as its ok to let go of old sexist habits. I hope i clarified it. And i hope you take this in good faith.Oh and in the end emancipating people will help everyone. Because then a more democratic way of living is possible. Just like ending sexism also helps men and not only women.   \\nSure, racial blindness may not be an immediate solution that magically fixes everything in record time. But I think if we brought up the next generation to just not focus on race altogether, in the long run it would make everything better. Hyperfixating on race is never going to make racism go away.What annoys me with that is that a racist would happily agree with you. This hyperfixation argument is something they created. And its such a sht move to simply tell a person that their view don't matter because they are to fixated or too sensible. \\"oh you don't like that i hit you?\\" \\"cmon don't be a pssy, you are to fixated on this negative stuff!\\". Thats what the bully says to the victim. Its not that bad, they say. You are imagining things, they say. Its all just an excuse to not take responsibility for your actions.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Johnson.I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, No, I already voted for these people, he said. Then, we have to explain to people, Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now youve got to go again.And youll probably have to go in December and do it one more time, he added.A post-election analysis of Ossoffs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoffs paid relational organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become community mobilizers  a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off, Ossoff continued.Ossoffs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor.

The US will always have two big tent parties along the left-right axis because this is the only way to secure enough electoral votes. For presidential elections at least. As far as I can see, the only in for a third party is if it eats into the electorates of both the Democratic and Republican parties. A leftist party as you mentioned would only meaningfully cannibalize the Democratic Party, but what platform could possibly peel off voters from the Republican Party as well? It would have to be a party platform that doesnt fit neatly into the current left-right axis of American politics. YIMBYism and anti-war/military intervention are the only policies right now that I see existing in that space, but public outcry over the war in Gaza would have to spread out much further from leftist spaces for this to turn into a viable third party platform in our elections. Im sure plenty of Republicans are anti-war or pro-Palestine but it is nowhere near being the issue that defines their votes.As for congressional elections, sure, a leftist party could probably pick up some seats in coastal states/urban areas. But they will not wield any kind of special power from this in the same way that Bernie Sanders does not wield special power as an independent senator. Their voters will still expect them to caucus with the Dems because nothing would get done in Congress otherwise.

But of course they didn't because the powers that be wanted to get rid of many of their Jews too.  They took the homeland of Palestinians and gave Zionist Jews (a movement that had begun long before WWII) a green light to genocide them.  And thinking the name meant anything is such a shallow view.  There was no way taking Palestine, part of whose land were the kingdoms of Israel and Judea back in the Bronze Age and part of the area their religious books told them was their promised land was not a religious act. The US and other countries specifically decided to start this religious conflict.Are you fucking kidding? Russia is ACTIVELY attempting to take over America from the insideYou're so far gone dude.

When people tell yourself to not compare yourself to others, they're talking about making yourself better, not about your valuation in the grand scheme of things in the world.The typical follow-up statement is \\"compare yourself to yourself instead.\\" Track your own growth. Measure your own capabilities, and keep measuring them. Gamify your life and your skills. Reward yourself not for competing with others, but for being a better you.Ultimately, it won't matter if you can run as fast as an olympic medalist, or if you're the most productive person at your place of work. What matters is if you are better than you were last week, or last month, or last year.True depression comes from stagnation - we were not meant to tread the same paths over and over, and not meant to dwell on thinking we were so much better when we were younger or fitter. We are meant to grow, but if you only ever spend your time focusing on those who are better than you, you do not grow. Instead, you always feel inferior.We also tend to only see the successes of other people and not their failures. We don't see what's left on the cutting room floor of people's lives. We don't see the times they said the wrong thing, or did something dumb. We see our own failures and magnify them, but we also see other people's successes in isolation from their failures.Let other people make those comparisons that you talk about, but for you, if you want to grow, you should not make that your focus. You should want to be better, to grow more, rather than just appearing to have done so in other people's eyes.","title":"CMV: Saying you shouldnt compare yourself doesnt feel like it makes sense"},{"text":"Yeah absolutely pathetic joke to make .

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. **If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.**Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.\\"Max Ehrmann","title":"CMV: Saying you shouldnt compare yourself doesnt feel like it makes sense"},{"text":"[Guy who's played Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain] wow it's just like how Venom Snake didn't make out with Ocelot","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its Kamalover","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[Guy who supports the CHIPS Act to support farmers](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/economie-social/budget-2025-les-deputes-votent-un-amendement-en-faveur-des-fabricants-francais-de-chips_AD-202410260177.html)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Im already on so many meds lol","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Free men and free women are not socially compatible with serfs, sycophants, sovrans.","title":"Theyre totally unhinged realizing the end is near"},{"text":"All they ever had was personal attacks.","title":"I think the left is realizing that their sham is coming to an end."},{"text":"Have you tried Zoloft","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/qtxj3mnbzgxd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=370d0b634b7a48bb5150e49346f30482505632b7","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Censorship.","title":"Why is Reddit predominantly liberal?"},{"text":"They have not fucked their own future.

You're gonna have wins and losses, but dwelling on the losses just makes you bitter. For example, in my work I write grants that are very competitive. Acceptance rates go from 10-50%. If I made a big deal of every time I didn't get a grant, I'd literally never get anywhere. I just recognize that lots of very good people are also applying, that at some point the selection process takes on some randomness because it depends on who's sitting on the committee, what they're looking for specifically, etc, and I don't worry about it.

The problem is assuming there is a certain \\"best\\" way for a person to be and you need to put yourself on the scale of who is closer to this \\"best\\" than you are and who is further away.People are different and being the best possible version of yourself will look different for everyone. Yes, schools pick candidates based on their academic performance and some people perform better academically than others. But those who perform worse academically aren't therefore worse altogether. They could be better artists, better athletes, have better relationships and so on. Yes, jobs pick a candidate based on their qualifications to perform the job. But just because you don't have the same qualifications as some else doesn't mean you're worse than them in general.Comparing yourself in the sense that you're a professional swimmer and aspire to beat the best score at swimming, so you need to know what the best score is and how the person currently holding it got there makes sense. Basing your whole worth as a person on this comparison is detrimental. Maybe you won't be able to beat that score and be forever a worse swimmer, but a much better painter, or father, or runner, or altogether a more decent and happier person, and then what does it matter that you're not the best swimmer?People have many traits, talents, and social roles. You can excel at some of them, be mediocre at others, and fail miserably at some. Creating one universal scale to determine the ultimate value of a person is impossible and stupid. So comparison itself is ok. What you use that comparison for is what this advice cautions against.","title":"CMV: Saying you shouldnt compare yourself doesnt feel like it makes sense"},{"text":"Also Republicans: \\"Why does everyone keep calling us racists?\\"","title":"Trump loyalists spew racist, vulgar attacks at Harris and Democrats at New York City rally | CNN Politics"},{"text":"Rumor has it that the Trump team is flying down to Puerto Rico where Trump will throw out paper towels and bibles in a last ditch effort to win back the Puerto Rican community.","title":"Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin Boost Kamala Harris After Trump Rally Speaker Bashes Puerto Rico as a Floating Island of Garbage"},{"text":"Wow...

Be it because of inherent advantages, experience, or any other factor you can think of. Comparing yourself to those people is most likely going to end up with you quitting your goals because you feel like you can't ever catch up.This is a disservice to both yourself as to society. You don't have to be better or on par with someone else to excel at the things you want to do. And society does have a repugnant standard of comparing people to one another, i agree there. When people tell you that you shouldn't compare yourself to others, it's not to **disallow** you to do so, they're quite literally looking out for you in the most empathetic way. They're saying, pursue your interests for **you**, not because you feel the need to be better than other people at it.This isn't to say that you can't use these people to **inspire** you, i've got my fair share of heroes and idols as well that drive me to pursue whatever they excel at. But i NEVER compare myself to them. I realise they're ahead of me, but if i were to compare myself to them i'd unrealistically be putting myself in competition with them, which isn't my goal and would likely drive me to quit eventually.

I think well see a larger amount of Gen Z than people expect. A few major things have happened to shift our sentiment in the past five years:1) Covid: its response by corporations and the government2) George Floyd Protests: the 2020 protests showed how corrupt our judicial system is3) Inflation: self-explanatory4) Job Market: one of the key points that sticks in my mind is the chair of the Federal Reserve saying they were going to raise rates not because of inflation, but because workers have too much power in the job market. Jerome Powell intentionally raised rates to curb the job market, because workers were beginning to have negotiating and bargaining power, and he stripped that away from us, and put us back into the worst job market weve had in a decade or more for younger people.5) Climate: self-explanatory. I no longer get frost on my windshield in winter or have to scrape bugs off my car on road trips. Its almost November and there are still red wasps in huge numbers outside my apartment when they shouldve died out by now. 6) Fascism/Project 2025: there were no talks about fascism, project 2025, or references to Nazis the last two times Trump ran. This time, its a lot more apparent and scary. 7) Kamala policy proposals: Trump wants to raise my taxes, and Kamala wants to find ways to solve the housing crisis and make it easier to open small businesses, pretty easy to pick one over the other.8) Trump Indictments: it was all fun and games when Trump ran in 2016, he was the change candidate and no one expected him to turn into modern Hitler. But now, more and more reports of him being an espionage agent groomed by Russia are coming out and his ties to corruption are more blatant than ever. Add on top of that his financial allegations and sexual convictions and the veil of the genius businessman Trump portrays has been pierced and replaced by an honest version.9) Mental decline: Trump (and Biden to an extent) have rapidly accelerated their mental decline and it is extremely apparent to anyone watching. Anyone saying otherwise is just refuting the evidence based on confirmation bias.10) School shootings/Gun violence: have ramped up in volume and publicity.There are a number of inciting factors that have ramped up in the past five years to both show younger generations how powerless they are, and how manipulated they are by the corrupt system they live in. The younger generation right now feels manipulated, attacked, abused, scammed, and angry. Weve lived through 9/11, Iraq/Afghanistan, 2008 recession, Covid, hyper-inflation, the rise of modern neo-fascism, and hyper-acceleration of climate change. Our childhood, teenage years, and future years were promised to us with lies, and stolen from us in retribution for existing compliantly. The 2020 protests showed us our voice does have power. Covid lockdown showed up life doesnt have to exist in a 9-5 cubicle. The 2021-2022 job market showed us we do have individual bargaining power. People can speculate however they want about my generation, but I know on November 4th I am doing my part to give my children a future and prevent a fascist takeover of America. There are no safeguards. No one is storming the beaches of Normandy to save us. We are the greatest example of freedom in the world, and we have seen that slowly stripped from us in the past 30 years by a group of people indoctrinated through culture wars, propaganda, and misinformation.

The election is not an actual coin flip that could go either way, it's just that the actual result will be too close for the ability of polling and modeling to predict it.If you Groundhog Day November 5, it will always have the same result. That's why the modelers' saying 'well, this is a coin flip, and there's nothing we can do about it\\" is frustrating. The information is out there, and you should modify your methodology to get a better result.If you think your models giving win probabilities of 45-55 and 55-45 are basically the exact same thing, then stop publishing the number that granularly!

He was *reputedly* THE top expert in communicable diseases in the USA, if not the world. No doubt Trump's staff and advisors told him that Fauci was the *\\"go-to guy\\"* for advice on handling a contagion that was *predicted* to cause a disastrously high number of casualties.Like his predecessors (Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.), Trump was no medical expert, so he did what executives are expected to do in crisis situations: Call on those who ARE experts -- and as far as Trump knew, Fauci was \\"that guy\\".Are you suggesting that Trump knew that Fauci was not only a fraud, but that he had colluded in the creation of COVID and in the cover-up of the underlying scandal? Because if Trump DID know, then he has some serious dirt on his hands -- but otherwise, it appears that he was doing what *he believed* to be in the best interest of the country, no?That said, Fauci's history was NOT without scandal -- most famously WRT his [botched handling of the AIDS crisis \\\\(AZT, etc.\\\\)](https://archive.is/AcUiH) -- but that was not exactly common knowledge in 2020, and any insider or medical professional who tried to raise alarm about Fauci's integrity was CENSORED AND SILENCED by the MSM and on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and on (most of) Reddit, all of which were hanging on every utterance of Fauci, and marching in lockstep to PUSH his \\"suggestions\\" -- however far-fetched (the clown would not even acknowledge that COVID was spread AIRBORNE until the summer of 2020 -- *\\"wash your hands!\\"*)Okay, but the \\"Captain\\" is ultimately responsible for the fate of the \\"ship\\", right? So if you want to lambast Trump for unwittily relying on faulty advice from malevolent advisers, THAT'S FINE. **FUCK TRUMP!!!**Then came the election -- and the Biden Regime took office -- and it was not long after when people began to awaken, *in large numbers*, to the insanity of the dictates pronounced by Fauci, the CDC, the WHO, and others -- *especially* the recklessly rushed and novel \\"vaccine\\" that was being PUSHED on the public, worldwide, when it had NOT undergone any proper clinical trials - and those that WERE conducted were FRAUDULENT.Who was the \\"Captain\\" of the \\"ship\\" at THAT time Biden. You said above that Trump SHOULD have fired Fauci, and in hindsight, you surely have a point -- but if it was clear that Fraudci should have been shit-canned by Trump, why was it not all the MORE clear under Biden? Especially because during Biden-Harris, we learned that Fauci and his associates were DEEPLY involved in the (banned) **Gain of Function Research** being carried out at the very Wuhan Lab where COVID-19 was created, and from which it leaked.We also learned that Fauci knew VERY early on EXACTLY what the virus was, AND that he either threatened or bribed researchers who discovered the Gain of Function \\"fingerprints\\" to keep their mouths shut -- and concoct a wild tale a about \\"bat soup\\" in Chinese \\"wet markets\\", or perhaps promiscuous pangolins  POPPYCOCK!The whole scandal, from the illegal Gain of Function research to the farcical lock-downs *and especially* the reckless and risky mRNA \\"vaccines\\" runs SO deep, and is SO widespread across the globe that it is scarcely fathomable -- even as more ugly details about long-term side effects from the FrankenVirus itself, the so-called \\"vaccines\\" AND the secretive no-fault non-disclosure CONTRACTS by and between Pfyzzer, McDerna and national governments across the globe continue to ooze out.**Trump is an asshat**, and the fact that he not only refuses to ADMIT his misjudgment in early countermeasures *and especially Operation Warp Speed* shows a SERIOUS character flaw: If you fuck up, you had damn well better OWN your fuck-ups -- because otherwise, your misjudgments and mistakes morph into mendacious malfeasance - and THAT is a far more serious betrayal of the Public Trust than simply relying on those who you *believed* to be qualified, capable, honest and honorable (and Fauci was NOT).The fact that Trump has not \\"owned\\" his fuck-ups is damning; and has resulted in a loss of confidence in many that would otherwise support him -- too fucking bad. Unfortunately, Harris can muster NO bragging rights -- the same bottom-dwelling \\"swamp creatures\\" that infested NAID, the CDC, the FDA, etc. under Trump are STILL THERE TODAY -- the only things that have changed are the \\"action figures\\" who sit at the heads of the agencies. IMO, there *may* be some glimmer of hope for some measure of reform IF someone like RFK Jr. manages to gain control of the National Institutes of Health, but that would require not only a Trump win, but overcoming the fierce resistance from the Corporate Overlords that have long controlled these agencies via their game of Regulatory Capture.Of course, the health fiasco is only ONE of MANY monstrous challenges that the USA and the world are facing as we enter the treacherous and dire straits of the coming years.Interesting time to be alive, eh?","title":"Do you guys remember when Harris/Biden fired Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and Pilots for refusing to take the COVID Vaccine?"},{"text":"Bro how are you going to put conditions on speech during a discussion.
