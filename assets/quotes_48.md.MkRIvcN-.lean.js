Now, both Collins and Crockett are essentially giving the same message. The problem is that it's very open to being perceived in two completely different ways:1. By engaging in actions contrary to the ultimate good of their class/ethnic group, they're mirroring the structural dynamics of slavery (what I think they're they're *trying* to say).2. By engaging in actions contrary to the ultimate good of their ethnic group, they're acting like slaves (how it ultimately comes off).If the previous groups in question are so infused with anti-Black racism, then they'll likely see interpretation 2 as a huge affront i.e. it's putting them at the level of American chattel slaves, who were overwhelmingly Black. *This* is what caused Alison Collins to be deposed, the Asian-American voters of San Francisco took her calling them \\"house nrs\\" at face value rather than looking for any nuance regarding systematic racism.","title":"Rep.

Part of the disease of the leadership vacuum is that personal ambition takes precedence over unity of message. There were at least half a dozen presidential hopefuls in Beverly Hills, if not more. The 2028 nominee will not be decided for some time, and those in the midst of that power struggle are less interested in how the Democrats should face their near-term challenges and more focused on how the Democrats should anoint them.","title":"What We Have Here Is a Rudderless Ship | Thoughts on the Democratic post-election drift"},{"text":"H-1B immigrants compete in the same labor market as native-born college graduates.","title":"Joe Biden administration unveils new H-1B visa regulations"},{"text":"They always avoided linking a usual person with unusual deeds.

But if the Liberal Party is prepared to be bold and innovative, an incredible opportunity is staring it in the face. Seizing this opportunity will first require the Prime Minister to recognize that his time is up. Canadians have decided that after ten years they want a new Prime Minister. There is no time to waste and Mr. Trudeau needs to announce this week that he will resign as Prime Minister effective January 6.Second, the Liberal Partys executive must recognize that we are not living in normal political times. In normal times, a Prime Minister would announce his or her retirement to take effect after a leadership convention. This usually takes three to four months. Given the precariousness of the governments position in the House of Commons and given that it is only a month before the Trump administration takes office, three to four months is too long to wait. The Liberal Party executive must therefore be innovative and announce that the caucus and the Cabinet will choose a new Prime Minister effective January 6, and that given the national and international situation today, there will be no normal leadership convention until after the next election. If the new Prime Minister is elected, the convention will be a formality. If he or she is defeated, then there will be a real contest. Third, Cabinet and the Liberal Caucus must grasp its responsibility to choose a new party leader and Prime Minister who is best placed to lead a government in which Canadians will have confidence. They have to do this in the next two weeks. [][LeBlanc and Champagne] might be safe choices [for PM]. But this is not the time for safe choices. The political situation in Canada since the resignation of Chrystia Freeland yesterday is qualitatively different than what it was a week ago. As former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan famously said - a week is a long time in politics. This is the time to do something unexpected and out of the ordinary that would capture the imagination and support of Canadians. That would be for Cabinet and caucus to actually reflect on how Chrystia Freeland has been received across the country in the last few days. Since Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation from Cabinet, she has been recognized across the spectrum for her courage in distancing herself from Mr. Trudeau and some of his policies. [] Imagine an election where the choice is who is best placed to negotiate with Donald Trump - Chrystia Freeland or Pierre Poilievre.Then recognizing that collectively the G7 and the G20 will have to determine how to deal with President Trump, another question in an election would be who would be better placed to champion Canadas interests, Chrystia Freeland who has attended all G7 and G20 meetings for many years and knows all the players or Mr. Poilievre?Then a further election question might be who better positioned to influence the future of Ukraine - Chrystia Freeland with her deep connections to Ukraine or Mr. Poilievre?In terms of domestic policy, we now know that Chrystia Freeland, independent of Mr. Trudeau and with her global economic credentials, does not buy into gimmicks or the type of catchy slogans which is largely all Canadians are getting today from Pierre Poilievre. For these reasons and more, Cabinet and the Liberal caucus should seriously consider taking a step no one would have even thought about last week. Drafting Chrystia Freeland in the next two weeks is the bold and innovative choice that could turn todays crisis into opportunity. Many Canadians today are prepared to vote for Pierre Poilievre, not necessarily because they like him or want him but largely because he is an antidote to Justin Trudeau. For Canadians who want neither Mr. Trudeau nor Mr. Poilievre, a Freeland-led government might strike an ideal balance. Unquestionably, the results of the next federal election would be very different than they would be if Mr. Trudeau remained as Liberal leader. It is up to the Liberal cabinet and the broader caucus to have the courage to seize the opportunity, and I sincerely hope that they do.!ping Can","title":"Crisis or Opportunity for the Liberal Government?

If the US eliminated the Electoral College, the president wouldn't be decided by any states at all.  Instead, it would be decided by individuals.  The biggest problem with the Electoral College is that voters who are political minorities in their states are disenfranchised.  So that means that the 6M Californians who voted for Trump didn't have a voice (nor of course did the 4.8M Texans who voted for Harris).  And people in states that are solidly \\"red\\" or \\"blue\\" get little attention during the campaign season --- instead all the focus is on the so-called \\"battleground\\" states: each individual voter in PA is much more important to the election than a voter in Vermont or North Dakota.Eliminating the Electoral College would mean that each voter across the US would have exactly the same impact on the election.  While naysayers might claim that this would cause voters in a few states to have an outsized impact on the election, that's already what's happening now...the difference is that currently voters in most states have very little impact in choosing the president.Now that's not to say that there aren't potential issues with direct election of the President.  Just look at how long some states like CA took to officially publish their vote totals; we wouldn't want individual states to be able to delay a nationwide process.

Just like many GOP reps today came into power primarying establishment GOP politicians during the tea party movement as a reaction to Obama. The difference is that the tea party took over the republican party and republicans allowed it to happen, and went with the sea change. Dems would rather minimize and brow beat those engaged in the sea change than learn what the changing seas say about their electorate. They would rather lose every single election than let the party become more progressive. Even when someone like AOC abandons principles and lies for them, they still shower her in piss because they don't even want to risk the party shifting to the left one fucking iota.

The reason is that Pelosi, and the democratic establishment, would prefer for Trump (or someone like him) to be president than for AOC, or Bernie, or someone like them to be president. Their primary loyality is to economic class, not to political party.

Example would be Pelosi being against Congressional stock trading bans when we all know she makes bank through her husband's trading on knowledge she gives him. They shut down any movement that threatens their power and control. We saw exactly how that worked out for Hilary Clinton in 2016.

Sanders was catching up so fast, it was very clear to those of us who were that he was going to pass her. That's when the 1% put their thumb on the election with that despicable pledged delegates fiasco. That's why their hand-picked corporatist stooge won.Even more despicably, in 2020, Joe Biden was in LAST PLACE. Sanders had won Nevada (a state Dems needed to win in the general) and was running away with California. That's when Clyburn was bought off with a change in the primary calendar and handed a meaningless (in the general) state to Biden, giving him his first ever primary win...in a state that the GOP was going to win in the general, so it was utterly meaningless.At that precise moment, the last place primary candidate was touted in unison by ALL of the tabloid corporate networks (owned by the same 1%, of course) declared Biden the obvious nominee to beat...a full week before Super Tuesday. Day after day they had the DNC loyal drop out and endorse Biden...again by winning a meaningless shithole red state and day after day stooges like Carville went on MSNBC and LIED (with GOP talking points verbatim!) about Sanders.Sanders got sandbagged by the establishment again.And this election, the 1% had Biden step down because of his disastrous debate. This time, within 24 hours they picked a corporatist stooge, a 2020 primary candidate who had done even WORSE than Biden(!), and told us she was the nominee. And, again, all the DNC loyalists (who had seen what happened in 2020), fell in line.No quick primary. No debates. No brokered convention.The 1% chose someone from Biden's own administration, tainted in the eyes of the voters during a CHANGE election, to represent their interests, not ours. So, *of course* voters didn't show up for her. Duh.The 1% will do anything to keep progressives from gaining power, because that would risk their tax cuts and loopholes.What I am telling you is that all of this is about THEIR money, not our nation.

Critics, both in Europe and abroad, warn of economic coercion, retaliation by Beijing and the risks of deepening Chinas market influence in Europe.\\nBut these concerns miss the point. The policy is neither capitulation nor gamble; it is a calculated response to the realities of the global competitive landscape for electric vehicles.\\nThe EUs requirements will align Chinese and European interests in ways that could redefine green ambitions. It is a strategy that the US, stuck in its obsession with tariffs and decoupling, should emulate.\\nBy tying subsidies to technology transfers and local production requirements, Brussels ensures that Chinese companies contribute to the EUs industrial base rather than merely exporting batteries. This approach mirrors other global trade practices. The US Inflation Reduction Act, for example, ties clean energy subsidies to domestic content.\\nThe EUs policy leverages the strength of Chinas leadership in battery technology and production. Chinese industry insiders view it as an opportunity to deepen integration into European markets. By transferring technology and establishing local production, Chinese battery companies can secure access to critical resources in a region less prone to geopolitical tensions than the US.\\nTariffs, by contrast, have done little to achieve their intended goals. They lead to workarounds, provoke retaliation and disrupt supply chains without addressing underlying industrial challenges. Europe is focusing on strategic inclusion rather than exclusion, fostering mutual benefits.\\nEuropean EV makers need Chinese batteries. Look at the problems faced by Northvolt, Europes homegrown battery champion. Despite billions in funding and high-profile contracts, the Swedish company has struggled to scale up, facing operational hurdles and cost overruns. It has now filed for bankruptcy. Chinese companies, by contrast, dominate not just battery production but the entire ecosystem  cathodes, anodes, electrolytes and logistics. Europe will struggle to replicate these capabilities.\\nThe EUs tech transfer policy addresses this gap and will develop a resilient, domestically anchored Chinese battery industry. It also minimises the growing pains that come with starting from scratch. And it will position Europe to navigate a fraught global trade environment.\\nThis strategy should also avoid internal EU divisions. Spain partners with Chinese companies on EVs, while France leans towards protectionism. The tech transfer policy aligns national and collective interests, creating a framework to share benefits equitably.\\nThe US should take note. Its reliance on tariffs and the rhetoric of decoupling is more about posturing than progress. Restricting imports from China in the hope that domestic industries will flourish has not delivered. Instead, tariffs disrupt supply chains, drive up consumer costs and spur Chinese companies to adapt. Suppliers reroute exports through third countries, expand into alternative markets and continue innovating faster than their western counterparts.\\nRather than shutting China out, the US should engage more strategically. Decoupling risks pushing China and Europe closer together. Beijing is already courting Brussels as a counterweight to US protectionism. Policies such as the EUs tech transfer requirements deepen these ties.\\nThe US does not need to abandon its concerns about China but it should rethink its approach. By adopting a version of the EUs policy and tying market access to technology transfers and local production, America could ensure Chinese companies contribute to its growth while mitigating overreliance on imports.\\nShifting the narrative around trade and industrial policy is crucial. Tariffs are politically expedient but economically flawed. A strategy combining engagement with strategic safeguards might be more difficult to explain to the public but it will be far more effective in practice.\\nNeither the US nor Europe can afford to fall behind in the green technology race. The stakes are immense and the competition is unrelenting. By embracing a pragmatic framework, the west can position itself as an active architect of the clean-energy future.\\nPragmatism is not weakness. Deals signal serious intent to secure a place in the green economy and ensure that Beijing does not have the final word.","title":"Europes demand for Chinese tech transfers beats tariffs: Linking subsidies to intellectual property is the sort of strategic inclusion that fosters mutual benefits"},{"text":"Two key things I try to keep in mind when things look bad:1) Feeling upset or anxious about whats coming is natural, but at a certain point, if you actually DO want to work for positive change, you ought to pull away from the doomiest big-picture hypotheticals and focus on specific ways to resist/fight certain things that may happen. Some can be countered in the courts (see: Marc Elias), some can be countered electorally (yes, there WILL continue to be elections, but even if that were an uncertain thing, wed have to proceed as if there would be, what other choice do we have?), a lot can be countered at the state level, etc. People who do this arent sticking their heads in the sand and pretending everything will just work out on its own, they recognize the fight ahead and the hard work it will take.2) I hate to say it, but misinformation about how the government works can be found all along the political spectrum, not just on the right. At least some of the people dooming the hardest are doing so over things that would have an extremely low chance of happening even if the incoming administration was very competent and strongly ideologically unified (it isnt). One of the bigger examples of this is the dooming over the lunatic fringe that wants to get rid of the 19th amendment. Its kind of surprising how many left-leaning people Ive seen comment on this who dont appear to be aware that getting rid of a constitutional amendment requires passage of *another* constitutional amendment (remember how we got rid of Prohibition?), which is just about impossible in the current political environment. And, IMO, fretting over this distracts activist-minded people from the myriad other ways that the GOP is ALREADY disenfranchising voters, and what can be done to fight those. And that comes back to focusing on individual battles: educate yourself about the actual political/legal feasibility of something that Trump *says* he wants to do (he certainly does say a lot of things, and a lot of them are things he cant just unilaterally do, because he doesnt really know how the government works either), and prepare to fight it accordingly should the government try to make it happen.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 17, 2024"},{"text":"Mr Bowman, you lost an election.","title":"Jamaal Bowman sees his exit as a political lynching"},{"text":"Nice edit job on your comment.","title":"Kamala Harris is reportedly eyeing another White House run.

Conservatives don't believe women are less than men. Do you seriously believe that conservative women think this?? Traditional roles are not about being \\"less than\\" anything.

Jesus prioritized helping the poor and vulnerable.So do Christian conservatives! But they prefer private charity vs the govt taking over. A core conservative belief is personal accountabilityTrue, but that doesn't mean charity doesn't have its place. But you have to start with personal accountability. Jesus didn't let people off the hook for their actions. Caring for others overrules strict adherence to rules.I think most Christian conservatives agree with this in principle. I think everyone agrees with this except in extreme situations, and the disagreement comes with how far you want to stretch this, depending on the context. Conservatives often focus on rules (e.g., opposing abortion, strict immigration policies) at the expense of compassion.In the case of abortion, if you believe it's murder of a human, then the compassion should toward saving the child, should it not? Illegal immigration is actually a better example of your point. I think most conservatives wouldn't care about illegal immigration if the level was low.

In fact he amplified them. He moved from adultery is wrong to thinking about someone you're not married to with lust is adultery. And when he encountered people who were living in such a way that they sinned routinely, he did not tell them that they were born that way and excuse it, he said go and sin no more. Of course, he also declared that all sins could be forgiven if one repented. That means turning from sin and throwing oneself on the mercy of God. Whereas progressivism refuses to accept that sin is sin. It attempts to change the Bible or throw out the whole thing so that sin is no longer sin, it's just an alternate lifestyle. Second, Christianity is predicated on the concept of free will and choice. It starts with everyone being free to act according to their conscience. Progressivism starts with the idea that the wise know what is best for all and will use social policy, legal policy, and economic policy to force people to do the \\"correct\\" thing... Which because it is decided by the wise, is a constantly moving target. So there is no true freedom in progressivism: there is only submission to the authorities, who make decisions based on what makes them feel good, or builds their own power. This is antithetical to a religion which only acknowledges one authority: God.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"I swear my plan wasnt to flee power or anything","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If you wanna know why I am the way that I amWe dont watch Christmas movies over the holidays.

Heres the wiki for the [Trinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) if you want. Fun fact: Mormons/Latter Day Saints also dont believe Jesus is God, and a lot of Christians dont consider Mormons to be Christian because they dont believe in the Trinity.I dont know if the redditors are good sources on theogy. But since the Catholic church is more hierarchical it at least has some official doctrine laid out and written down. So do a lot of churches though.Heres an excerpt from the Bible that gets read during some church marriage ceremonies. Definitely not aligned with gender equality, but it does focus on mutuality. I dont think it conflicts with OPs examples of strong women in the Bible at all. It aligns more with conservatives than progressives, so I think OP is way off. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church for we are members of his body. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mysterybut I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. Ephesians 5:21-33Edit: Just wanted to add that there is frequent imagery in the Bible about the Church being the bride of Jesus. Also the church being the body of Christ. The relationship between Christ and the Church are compared with these metaphors a lot.

I lost friends to either COVID or other illness due to the strained hospital system, had an extended period of unemployment, nearly went broke 2-3 times. The life I planned and expected to live for myself went to absolute hell in many ways. I lost a major relationship due to the collapse of their mental health and the toxicity of social media and the culture wars.Yet the irony is by just persevering on and 'not' giving up things didn't just get better, they got a lot better. I try not to talk much about my IRL here, but for the past 2 and a half years I've worked to establish myself in a dream industry bit by bit, doing things I deeply care about, and I only got to do this because I didn't give up and worked to survive even when times were tough.Am I discouraged by the outcome of this election, concerned for the future, and genuinely questioning the value of democracy itself even? Yes and Yes, and even to the last one... yes at least a bit.But in truth I've learned a lot more about how to survive because of the events of the past few years. I've learned more about what I can tolerate and what I can't. I've learned how to stretch my funds when necessary, and what to prioritize when I must spend, and I've learned a lot more about what I care about and how to advocate for myself wherever possible.I've learned that I'm a survivor, and that there are people I can still find community with no matter what Trumpism tries to do. I've learned that I am simultaneously a person who can make a difference, yet still too small for MAGA's ego to care about and I can disappear just as quickly when I need to, and help others do so too. I survived a life surrounded by conservatism in the 90s and 2000s. I know how these people think and operate, even when I disagree. I know how to get through this, at least as much as anyone can.So I'm walking away from the rest of reddit and even most of political social media if that's all it has to offer. Endless doom is worthless hyperbole. It helps no one survive or adapt in a crisis. It at best serves as an outlet to vent and mourn, at worst is literally itself a tool of oppression to control how you think and steal your own happiness and productivity, even if there can only be so much of it to find at one given time.We'll survive until we can't. And if your number does come up? Then you did what you could amidst a world that was never going to be fully fair in the first place, that was always imperfect. Strive to make a positive impact with the time you have. Help people at the local level. Acknowledge your fears, but then keep going anyway. Protect yourself, but don't give up on empathy when you do.And when the time comes, pick your battles. Despite all the hyperbole, a full on civil war isn't what's coming. Everything Trump and MAGA say they want to do are extremely hard to implement long term, and even the conservative SCOTUS has limits to what they can pull off. Practically no one actually wants Christian Nationalism in a practical sense, but they all live in fear and have not yet learned how to manage that. If it gets chaotic for a bit, so be it, but balkanization or civil war is not the end result we're likely to see here. There is no clear territorial dispute by which to define it.Find your communities, anywhere you can.

Now the Israelites were so caught up in taking the teachings at face value they missed what the Temple Rituals were all about, and ultimately they missed the coming of their MessiahSometimes we (Christians) do the same with old testament teachings, we say \\"ohh this was for the Jews (Israelites basically, but that's another topic)\\" but we completely miss the principle behind it..A beautiful example is Leviticus 11. God lists clean and unclean foods, now you will say \\"well that was for spiritual reasons\\"..and i say fair, but if you look at the animals that aren't meant to be eaten, they're not just spiritually unclean (which i dont believe), but they are very unclean even in terms of health..so if it's a law just for Israelites, does that mean then everyone that isn't an Israelite has a better immune system and spirit and can eat these animals and not be defiled?..of course not..now people will always quote what Jesus said \\"what goes in doesn't defile a man, but what comes out\\"..that verse is used in the wrong sense but that's a discussion for another  day..My point is, we should not focus toooo much on the teaching, but rather the principle..but we must also keep in mind the context it was said under.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"Because Pelosi is 1000% the archetypical Dem that gives  everyone the impression they'd fight on every hilltop for minority and gender/orientation rights while pointedly ignoring the billionares eating the Middle Class for dinner.

They are able to reanimate the bodies if they're fresh, i don't think they can if they've been dead for a long time or in the ground for a while, but i think there's about a 1 week window that they still can.I wouldn't advise killing yourself though obviously.I'm not sure what they looked like, they were always wearing human skin when i saw them, although it was sort of loose and they would walk upright like humans, but they could run faster than any human, and even faster on all 4's, even the child sized ones were stronger than any human, there was no way to kill any of them either, i don't mean that figuratively, i mean literally in my entire time i had not seen a single one die.They had a weird sort of glow to them though, like you could see under the skin where they had glowing machinery or augmented bodyparts or something that were part of them, and some of them the heads didn't look right because you could see the human's skin on them but you could see 4 or 5 glowing white eyes under the skin.the only way to survive was either run, which wasn't advisable because they WILL catch you on foot, or hide until they leave, but even that wasn't too good because they were extremely quiet and would just sit there and wait outside of doors silently until people open them and then they would take them, the only people who really survived were the ones who had already gotten to the middle of nowhere when the nuclear war went down, or those who had basically given away their own as bait to lure them away while they escaped.I would not doubt for a second that by the end of the 72 years there were probably only a few hundred thousand people left on earth, if even that many. My scanner isn't working so i can't upload anything i've drawn about this stuff without it being shit-tier quality but from what i can tell, their technology is compartmentalized, as in they have several tiers/hierarchies of technology, whether this is due to them being an amalgam of civilizations or not is unknown to me, but i think it might be a similar reason to just not wanting us to get their technology, i'm pretty sure the hand scanner was theirs, but i was based off existing human technology, or maybe human technology was based off of it? i'm not sure.Most of their other stuff was absolutely useless to us though, there was no way for us to use it, somehow with these portals being open they were siphoning some kind of energy that powered the ships completely different from electricity, although I'm not sure they even needed the portals tbqh.without this energy the pieces of their ships were literally nothing more than useless common metals/alloys, they somehow underwent some kind of rapid breakdown without the energy source, i don't remember how the portals closed or how the ships were destroyed, i was in the middle of nowhere at the time, i'm almost certain (90% anyways) that they're some kind of scavenger civilization, they wait for civilizations to wipe themselves out and then it's like it's some kind of cosmic law that for the most part everyone is allowed to pick through the remains, which i think is what happened after the nuclear war, and i think someone didn't like this and kicked them out, but not before they damaged the sun as a final \\"Fuck you\\" to humans and whoever helped them.As i said though it was not fun, there was something left behind, i don't think it was 'them' though, i think it was something else, it was something in the long dark that would eat people, they didn't glow and i never saw them, i just knew not to ever show any light at nighttime ever, and when it was night we slept underground (part 2 in a second Part 2:We slept underground under the house in case the things in the dark came inside and found us, i think they were little more than animals, maybe something 'they' left behind, but i don't know.I don't even know if the long dark was permanent or not, as that's when the dream ended, the sun was dying, it was also possible in addition to this that it was nighttime as it was that the sun had died or that 'they' had moved an object in front of it to obfuscate the earth, or maybe it was residual atmospheric debris from the nuclear war and everything else that had happened, i know for a fact that something did happen to the sun though so it could've been a compounded mixture of these events.In addition to this, i remember one time during this dream ( a different occasion) where i had gotten onto one of the ships somehow, and i saw what happened to the people who were taken, they were intubated in their back and varying bodyparts, not too much unlike the matrix, however there were far more cables and other mechanisms that i have no idea what they were, but if you died then these devices let them bring you back, and most of the people attatched to these devices were spliced open with organs showing or missing entire pieces of their bodies, there were a few people who weren't much more than heads with gore sticking out of the bottom, but they were still intubated and kept alive and mostly just screamed, the inside of the ships was the same slate grayish color but there were colors made of energy, perhaps as electronic interface panels of some sort but probably not, it wasn't pretty colors though, just varying shades of white/yellow/light light blue-ish.it was very basic too, none of that H.R. geiger alien style, the ships were very utilitarian in design on the inside, everything served a purpose and only that purpose, no decoration whatsoever. \\"","title":"This is One Hell of a Story.

Story #2Significantly after this, but before re-discovering this weird life event of mine, i had another incident take place.I had the day off and had gone to sleep, although once i had awoken in my dream i didn't realize i was asleep.I lived out day after day, week after week, month after month in this dream that i didn't even know was a dream, however it was not a good one.Eventually at some distant future point the space station was de-orbited, i do not know if this was intentional, or if it was normal orbital decay, or if it was even the ISS and not just one of the Chinese stations, however, shortly after this there was a limited nuclear exchange in which 36 nuclear weapons were detonated in the Texas gulf region, i am unsure what happened with the rest of the country though but i imagine it was catastrophic, services never came back.Shortly after this came airstrikes, no idea from who, it honestly looked like some variant of Su-30 Russian plane, only a few however before those too eventually stopped.About a week after this it got horrific, there were a bunch of anvil clouds that seemingly developed out of nowhere and large spacecraft were seen in them, not emerging independence day style, but as if the cloud itself was some kind of portal and these ships were sort of halfway loitering halfway in/out of the portal, the ships were large angular brick shaped, but had no real texture to speak of, they were a sort of solid stone/slate gray, and just sat there.We never saw anything come out of them, all we remembered were screams, from everywhere, and these monsters that would peel the skin from children and parents and wear their skin, and they were capable of perfectly imitating the voices of the people whose skin they took, they did this to lure people out of their hiding spots and take them, killing yourself to escape them would not work, they could reanimate the dead (part 2 after this) Part 2 of the last story:If you killed yourself to escape, it wouldn't work, they could reanimate the dead and keep you on some sort of life support for the sake of experimentation, i don't know why or how but somehow i knew that if they took you that you were theirs forever, there was no escape.However they also had large facilities on the earth, they looked like normal warehouses but the ones who wore people's skin were inside these, they would liquefy humans in here and keep them in devices that looked similar to dryers, and each liquified human was kept in their own, and we had a hand scanner we could use to find where our person's remains were so we could steal them so that they couldn't re-constitute their remains and make them suffer, somehow we could reconstruct the entire person back to what they were with this liquid.However the ones who wore people's skin had these large pools ringed with symbols that looked similar to zoroastrian dakhmas ( i don't know the spelling) and they would fill these pools with the people's liquefied remains and bathe in them, and their children would bathe in them and drink them, and they would try throwing people in and if you fell in then you were one of them.This went on until most of the human race had been wiped out, i do not remember most of what happened as this was a single dream spanning almost 72 years, eventually though their spacecraft were destroyed, most of the life on earth was destroyed, it had become a large desert, i remember there were still alligators though, and whatever had transpired had killed the sun, it was slowly dying, as if perhaps they had siphoned energy from it to escape, i don't know if anyone intervened on our behalf but i think someone did, but i remember i was walking with a girl in a blue dress, she was my wife (i don't have a wife in real life mind you) Part 3 after this: But anyways me and my wife in the blue dress were walking down the road, there was a small ditch on the left side, with a few alligators in it, and a line of trees on the other following the ditch, we were walking home, and there were bits of these spacecraft everywhere, the sun looked like it was setting but it wasn't (damaged or something as i stated in previous post) But we finally got home it was getting close to nighttime.I then remember her whispering to me very quietly, \\"we need to be quiet and turn all the lights off or they'll see us\\", we did this, and saw lights on the horizon slowly blinking out one by one by one, i don't know if the lights were really close enough or not, but i could swear i heard distant screaming, like there was a reason their lights were going off, as though even in our victory we were still being hunted, i do not know what our enemy was, we all just called it \\"Them\\"I woke up after this, and realized i had been asleep for almost 14 hours, (normally i sleep 7 and a half) and that this 72 years of mine had all somehow been a complex fabrication of my imagination.However, every single event leading up to this has happened so far again, every single last one, and i fear that either i am once again in the long dream, or that it has become reality this time, and we are about to see tribulation.","title":"This is One Hell of a Story.

Could it be that the right has weaponized Christianity for decades? Could it be that Republicans have time and time again used Christianity to force Religious ideologies into what is supposed to be secular legislation?

To define liberalism a bit better, it's a political philosophy that prioritizes the individual and protects private property rights. Private property specifically relates to means of production, such as farms, factories, stores, etc., or, generally, any place where labor is or can be produced. A house, for example, isn't private property. It's personal property.What this means is that liberalism, and its focus on the individual and exploitative structures, is antithetical to the teachings of a man who taught about love and sharing. The underlying dichotomy of \\"progressive\\" and \\"conservative\\" becomes meaningless when the structure above it is already in opposition to what Jesus taught. Jesus and his followers were heavily aligned with communal living where the community is seen as crucially important to our spiritual lives. I want to separate \\"communal\\" from \\"communist\\" because communism is an economic system that heavily promotes the communal mindsets, and the two are pretty intertwined, but I think we'd be reaching if we called Jesus a (Marxist) Communist for a lot of reasons. Among them being a rejection of metaphysics and spiritual/non-material things.We all like to think Jesus agrees with what we already believe, and he routinely dodges or subverts anyones attempts to say \\"What I believe is right, isn't it, Jesus?\\" What he lays out in his teachings defies the kinds of political and economic structures we're familiar with, and instead he advocates for a kind of lifestyle that's almost too revolutionary to define outside of what he says it is. If that makes sense. He didn't teach things that fit neatly with any ideology other than his own, basically.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"I'm sorry.","title":"AOC Should Have Won This Fight  Nancy Pelosi led the charge to keep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez out of a key House position.

Russert was known for his tough questioning and had a knack for exposing truths that powerful forces might want to keep hidden. His inquiries into sensitive political matters, including his probing of high-profile figures about their Skull and Bones affiliations and his relentless questioning during the 2008 Democratic Primary, could have made him a target. The timing of his death, right before significant political and economic events, fuels speculation that he was silenced to prevent further revelations. The rapid decline of \\"Meet the Press\\" ratings after his departure, under the stewardship of less challenging moderators, further suggests that his unique style of journalism was perceived as a threat, leading to his untimely and possibly forced exit from the scene.Video: https://x.com/dom_lucre/status/1869105845403038047?t=Ke_oJ8p3Ljzr2uZys47Utg&amp;s=19","title":"Tim Russert, the beloved host of NBC's \\"Meet the Press,\\" met a suspicious end in June 2008, when he suddenly collapsed from what was officially reported as a heart attack."},{"text":"Bless your heart Bernie.

The Bible teaches that men and women are equal in the eighth of God, but that wives are to be subservient to their husbands and that men are to be the leaders of the church. Men and women have different roles, but that doesnt make women lesser than men in the eyes of God.2. Loving is pointing out sin. If you love someone, you will try and tell them the gospel in order that they might repent and believe and be saved by God from eternal damnation. Christians shouldnt judge the worth of a person, but the Bible says pretty clearly what is and isnt sin (LGBT stuff is a sin), and Christians should share the gospel with sinners and try and exhort Christians who are sinning.3. Helping the poor and vulnerable does nothing if those poor and vulnerable arent saved. Christians should share the gospel with them first and help them that way. Once they are saved, they can be helped materially. But it doesnt matter if the poor man becomes rich or the vulnerable become secure, theyre going to hell either way if they dont believe the gospel.4. Compassion is saving babies that will be killed and sharing the gospel to the hell bound. I dont think Christians should necessarily have a strong stance one way or another on illegal immigration, at least illegal immigrants themselves, but Jesus said that we should always follow the laws of the land as long as they dont conflict with the commands of God. Illegal immigration doesnt conflict with the commands of God, and disobeys the laws of the land, so illegal immigrants shouldnt come to the land illegally. And I suppose the logical conclusion for a saved illegal immigrant to obey Gods commands, which includes obeying the laws of the land, would be for that illegal immigrant to either try and become a legal immigrant or move back, either way to stop themselves from breaking the law.5. Once again, none of that really matters if the people arent saved. Remember, Jesus didnt come to earth the first time to lift people out of poverty and oppression. He didnt open charities or soup kitchens or anything like that. He went around preaching the gospel and died in the cross for our sins. Jesus healed the sick when they came to Him, sure, but that was more to display His Godhood more than anything else. Once He was resurrected, He stayed for 40 days to instruct His apostles and followers on what to do when He was gone, and then ascended. Again, He didnt try and fight oppression, He was there to save peoples souls. Thats more important than any form of earthly charity.In conclusion: I dont really think actual Christians should be that involved in politics and I dont think laws should be made enforcing Christian values. You cant force people to be saved and living a godly life doesnt get you to heaven. There are a lot of things that Christians should disagree with on both sides, but conservatism is more closely aligned with Christian values than liberalism. Of course hating people based on whatever is a sin (such as racism), but what the world thinks is hate is usually just Christians trying to point out sin and share the gospel (telling someone what the Bible says about LGBT stuff is not being homophobic).","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"same as RBG didAnd Feinstein.","title":"Pelosi Won.

So, blood is spiritually unclean because too much of it outside of a body leads to death, not because it carries diseases.But, I think another thing, in this case, stems from respecting other people. Yeah, women don't really want to be bothered when cramping and feeling like crap, so giving them this state of ritual impurity kinda implies that they get left alone for a while. Ritual purity sounds strange to us now, but back then it was probably really nice to say \\"Nope, I can't do laundry this week. You can figure out how to get it done, or wear dirty clothes, but I'm unclean for the week.\\" It would've granted them time away from chores, basically.These teachings about ritual purity sound like punishments to us now, but they played an important role in structuring society. In some ways, because ritual \\"impurity\\" meant touching/being touched by certain things would pass that \\"impurity\\" along to it, it would actually serve women to be in that \\"impure\\" state. It also meant, for example, sick people could be left alone to heal because they could pass their ritual impurity onto things they touch, so they can't be expected to work while sick. Granted, there were people who warp/warped this form of purity into a morality thing, but a significant portion of purity laws have little, if nothing, to do with morality. We *think* these laws are about things that they aren't, and so we misinterpret what they really stood for for an ancient people group within a specific historical context.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"Can you link some stuff before spewing absolute unsupported bullshit?

If we use personality types like we are observing the tip of an iceberg, they encourage us to better respect, engage and understand each other from a place of depth, rather than simplification.

If everyone around you is a conservative, then so are you. If they all love Trump, then so do you. It just makes life easier and simpler to go with the flow.\\nOn the other hand if you're practicing to feel superior, morally and spiritually, then you could certainly accomplish that be actually being a good person, helping the needy, standing up for the weak, and so on.

The best policy decisions were when control was split, and more specifically, Dem control of the Executive and Rep control of the legislative. Best year ever was one in the second term of Clinton (I forget exactly); I could argue it was mostly due to being his second term, but I think he just matured a bit and became less partisan.Second complaint, nothing about debt to GDP That is the biggest predictor of economic success and collapse and it was relatively stable from WW2 until Obama; where we went from something like 55% to 100%. The EU (as I recall) considers anything below 60% low risk, 60-85% moderate risk, over 85% high risk  And economies start collapsing around 130% if small, but historically around 150-200% Surprisingly, last time I looked China was over 300% (not sure how they are keeping it afloat, but dont have time to research).Too many factors for such a complex assertion, and to argue things are better when one party controls the Executive and this and that happens, we need to look at it holistically (which he kind of acknowledged). Thus, we need to look at more than just a couple key stats while (more likely than not) ignoring others that dont fit the conclusion. Unfortunately, all politicians (and now way too many academics) start with conclusions and omit anything contradictoryAs I learned while pursuing an economics degree some 30ish years ago, and what is my favorite saying, is that we have lies, damn lies, and statistics!","title":"Bidenomics Was Wildly Successful"},{"text":"It makes sense if you understand their goal as a party is the status quo NOT progressive change.","title":"Progressives Up in Arms After AOC Loses Key Committee Seat | At this point almost nothing the Democratic Party does makes any damned sense, MSNBCs Joy Reid wrote."},{"text":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/17/indictment-russians-also-tried-help-bernie-sanders-jill-stein-presidential-campaigns/348051002/","title":"Democrats failed to address voters' 'despair', says top Biden official - Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm says Donald Trump listened better to suffering rust-belt communities"},{"text":"And Elon Musk paying billions to buy twitter to attack the democrats?

Conservatism is simply about retention of societal norms, while progressivism is about replacing them with new norms. Neither of those things have anything inherently to do with what's under discussion. Conservative Christians are just as capable of kindness, generosity, and inclusion as progressive Christians.Although I agree with almost everything you said, I think you're being a bit wilfully blind here. If you want to go with some specific restricted definitions of progressivism and conservatism, then yes, sure: \\"Conservatism is simply about retention of societal norms, while progressivism is about replacing them with new norms\\". But if realistically we're talking about the underlying principles behind modern left-wing and right-wing politics, then we have to acknowledge that \\"*kindness, inclusion, and care for the vulnerable*\\" ARE some of the fundamental progressive values and the things which specifically drive people to be left-wing progressives. Often in discussions like these, I see it brought up that left-wingers don't have a monopoly on kindness, and conservatives are just as capable of being generous and compassionate. And yes, this is true. Certainly in my experience, the conservatives I know in real life are, for the most part, as nice and empathetic as anybody else on an individual basis. I think I even saw a study once that suggested conservatives are more likely to donate to charity and to feel empathy for people in their community that they know personally (whereas liberals are more concerned with injustices happening on a grand scale). But if we're talking about left-wing politics itself, IS centred around inclusion, kindness and care for the vulnerable, whereas right-wing politics is not. Right-wing politics often, at the expense of these things, has a strong emphasis on individual responsibility - if you mess up, you should go to jail and be punished - and stresses the unfairness of having the money you feel you earned go to support somebody else, over the unfairness of some people having more money than others (for whatever reason) - if you can't or don't want to work for a living, that's not our business, we shouldn't be expected to provide for you! This isn't necessarily immoral - I think conservatives are good people, mostly, who just think liberals go a bit too far. But it is what right-wing politics is all about, and that is contrary to Christian beliefs and principles.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"The focus of the Biden administration was recovery from the devastation of the pandemic and infrastructural reinvestment through the Build Back Better agenda.

Im going to respond to each of your points in order.1. You are correct when you say Christianity does not teach that women are less than men. But in the context of your argument, you are implying that conservatives believe that women are less than men. This is absolutely not the case, and I challenge you to show me where Conservative philosophical or political thought makes the claim that women are lesser than men.You are somewhat correct to say that conservatives prioritize rigid gender roles, but that does not necessarily mean that conservatives believe that women are less than men.2. Jesus absolutely did judge. And it is his place to judge. He will be the one that judges all of us after we die. You did cite biblical examples of Jesus telling people not to judge others. But again, you are drawing the wrong conclusions from those examples. When looking at the wider context, its easy to see why Jesus said things like that. The whole point of Christianity is that we are ALL sinners. Nobody is perfect. We all fall short of the glory of God. So, judging others is a form of hypocrisy. Instead of focusing on the deeds of others, it is more important to focus on your own shortcomings.BUT, that does not mean that sin is ok. Yes, Jesus told people not to stone the adulterous woman, because everyone present was also a sinner. That does not mean that the womans adultery was ok. He told every sinner he came across to go forth and sin no more. This is definitely something that all Christians struggle with, and there is a proper balance that needs to be found. A lot of Christians are extremely judgmental and dont see their own hypocrisy. But at then end of the day, its only natural that Christians oppose sin.3. You are correct. Jesus did prioritize helping the poor and the vulnerable. And Christians have also prioritized that. The vast majority of charities that help the poor are religiously motivated. And Christians disproportionately volunteer their time and money to help underprivileged people.That being said, you are right that prioritizing helping the poor is generally lacking in our society (hence why Im becoming a little more progressive on economic issues). We can (and should) do a lot more to help people in need. But where conservatives and liberals disagree is HOW we should do that. Conservatives believe that helping the poor is a responsibility of society. Liberals believe that it is a responsibility of the government. There is a lot more nuance to this discussion, but it is divorced from the religious perspective so I wont really touch on it here. If you want to talk more about it, Im open.Also, personal responsibility is a valuable trait that people should have regardless of what political ideology they believe. Not sure why you implied that its a bad thing.4. I agree with some of this, but I still think you have some bias in your understanding of how Christianity translates into political beliefs.Caring for others is a foundational pillar of Christianity. That does not mean that we shouldnt have a legal framework to deal with these contentious issues.You specifically mentioned the border issue. Yes, I believe that we should care for disadvantaged people. But we already have so many disadvantaged people in our own country. What sense does it make to allow millions of people to enter the country every year when we are failing to provide services for the people who already live here. The whole concept of a government is people in a society collaborate together to promote the welfare of their own citizens. That is a valid form of political organization.5. The question what would Jesus do is something that transcends political ideology. Jesus was not a liberal. Jesus was not a conservative. He wasnt a communist, or a capitalist, or a socialist, or a libertarian, or an anarchist. He is the literal creator of the universe, and the creator of mankind. His nature is not something we can comprehend.You cant read verses in the Bible and apply it to modern political phenomenon accurately. Asking the question how would Jesus organize healthcare in America is nonsensical. He would obviously try and organize it in a way that alleviates suffering for the most amount of people. The question is how do we actually do that?We can go on and on about how Jesus would respond in certain scenarios, but that is purely hypothetical, and accomplishes absolutely nothing.Conclusion: I think you are overlooking a lot of historical context when it comes to your analysis of both Christian and conservative beliefs. Both Christianity, and Conservatism are a lot more nuanced than you give them credit for. But at the end of the day, Christianity does not correlate 100% to one political ideology or the other. Most Christians will be socially conservative due to the moral teachings of the Bible. Thats just a given, and there is no way around that. When it comes to economics, that all really depends on individual experiences and beliefs. Obviously, religious ethics influence economic decision making, but there is more room for interpretation and theorizing.Neither Conservative nor Liberal beliefs truly reflect the Gospel message.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"Difference between thoughts and actions","title":"Joe Biden has pardoned a doctor who diluted the chemo of cancer patients, a judge who locked up kids for cash, a CEO who led a $19 million fraud scheme, a local official who stole $53 million from a small town, and his own son.

It's ridiculous.1. Every significant Christian denomination that I'm aware of teaches \\"traditional\\" mother and father husband and wife type roles. Equal but different. Helpmeets. a couple scriptural anecdotes imply more that you are misinterpreting the scriptures by seeing cultural norms of the time and calling it doctrine.2. This is the worst one by far. First sentence \\"Jesus condemned\\" second sentence \\"if Jesus didn't judge\\". You completely ignored the argument. To repeat. Condemnation is not the same as exclusion.  Jesus judged all the time. He is THE ultimate judge at the final day. We don't get to judge whether someone is going to make it or not. That's his job. But we all judge people all the time, every day. Who you date, what shows are good, who you work with, where you spend your money etc.He dined with sinners but he didn't join in, he didn't help them find opportunities to sin or tell them it was all fine. He didn't support their lifestyle. Liberal ideology pushes the idea that no culture or way of life is better than another. This is in total opposition. Christianity is not relativistic. Christ came to call sinners to repentance (personally if possible, lovingly) There is nothing wrong with identifying sin with love and tact, and encouraging others to improve. Everyone is welcome at church, but we're still gonna invite you to keep the commandments.3. What? You paint with such a broad brush it's absurd the fallacies. Not all conservatives are rich. You would be hard pressed to find research suggesting conservatives are more wealthy on average than liberals with any significance. Duh. Conservative may benefit  the wealthy, but at least it benefits everyone as opposed to liberalism. And it reinforces you reap what you sow. You work you eat. Systemic inequality or racism doesn't have an important part of this conversation, it's completely irrelevant. 4. Christ offers the ultimate stipulation. Have faith in me, keep my commandments  forgiveness, salvation.  The blessings of the atonement are freely given BUT HE STILL ASKS US TO DO STUFF. What is the sermon on the mount all about? Behavior, character change. Why didn't Christ perform miracles in certain towns? Lack of faith. So... It's not freely given? A huge number of performed miracles are preceded by a recognition of sufficient faith. That is a stipulation. And it doesn't mean that he isn't also asking these people to keep the commandments.You are perhaps unintentionally (huge benefit of the doubt here) creating enormous straw men where you either argue against conservative beliefs that don't actually exist or using Christian doctrine that isn't actually accurate.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"You think he really made this list?

You are assuming that complementarity (men and women having different role, but equal in value) which IS biblical amounts to inequality. This is contrary to progressive values that deny that there is any biological difference between men and women. 2. Jesus did in fact judge, and judged harshly those who rejected the teachings of God. This includes violations of sexual purity. Arguing that, \\"Jesus never explicitly said anything about homosexuality\\", while ignoring what the Law actually taught and Jesus saying that he came to uphold the Law, is begging the question. 3. Jesus also taught the parable of the talents. \\"Those who have, more will be given to them, and those who have nothing will lose what they have been given to them\\". The point being that we have an obligation to put our talents to work and to strive to be productive. Also, with respect to charity, charity is freely given. Judas himself says that, \\"we should take the donations and give it to the poor\\", whereas Jesus rebukes him saying that anointing him with oil is the correct response because, \\"you will always have the poor, but you will not always have me\\". Taxation is just forced theft, not charity.4. Abortion is not compassionate because you are killing children. \\"Even the stones will cry out for justice.\\" Jesus is all about the weak and the helpless, and definitely would NOT approve of killing those who are the weakest and most helpless because it is convenient. 5. What did Jesus teach?Love the Lord God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. How are you loving your neighbor by increasing their taxes to give to causes that you support, and trying to prevent your neighbor from supporting causes that you do not support?How are we loving our neighbor by taxing them from money they could use to support their families?","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"It really is","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Kim min jae","title":"Joe Biden has pardoned a doctor who diluted the chemo of cancer patients, a judge who locked up kids for cash, a CEO who led a $19 million fraud scheme, a local official who stole $53 million from a small town, and his own son.

Conservatism at its core is a movement by wealthy nobles and aristocrats to keep (conserve) their power after the monarchies of Europe started getting marched to the guillotine. You can look at any of the writings of the classic 19th century conservatives from Edmund Burke on and their entire philosophy boils down to \\"society is hierarchical and we should be at the top\\". Obviously declaring yourself to be better than everyone else and deserving of all the money and power isn't going to be a winning strategy in a democracy. So conservatives don't put their actual views at the forefront. Instead they pretend to care about \\"cultural norms\\". Gay marriage, abortion, DEI, critical race theory, the war on Christmas are all talked about ad nauseum, but when conservatives get actual power what do they do? They attack social safety nets, reduce taxes for the rich, and destroy regulations.And to your point about progressives not explaining their positions through a biblical lens, that's not their job.

No conservative believes women are less than men. You clearly see a woman's role as a caregiver for children to be a lesser role. I can assure you, it is not. You need to search your own bias as to why you diminish traditional roles in a family that women have held. 2. The Bible states VERY clearly that marriage is between a man and a woman. And to be fruitful and multiply. LGBT does not fit this mold. It goes against God's design. This does not mean LGBT individuals should be hated. But the Bible most certainly does not condone it. 3. If a man who is capable of work will not work, then he shall not eat. Paraphrased from the Bible. There is a difference between helping those who need a hand, caring for those who cannot care for themselves, and enabling freeloaders and addicts. Unfortunately, the freeloaders and addicts outnumber the actual needy nowadays. I had a guy enter my place of work asking for money for food. I offered him my lunch. He refused and asked for cash instead. That's a negative.I am sorry that your worldview does not align with Christ and Christianity. Satan himself deceives as you are attempting to do now. Half truths and lies wrapped in cherry picked scripture are the words of one who aims to deceive. Satan did exactly this to Christ in the desert.

Most conservatives want to help the poor and needy, but believe the solution is families working together and the supreme importance of a healthy nuclear family.  They believe throwing money into a bucket for the government won't solve the problem and is a waste of time and energy on everyone's behalf, NOT because they dont care for the poor.  It is a disagreement on solutions, not debate over whether the problem exists.4. Conservative Christians unanimously agree that caring for others overrides strict adherence to rules.5. What would Jesus do? He came to make the Word become flesh and to fulfil the commandments of the Bible, not to disregard them.

Whenever Christians expressed concern that progressive values were possibly inconsistent with the Bible, the progressive response was not to show them that their values are, in fact, consistent with it, but rather to tell them that the Bible isn't true and that they should throw it out.\\\\Conservatives didn't tell them that. Conservatism is about preserving and retaining norms, and Scripture was one of those norms. Had progressives appealed to Scripture, rather than discarding it, I think Christianity would be more associated with progressivism today than it is. Progressives lost the battle before it even started.My personal experience is that whenever scripture clashes with conservative values, conservative values always win out whilst the bible is tossed in the trash.Though Jesus is quite the pacifist and elucidates several very specific stances on nonviolence, conservatives seem unwilling to follow his lead especially when gun rights are up for discussion - they become passionate advocates of various forms of violence instead.Jesus also held very firm stances on what to do with immigrants and aliens; namely, Jesus demands very clearly that you embrace them, accept them, help them, and love them. It is in over a dozen places in the bible, in the direct words of Jesus himself. I find it difficult to believe that Jesus would want immigrants rounded up, shoveled into concentration camps, and deported.This leads me to believe that the vast majority of conservatives are not actually christian but merely mouth the words when it is convenient to them.

It started with months of Trump and Republican leaders and media spreading constant conspiracy theories to discredit the election, before the election even took place. This turned into using the legal system to push their claims, making a ton of insane and already totally discredited claims in court while asking the courts to throw out ultimately millions of legally cast ballots. Multiple lawyers lost their ability to practice law after this. This then turned into Trump, the sitting president, personally calling hundreds of state representatives around the country and threatening them and demanding they throw out exactly enough legally cast ballots to give him the win. Simultaneously, he was pressuring states to send false electors to vote for him over the winning candidate. He and his advisors, like Flynn, were crafting executive orders to have the military seize ballots and machines. Fortunately it didn't come to that. This all culminated in Trump urging his supporters to march on the Capitol to pressure his VP to unconstitutionally reject the certification of entire states. He refused, and Trump's supporters rioted and violently stormed the Capitol, threatening to murder a number of politicians, including Pence, in a last ditch effort to overturn the election. Throughout the entire process Trump was claiming that he won the election and was the legitimate president, and refused to concede. Nothing like this has ever occurred in our history. You've given examples of handfuls of legislators sending a letter, and some random protestors totally unconnected to Hillary Clinton or Obama. In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the same night if I'm not mistaken, or the next day. In 2024, Kamala Harris conceded almost immediately. They didn't go on a massive campaign of lying to the public, breaking the law and threatening states to get them to throw out ballots, or trying unconstitutional moves like rejecting the certification of entire states.It was completely unprecedented and wildly undemocratic. A sitting president tried to overturn an election, and we can all literally listen to him as he does it.

The Bible doesnt teach that women are less than men.That's true. Women are not less than men. We Catholics (and Orthodox too) venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary. She played (and plays) a very important role in our salvation. If anything, I feel less than her. But I don't think conservatives actually believe women are less than men. they complement us, and we complement them. I'm not from the US though, so I might be mistaken.2. Jesus didnt judge or exclude based on tradition or social norms.Jesus meets everyone, but He expects us to change and to leave sin behind. You quoted John 8:1-11, but you left out the part where the Lord tells the adulterous woman to **NOT SIN AGAIN**. Jesus also spoke many times about hell and sin. There was no need for Him to condemn homosexual acts (not people with homosexual tendency), because the Law of Moses already taught that. In fact, Paul reminds us that these kind of acts are not allowed (Corinthians 6:9-11 and Corinthians 6:18). Everyone knew that back then.So, each one of us is a sinner, But we have to repent, and be ready to change our life in order to be able to receive Jesus' Mercy. Encouraging people to keep living in a sinful way **is not love**. We are harming them if we do.3. Jesus prioritized helping the poor and vulnerable.I partially agree with you. I think that as a society we should care about the poor and vulnerable. In my country we have public health and education, and I support that. But be careful: Jesus didn't condemn wealth in itself. What he condemned is attachment to earthly possessions. That's why he tells the young rich to give everything to the poor. His attachment to wealth was stopping him from following Jesus. If you read the Bible more carefully, you'll find that some of Jesus's followers were rich (e.g Joseph of Arimathea). Also, he didn't ask Zacchaeus to sell everything. He knows the hearts of the people, and their attachments. Being obsessed with money is the problem.4. Caring for others overrules strict adherence to rules.I don't understand how opposing abortion would be not caring for others. [The Tradition of the Church is pretty clear on abortion being murder and a grave sin](https://www.catholic.com/tract/abortion).  It was known in Jesus's time. He didn't have to teach people about that. Caring for others is providing what vulnerable pregnant women need, not helping them to murder their own children.5. What would Jesus do? often doesnt align with conservative stances.Again, I'm not very familiar with what conservatism stands for in the US. But some leftists make the same mistake. They think Jesus would be happy about Pride Parades, euthanasia, abortion being legal and supported by the government, etc. As I said before, He wants us to repent from our sins and to love Him - which is to do what He commands. He loves the sinner but not the sin.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"This is the thing people dont realize.

Conservatism disproportionately benefits the wealthy &amp; so saying rich people spend more money than everyone else isnt really saying much. Regardless, Jesus emphasized collective responsibility.

The few occasions where Jesus was actually at a point of judgement was when he was confronted with systemic corruption. Not individuals but systems that took advantage of people. 4.

While systems like astrology or Harry Potter houses can certainly oversimplify, the FFM offers a nuanced, research-backed approach to understanding personality that addresses many of the problems you raise.One of the key differences is that the FFM doesnt pigeonhole people into rigid types. It describes personality across five dimensionsOpenness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticismthat exist on continuums, allowing for rich variation. For example, knowing someone scores high on Openness doesnt reduce them to a stereotype; it provides a starting point to explore how traits like creativity or intellectual curiosity manifest in their life. Rather than being a thought-terminating exercise, it opens avenues for deeper inquiry. Tools like the FFM enhance understanding rather than shutting it down because they acknowledge the complexity and fluidity of personality.Your argument also suggests that personality labels distract from forming genuine human connections, but when used properly, frameworks like the FFM can foster those very connections. For instance, understanding that a friends reserved nature reflects a lower score in Extraversionrather than disinterestcan encourage patience and empathy. Similarly, recognizing that someone high in Agreeableness values harmony might guide how to handle conflict in a way that strengthens the relationship. These insights dont replace person-to-person connection; they deepen it by offering a clearer picture of the factors influencing behavior.Unlike the arbitrary nature of systems like astrology or even Myers-Briggs, the FFM is grounded in decades of empirical research and cross-cultural studies. It consistently replicates across populations, showing that these five traits represent fundamental dimensions of human personality. While it doesnt claim to reveal absolute truths, it provides a practical, evidence-based framework for understanding how people differ and how those differences affect relationships and group dynamics.Youre right to critique how some personality labels are used, especially when they create superficial tribes that substitute for real community. But thats a misuse of the tool, not a flaw inherent to it. Personality frameworks like the FFM dont isolate people or replace genuine connectionthey facilitate understanding, empathy, and collaboration. For instance, a person who learns they are high in Neuroticism might share this insight with others to explain their heightened response to stress, inviting support and fostering closer relationships. When applied thoughtfully, these tools enhance relationships rather than fragmenting them.The heart of your argumentthat people are too complex to be reduced to a typeis entirely valid. But tools like the FFM dont aim to solve or define someone; they provide a language for exploring and appreciating complexity. Rejecting all personality frameworks risks losing the value that scientifically grounded systems can bring: deeper understanding, better communication, and stronger communities. The issue lies not in the frameworks themselves but in how theyre applied. Used properly, tools like the FFM dont limit our view of othersthey enrich it.","title":"CMV: Personality types do more harm than good."},{"text":"I mean yeah I'm down for pentagon budget cuts, but you can't just make it's budget zero.

That being said, on some issues, yes I would align more conservatively. \\\\Do you believe with unconditionally helping the hungryI absolutely beleive in helping the hungry to a large extent. Unconditionally goes further than I would take it. Is starting a war justified by feeding the hungry? What about causing people to lose their salvation? Its important to understand that conservative/liberal can be more complicated than just two competing policies, and that I care about what works at helping the hungry not what makes idealistic claims about helping the hungry. For example, China opening its markets to capitalist forces ended the devasting famine caused by Great Leap Forward and lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty--thats effective feeding of the hungry. We can debate what is the best method of feeding the hungry, and the reality ids that it would be a mixture of government interventions, free-market forces, liberal and conservative ideologies.

It teaches that each gender has different roles. A man cannot give birth, a woman cannot go for an entire month without having hormonal fluctuations. It's to say we have specific roles. I'm not saying women belong in the kitchen, that's just misogynistic. But things like parenting, at least for me - I feel like women have higher empathy than me, and I think it's needed to raise a child because the kid needs that connection growing up since logic and rationale isn't fully developed; I'm not saying I don't have any empathy, but I think my spouse would be better at it. So by process of elimination, women is better to be at home raising the child, meaning the man has to make the income. One is not greater than the other, but each have their role.\\n2. Jesus called us not to judge others, and to bring others to him. But when others are sinning, you call them out for correction. So I'm not saying you should stand outside with a sign and megaphone saying \\"LGBTQ are going to hell!\\" but you should lovingly edify them and letting them know where Jesus stands against LGBTQ, and that it's a sin and we ought to stop sinning because sin draws us away from Jesus.\\n3. Yes Christians ought to care for the widows and orphans and those in need (Acts 20:35). The difference between Republican v Democrat is how it's done. Republicans would like to help the poor directly, they don't want government intervention. Democrats want to help the poor using tax dollars, meaning that you'll pay more in taxes for funds to be used for welfare programs - the problem with the latter is the bloated administrative cost.\\n4. I agree that there needs to be a heart for caring towards those having difficulty. But I don't see how this relates to conservative values - you're basically saying all conservatives are heartless. The reality is that when it comes to a vote, since America is a democracy, you want to vote based on your values (and for Christians that's against abortions) but it doesn't mean that there's no compassion - just because you see it on TikTok doesn't mean it's representative of Christians.\\n5. WWJD - your choosing all the bad examples of conservatives, but the same goes for liberals then. Focusing on accepting others because it makes them feel welcomed (but Jesus focuses on edifying others with the truth), or allowing LGBTQ teachings to be taught in church (but Jesus started flipping tables when the church was turned into a marketplace). The reality is that both parties have good and bad values, and the issue with America is that it's a two party system - the truth is that you can't put Jesus into either category, but in terms of his teachings and codifying that into legislations, that aligns more with the Republican party. Not the actions of Republicans, but the policies that the Republicans put into legislations.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"Oh really?

The right is almost always worse and wrong, but the non-4chan points they made against the democrats were fairly spot on.Bernie is correct that we need a grassroots progressive upheaval. It cant be 3rd party either. From every level, we need to dump the aging corporate democrats the same way the nazis and nut jobs took the Republican Party. If we dont, the nazis and nut jobs will continue to win, or best case, the corporate dems benefit from another disgust win and nothing changes.Every blue candidate should study under a community college economics professor to learn how to explain shit to people who are barely paying attention. Macro really isnt that difficult if candidates could just shut up about focus group issues. More people having more money = more money changing hands = more tax revenue, less debt, and more consumer influence = less crappy stuff in your lifeSubsidizing debt and giving entitlement funds to people who need it is not a bad stopgap, but its a dumb final goal because it doesnt increase savings or upward mobility. In the long term, it subsidizes the labor force and adds to corporate profit which doesnt get reinvested. I bring that up because thats what democrats running for office kept bringing up. They would mention corporate greed and speculation, but didnt mention the plan for that. They only talked about loan forgiveness and programs to help people buy homes. No. No. No. How about you make every employer pay for every dollar their employee gets to help pay for essential living expenses. Got a discounted ACA health plan because you dont make enough money? Your employer doesnt need to know but they need to pay for it.Get housing or food assistance because your family needs it to survive? Your employer doesnt need to know but they need to pay for it. The employers would say: how much do I need to pay my employees to avoid this penalty? The next day Amazon and Walmart would announce $25/hr minimum pay as if they did it out of kindness. Then 15 chuckleducks would call it a brilliant move to attract higher quality workersThen opposing corporate politicians would say theyre doing this to boot people off welfare. Its causing mass unemployment.Pleaseif the corporations could do without these laborers, theyd already be collecting unemployment.But theyll pass it on to the consumer! - good, let them charge what it actually costs to make their product, create some of that competition libertarians are always screaming about. If McDonalds needs to charge $20 for a Big Mac, maybe they dont have the most efficient business model and someone else should make cheaper hamburgers. Ya know what costs less after externalities than a bunch of semi trucks with meat patties? A locally sourced burger at a burger place  with a good business model.

Yes Jesus did. read john 8:11, literally after condemning the men of stoning the women, he tells the women to 'go forth and sin no more', as to condemn her sin as well. Sure the Bible says that all people are sinners, but in terms of political alignment, it is not surprising that generally Christians would support a party that stands moreso against things such as abortion, lgbtq, etc. Why would a Christian support a party that basically affirms sin?3. This is true. A hyper capitalist mindset, is wrong. That being said, it would understandable why Christians would rather choose the ability for a smaller government and lower taxes that would allow for them to give to charities out of their own will, rather government programs and higher taxes that may or may not be managed properly. Also, despite what r/athiesm espouses, Christians are the most charitable demographic in America. 4. Those verses speak specifically towards the ceremonial laws of the old testament, and is not a statement against following the law, or choosing to sin. Also, abortion is not compassionate, as murder is not an act of compassion. Illegal immigration is not an act of compassion, when a majority of illegal immigrants are economic migrants making the conscious decision to break the law. 5. If by 'focusing on tradition', you mean to say focusing on traditional Christian morality, then yes (John 14:15). The death penalty is not something the Bible takes an extreme stance on either way, there are verses in support and against it. Overall, yes, helping the needy and downtrodden is good. The hyper capitalistic mindset of many conservatives is not particularly Christian. However, compared to the progressive stance on lgbtq, abortion and drug legalization, one could see how generally Christians might align more with the party who may be against such values.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"This comment should get a response.","title":"CMV: Christians should disagree more with conservative values than progressive values"},{"text":"If the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk are the ones that ride us into fascism, we truly deserve it.","title":"2024 might be the year American democracy ended and fascism began"},{"text":"The Democrats have no off-ramp to positions not popular with voters.
