I'll mention a few things specific to your points:1) Economy and immigration - Sure, Harris had plans like banning price gouging.... But we've been told for four years about supply chain issues and inflation driving prices up... So if you ban price \\"gouging\\" or you implement price caps... Is that going to stop supply chain issues or inflation? People understand that it costs money to make things. The Democrats missed their mark on this by assuming that voters wouldn't question the other effects of it. For immigration... Again, Democrats assumed that voters weren't going to hear about the Venezuelan gangs taking over apartments. They assumed that giving illegal immigrants free housing, gift cards, etc was a \\"popular\\" opinion, because it was their opinion. They assumed that people wouldn't be paying attention to what mass immigration is doing in Canada or Germany, and how their citizens were reacting to it. It wasn't a messaging failure. It was an arrogance failure.2) This is a big one... By this point, people either believe Trump is a fascist or they don't. If they do, they were never voting for him. If they don't, finding yet another reason to say that he's fascist isn't going to convince them. Predicting all of these dramatic shifts, and extreme things... It didn't land, because people don't believe that Trump is evil to the same degree that Democrats do. For voting rights, again... Are you referring to the fact that Democrats want to remove voter ID laws and such? That's not all that popular an opinion. Most people don't have a problem with it, and most people realize that the number of people who genuinely don't have, and cannot acquire, and ID, and are mentally sound enough to vote, is very, very small. On abortion, again... Democrats have shifted so far to the left that their arguments aren't popular. I guess you could chalk a couple of those things up to bad messaging... But to me, the primary failure of the Democrats this election cycle is just a complete disconnect from what voters actually cared about.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Hmmm, never tried to but go off!","title":"FEMA Fires Manager Who Told Staff to Skip Homes With Trump Signs"},{"text":"Look on the bright side: lower rent.","title":"Trump Advisers Ramp Up Work on Mass Deportation Push"},{"text":"The guy who did a netflix special called \\"Woke Foke\\" ?The guy who wore a full Gucci suit posing in front of a tesla truck?The guy who wears a black and white diamond chain and likes to cover 1 eye?https://images.app.goo.gl/Cadp2GuMqWGTrZGFA","title":"\\"Trump is on the Epstein List\\" Meanwhile Trump and his staff.

It was there for those who looked for it.The problem is that there was a narrow window where for people who grew up with the internet and also used it to seek out information.  Most people have become accustomed to relying on a social media feed to present them with information rather than going out and looking for it.  And that feed is algorithmically tailored unless you take steps to impede the algorithm.  And even before social media, sponsored search results and interpretive search interfered with peoples ability to just search for what they were looking for.  And the AI clients being added in are just making it worse.Apparently peoples votes not being counted and their ballots being listed as uncounted or missing is currently trending on TikTok.Good.  Everyone needs to check and call out irregularities.  People shouldn't jump to conclusions, just call out and report problems where they arise.  Sometimes it's simple human error.  But double checking is how you catch if there was an issue.  There's already been a software / human operation error identified in Michigan that's being transparently addressed.My concern though is that [bomb threats were made](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/hoax-bomb-threats-made-dozens-polling-locations-swing-states-rcna178889) to 50 sites in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona to disrupt polling operations.  I don't know if after the buildings were cleared, if election workers confirmed that none of the machines had been tampered with.  Calling in a fake threat can be used as a distraction to clear people out of a space and give someone cover to tamper.[Federal elections monitors were also barred from some Republican led states,](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-election-monitors-republican-states-b432050ce1a28e106394b6cefeb4866c) while there was a move by [2020 election deniers to get jobs at polling locations ](https://www.reddit.com/r/houstonwade/comments/1gn3v1u/the_trojan_horse_to_steal_the_election/)so that they could be there to count the votes.  These people were easily manipulated into believing the previous election was stolen, and they're going into it thinking they're doing gods work, and that Trump is some righteous leader.  It's at least worth a double check and a gentle probe.People have also brought up the last minute purging of voter roles in swing states.","title":"Trumps golden age of America could be an unrestrained imperial presidency"},{"text":"that is a big problem. for a while like in the 90's and after citizens united - republicans were better at getting the big donors, wall street, raising money for big corportations - their policies favored them and republicans were always allies of big business....RNC had Fox news, am radio and many news paper on lock ....they used to have most of the national news networks....with Clintons and Obama the DNC they figured it....with the Carter Dems moved to the right, with bill clinton they mastered the art of using reagan policies while championing liberal and even progressive ideas but they favored trickle down economics/anti lgbtq/pro war on drugs/cutting welfare.....By the 2000's and deff by Obama Hillary DNC figured out and basically started being the party for big business, wall street, energy companies, MIC and after Mitt Romney with Hillary 2016 - Dems were fully what the RNC used to be just that they also had unions, big academia too - they were the party funded for elites that advocated for the elites - Trump came in and killed the Neo Cons and tooks control of the republican party from evangicals and the Bush people.He won in 2016 mainly because he really was an f you to the elites, billionaires, both parties political machines and donar groups.what is crazy Dems kinda doubled down on being the big business, wall street, big academia, MIC, elite party since 2016 and even went mroe wall street - Like i never thought I would see Dems advocate for globalism and off shoring Jobs and sighting and embracing Goldman Sacks policies and proudly campaigning with Goldman's endorsement.  I never thought Dems would fight for and being pro illegal immigration, open boarders, and saying it was good to bring in more low skilled cheap labor with these immigrants and having them work jobs for companies instead of americans...like they had adds and interviews with those companies in which management was saying these immigrants work longer and harder than americans and that they prefered to hire the immigrants and would state the wages which while sounded good, you instantly would realize that the wages were under what was average for that position and what they were paying US citizens also many of those jobs were usually down by unions in that region - like that is what Dems where always against.DNC is a money making machine. their donars are willing to donate to them because if they win, dems will pass policies that help them....if they don't welp republicans policies align with them and their goals anyway so its win win.DNC realized they can get money and bought by huge donars and industries basically get paid to not be progressive or anti average american and working class.  Dem's liberal and progressive platform is basically a shake down of big money holders - DNC is charging a protection fee.Republicans are going to be conservative pro business regardless. So the big money has no reason to pay them.  Elon saw this and was like yo I got the most valuable car company, an ev company, my supply line is in china, my company does solar and batteries. My other company does rockets and space contracts from nasa and darpa.  I get a ton of money from Gov subsidies and contracts and I am liked by one party mainly, the democrats. My compeitors and rivals are the tech companies, ICE car manufactures, and fossil fuel industry.....after trump won in 2016....he saw the shift in donars and parties and was like hmm Dems are getting bought by the people that don't like me and are probably going to loose these next few cycles I got to hedge politically....so he bought twitter and went right wing and endorsed trump.  there is more too it but Elon hedged and got the political support and power he needed to protect and benefit his companies.

But, it seems like anything at all we say or do to support the trans community will be announced full blast until the end of time.That being said. I think there are a couple principles at stake here.  First, people have to go to the bathroom and get changed somewhere. So, where is the best place?  If it's based on sex at birth and then you have a trans-female using the male bathroom or a trans-male using the female bathroom, is that perfectly normal to you?  It might actually feel weirder not just for the transgender person but the cisgender people using the bathroom with them.  The other way is probably most preferred by the transgendered person, where they use the bathroom of current gender.  But, people are often at different stages of gender transformation, so it really just makes sense to allow the transgendered person to use the bathroom they're most comfortable with.  Offering smaller unisex bathrooms and locker rooms would help alleviate the problems, but overall I can't really seeing it being an issue and I think that would depend of if schools want to allocate funds to create these bathrooms.Second, for sports, the main principle is people should have the opportunity to participate.  The executive order is vague enough it's not clear that it requires trans-females to be allowed to compete in female competition only that they have access to these sports.  I do think at the highest levels of competition and where excess physical harm is possible that trans-females probably shouldn't be allowed, but I'd prefer that decision be made by the sporting bodies governing their respective sports.","title":"Two Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"Many people are stupid and believe anything the TV tells them to.

By and large most people, conservative or not, just want to live their lives in peace, and could care less how other people live. The disconnect that alot of people have is that when you start involving children, that's where people draw the line. And the only \\"rhetoric\\", if you want to call it that, I've ever seen the right (and Trump) engage in is agisnt allowing children to transition. As far as \\"rolling back protections\\" for trans people, what \\"protections\\" are being rolled back?  (notice how this shifted from LGBTQIA+ conversation to now its only a trans one) If people are being hateful towards trans people online, thats free speech. It's  not the role of the federal government to police speach.  Also, as I see it, especially over the last few days,  far more hateful, spiteful, racist/sexist comments are coming from the left, not the right. I've seen nothing but calls to deport citizens and/or getting them arrested because Hispanics voted for Trump. I've seen rad fems lose their minds and go on unhinged screaming fits about they should rise up and kill all men. I've seen people who think someone who voted for Trump= nazi and then statements like Nazis need to be put down in the street in cold blood, and so, so many more fucked up things. You are right. I don't trust the MSM. Not sure why you would think that Fox is OK, they aren't. Just as bad as CNN, just spun in the opposite direction. As far as women's \\"rights\\", I assume you mean unlimited access to abortions. Quite frankly, Trumps stance on the issue is clear. He said it's not a federal government problem. It's already been returned to the States. He isnt going to do anything further with it. It's up to the people in each state to decide the issue, and if someone doesnt like what their state is doing, either convince people locally to change the laws, or move to another state that more closely reflects your values. Which happens to be a stance I agree with. Even as someone who is pro-abortion (excluding late term abortions), I don't believe the federal government should be making *any* decisions about medical care of *any* type. I really don't think it's the states roll either...but it's definitely more of a states decision than the federal government. And it is a mind virus. It didn't start with this election season, or even the last election season. The \\"fear\\" has infected people for well over 30 years now. But the things people are afraid about are not \\"real\\".

Instead of bragging about how good the economy is to people who only see what they're paying for groceries, they should have pointed out that under Biden inflation in the US is half of what it is for our industrial competitors and our economy is far more robust than in all the other nations which are still recovering from the same pandemic we are.They should have pointed out that Trump ignored the pandemic, then called it a democratic hoax, then said it would be over by Easter. All that after he'd been briefed about how bad it would be. They could have pointed out that if he hadn't mismanaged the pandemic, thrown out the playbook and disbanded the office created to watch out for it, minimized the threat, ridiculed masking and isolation we might have saved the lives of one hundred thousand Americans.Democrats failed the same way the usually fail: they see the obvious and assume that if they point it out to people they'll see it too. They forget that people are ~~morons~~ imperfect observers and must not only be lead to water but have to be encouraged over and over again to drink. But the greater problem is that none of this message would have been broadcast in any of the states where the media is controlled by rightwing extremists. That's all the swing states and all the south and all the middle of the country.

I agree with pretty much everything you said. I absolutely think regular middle and working class economics is the biggest issue the US faces right now and I think both parties are failing them miserably.I'll admit I didn't really dig in to trump's platform because my mind was made up well before the election for a myriad of reasons, many based on his character but also GOP policy. I definitely was curious about Harris's platform during the campaign and I noticed actual policy for child tax credits (raising it to $6k) and first time homebuyers ($25k credit). Things that would've directly and substantially benefit me personally. Biden was the most FDR president we've had since that time and if you look at the actual policy he tried and successfully enacted some of it was legitimately beneficial for the middle and working class. It could've been better if Dems didn't have Sinema and Manchin standing in the way of it along with other factors but I'm digressing and none of that nuance was going to reach the masses. I went to trump's campaign website and a lot of it is vague and wasn't specific about tax credits other than a raise to $5k for the child credit. There is nothing specific for the housing crisis other than opening up non-specific federal land and ambiguity about removing red tape. I chose these two issues as they were the most easily identifiable for me and middle / working class people. Generally I do not see tangible ways to fully bring back the middle class from either political party besides maybe from Bernie Sanders and even less so from the GOP comparing them to the dems. I think you're spot on about the media. The mainstream traditional media is fox news. They're the most successful \\"news\\" in the country and to that end the GOP / republicans are the majority politically speaking. I would've assumed both political campaigns would have modernized their strategies to take digital / internet media into account. The dem's don't really have an apparatus like fox news but like you said there is more going on in media than just TV. Based on nothing but knowing his ties to Vance, I think Peter Thiel and Palantir's big data capabilities had more to do with Trump / GOP campaign efforts than can be understood right now. Combine that with Elon's control of twitter and other digital strategies, there's a lot of capability. I have little faith in dems and especially republicans right now in terms of fixing economic issues for the middle and working class. I am genuinely curious to know what Trump and the GOP intends to do for these Americans. Ok they got their big wins, whats actually going to happen now? And Dem's sure as fuck need to wise up about getting better on these issues and communication to voters. https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5170351/trump-harris-housing-costs-planhttps://apnews.com/article/child-tax-credit-poverty-cc423366a1a6f2299fb23ed169045b7b","title":"Barack Obama Voters Are Donald Trump Supporters Now"},{"text":"You are definitely one of the people that women of this movement will avoid.

The Plan B pill is most effective within 72 hours, I have no problem with that.Now to elaborate on the parasite argument, I often hear advocates for abortion claim the unborn \\"child\\" can not live outside the womb, so it has no rights and is nothing more than a virus. When I hear this, my eyes roll so far back into my head that I'm blinded with anger. Once composed, I then argue that a 2-year-old can't live autonomously either, so is it ok to kill a 2-year-old? Where is the line drawn?As you commented, it's a highly alienating stance, and if the pro-choicers? want to gain any ground with pro-lifers, they need to address the keystone to both arguments and find an agreeable answer to \\"When is it a baby?\\".Forced pregnancies. Ok, lets break that down a little because I see a few sides to this.Forced in the context of a woman being abused and the abuser forcing her to carry full term. That's abuse and a crime. Period....Forced in the context of a woman being legally required to carry full term if the pregnancy is detected far too late and it is not a threat to her life is what I think you're eluding to. Here is where the argument of life begins. Is it a baby at 9, 7, 6, 5, or 2 months? When is it considered murder? I think you will agree that everyone with a moral compass is against murder. Thus leaving us with our current situation of when abortion becomes immoral and a crime.?Until that question is finally decided, and agreeable to both sides, abortion will continue to be an issue. This is why I support individual states voting on issues like this. If you don't agree, dont live in that state. And I stand by that fully. My home state lost its damn mind about 16 years ago and started going in a direction I vehemently disagreed with. So I sold everything, packed up my family, and left to a state that did support my values. It wasn't easy, it wasn't cheap, and it caused all kinds of issues. But I don't regret it for a second.?And likewise, thanks for being civil; it's a rarity on Reddit.","title":"Yo, Im politically aligned quite far left, youd probably call me aWoke Liberal.

It is fair to say that figures throughout history integrate a then-contemporary understanding of the Bible into their arts and letters, but even the popular conception of biblical teachings evolve over time. Even within a narrow temporal frame, the Bible can be interpreted and cast numerous different ways. It's not a monolithic cohesive work, it's a weird amalgam of some accumulated works from COMPETING Yahweh/Abrahamic traditions. Judaism and Christianity are unalike and often in conflict, and Islam further complicates this mythological landscape. To say \\"knowing the book\\" and \\"their inspiration\\" and \\"their motivations\\" spackles over so, so many ideological and doctrinal cracks and crevasses. The real miracle of the Bible is that it can serve an unlimited range of personal creeds and biases, it can be deployed by anyone to suit any egotistical conception of divinity. This is precisely from where the proliferation of sects and denominations arises. The protestant reformation ignited an unquenchable fire of self-ascribed righteousness that is burning even brighter now with mystical magical pentatcostal fuel. Nothing is more absurd that starting a sentence with, \\"the Bible says...\\" and nothing is more true than starting a sentence with, \\"I believe the Bible means...\\"The Bible is very much like the Mirror of Erised in the Harry Potter movie, it reveals to you what you desire most. If you desire peace and charity in your life, you will find it there. If you long for wrath and conquest of others, you certainly will find that too. In the end, the bible serves egos, not the other way around. A customized conception of divinity and a personally embodies deity is the highest form of human vanity.Artist, political leaders, and rogues are free to interpret and use the Bible for their rhetorical purposes, and they do. Everyone does.","title":"The Trump Bible - Inauguration Day Edition in now on sale for $69.99.

Basis of appeal in Fox case. Will cover live:?\\nFox and Croft received a hung jury (one holdout) in April 2022 trial that resulted in the acquittal of 2 co-defendants. DOJ retried both men in August; they were found guilty. At issue in appeal is accusations of juror and judicial misconduct.?\\n9:00 AM  May 2, 2024\\nhttps://twitter.com/julie_kelly2/status/1786032914360062120?\\nLocal publication 2022\\nDoug Tribou: Croft and Fox were convicted of conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. Croft was also convicted of another explosives charge. They could receive life sentences. What stands out to you about the jurys verdict??\\nMatthew Schneider: Well, the case here is a bit different from the first one. In the first trial, there were acquittals and a hung jury. And you can obviously tell from how this case was put in by the government that the prosecution really sharpened its swords and changed its strategy approach to handling the case. What they really did is they focused more on the case as it relates to these defendants and what they did in the case prior to ever meeting the FBI.?\\nThe defense was that the FBI forced this upon them, there was an entrapment and the FBI was really behind it. But the government took the wind out of the defense's sails by explaining the fact that prior to these defendants ever meeting with an FBI undercover informant, they were already beginning the plot and they had Governor Whitmer in mind and they had violence in mind. That really rebutted the defense from the get-go.?\\nDT: The attorneys for Croft and Fox claimed the men were just big talkers goaded into action by undercover FBI agents, as you mentioned. In cases based on FBI investigations, that debate over was this entrapment is often central to a trial. If agents believe theres a dangerous plot unfolding, how is that decision made about the dividing line between making an arrest to keep people safe - in this case Gov. Whitmer - and gathering evidence that will eventually hold up in court??\\nMS: That's an excellent point, because I think that it is central to perhaps why we had a mistrial in the first place. Maybe if they would have gathered additional evidence, the case would have been stronger. The jury would have been more convinced than the two acquitted defendants. But then again, there are often reasons for officer safety. And why do you have to take down the case? Might not be precisely what you want to do it at the time, but nobody wants to get hurt in an investigation. And the government here felt that they had to do it then. But I think they'll always be second guessing on this and future cases about the appropriate time to end the investigation and begin a prosecution.?\\nDT: Do you see any avenue for Croft and Fox to make an appeal of their convictions??\\nMS: Yes, they certainly do [have an argument]. As a matter of fact, one of the most serious things that happened in this case was the fact that the judge severely limited the cross-examination of the defendants when they tried to cross-examine the cooperating witnesses in the case.?\\nhttps://www.michiganpublic.org/criminal-justice-legal-system/2022-08-24/analysis-strategy-shift-led-to-convictions-in-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-but-door-open-for-appeal","title":"I dont think she is very happy about Trump taking her state Isnt it great?

Do I have that right?Again the issue is, you are still claiming that California should get to decide whether to pay federal taxes or not because its the biggest and makes the most money, so it should not have to fund anything that might be harmful to itself. Again, correct?The problem still is as I said, if California gets to choose not to do that, then why shouldnt every other state get to choose as well? Oh, Texas has decided it doesnt like something the federal goverment is doing that benefits California but maybe harms Texas. Should it get to decide that? In your view, no, because California is bigger and makes more money. It should get to decide. But if California is the one deciding, then again, what is the point of the federal government at all? At that point California should just be its own state. But you claim you arent advocating for that. And you claim you believe in socialist programs.

However, who determines if those orders are illegal? Is each military member supposed to receive an order and then make a legal determination on their own? Is each one given an attorney who decides? Does the commanding officer decide for the unit? If so, who is he/she conferring with to make that determination?\\nFor example, let look at deportations. Assume the military is assigned to assist in rounding up specific illegal aliens. Assume they are associated with Tren de Aragua and the president has listed them as terrorists. That pretty much makes them part of the war on terror even though they may be on American soil. Can or should military units refuse to participate? What does that do to military discipline? Who decides if this is a legal order? Should a tech sergeant make that decision? Should a colonel make that decision? Should a general? See the problem.And what about the various Iranian, Chinese, and Venezuelan nationals that are known to have come into this country in the last 4 years during the Biden-Harris adminstration? Many of them are known to be part of the those countries intelligence and/or military. Is not using our military against known foreign spies and military assets a legal thing to do? Is this something that even an O-6 can answer? Most of the ones I know could not.So while it seems easy to say that the military will not obey orders, the reality is that the President is the Commander in Chief. And if his SUBORDINATES do not follow his orders, there are LEGAL ramifications for not doing so. And thus, they had better been very certain that they are legally correct BEFORE they disobey an order.You don't just get to say, let me ask an attorney before I obey your order sir, in the military. So unless some of these people are looking to be brought up on charges for disobeying orders, losing their pensions, and seeing themselves in prison, they will follow orders. There may be a couple at the upper level that will attempt something, but at the lower levels, those folks will follow orders whatever they may be. They do not have the resources that generals have. And they certainly do not have the political backing that some of the generals have. There are those who will seek to undermine our President even though doing so is treason. Hopefully, the first time any one of them does so, they get hit HARD by Trump's legal team and he does not have to put with such BS again.","title":"NEW: Pentagon Officials Are Already Conspiring Against Donald Trump"},{"text":"He also wants to move several departments of the government out of DC area to red states so they can be packed with MAGA.

His win with Latino men and Black men in particular, happened because strait laced Latino and Black men, are tired of fearing the criminal elements in both respective communities.

But, for the most part, these men are tired of the nuanced approach and want radical law enforcement and are blindly hoping that whatever comes, its able to separate the good from the bad correctly, which ..you know. Good for them for one last grasp I guess in trying to be apart of the America as promised, when it comes to if you face discrimination.

Where they could be blind and numb to anyone elses suffering but their own. And they think a guy like Trump and the men and women he appoints will hush the noise so they can enjoy their unbothered lives. It basically comes down to people really, really wanting to live in a reality that they want to live in, and not the reality they actually live in. And Trump promises that by promising a fantasy world of making America great again and democrats promise to help you cope with reality. And they dont want to cope with reality. They want to shape their reality. And theres more people right now that are like Cipher in the matrix, they are tired of eating sloop and want to just go back in, at any cost.

Trumps tariffs had several negative effects on the U.S. economy:\\t1.\\tIncreased Costs for Consumers and Businesses: The tariffs, particularly on Chinese goods, led to higher prices on a wide range of consumer goods and raw materials, such as steel and aluminum. This increase in costs was often passed on to American consumers and businesses, reducing their purchasing power and profit margins.\\t2.\\tRetaliatory Tariffs: Other countries, including China and the European Union, imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, hurting American farmers and manufacturers. This led to decreased demand for U.S. agricultural and industrial products, causing financial difficulties for many American producers.\\t3.\\tSupply Chain Disruptions: The uncertainty and additional costs associated with tariffs disrupted global supply chains, complicating production for manufacturers that relied on imported components. Businesses had to reevaluate their supply chains, which sometimes led to inefficiencies and additional expenses.\\t4.\\tReduced Investment and Growth: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies and tariffs led to reduced business investment. Companies hesitated to expand or invest in new projects due to concerns about the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions.\\t5.\\tSlower Economic Growth: The tariffs contributed to slower economic growth, as they negatively impacted both consumer spending and business investment. Various studies suggested that the trade war reduced U.S. GDP by a modest but significant amount.\\t6.\\tImpact on Employment: Some industries that relied on imported materials faced job losses or lower profit margins due to increased costs. For example, sectors like manufacturing and construction, which are heavy users of steel and aluminum, were affected by higher input prices.While some sectors, like domestic steel manufacturing, saw short-term gains, the broader negative economic impacts were felt across the economy.","title":"Cuban implies Trumps tariff threat having negative impact right now"},{"text":"\\"we keep trying the same strategy and failing.

He was a coward and backpedaled on his support for the trucker protests, he refused to call out persecution of conservatives in many contexts, and he was afraid to take a position against the absurd immigration policy in Canada before it was popular to do so.He has so far rejected the populist conservatives (lead by Bernier and the PPC) - if he extends an olive branch to them like Trump did with his coalition then Canada has a chance. If he doesn't then that signals he'll be another corrupt corporate hack in my opinion. Trudeau will be out for sure but I have little faith Canadians will replace him with anyone but another puppet.Even after such a terrible record for the left that has really run the country into the ground they still have 60% support among the population the only reason the \\"right\\" has any chance is because the left splits the vote. Canada does not deserve a conservative leader based on how their population votes in my opinion. They deserve to be run into the ground until their population actually gets it through their thick skulls.","title":"After Trump victory over Harris, Elon Musk says Justin Trudeau will be next to go"},{"text":"Just tell her women shouldnt vote.

Then there's the *costs* of surgeries which could be anywhere from $20,000 - $50,000 or more.The steps/ requirements/ costs vary, but my point is it's not something where anyone (kids or adults) is just showing up at school or doctors' offices and getting our procedures done over lunch hour.

Most people feel very strongly about paying taxes that don't support things that they don't believe in.  However, as a society, we decide what direction we go in based on who we vote for and the issues that are advocated on a national level.  \\n  \\nIn recent years, there has been a strong progressive movement that has focused on many social issues viewed important by progressive strongholds.  However, there has also been a reaction to those movements with large groups unhappy with them.  When these citizens went to vote, the winner was Donald Trump by a massive margin.  He had a sweeping electoral victory of 301 to 226, and he won the popular vote by ~4 million votes.  In addition, Republicans have won the senate by wide margin and are on track to win the house.  \\n  \\nFrom a voting standpoint, that's as clear a mandate as there has been in a long time.  \\n  \\nYou may feel that California clearly is against these policies so it shouldn't have to pay, but that's not how federal policies work.  From an objective view, California has seen it's voters reacting against many of their policies as well.  \\n  \\n* California has seen Democrat's lead dropped by ~10% from 2020 which is a huge amount.  \\n* California has seen a net migration out of the state with more people leaving California than entering it.  \\n* California has seen GDP growth slowdown with it being outpaced by many states who have seen quicker growth (note, in terms of quantity of growth, California is still near the top due to it's large size but from a percentage standpoint it's fallen to the middle of the states).  \\n  \\nFinally, many conservative states take in more money because many military bases and institutions are based there.  In general, building massive military complexes, nuclear silos, and other facilities are easier and cheaper to do in more rural areas.  There's also added security by its secluded nature.  A lot of money goes to them that way.  A lot of money also goes to rural states for food security.  Farmers receive billions in subsidy because the US feels it to be of strategic importance (similar to Oil and Gas industries).  Those investments largely give rural areas more tax money then they pay.","title":"CMV: Californians should not be obligated to pay federal taxes for policies that are directly harmful to us."},{"text":"They were plotting to steal it.

These are not issues unaddressed or not already successfully managed by Democrats. You just dont know that. You parrot right wing points. This economy is the envy of the world. 4% unemployment, GDP 2-3%, real wage growth, inflation in the 2-2.5% range. Equity markets at ATH. Look at data on immigrations trends - arrests at border are up, illegal immigration down, opioid related deaths down, rates of immigrant-related crime are much lower than those of US citizens. Immigrants, including illegals, are the rocket fuel of this economy. They are the offshore labor that we have onshore. Crime in general is on the decline from rates that peaked in 2020 when you know who was running the government. The problem is the media you refer to is not a reputable news organization. It doesnt fact check, get multiple sources, etc. These right wing places have not really broken any consequential news in our lifetime. And their conspiracies and slanted views of the world are supercharged through social media to reach infinitely more people today than these crazy fringe view would have ever attracted when the vast majority of media was held to a fairness doctrine standard.

That limit usually results in a coup and in many cases the establishment of a junta dictatorship. Seeing as how professional US military officers are and how allegiant they are to the Constitution (you swear and oath to defend the constitution, not defend the president), if a junta arose in the US it is a possibility they restablish the constitution but omly remove civilian leadership.

I'm a loyal American, and I know as all loyal Americans do that federal employees are basically superhumans. Every single one of the 2.7 million civilian federal employees is serving our nation in an absolutely vital position that our country would fall apart without. Every single one of them is precious, is vital, is a being of pure light, reason, eloquence. They all work harder than anyone on absolutely vital tasks. There's simply no fat to cut. How are they going to fix our schools when the Department of Education gets eliminatedI don't know. We've never ever educated children without it before. It scares me, thinking of a world without a federal Department of Education. How would we land on the moon, split the atom, develop chemical fertilizers? How would great novels be written, great music composed? How? For before the nation rose, the Department of Education was there. When John Smith drove the first piling of the Jamestown wall the Department of Education was there waiting for him. Some say it was always there, shining like a beacon the hillside as the first fish crawled out onto the land. Oh woe, oh lamentation, how terrible that the shining lamp should be snuffed out by the darkness. How are they going to start businesses when theyre unemployed and the SBA has been gutted?I don't know. It's simply impossible to capitalize a small business without a government loan. I do know that federal employees would find it trivially easy to run any business. After all, they are federal employees and as we have established, federal employees are simply above the rest of us. They should never ever have to suffer a downsizing, that's something the rest of us have to do. It's important to know your place in life. But without the SBA, I don't know how they could obtain the capital. If only there were large organizations people saved their money in. These organizations could then lend the money out at interest, and distribute the resulting profit to the people who save their money. Dark times ahead friend. Dark times. I wish you good fortune.

They can refine processes in their current plant to produce more, but theyve already shelved expansion (into Georgia I believe) in favor of capital conservation.Made in America and More affordable are going to be tough. Their R1 series retail at ~$80k. The R2 is planned for the 40-50k range, which may help.For whatever reason, the R1 series doesnt qualify for a full rebate which is a competitive challenge. The R2 should also address this. I also believe Elon is further aiming at those rebates though.And the last point can be tuned, but Rivian already owns much of their vertical capabilities.Point of this post is to add context that Rivian is highly managed and they have comprehensively addressed your suggestions. I do however think tariffs could be a significant challenge to longevity.Theyre currently losing 40+ thousand dollars for every vehicle they sell, and possess one major partner in Amazon. Their capacity to ramp up production is somewhat limited by this.I honestly think the best move for their survival is to hunker down and consider expanding horizontally as a more formal manufacturer EV offering. They do have like $(5 or 9)bn in liquid assets, but I have to imagine they are not too amped. hehThe next four years will likely be slim for Rivian.It is somewhat possible loosening fiscal policy gives someone a wild hair to partner with them.","title":"Rivian plans for new tariff structure following Trump's election: Even American made brands rely heavily on global supply chains.

Despite the medias apparent belief, democrats are not a monolith and do not all appreciate being pigeonholed into a specific candidate. I appreciate she was willing to buck her party and vote for somebody she doesnt particularly like because she felt her party took her voice away. I dont think democrats have yet fully realized this election was a referendum on their game playing. The verdict is in and the democrat elite has been rebuked. Doubling down and asserting democracy has been subverted is willful ignorance at this point. This should be a time of reflection for the left, but thats a hard, if not impossible, pill to swallow for people who have made it their lifes work to claim victim. If they continue down this path, it will lead only to obscurity and irrelevance. Should they choose that path, the world will be a better place. The choice is theirs: look inward and see if middle ground can be achieved through democratic processes or double down and continue the toward authoritarian tyranny. The choice is clear to me which is a better path, but only time will tell if they can lift the blinders of hypocrisy and learn to listen instead of pontificate and virtue signal.","title":"Rachel Maddow Insists Trump Voters Have Let Democracy Go"},{"text":"He got caught Toobin' off and didn't get fired for it","title":"Toobin warns GOP against probing Jack Smith: Doubt it would go so well for President Trump"},{"text":"This is the answer","title":"The First Order of Trump 2.0?

Our healthcare system is overburdened, our housing is overburdened, and our schools are overburdened.

The American government should prioritize the well-being and safety of American citizens.","title":"Reminder to Republicans, Trump is a billionaire landlord who owns a skyscraper in Manhattan. Elitism personified."},{"text":"I honestly dont think theyre thinking that deep. Its the same way Georgia elected a bunch of hardliners who promised to be tough on immigration - but then to the farmers chagrin, started with paying a law to require every person working in the state to show verifiable proof of citizenship* to get a job, with the intention of driving out illegal workers. But once the law passed the farmers were left with millions of pounds of food rotting in fields and orchards, and they begged the legislature to repeal the law. And youre 100% right about WFH. This is whats really sad. The Infrastructure Act that Biden signed included money for states to pay for local contractors to lay high speed internet to every front door of every house in America, prioritizing veterans, elderly, and disabled people. Virginia, where I live, got 750m to do this and should be finished in 2026, I think. The problem has been smaller towns, theres no incentive for the broadband industry to run the lines from the main pipe to the houses because the cost is like $1m per mile, and small towns its financially unviable for a for profit business to do. Just 19% of Americans live in areas classified as rural. So with the federal money, small businesses should flourish in small towns, and it should be easier for couples and families to relocate for remote work. Sadly, Dems spent more time debating culture war issues than talking about that this program means for the economy. It shouldve been a cornerstone of their achievements. But regardless, I hope to be hearing some great stories of the changes this will make for especially remote health care for elderly and disabled folks as rural healthcare is also in crisis.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"for years, whenever people would post exactly what you did, I would ask (and usually get downvoted) what you're prepared to do if he winsWell guess what?
