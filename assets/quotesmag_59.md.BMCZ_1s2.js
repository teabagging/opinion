Harris maintained the Democratic hold on the prosperous, well-educated inner suburbs around major cities. But in most of them, her partys margins declined relative to its 2020 results  The result was that in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Harriss margins in these big suburbs were closer to Hillary Clintons in 2016 than Bidens in 2020. That wasnt enough to withstand what Ive called the pincer move of Trumps concurrent gains in the smaller, mostly white, blue-collar places and the much more diverse urban cores. The most apt precedent for this election may be 1980. Laboring under widespread discontent, including over a raging bout of inflation, Carter tried to use his campaign to shift attention to the risks he said his right-wing rival, Ronald Reagan, represented, with some success: Doubts about Reagan did keep Carter close in the polls. But in the campaigns final days, voters decided that continuity with Carter represented a greater risk than change with Reaganand flocked to the challenger in crushing numbers. Reagans victory in 1980 solidified a realignment in American politics that began under his Republican predecessor, Richard Nixon. Reagan cemented working-class white voters into the conservative movements electoral coalitionboth white southern evangelical Christians and northern industrial workers in places such as Michigans Macomb Countywho became lastingly known as Reagan Democrats. Those voters remain a cornerstone GOP constituency: Even four-plus decades later, they were the two groups that supported Trump in the largest numbers on Tuesday.Many Republicans believe that Trump now has the chance to secure an equally significant shift in the party allegiance of Black men and Latino voters of both genders, who voted for him in historic numbers this week. That opportunity surely exists. But realizing it in a lasting way will require Trump and the Republican Party to maintain the support of millions of voters of color and justify their faith in him on the economy over any concern about policies such as mass deportation and more aggressive law enforcement.Read more: [https://theatln.tc/O4hjDlAm](https://theatln.tc/O4hjDlAm)","title":"What Swayed Trump Voters Was Bidenomics"},{"text":"Bro, theyre going to get mad.

They need someone to promise to take money out of politics, not take millions of dollars from corporations. They need someone to regulate the prices of Pharmaceutical drugs (not just insulin). They need someone to revamp the corporate ownership of the democratic party. This will take decades.

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n?

Tariffs are one tool in a long list of economic changes intended for the country.On their own, tariffs can help or hurt, depending on the context. Using the electronics example of computer parts (many of which are built overseas), simply slapping on a tariff overnight will increase the cost to manufacturers and leave them to decide how much, if any, of that tariff will be passed on to the consumer. That can make things more painful for consumers, no question.Then you look at EVs. Chinese EVs are moving heavily into Europe, and they've taken a quick hold over their own market in China. They are poised to undercut vehicles sold in America right now, and to such a degree that they would probably make investment in EVs for other businesses a massive loss. We've seen Trump call for massive tariffs on Chinese EVs to combat this, which can protect automakers invested heavily into American production, along with their employees.In that first example, part of the counter is that we've already seen work towards increasing silicon fabrication in the US. It's possible that businesses making those moves (like TSMC, the leading chip maker for advanced silicon nodes) get smaller or delayed tariffs that are based on their continued investment in shifting to American production. While that can still come with higher production costs for those companies (relative to cheap labor in SE Asia), the creation of high-skill, high-paying jobs should also mean more talent and money in the American economy.Throw on things like Trump's suggestion to use tariffs as a replacement for income tax, and there's a lot going on that has to be implemented, balanced, and seen as a whole.","title":"Trump-Vance Need To Fix The Debt Bomb Biden-Harris Created"},{"text":"Kind of fucking weird, since the GOP candidate in question, Lily Tang Williams, is worth somewhere between $4 and $8 million based on financial disclosure forms, and left a bunch of additional assets off of those forms?

Trump has a solid point of argument that can't be denied: Obama campaigned on stopping wars and closing gitmo. He left in 16 kicking the can on all of it, likely out of concern of the optics. Trump wins. Completed the negotiation and sets a timeline. Met with all the local stakeholders. Scheduled it for the next presidential term. Iraq and Afghanistan both.Biden wins, sticks to the timetable, Afghanistan folds like a wet towel, as expected. People complain Trump left it for the next person to clean up. Trump pulls a Grover Cleveland, and gets to say: I wanted to go back to back like any other President, but why are people mad that Biden was stuck cleaning up the mess him and Obama promised to clean?I hate the fucker, but goddamn that's a solid body blow. The numbers are plain to see in the state vote splits. Take Michigan for example: Trump has less votes overall than 2020. One Muslim mayor endorsed Trump, and the other said \\"vote your conscience\\". The result: Kamala lost at the top of the ticket, but Slotkin won her Senate race. I don't think misogyny played much part in a state with a wildly popular woman at Governor, who just literally sent a woman to the Senate. I don't think racism played much part in a state that solidly backed Obama twice.Michigan didn't even become *more Republican*, the numbers show it became less this cycle. Michigan voted protest at the top and then regrouped D down ballot. Gaza was the wedge here with the Muslim bloc.NC is even wilder. The black Nazi took a straight ass kicking almost 2:1. NC split the ticket: D governor and R President. NC, lots of bases, shit tons of veterans, a few who remembered Trump brought the boys home from the pointless wars. The DNC couldn't move the needle but again, Trump didn't make any mind-blowing gains, up less than 100k over 2020 so far. NC certainly didn't become more Nazi. This election was about wedge issues. Gaza. Inflation. But it's also plain as day that Democrats struggle to keep their coalition together too. The diversity of that coalition suffers from identity politics.

Can you honestly hold these arguments to those standards?Also on what basis are you claiming that Israeli and American citizens don't have a say over which politicians are elected and hold power in their country? Trump and Netanyahu didn't appear by magic. They didn't take power in a coup. They don't run terrorist organisations which have seized power. They won elections. They came to power in democracies where the will of the people has spoken.There is a clear distinction between the sway people have over their government in democracies vs non-democracies.As for Zionism, I think something you need to conceptualise is that your opinion doesn't matter in this. What we are conceptualising is how all hypothetical people who blame Zionists for Israel's actions use the word \\"Zionist\\", not how you do. I think we've firmly established that's not how you use it, and that's fine, but it's not relevant. So let's talk about how other people use it, seeing as this topic is about how other people use the word.There are a wide variety of meanings and I have given you multiple examples of other such meanings which are neither hypocritical in terms of not applying them to a Palestinians not antisemitic as it's based on someone's chosen beliefs rather than their ethnoreligious group. What is antisemitic or hypocritical about it saying that people who have pushed for conflict with Palestinians are responsible for the conflict?Btw Zionism comes from the German *Zionismus* which was used before *The Jewish State* in the Zionist document *Selbstemancipation* over a decade earlier.

A lot of these homes work seriously hard just to scrape by and when they see \\"their money going to others\\" they get upset and are \\"that's MY money.\\"  So a lot of social plans that Democrats put together take money from taxes and put it to social programs that benefit groups such as immigrants, homeless, etc (groups that a lot of these working class people are not a part of).  Then you add in businesses like Planned Parenthood which \\"promote the killing of babies\\" and \\"un-Christian principles\\" of contraptions for birth control.  All the while, the price of \\"essential goods\\" only get higher (double in some areas) during what they perceive to be \\"the President's economy\\" and well, that's that.

Quite insightful.","title":"A fatal miscalculation: masculinity researcher Richard Reeves on why Democrats lost young men"},{"text":"There are a couple of things I've been thinking about with a caveat that I don't fully trust reddit commentors, but am taking into account with my local subreddit and randos on national political subs:First and foremost, the economy. The Dems insisted the economy is recovering/doing fine post-covid. All the data would indicate that on a macro level, yeah. But the thing is, perception is reality to voters. Saying the economy is fine while people can't afford housing, food, utilities, transportation, education, etc. makes them seem out of touch and disingenuine. And I want to relate the economy with Democratic measaging on things like race, gender, sexuality, etc. Something they don't seem to understand is that economic justice is tied to social justice. MLK understood this, he even wanted an economic bill of rights and was not only a figurehead of this Civil Rights movement, but of the Poor People's Movement in the last year of his life. Money is power here, and it's not enough to say \\"we'll have legal protections for poc and lgbtq+\\" because, guess what? A big part of their plight is economic. Did the Dems actually have relief plans? Probably? But the messaging sucked. Not only that, but I see lots of \\"woke mob\\" retaliatory comments, which leads me to believe that the messaging made Dems appear to care more about poc and LGBTQ+ than, well, everyone and anyrhing else. Again, that's not to say social justice isn't an issue worth addressing, but only focusing on the social element and not the economic element of the issue was a missed opportunity to build solidarity in the working class.The other biggest issue is the candidate, the lead up to her being the nominee, and the way Dems run primaries/caucuses. While there wasn't a primary for Harris, and I get it - there wasn't really time to hold a primary, then fund and run a campaign because Biden did what old as dirt politicians do and didn't step down until the last possible moment - which was a detriment to their chances. But I want to talk primaries and what it says about the Democratic party: they freaked out like Republicans freaked out when Obama was nominated and elected. They don't run a primary, they run a coronation. They tried to do it with Hillary, they all but pressured Biden to be (remember how iffy he was about running in 2020?), tried to do it with Kamala. They begin their primaries, not in New York or LA or some other diverse, populous state. No, they start in Iowa. 86% white, rural Iowa. In fact, most of the first states to cast votes in Dem primaries seem to be majority white. Could it be that the Dems, despite their virtue signaling, have a bit of that systemic racism they say they care so much about dismantling? I personally would have loved to vote for Bernie or Warren in past elections, but by the time the primaries came to Pennsyltuckey they were all but off the ballot, and it's because those early numbers also influence how people will vote in those primaries. So, not quite as democratic as the democrats would like believe themselves to be. This is all to say that the Democratic party doesn't have a stellar democratic process. Kamala was not popular in 2020. The Biden administration didn't make her any more popular. Furthermore, they aliensted their progressive base to try and court Republicans - palling around with the fucking Cheneys was such an idiotic thing to do. This, coupled with a huge number of people that were not enthused with us giving weapons to Isreal in spite of obvious war crimes and civilian deaths...Speaking of foreign policy: Not just progressives, but plenty of Americans take issue with military aid while Americans go wanting for relief themselves. That's not to say we shouldn't help Ukraine - It's a much better look to help a country fighting off a foreign invader, us with our marketing material of national sovereignty *and* it's against our most antagonistic adversary (Russia). But people couldn't help but notice the ethnic makeup of Ukraine and Palestine and draw their own conclusions that Dem's trying to sell social justice domestically didn't translate to action overseas. But this election failure on the side of the Dems has been in the making for a number of years, and they never reversed the trajectory of the GOP consolidating power as they have. They let the GOP break the rules with Obama's SCOTUS pick. They let the GOP shield Trump after a first impeachment and after a literal fucking coup attempt. Why? Because Dems can't help but follow the rules and hope to reach across the aisle to preserve or improve the system the GOP is actively trying to destroy. Not that I encourage extrajudicial action, but Trump and those in his orbit committed treason by the book and should be in jail. If the other side is going to break the rules, you have a bit of license to bend them, damn the consequences. I know they were scared of retaliation, but now they've lost everything. Trump *is* the Republican Party. Fascist movements tend to die when the demagogue is out of the picture, and the Dems just let him walk. These monumental failures of course-correcting democracy made them look weak, so what hope do we have that they can really do anything against the now inevitable authoritarian takeover of the country? My only true hope is that the Democratic Party more or less implodes and leadership with some popular awareness spinters off or takes over. I'm not advocating a blue Trump, but a realignment of values and strategy, because clearly what the Dems have been doing isn't working, both on the campaign trail and in the halls of government. And now we're all going to get fucked because of it.PS. I know I related a lot of issues back to ethnicity and race, and that may be an icky thing to talk about. I didn't even mention abortion, mostly because a number of states voted to enshrine abortion protections into their constitutions. People like progressive policy and protecting their rights, it turns out. Trump said he'd leave it up to the states, and the states put it on the ballot, and now those states that voted for it have it. Whether or not Trump will persue a national ban depends on his mood and what his handlers tell him to do (I'm more afraid of Trump's orbit than Trump himself), but to those voters that had abortion on their ballot, they probably felt like their vote would settle the issue. It remains to be seen if that will be the case, but something like marijuana also has federal restrictions with state legalization, so even if the fed tries to limit abortion access, there's a chance it's not enforced on a state level. Then again, we all know Trump makes states kiss the ring for any hope of federal assistance with anything. But back to why I focused on race and lgbtq+. It was a core of Dem messaging and has been for a while, but the Democrats repeatedly were percieved to be acting against their own marketing material, making them seem disingenuous and unfocused on things like the economic struggles of, well, everyone including poc and lgbtq+. Again, you can't have social justice without economic justice.","title":"Democrats begin soul-searching C and finger-pointing C after devastating loss"},{"text":"They're voting for a smart daddy over a stupid mommy","title":"A fatal miscalculation: masculinity researcher Richard Reeves on why Democrats lost young men"},{"text":"Is there any evidence to support this idea: [Exit polls show trans issues arent among voters top concerns](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/exit-polls-show-trans-issues-aren-t-among-voters-top-concerns/ar-AA1tzEwo)It's important not to overreact to the results of the election.

But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.That's from Thomas Paine's Common Sense - which I've often seen noted as key propaganda which led to the US revolution or at least to it looking somewhat like it did. That said, what we got was... Not entirely what Paine had fully advocated for at all. That bit I quoted always makes me think of MLK Jr's Letter from Birmingham Jail:I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, **who is more devoted to \\"order\\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice**; who constantly says: \\"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \\"more convenient season.\\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. Mostly sharing because I think you're right that it goes back that far and even further in some senses. The counter revolutionary ideal winning out in a way that let's the steam of the movement they're resting on to begin with dissipate isn't new.And while we don't use the term Tory in the US at this point, I think Paine is 100% on point in American Crisis:Every Tory is a coward; for servile, slavish, self-interested fear is the foundation of Toryism; and a man under such influence, though he may be cruel, never can be brave.Some things have never changed.","title":"Democrats Should Have Listened to Bernie Sanders, Historians Say"},{"text":"To some extent, and that was before he was granted full immunity from prosecution by the Supreme court.","title":"Trump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies"},{"text":"I would love to see him leave because I cant stand him","title":"And here we go.

After all, repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result is the very definition of insanity. Out of all the hundreds of millions of Americans, who really thinks these are the best two candidates...? Is it a wise tribe that does not send its best warriors to fight? You see, your masters will never give you the tools to dismantle their houses... The Republic of America has a so-called \\"representative democracy.\\" How can that be true when the \\"representatives\\" are wealthy while the \\"represented\\" are not? American two party politics is like the cartoon Tom and Jerry. Tom doesn't really want to catch Jerry because then he'd be out of a job, and Jerry doesn't want Tom replaced with a cat that will actually eat him. So they act like they hate one another and put on a show for the masses while continuing business as usual in the back room. For example, insider trading laws do not apply to any members of Congress, either side. What's it called when those who make the rules don't have to live by them? Furthermore, when the punishment for a crime is only a fine, it does not apply to the wealthy. Sure, they can say they let us \\"vote\\", but with all the lobbying and money in American politics, America is as much a democracy as would be two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner or asking a child if they would like to go to bed at 7:59 or 8:01. In America, the wealthy have won every \\"election,\\" and the only thing to trickle down in the economy has been their generational wealth. This is why, in a true democracy as the ancient Greeks understood it, people got their representatives the same way we would get a jury. America is not a democracy. \\"Only those who do not seek power are qualified to hold it.\\" PlatoAnd please remember what we were actually celebrating on the 4th. A cabal of stolen land entitled elite, slave owning aristocrats, found a way to get out of paying their taxes. Only thirty percent of the colonists supported the \\"revolution\\" with the rest saying, \\"Why trade one tyrant a thousand miles away for a thousand tyrants one mile away...?\\" System isn't broken it's functioning exactly as intended. Why own slaves when you can rent them for a fraction of the cost (read the 13th amendment)...? But the real question they must be asking themselves is how can their grand social experiment survive contact with the real time information/communication age, which is where we are now...","title":"DNC chair calls Sanderss criticism straight up BS"},{"text":"Dems were amped into a frenzy in 2020.

Its deeper than that. By the 50s and 60s our own government largely knew that the American people were too stupid to protect themselves from the kind of propaganda the 20th century had given us access to. Thats why we felt the need to brainwash our own citizenry through domestic propaganda during the Cold War. The Cold War eventually ended and the propaganda machine was slowly dismantled, which left space for the media companies to fill in the void left by the lack of government-based, pro-American propaganda. The media companies invaded the American consciousness, and now we get to see first hand why our leaders during the Cold War feared the power of the media so much. It was only a matter of time until someone came along and took advantage of that media system to control the masses, and that seems to have been exactly what happened. It sure doesnt feel like a coincidence to me that the chunk of people in this country who are functionally illiterate seems to overlap strongly with the parts of the country who voted Trump back into power. But sadly, this really isnt the fault of those people. They are stupid and gullible and have been fed a steady diet of brainwashing and lies. The propaganda machine is more of the problem than the people themselves are. The issue is, the propaganda today is way more effective than what we were doing back then, and on a certain level, the only way to counter it is with propaganda of your own, something Dems in this country didnt seem willing to do, so here we are.","title":"Democrats Should Have Listened to Bernie Sanders, Historians Say"},{"text":"This is an amusing joke but, I dont think moving away from toxic brand of racial/gender identity politics is necessarily bigotry.There is some basic civility and good intentions with political correctness worth keeping but, the Party did momentarily lose its mind around 2016-2020.","title":"Dems for the next 4 years"},{"text":"Why?

Across a broad span of countries and partisan leanings, people who value freedom, democracy, and the rule of lawincluding leaders of government, opposition parties, civic activists, businesspersons, journalists, or ordinary citizenswatched with growing trepidation as political polarization intensified in the United States and Donald Trump drew closer to retaking the White House.

Is it because there is a lack of teeth to alot of it? Sure. Is it because some of these policy take 5-10 years to bear fruit? sure as well. But the dems need to, imo, stop trying to turn R voters. Trying not to be to cynical, what ever it is the R voters want does not seem to align well with what a Leftest or more progressive Dem would want, trying to bridge that gape hurt them more then it helps.

I think his exact words to the campaign managers was literally: \\"Those are our people. Why are we not down there?\\" He called it in 2016. The Rust Belt voted for Trump.The issue is that the Democrats keep thinking that going high and talking policy is going to work against a populist demagogue like Trump. It won't. To many Americans, those actions are the same that resulted in their current disillusions with the system. That being said, the issue isn't the Presidency. The issue is the Legislative, which has been in a state of dysfunction I would say long before even Bill Clinton. They've increasingly passed their responsibilities and some of their powers over to the executive and we've had nothing but continuing resolutions for a few years now. America may not realize it, but their frustration isn't with the President -- it's with the Legislative; however, the Executive acts as a massive scapegoat FOR the Legislative (because it's easier to remember one person on top and focus all your blame on them versus a bunch of other Senators/Reps) and there is a weird practice where constituents don't blame their own Senators and Reps, they blame the others.There has to be a greater outreach towards voters in those rural states, but they have to change up their tactics. Americans clearly don't care if you \\"go low\\". They want to be told there are solutions, even if it's a borderline lie because the status quo is not working for them. This is how demagogues like Trump get power in the first place as they tell people what they want to hear.Additionally, they need to start holding the billionaire class to account and show the American people that they are. There are a few things that both Republican voters and Democrat voters actually agree on: the removal of gerrymandering, the removal of money in politics, protections for social security, etc..

Companies did merge with the state, the way it was done was essentially nationalization, with some autonomy granted by the party because when these industries were taken over, they were given to card carrying party members. The distinction between this and direct nationalization is incredibly thin. Hitler also created a massive union for workers.The thing about Nazism and by extension Fascism, is that they are collectivist and totalitarian, and *expansionist*. Therefore, and the left hates hearing this, its strongly on the left. There arent many things that actually separate communism and fascism other than how they practically applied their regimes, and what their commune was. For Hitler it was the German race, for Stalin it was the working class, and for Mussolini it was the Italian people. They all favored totalitarian collectivism and were all aggressively expansionist. Communism, unlike Italy and Germany, still believed in an international revolution. Many people forget that even before Hitler and Mussolini became relevant the communists had formed Comintern that advocated for an international revolution (and was succeeded by Cominform).Add to all of this that, as another commenter said, Hitler hated the Jews because he said that they were international capitalists. The reason that communists and the burgeoning Nazi part kept fighting in the lead up to Hitler becoming chancellor, was *not* because they were diametrically opposed in ideology. They disagreed on how to apply socialism (so example 1,304,678 of the left eating itself)So you have 3 ideologies that are totalitarian, collectivist, and believed in aggressive expansion. This is far from what the right would be propping up. What frustrates me the most is that historians (I am guessing that they are somewhat lefty in their own right) defend the notion that fascism is on the right which logically just does not make any sense. Unless we are talking about strictly leftist forms of government where national socialism and Italian fascism are slightly to the right of that, then sure they are on the right.","title":"Liberals dont actually know what fascist means"},{"text":"Yes but...everyone wants to move their asses now when all this would've been nice BEFORE the election even took place.","title":"Biden to push through anti-Trump plans as he vows to make last days in office count"},{"text":"I would love to hear them but I don't have any power so I don't want to waste your time or energy.

Harris was a bad pick, even before you consider her as a person. When the economy is the number 1 issue for voters, no serious person whos not insanely partisan, could *possibly* believe the sitting Vice President is the candidate for change in this election. They needed someone who could distance themselves from the Biden Admin, not somebody who defended it at every turn. Democrats skipped their primary and completely missed this utterly massive weakness as a result. 2. Harris was a bad candidate on top of that, both on policy and on engagement. She had no real platform, no real solutions, aside from look at me! Im not Trump!! dont vote for Big Racist hes Big Bad and thats Not Good!! When asked about grocery prices, she blamed some vague corporate greed and promised free money to first-time homebuyers, but had no tangible answer to how the fuck that has *anything* to do with groceries. Her nomination was official in late July and her first unscripted, major press event was a CNN interview on August 30th. A full month after she was nominated. That was supposed to be a soft-ball interview, but she crumbled trying to explain her massive pivots on healthcare and decriminalizing the border between the 2020 primary and now. My guess is that she inherited Bidens staffers and she agreed to run their hide the nominee strategy her engagement was so bad that her campaign came out after the debate and said theyd do more media. 3. Further on engagement- while Kamala racked up Hollywood celebrity endorsements, Trump was doing multi-hour podcasts with influencers who have real reach with younger votes who lean Conservative but dont vote reliably. Like. My wife is also Conservative, and she loves Taylor Swift *no shit* shes a Democrat, everyone knows that, everyone knew that, it changes absolutely nothing for her to endorse Harris. 80% of her audience is already Democrat and the other 20% just wanna hear music and not politics, they couldnt care less who she endorses or doesnt endorse.

He is responsible for a right-wing shift in culture, the reduction of minorities in society, the proliferation of the Christian Conservative, the fattening of the 1%'s wallet. Obama ran on changes to the social system and underdelivered with the ACA. Biden fought for the soul of America, and well... he lost that fight. They election turn out in 2024 ended up looking like this:Trumps' total votes from the time he was defeated in 2016 was about 74.2 million votes. His current vote count as of this post is 73.4.

You can argue that what it means it the EC isn't representative or is causative for the Democrats losing, but the reality is that they've lost elections following successful administrations with high approval numbers, and only really won when there was some major factor dooming the republicans (watergate, Perot, financial crisis, Trump/Covid).Actually I think its even more damning if they've won the popular vote because that means they've had popular support but the parties national election body, (and btw the state bodies where they're behind in governorship and local legislature across a majority of states), hasn't been able to convert said popularity into actual election wins.There's really 0 reason the Democrats shouldn't have won landslides in at least 2000 and 2016 at least and somehow they lost. 2000 should have been a runaway, the US had the longest period of economic prosperity in a row at the time, Gore was favored to handle most issues, the administrations approval rating was 62. The party ran away from the message of continued prosperity and allowed the republicans and Karl Rove to have free reign over messaging, not to mention Lieberman did nothing for the ticket and alienated progressives, Tipper Gore had spent the previous decade railing against explicit music (and thus freedom of expression) and the DNC was convinced that none of it mattered because Gore had such a lead going in with big-states that they didn't really need to push the message too hard. 2016 they doomed themselves by picking Clinton and suppressing any real primary challengers.

Provide opportunities everyone can benefit from regardless of race. Once people are divided along racial lines you have unfair treatment that leads to bitterness along racial lines.

Heck, even Trump seemed to adopt this approach when people asked things like what are you gonna do for this race or this group, he would respond that he would focus primarily on economic output that would benefit everyone.

Biden made his campaign about himself and positioned himself as the only answer to Trump instead of actually uplifting the rest of the DNC like he said he would. Biden fumbled the bag in maybe the most iconic and tragic debate performances in history. Something that shouldve been a layup became an absolute failure- and that reflects in the result we see today. Biden was also stubborn and reinforced that he was the only one strong enough to beat Trump in a moment when it was important to be open and excited about possibilities. He lied about not running again. Biden ran on fear, status quo, and opposition. The Whig party would have been proud.The DNC was too focused on hushing descent and not listening to peoples base desires and needs. There was not a real robust primary held to hammer in on messaging that would activate the base for elections down ballot and to consider the future of the party. There was almost no time spent highlighting the rising stars within the party, except for when Biden was under question. The DNC does not understand populism, and its exactly why Clinton lost, why Bernie is still an icon, and why Trump remains a dark force within this country. The active voting population right now listened to their paychecks from yesterday, and apparently nothing else.Harris had to choose between distinguishing her own platform or taking up Bidens bones, and picked somewhere in between that didnt capture people like she would have hoped.

Someone would be mistaken to do so but would not be a hypocrite or an antisemite if it was a simple error.Moving on to Israeli, no, I do mean that Israelis have a greater responsible for Israel's actions than Palestinians have for Hamas and I disagree that it is zero-sum.One of Israel's main arguments to secure support is that it is the only democracy in the Middle East. The point of a democracy is that the government reflects the will of the people, albeit imperfectly, therefore saying that the Israeli public as a whole is more to blame for Israel's actions is neither antisemitic (it's a race less and religionless analysis which can be applied equally to any democracy) nor hypocritical (Gazans do not live in a democracy and can't influence Hamas in the way Israelis can). It isn't inherently hypocritical or antisemitic to hold the people of democracies as somewhat culpable for the actions of the government they elected.Moving onto Zionism, I think the key thing to recognise is that there is no single definition of Zionism and your wanting vs supporting split doesn't work either. The problem is if you get a dozen people knowledgeable about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a room you'll have somewhere between 6 and 12 different definitions of Zionism.What Id suggest as an example is this essay from Judaism, a quarterly journal: https://www.bjpa.org/content/upload/bjpa/rede/Redefining%20Zionism.pdfIn it the author talks about how Zionism has lost all meaning and trying to use the original definition of someone who wants Israel to exist, where by almost every Jew and every person critical of Israel can still be classified as Zionist simply by virtue of wanting there to be some form of Israeli state, is both pointless and doesnt match actual use. He offers an alternate definition with multiple criteria where the last one of *unqualified* support for Israel, matches my personal definition I gave very closely.By my definition, Zionist is a specific subset of people supporting the Israel who have pushed for and excused Israeli war crimes and human rights abuses. It would seem fair to blame such people for the consequences of their philosophy.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Yes I am.

Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2 to 6.8 percent. It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.\\nMass deportations would cause significant labor shocks across multiple key industries, with especially acute impacts on construction, agriculture, and the hospitality sector. We estimate that nearly 14 percent of people employed in the construction industry are undocumented. Removing that labor would disrupt all forms of construction across the nation, from homes to businesses to basic infrastructure. As industries suffer, hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born workers could lose their jobs.&amp;nbsp;[Source](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation#:~:text=Beyond%20the%20direct%20financial%20cost,workers%20could%20lose%20their%20jobs.)&amp;nbsp;I guess you'll be ecstatic about not only breaking up and ripping apart innocent families to be incarcerated in private prisons, you'll be totally thrilled by the devastating impact on the economy when not only are we spending BILLIONS amounts of dollars on deporting these people, but also tanking the economy by removing their contributions to it.

Anger over Mitt Romney's running a campaign that seemed designed to lose is what produced the Republicans embracing Donald Trump for 3 elections, because at least Trump in the eyes of his supporters was fighting to win.An analysis of how the Democrats wasted $1.4 billion on Kamala Harris' campaign will reveal the Democratic equivalent of Project Orca for Romney, just like I called well before election day:https://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/romneys-orca-program-sank-083653?hp=f1 Instead, Romney campaign officials were mostly flying without instruments on Election Day. Numerous Republicans in and around the Romney campaign called the ORCA platform a total bust, stranding thousands of volunteers without a way of reporting data back to headquarters and leaving Romney central command without a clear view of developments on the ground. The system was not shared with officials outside a small group in Boston and was kept largely a secret until the immediate lead-up to Election Day. The system was beta-tested on its own but not within technical infrastructure of the Boston TD Garden, where the Romney campaigns massive War Room was set up. As I have said for years about Romney's campaign, you cannot sell yourself as the rational and competent group in politics if you yourself are not rational and competent in how you run your political campaign.   Romney's incompetence managing his own campaign  destroyed for a decade inside the Republican Party respect for Romney's approach to politics.Whether the Democrats will manage a similar break in 2028 from those who advocate running campaigns designed to lose remains to be seen.","title":"How Kamala Harris plowed through $1 billion"},{"text":"So the culture war has finally begun to shift towards modesty.  \\n![gif](giphy|AuwBPJztsEWkw)","title":"I hear liberal women no longer want to have casual sex, get pregnant or date conservative men."},{"text":"Delicious!","title":"Democrat Strategist James Carville: Trump Win Is Sickening and Depressing"},{"text":"He is talking in generalities.

One example that strikes me is that you have slogans like The future is female at a time when theres a 20% gap in college enrollment in favor of women. A gap which Democrats have no plan to address.

Merit is valued more than the idea of \\"equity\\" for its own sake. And there's a cultural emphasis on education and success rather than falling into a perpetual victimhood mindset. To be honest, it's not all that different from the values seen in many Asian communities too.There's a preference for traditional values (to a degree) over radical shifts in society and white liberals would be keen to recognize and accomodate for that. If liberals want to move forward, they really need to ditch some of the toxic parts of progressivism, especially what some would call cultural Marxism. That means moving away from rejecting meritocracy, which values hard work and talent, and avoiding doomerism that undermines the American Dream. Constantly bashing personal responsibility and the value of hard work only gives liberals a bad reputation.On strictly social issues, Latinos in the U.S. tend to occupy a moderate space when it comes to politics. They're neither as conservative as evangelical Christians, nor as liberal as white progressives. This moderation is especially noticeable on social issues like abortion. While many Latinos hold personal pro-life views, they are often persuaded to support pro-choice policies because there isn't a strong emphasis in their culture on imposing one's values on others. However, liberals sometimes go too far on the messaging. Latinos generally see abortion as a tragic and difficult decision, the least-worst option. They see it as heartbreaking for a family. Some liberals on the hand, especially more extreme voices, speak about abortion in a way that feels gives way to zero nuance. For example, perceived complete disregard for the value of a fetus by some pro-choice advocates is something that often appears ghoulish to Latinos. Basically, they exist in the center and they are up for grabs for those that can moderate, listen and speak to them.","title":"\\"Dems lost because the woke scared away white people\\" son or \\"dems lost because they weren't progressive enough\\" daughter"},{"text":"The felony thing is hilarious.

I knew Trump would win here.  But he won by a much bigger margin than I had expected.In 2016, Trump's margin of victory over Hillary Clinton was 8.99%.**[2016 County Map](https://i.imgur.com/8p0pyUz.jpg)**  (Shows which counties were red and which were blue.)  As you can see, South Texas along the border was a Democratic stronghold.  Majority Hispanic residents.In 2020, Trump's margin of victory over Biden was 5.58%**[2020 County Map](https://i.imgur.com/m7JZgdf.jpeg)**Since 2020 many people from California and some other liberal states relocated to TX and the libs were thinking Texas could turn blue - or at least come closer to turning blue.  And yet with 99% of the vote counted, Trump's margin of victory was a whopping **[13.9%](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/texas/?r=0)*[2024 County Map](https://i.imgur.com/m1OVWm3.jpg)**Notice how all those counties in South Texas along the border are mostly red now?  The few left that are still blue are small population countie except for Nueces County (Corpus Christi) which leaned red in 2016.  You can get an idea of the size of the county by the size of the dot in **[this map](https://i.imgur.com/FW6WMKE.png)**The four big counties (Population-wise) in South Texas are:- Hidalgo County - 898,000 - McAllen, Edinburgh,\\n- Cameron County - 421,000 - Brownsville, Harlingen\\n- Nueces County - 353,000 - Corpus Christi\\n- Webb County - 267,000 - LaredoThe other three counties in South Texas with larger populations (and many of the smaller ones) that used to be blue have turned red and I can't help think that it's because of Kamala Harris' failure as the Border Czar.---\\nThat was the post.Since then, I've had time to think about it a little more and I'll just say this.  It's not all about the border.  It's about something else as well.Hispanics in Texas are pretty ultra-conservative when it comes to family values.  They believe there are two sexes - male and female.  They don't use the she/her  he/him  they/them pronouns. They don't think biological males should be able to identify as a woman in order to compete in women's sports, and as a rule, they don't take their 8-year old children to drag shows.  They generally don't think children should have sex changes until they reach the age of 18.  They think it's ridiculous that if you accidentally misgender someone you could possibly lose your job because you offended some poor little woke snowflake.  And yet the Democratic Party is always shoving these values that they don't agree with in their faces day after day after day and they are sick of it.  And quite frankly, so am I and I'm not Hispanic.  But I am totally disgusted with the Democratic Party and their identity politics and their extreme \\"wokeness.\\"  That and abortion are all the Democratic party ever talks about.  Well that and \\"Vote for me because I'm not Trump.  Sorry Dems, that ain't gonna cut it.  They want to hear what the Democrats are gonna do about the economy and immigration.  Those where the top two issues in Texas and every other state I looked at.  To his credit (and I hate saying this) Trump did campaign on themes focused on the economy, including tariffs, immigration and tax policies. Harris did not and chose to focus on abortion in the hopes that enough women would go to the polls to get her over the finish line.  She gambled and she lost.I didn't vote for a single Democrat or Republican when I early-voted in TX, which means I hardly voted in any of the downballot races.  I voted Green where I could, and other third party candidates where a Green option wasn't available.  But there were tons of races where it was  between an R or a D, and there were were many others where it was a D running unopposed.  I refused to cast a ballot in any of those races.I'll leave you with this:**[Democratic strategist issues hard truth to party members after losing election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJDcAKNr7o)**Listen to what the lady in the white suit says.

She wanted to protect women's reproductive rights on a national scale. She said she had a plan to create 3 million new homes throughout the country, which would not only increase the supply that we need so badly, but also make a lot of homes more affordable. And I assume she would have also tried to reinstate the regulation that Trump rolled back, the one where corporations had to wait one month before they could place a bid on a property that was listed. That's why all of the homes are being bought up so quickly by companies like Black Rock right now, because Trump rolled back a regulation which prevented them from buying homes the moment they hit the market, which has made it very hard for regular people to get a home because they are competing against corporations offering 10% above market cash offers. She also wanted to unite the country and bring back normalcy in politics instead of dividing us more, and I'm pretty sure all of the things I just mentioned are what most of us would refer to as positive change.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

Both are evil, but I would go as far as to say that (Italian) fascism and National Socialism are incompatible with each other. The former is racist in a nationalist way (i.e. if you live in the kingdom of italy, you are a part of the state. But everyone outside the state is inferior), while the latter was racist in a biological way (e.g. everyone who was not a nordic-germanic aryan with a 57cm skull circumference, is inferior). This means that co-governance would actually be impossible because the fascists would have to execute people whom they considered to be equal under the state but the nazis viewed as racial inferiors. The Jews are a good example of this. Hitler tried to persecute Italian Jews, but mussolini never really cooperated. Funny thing is there were 10,000 Jews in the fascist party of Italy. Oh and, would you believe me if I told you the philosophical founder of fascism (Giovanni Gentile) helped Jews escape from National Socialist custody? Mussolini was staunchly opposed to Hitler's anschluss of austria, and he sent divisions into the mountains of northern Italy to deter Hitler. Also, there are tonnes of quotes by Mussolini, Hitler, and Goebbels where they talk down on each other's ideology. Hitler thought that Mussolini's fascism was crap. Hitler also claimed to be \\"a true socialist\\". So there's that.It was only when they were in the same sinking ship that they decided to team up (both were excluded from the league of nations, both were facing economic sanctions from the west).

They had to have music stars host free mini shows to get people to come to her rallies.If they are Bernie supporters, I'd let you know that the one positive (whether you believe it or not), is that hopefully the DNC gets back to the Obama/Bernie/Occupy Wall Street sentiments of why are we still at war, and why haven't we even audited the federal reserve properly.There's things we can agree with Bernie supporters on.

Ever.There is no middle ground there. There is a fundamental disagreement in morality.We've been watching the masks come off of Trump voters real fast this time around. They are saying the quiet parts out loud. \\"Ban abortion in all cases\\", \\"ban transgender care for minors\\", \\"Deport, deport, deport\\", \\"Your body, MY choice.\\", \\"You have the rights I say you have\\", \\"This is a Christian Nation\\", \\"Ban gay marriage\\", \\"No homosexuals\\", and \\"You will become slaves\\" these are things that a large group on the right have been saying for the last 24 hours.What middle ground would you have us find with these people? If you broke bread with those people and joined their cause, while the rest of us have been warning you, then you deserve what's about to happen to this country. It won't be pretty. It won't be kind. Millions of Americans are in danger. So I'll be protecting the queer community, my friends and famiky, I'll be protecting those that chose to fight for the rights of others over self-interested, economic bullshit - when we know that nobody, NOBODY is bringing prices down right now. Trump is not going to fix any of the economic woes of the country. He just isn't. That is a fact.Prices will go up, he is about to reverse the course on inflation, and due to his immigration reforms the prices of food, construction and basic services will skyrocket. Then the tariffs will hit and the prices of EVERYTHING ELSE will raise.He isn't draining the swamp. The guy he wants in the FDA doesn't believe in vaccines.

So prices will rise and more and more Americans will lose everything. So nah. The answer wasn't to reach out to these fuckers, we tried that. Harris went right. She got snubbed.My answer is simple. I'll keep working on my networks. I'll keep helping people on the left set up theirs. I will ensure everyone is vetting the people coming to ours through social media. And I will absolutely ensure that people on the right are excluded. You lose your house due to the inability to afford repairs and end up on the street because prices skyrocketed over the deportations YOU voted for? That's fine by me, you voted to take away the rights from people I love, so I will happily watch you starve. You aren't welcome in the soup kitchens I run. You can't afford clothing for your kids and it's winter? Fuck off, my donations are going to organizations that were ensure it goes to the most in danger of us all queer groups. Your trying to flee your conservative state to get access you need to survive your pregnancy? Nah fam, me and the folks I work with to drive women out of states with bans and help them get that healthcare they need, up to and including abortion have already started building social media based black-lists.In short, if you voted for the shit show that's coming, I intend to ensure you sleep in that bed, and I will mock you for it.

I've had no less than six attempts in the last 3 weeks to light my pride flag on fire. It was stolen the day after the election. I've bought a second one and put it up, and found a note, typed out that said \\"If you put one up again, we will burn your fucking house down.\\" in it's place this morning.So nah.

Left-populist policies are *unpopular* when implemented, because many of them are just straight up *bad policies*. The idea that Biden failed on messaging is, in my view, pure cope. \\nNow, I do think that erring on the too high side was the right move for fiscal stimulus, as proven by Europe, but Biden kept doubling down on it well past the point where it was clear we were already entering an inflationary environment. The best *defense* of Biden is that he implemented so many rules around spending the money that much of it is still left unspent [and Trump will eventually see the benefits from it. lol.] \\nAnyway, Trump promises all the populist economics you could ever desire *and*, for the cherry on top, also offers you a form of social conservatism that's actually pretty close to the median American's point of view. That's a far more compelling sell to Americans than left-wing economics *and* social policy. Democrats are getting left with a coalition of people who are *not* keen on big spending--the college educated, upper and middle classes, and they better get used to that fact--those white suburban voters are not happy about Biden's behavior, and were willing to even swing a few points back to Trump because of it.\\nDemocrats need to turn towards fiscal conservatism ASAP. It's the best way to criticize and sabotage a Trump administration that will likely undermine the fed and continue to run outrageous deficits, while also massively hiking tariffs--Democrats need to get on the pro-free-trade line too, because Americans aren't going to like the spike in the prices of their iThings.
