Since the 1960s, the price of homeownership has risen twice as fast as inflation, and rents have climbed?five times faster than wages. A collapse in housing construction has squeezed supply, and homelessness has reached?record highs. Voters this year consistently named housing as one of the?top financial issues?they face.Given his background as a real estate developer, the president-elect might seem like a logical ally of the nationwide push to reduce barriers to new housing. The YIMBY movement (for Yes in My Backyard) started about a decade ago, when Sonja Trauss, a math teacher with a masters degree in economics, started?organizing renters?in San Francisco to show up at planning commission meetings to support proposed housing, countering the powerful voice of the?NIMBYs, residents who were hostile to new development, often because they had home values to protect.Adherents of the YIMBY movement pressed for denser construction as a remedy to unaffordable housing, and activists in other cost-burdened parts of the country formed their own organizations. With a supportive building industry, cities and states started drafting bills to unwind zoning restrictions on multifamily construction, and by the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot of them passed. In 2022 the Biden administration was talking about reducing regulatory barriers to jump-start homebuilding. Both?Kamala Harris?and Trump made promises to bring down housing costs during their 2024 campaigns.But housing policy experts dont expect much from Trump, whose views on the issue dont follow any discernible school of economic thought. In a July?[interview with?*Bloomberg Businessweek*](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview/), Trump struck a YIMBYish tone, describing zoning as a killer. But his rhetoric has also been full of NIMBYish dog whistles. The woke left is waging full-scale war on the suburbs, and their Marxist crusade is coming for your neighborhood, your tax dollars, your public safety and your home,?he said?in a 2023 video, echoing?his 2020 campaign, which took aim at Democrats efforts to?unwind zoning codes?that enforce racial segregation.

Corporate managers would not buy any non-IBM PC, as IBM sold \\"FUD\\" - fear, uncertainty, doubt - that attaching some 'foreign' equipment might crash an entire corporate network, and the number of IT managers willing to take that chance was virtually zero. When IBM chose Gates, they thought they would sell less than 100,000 PCs, and the contract for Gates might be worth $5 million, tops (at $50/copy). When it turned out that IBM had drastically underestimated PC demand, Gates and Microsoft became fantastically wealthy in just a few years. $50 for some floppies and a book left a hefty profit margin. To his credit, Gates hired some good managers and they operated efficiently, but Gates was always tyrannical trying to crush all competition. He has been fined a number of times for anti-competitive practices. Since he left M$, his  'humanitarian' efforts have evoked suspicion that he's actually trying to achieve depopulation, although I have no facts one way or the other; this is just what I've read. He certainly seems more interested in the world of Bill Gates than anyone else. Why I Like Musk:First and foremost, he gets stuff done and most of it works. I see a lot of Teslas on the road; I don't often see on sitting by the side of the road. SpaceX caught their rocket. StarLink - unlike Bill Gates' similar Irridium - works. Paypal - although I realize he didn't write the code or anything - works. He's had some misses - I haven't heard much about the Boring company in a while, nor Gigafactory - but he's had diverse success.Then he bought Twitter, and singlehandedly changed the world's worst propaganda forum into what it was intended to be - a global water cooler where anyone could offer their two cents on any topic. The sunlight of truth has exposed numerous activities that were previously hidden, and the proof of its effectiveness has been the surge of what the robber-barons dismissively call \\"populism\\", and what we plebes used to call \\"waking up\\". We learned how the robber-barons lied and cheated us with Covid, with Biden, and with Trump. The lies could not be completely hidden anymore ,and we have Musk and \\"X\\" to thank for that. I'm sure Musk has flaws. He's a human being. But I think he actually likes people. Gates, I'm not sure.","title":"Why do people hate Bill Gates but love Musk?"},{"text":"The question is whether or not people will get rounded up and removed first and then questions will be asked later.

This is what America voted for and it deserves everything it has coming to it---if you think your flimsy piece of paper declaring you a naturalized citizen or permanent resident will save you, you've got another thing coming!! If you thought Trump will only go after the bad ones, you've got another thing coming. His cabinet and project 2025 is made up of WHITE Natuonalists--read that very carefully!

[22 studies agree medicare for all saves money.](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/484301-22-studies-agree-medicare-for-all-saves-money/)  Of course, there are other studies that prove the opposite.

But over the past half century that basic impulse underwent two great distortions. The first was the rise of neoliberalism, an economic doctrine that sanctified markets and reduced the ability of governments to protect those hurt by economic change. The world got a lot richer in the aggregate, while the working class lost jobs and opportunity. Power shifted away from the places that hosted the original industrial revolution to Asia and other parts of the developing world.The second distortion was the rise of identity politics or what one might call woke liberalism, in which progressive concern for the working class was replaced by targeted protections for a narrower set of marginalised groups: racial minorities, immigrants, sexual minorities and the like. State power was increasingly used not in the service of impartial justice, but rather to promote specific social outcomes for these groups.In the meantime, labour markets were shifting into an information economy. In a world in which most workers sat in front of a computer screen rather than lifted heavy objects off factory floors, women experienced a more equal footing. This transformed power within households and led to the perception of a seemingly constant celebration of female achievement.","title":"Francis Fukuyama: what Trump unleashed means for America"},{"text":"They will","title":"Illinois governor on Trump win: You come for my people, you come through me"},{"text":"It costs a lot of money to run chat bots, either the gpu computing power or something similar to ChatGPTs api is very expensive to analyse and respond to thousands of comments every minute.

She has been pivotal in his political career and in politics for years doing what she does.In 1979, Wiles was hired as an assistant for Representative Jack Kemp. In 1980, she joined Ronald Reagans 1980 presidential campaign as a campaign scheduler.[4]\\nIn the 1990s, Wiles served as a chief of staff to John Delaney, who was then serving as mayor of Jacksonville. Wiles also worked for U.S. Representative Tillie Fowler.[5]\\nFrom 2004 to 2009, she advised the mayor of Jacksonville, John Peyton. In the 2010 Florida gubernatorial election, Wiles was credited with helping elect businessman Rick Scott. Considered an outsider at the time, Scott previously had few connections with the Florida Republican Party.[7]\\nIn January 2011, Wiles was hired as campaign manager for former Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman Jr.s presidential campaign. While on the Huntsman campaign, she and former Jacksonville Jaguars player Tony Boselli launched a Ponte Vedra Beach-based consulting firm. Wiles left the campaign in July 2011.[8]\\nWiles also ran Tallahassee, Florida-based lobbying firm Ballard Partners for close to a decade,[9] but left in September 2019, citing a nagging health issue.[10]\\nWork for Donald Trump\\nedit\\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Wiles ran the Trump campaigns operations in Florida.[11] During the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election, Wiles was reportedly deputized by Trump to help Republican Ron DeSantis campaign for Governor.[12] In his victory speech, DeSantis described Wiles as the best in the business.[13] However, rising tensions between the duo led to her dismissal as a top advisor to DeSantis in 2019.[4] According to the reporting from Politico, the tie to Wiles, who had played a key role in... 2016, was cut at the urging of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to allow him to install his own allies in the state party, a move widely seen as a setback to the presidents re-election campaign in that battleground state.[14] She described working for DeSantis as the biggest mistake of her entire career.[15]\\nIn March 2021, Wiles was chosen as CEO of Trumps Save America PAC. In April 2021, Politico described Wiles as the new honcho atop Trumpworld, noting that she would wield authority over former 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien and key aide Justin R. Clark.[16] Under her leadership, Save America PAC has covered legal fees for several current and former Trump staffers involved in the many legal proceedings against the former president.[17]\\nIn August 2022, she was described as effectively Trumps chief of staff in the run-up to the 2022 midterm election and his 2024 presidential campaign announcement.[12] Alongside individuals such as businessman Peter Thiel, Wiles pushed Trump to endorse Blake Masters in the 2022 Senate election in Arizona, who lost the election.[18]\\nIn the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump reiterated that Wiles and Chris LaCivita were the two people running the campaign after a spat with Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski. In 2024, Politico and The Guardian reported that Wiles describes herself as a moderate Republican.[19][20]\\nTwo days after Donald Trumps victory in the 2024 presidential election, Wiles was selected as his new White House Chief of Staff.[21]","title":"Trump hires a corporate lobbyist as his Chief of Staff"},{"text":"The answer is stupidity and selfishness.American white people were told that just showing up would elevate them to the middle class.

And if we're honest if you look at the polls, again, most of them were not all that far off, a point or two points in most cases. And, importantly, each of the three presidential elections where Donald Trump has been a candidate, his support has been undercounted in polls. Most of the issues that seem to have happened, were talked about prior to the election.  Gen Z voters and Millennials failed to show up in the numbers hoped. (which is a persistent problem).  Gen Z men, Latino men and African American men voted for Trump in higher numbers than in the past.   18% of Dearborn Michigan voted for Jill stein because she campaigned in a Keffiyeh and called Gaza a genocide. Trump's vote totals weren't much larger than the past. He lost some support from women and picked up some support from young men.\\nI think the Latino support was the only thing that didn't really get captured well in the polls. Most of the general election polls were only 1 to 2% off the results in their specific states, within the margin of error.  Some of the polls of heavily latino areas in Florida and Texas were off 5-7 points.","title":"Donald Trump, Elon Musk and MAGA are the establishment now"},{"text":"Trump is a cancer to American politics and brings out the worst in his supporters, pushing this country to the right when we desperately need progressive policy to save off the ills of late-stage capitalism.

President Biden reappointed Powell in 2021  despite objections from progressives who have criticized the chair  saying he has burdened the average American by keeping rates too high for too long.Trump suggested earlier this year that Powell, a lifelong Republican, was political and would cut rates ahead of the 2024 election to help Democrats.

Look, I have voted straight ticket Democrat in every single election including this one but as a 36 year old Millennial white male from a lower-middle class socioeconomic background, Im gonna let you in on my experience.All throughout high school I worked my ass off to get a full academic scholarship to a state school while seeing women and minorities get similar scholarships for much less effort and with fewer accomplishments. All throughout college seeing the same thing happen with internships and undergraduate research positions (engineering major). I was even specifically told by my academic advisor that despite being top of my class, I shouldnt even bother applying for summer research grants because they will preferentially go to women and minorities. Coming out of college, women even at the bottom of the class getting instant job placement and competitive offers while men of every class rank had enormous trouble finding a job during the 2010 recession.And I understand the historical need for all of that but while all this is happening, pop culture is blaring messages in our faces at all times that men are privileged little shits and women are oppressed. That we need to fight the patriarchy and give up our privilege when weve seen an enormous amount of that privilege being given in the opposite direction.I dont doubt that I have enjoyed privileges as a white man but there is an outright refusal of feminist groups and other progressive organizations to acknowledge the privileges that women and minorities also have today. Supposedly its all about equality but were constantly told we need to fight for everyone else and we can fuck off with our own concerns. This is pissing a lot of young men off.And while social media is growing, all of these messages have intensified while young men see the scales continue to tip in womens favor. Currently, a significant majority of all college degrees are awarded to women, and before marriage and kids, women outearn men by something like 30%. Why isnt this being attributed to sexism? Instead, all we ever hear about is needing more women in STEM and a wage gap that only exists when you badly distort the data. Add to that the wildly bigoted shit that is said about men in social media with absolutely no backlash. Like can you even imagine the shit storm that would happen if the man vs bear debate was referring to any sort of racial/ethnic/gender group other than (white) men?But we cant point any of this out without being shouted down with accusations of mansplaining and toxic masculinity or being called incels. So in comes bro media and most of them are shit head grifters but they are the ONLY ones talking to young men and saying We hear you and we empathize with your concerns without also tearing them down, overtly or implicitly, about privilege, patriarchy or whatever the lingo of the day is. They are the ONLY ones who arent constantly blaming them for things they never did nor contributed to. Think about it, when is the last time youve heard an actual positive message directed to men that didnt also include backhanded criticism of their gender? When people find out about my voting record theyll say things like men are terrible but at least youre one of the good ones, can you imagine saying that about any other group of people other than men?So this is a learning experience, and youre not going to like hearing it, but a lot of you need to let go of your ego and tone down the self-righteous anger, youre not the focus of this conversation. Right now its important to just sit down, shut up and listen. Then you need to earnestly talk to young men and hear their concerns without making it all about yourself.","title":"Men of Gen Z backed Donald Trump, fueling his political comeback, polls say"},{"text":"She flipped Florida for him in 2016.

And yet with 99% of the vote counted, Trump's margin of victory was a whopping **[13.9%](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/texas/?r=0)*[2024 County Map](https://i.imgur.com/m1OVWm3.jpg)**Notice how all those counties in South Texas along the border are mostly red now?  The few left that are still blue are small population countie except for Nueces County (Corpus Christi) which leaned red in 2016.  You can get an idea of the size of the county by the size of the dot in **[this map](https://i.imgur.com/FW6WMKE.png)**The four big counties (Population-wise) in South Texas are:- Hidalgo County - 898,000 - McAllen, Edinburgh,\\n- Cameron County - 421,000 - Brownsville, Harlingen\\n- Nueces County - 353,000 - Corpus Christi\\n- Webb County - 267,000 - LaredoThe other three counties in South Texas with larger populations (and many of the smaller ones) that used to be blue have turned red and I can't help think that it's because of Kamala Harris' failure as the Border Czar.---\\nThat was the post.Since then, I've had time to think about it a little more and I'll just say this.  It's not all about the border.  It's about something else as well.Hispanics in Texas are pretty ultra-conservative when it comes to family values.  They believe there are two sexes - male and female.  They don't use the she/her  he/him  they/them pronouns. They don't think biological males should be able to identify as a woman in order to compete in women's sports, and as a rule, they don't take their 8-year old children to drag shows.  They generally don't think children should have sex changes until they reach the age of 18.  They think it's ridiculous that if you accidentally misgender someone you could possibly lose your job because you offended some poor little woke snowflake.  And yet the Democratic Party is always shoving these values that they don't agree with in their faces day after day after day and they are sick of it.  And quite frankly, so am I and I'm not Hispanic.  But I am totally disgusted with the Democratic Party and their identity politics and their extreme \\"wokeness.\\"  That and abortion are all the Democratic party ever talks about.  Well that and \\"Vote for me because I'm not Trump.  Sorry Dems, that ain't gonna cut it.  They want to hear what the Democrats are gonna do about the economy and immigration.  Those where the top two issues in Texas and every other state I looked at.  To his credit (and I hate saying this) Trump did campaign on themes focused on the economy, including tariffs, immigration and tax policies. Harris did not and chose to focus on abortion in the hopes that enough women would go to the polls to get her over the finish line.  She gambled and she lost.I didn't vote for a single Democrat or Republican when I early-voted in TX, which means I hardly voted in any of the downballot races.  I voted Green where I could, and other third party candidates where a Green option wasn't available.  But there were tons of races where it was  between an R or a D, and there were were many others where it was a D running unopposed.  I refused to cast a ballot in any of those races.I'll leave you with this:**[Democratic strategist issues hard truth to party members after losing election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJDcAKNr7o)**Listen to what the lady in the white suit says.  She says it wasn't Biden's fault or Kamala Harris' fault (which I disagree with) but I do agree with her regarding the way Democrats try to communicate with the voters./rant","title":"The hatred and contempt unleashed by liberals on Latinos was predictable as soon as it became apparent how many of them voted for Trump, but the intensity of the anti-Latino bile in just 24 hours has been a bit surprising.

The problem with dealing with Trump, is he lies so often, you never know if what he is saying will reflect what he will do. Lets talk about illegal immigration. There is a system called  E Verify. This will absolutely flag anyone who is illegal , from getting a job. However, there is no federal law mandating this be used. Some states( like Illinois) only use it for some classes of state employees. Some, like Florida, require it for everybody. So why isnt this being used as a tool to fight illegal immigration? The businesses that employ entry level workers cannot hire enough workers to fill their needs. If you deport every undocumented worker in the country( some have been here since the early 90s) it will crash the economy. And not to mention all these people pay into social security, and will never receive benefits. Retirement for them, will be saving money and moving back to Mexico, etc. The problem is in 3 decades, they have gotten married, and raised families who were born here. Now a lot have grandchildren as well. You can change current immigration policies, but you cannot put the Genie back in the box. Biden should mimic Reagan, and do this last thing to Trump. Pardon all undocumented workers in the USA, and make them citizens.  But that would allow the businesses to get their employees, without the Republicans having to take responsibility for these people. And dont forget, the Hispanic voting bloc gave Trump 42%.

Our adversaries (China, India, Russia), make up 45% of all carbon emissions in the world. We need to do better, yes (12.6%) but let's start by getting Hollywood off its high horse where 1% of Americans contribute to [50% of the country's c02 emissions](https://greenly.earth/en-gb/blog/ecology-news/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-celebrities).","title":"Trump has pledged to wage war on planet Earth C and it will take a progressive revolution to stop him"},{"text":"He gonna lose","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"We haven't had real justice for 4 years.

She wanted to give a $25,000 tax credit to first-time home buyers, and a $50,000 one to people starting a small business. She wanted to legalize marijuana on the Federal level. She wanted to protect women's reproductive rights on a national scale. She said she had a plan to create 3 million new homes throughout the country, which would not only increase the supply that we need so badly, but also make a lot of homes more affordable. And I assume she would have also tried to reinstate the regulation that Trump rolled back, the one where corporations had to wait one month before they could place a bid on a property that was listed. That's why all of the homes are being bought up so quickly by companies like Black Rock right now, because Trump rolled back a regulation which prevented them from buying homes the moment they hit the market, which has made it very hard for regular people to get a home because they are competing against corporations offering 10% above market cash offers. She also wanted to unite the country and bring back normalcy in politics instead of dividing us more, and I'm pretty sure all of the things I just mentioned are what most of us would refer to as positive change.","title":"Is the average American really as pro-Trump like the election shows?

I don't get how nobody cared enough to vote to save democracy, since it looks to be clear that they - the MAGAs - will not protect the process, or how they overlooked Trump's character and honesty issues.Nobody voted with any sophistication over economic issues.  The tariff thing, if they get it through, will up the economy like its hit with a nuclear bomb.  It's complete madness.  Similar with the mass-deportation fetish.   It might help American citizens in 5-8 years.  Until then, it will cause almost infinite suffering, and hurt businesses.The GOP managed to blame inflation on Biden, who did not push back or explain things in better detail.  Maybe he was too old and forgot that part of his job.  Harris also - never pushed back on the GOP narrative.   And Biden trying to stay for re-election was a disaster.  He blocked the primary process, so when he later delivered the nomination to Harris, she did not have the following to win.  It takes 18-30 months in the US to get someone nominated who has the organic support to win the general. She tried to do it in 110 days.  If they had had a debate and a nomination-contest in July, they would have had a better chance to succeed.  They skipped that part.   It was a big mistake.Hope springs eternal.

Both are evil, but I would go as far as to say that (Italian) fascism and National Socialism are incompatible with each other. The former is racist in a nationalist way (i.e. if you live in the kingdom of italy, you are a part of the state. But everyone outside the state is inferior), while the latter was racist in a biological way (e.g. everyone who was not a nordic-germanic aryan with a 57cm skull circumference, is inferior). This means that co-governance would actually be impossible because the fascists would have to execute people whom they considered to be equal under the state but the nazis viewed as racial inferiors. The Jews are a good example of this. Hitler tried to persecute Italian Jews, but mussolini never really cooperated. Funny thing is there were 10,000 Jews in the fascist party of Italy. Oh and, would you believe me if I told you the philosophical founder of fascism (Giovanni Gentile) helped Jews escape from National Socialist custody? Mussolini was staunchly opposed to Hitler's anschluss of austria, and he sent divisions into the mountains of northern Italy to deter Hitler. Also, there are tonnes of quotes by Mussolini, Hitler, and Goebbels where they talk down on each other's ideology. Hitler thought that Mussolini's fascism was crap. Hitler also claimed to be \\"a true socialist\\". So there's that.It was only when they were in the same sinking ship that they decided to team up (both were excluded from the league of nations, both were facing economic sanctions from the west).

(AP)  A wealthy campaign donor of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Panera Bread restaurants he owns will start paying workers at least $20 an hour on April 1 after controversy over whether a new state minimum wage law for fast food workers applies to his businesses.Californias statewide minimum wage is $16 per hour. Newsom?[signed a law last year](https://apnews.com/article/california-minimum-wage-increase-fast-food-newsom-69c26b7f07f2647149c37677446cea30)?that says fast food restaurants that are part of a chain with at least 60 locations nationally must pay their workers at least $20 per hour beginning April 1. But the law does not apply to restaurants that have their own bakeries to make and sell bread as a stand-alone menu item.That exception appeared to apply to restaurants like Panera Bread. Last week, Bloomberg News reported that Newsom had pushed for such a carve-out to benefit donor Greg Flynn, whose company owns and operates 24 Panera Bread restaurants in California.The Democratic governor and Flynn denied the report, with Newsom calling it absurd. Newsom spokesperson Alex Stack said the administrations legal team analyzed the law in response to recent news articles and concluded Panera Bread restaurants are likely not exempt because the dough they use to make bread is mixed off site.","title":"I think we should start hate maxing for the next several years to try tapping in to the electorates general bad vibes.

Ever.There is no middle ground there. There is a fundamental disagreement in morality.We've been watching the masks come off of Trump voters real fast this time around. They are saying the quiet parts out loud. \\"Ban abortion in all cases\\", \\"ban transgender care for minors\\", \\"Deport, deport, deport\\", \\"Your body, MY choice.\\", \\"You have the rights I say you have\\", \\"This is a Christian Nation\\", \\"Ban gay marriage\\", \\"No homosexuals\\", and \\"You will become slaves\\" these are things that a large group on the right have been saying for the last 24 hours.What middle ground would you have us find with these people? If you broke bread with those people and joined their cause, while the rest of us have been warning you, then you deserve what's about to happen to this country. It won't be pretty. It won't be kind. Millions of Americans are in danger. So I'll be protecting the queer community, my friends and famiky, I'll be protecting those that chose to fight for the rights of others over self-interested, economic bullshit - when we know that nobody, NOBODY is bringing prices down right now. Trump is not going to fix any of the economic woes of the country. He just isn't. That is a fact.Prices will go up, he is about to reverse the course on inflation, and due to his immigration reforms the prices of food, construction and basic services will skyrocket. Then the tariffs will hit and the prices of EVERYTHING ELSE will raise.He isn't draining the swamp. The guy he wants in the FDA doesn't believe in vaccines. The guy he wants to put in the \\"Government Efficiency\\" office is an entitled man baby who is notorious for taking credit for the work of others. Musk, according to his own employees is not a brilliant engineer. His Vice President AND most of his cabinet are Christian Nationalist.But nah. We were over-blowing our warnings, over-blowing how bad it could get.And, because of what's about to happen to regulation, we are going to lock in the worst case scenarios for climate change. So prices will rise and more and more Americans will lose everything. So nah. The answer wasn't to reach out to these fuckers, we tried that. Harris went right. She got snubbed.My answer is simple. I'll keep working on my networks. I'll keep helping people on the left set up theirs. I will ensure everyone is vetting the people coming to ours through social media. And I will absolutely ensure that people on the right are excluded. You lose your house due to the inability to afford repairs and end up on the street because prices skyrocketed over the deportations YOU voted for? That's fine by me, you voted to take away the rights from people I love, so I will happily watch you starve. You aren't welcome in the soup kitchens I run. You can't afford clothing for your kids and it's winter? Fuck off, my donations are going to organizations that were ensure it goes to the most in danger of us all queer groups. Your trying to flee your conservative state to get access you need to survive your pregnancy? Nah fam, me and the folks I work with to drive women out of states with bans and help them get that healthcare they need, up to and including abortion have already started building social media based black-lists.In short, if you voted for the shit show that's coming, I intend to ensure you sleep in that bed, and I will mock you for it. You will find no succor from me and mine.

I've had no less than six attempts in the last 3 weeks to light my pride flag on fire. It was stolen the day after the election. I've bought a second one and put it up, and found a note, typed out that said \\"If you put one up again, we will burn your fucking house down.\\" in it's place this morning.So nah.

Key drivers included a focus on economic dissatisfaction, particularly in regions impacted by deindustrialization, and a strategic outreach on popular platforms. Trump engaged with well-known influencers like Adin Ross, Logan Paul, and the Nelk Boys, creating a targeted social media presence that resonated with younger demographics who felt disconnected from traditional media narratives.Elon Musks active endorsement and substantial financial support also played a significant role. Musk donated over $100 million and used his platform X (formerly Twitter) to amplify Trump's campaign messages, which helped sway voters in swing states like Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Musks influence, alongside endorsements from other high-profile figures like Joe Rogan and Jake Paul, contributed to a powerful ground game and digital presence that bolstered voter turnout.Moreover, economic concerns and dissatisfaction with the Biden administrations handling of inflation and cost-of-living issues were critical factors. Voters in economically struggling areas, especially among traditionally Democratic minority groups, leaned toward Trump, feeling that he could more effectively address their economic needs. This shift was amplified by Republican control of the Senate, which is expected to streamline Trump's policy agenda in his next term.These combined strategies and endorsements secured both Trumps popular vote majority and his key victories across swing states, leading to a decisive win over Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in both the Electoral College and the popular vote","title":"[Brookings] Why Trump won and Harris lost"},{"text":"We had them in the last Trump presidency down at the border to Mexico.

Trump won't defend anyone but himself. Dude cares about *nobody*. Case in point, his self proclaimed \\"best friend for over 10 years\\", Jeffrey Epstein was heard saying in the recordings released recently that Trump would try to sleep with his friend's wives. [Epstein also said Trump \\"has no morals\\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes), and imagine what kind of dirtbag you have to be for Jeffrey Epstein to say you have no morals. Or how about his lawyer for over a decade, who went to jail for doing what Trump told him to? Or Rudy giuliani, who got disbarred and forced to surrender every single one of his assets including his television for lying about the election being stolen under Trump's direction because he was his lawyer as well? And then here Steve Bannon, who went to jail for following Trump's orders as well. There are a few others that I'm forgetting too. You truly believe this is a man who will defend the regular working class when he won't even defend the people that are in his close circle? The same man who was sued over 4,000 times for not paying the people that he hired to build and clean his buildings? Regular working class Americans that he then kept tied up in court until they ran out of money and couldn't fight him anymore? That's a guy you think stands up for people?And if you read the article, remember Trump's \\"3 rules of winning\\" that he learned from the ruthless shark Roy Cohn - 1) attack, attack, attack 2) deny *everything* and never admit fault, and 3) always claim victory, never under any circumstances admit defeat. And in my opinion, a man who can't admit when he's wrong and takes no accountability for anything is a coward and has no character.

This is the fundamental issue Democrats need to reconcile with now. Do you want to be Republican lite and continue to keep the status quo of moving our country further right on issues (like immigration) that are more of a scapegoat for why we all are feeling frustrated with the economy, healthcare, etc? Or, do you want to finally embrace a progressive movement that recognizes this country is primarily run by corporations that will always seek profit over all else, and to address those issues we all care about we need to fundamentally shift away from prioritizing those corporations' needs over the basic needs of our people.

Here are my thoughts:You are conflating the price of goods and inflation, which are not the same. Inflation (more akin to excessive calories in your metaphor) contributes to higher prices of goods (your body weight). If you slow excessive caloric intake, you will slow weight gain. But to your point, the pounds remain for some time, which is true. The Fed lowered interest rates as inflation remains at goal.The other, more significant contributor to high prices, is corporate price gouging. I think of it like this: prices went up during pandemic BEFORE inflation picked up under Biden, I think, due to disruption in the supply chain and goods becoming more scarce. But the supply chain has been restored and supply of goods has improved. Prices arent going down more quickly because greedy corporations/retailers dont want them to (corporations have been getting record profits for multiple successive quarters) The Biden administration is taking steps to address this problem, but I doubt theyll make any significant progress before Trump takes the White House.On the other hand, the tariffs Trump plans to impose are expected to be inflationary, and will make imported goods more expensive. This will be felt most by low and middle income households. And heres the kicker, he wants to give billionaires and corporations, who I think any reasonable person would say are doing quite well, more tax breaks.The economy was the principal issue this election, thats clear. The problem, in my view, is that most voters dont understand whats being done to transfer wealth and financial stability away from them to be given to corporations and billionaires, who are only looking for the next way to enrich themselves further. US households stimulate the economy; not corporations.And from a historical and objective perspective, the US economy has performed better under Democrat administrations than republican ones.

In a depression, the price falls *because demand falls* - i.e. people can no longer pay what they could before. People still want to move or need to sell their homes so prices fall. This does not help *average* affordability (although it might help in specific situations, such as a young worker living with their parents who keeps their job despite the depression).?\\nA supply increase absolutely would be the only way to cause a real fall in prices versus income. Imagine if I waved a wand (for the sake of argument) and doubled the number if houses in the US. For the sake of argument let's imagine each homeowner gets a carbon copy of their home somewhere nearby to where they live (so I'm not even redistributing any of this wealth to non owners). A lot of these people would rather sell that home than keep it (and pay maintenance, taxes, etc. versus the cash injection from selling it). But there would be nowhere near enough people to buy them all at current prices so the price would fall dramatically.?\\nOf course, the above will never happen overnight but every little bit of supply increase would give a corresponding small reduction in prices for the same reason.","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"Would you describe what Musk is doing with Twitter as freedom?","title":"Elon Musk's biggest campaign contribution to Trump: Weaponizing the First Amendment"},{"text":"Never forgive, never forget.

What makes you think that MAGAts didn't show to her rallies? What makes you think that your neighbors who were previously known Trump supporters suddenly had a change of heart and didn't just lied to you when they told you that they were going to vote for Harris this time due to his bad rhetoric and racism? They stopped posting Trump signs and instead actually VOTED. Our side had the thousands of people who previously voted for Biden in 2020 only to turn their backs on him, and then her because of the United States' help to Israel. Many of those young people stayed home.2) I keep thinking that timing of the war in Israel and Gaza has been very suspicious from the start. Netanyahu and Putin knew that this would hurt Bidens administration hugely, especially during the election season because America ? has always been supporting Israel no matter what and this war would put Biden and Kamala in impossible situation. Also Bibi is friends with Trump, so why wouldn't he want him to win while also being able to stay in power himself because of his own corruption? Starting this war was definitely a great ticket to accomplish that. He killed two birds with one stone. How could Israeli government not know about Hamas' plans for October 7th when Israel has the best intelligence in the world and they are one of the most militarized countries in the world? They know about a mouse is about to fart before that mouse itself even does it. \\nBottom line to all this is that the Democrats walked into a trap, partly because of their own making due to their complacency and laziness, but also due to a lot of assholery by Putin, Netanyahu and other foreign enemies.","title":"Where did Joe Biden voters go?

Thank you for your post. You bring up some really good points to talk about.My question was to find out from those who did vote for Trump, was it for the same reason why the person in the video did and as a follow up, do Trumps policies actually support what the guy in the video believes they do? Simple. I dont believe all 76 million people who voted for Trump (man that is a lot, how many were mail-ins?), are racist, not at all. This was the primary reason why I posted my questions. So far, responses are about half and half.I dont want anyone to feel oppressed. This is just a discussion of two differing perspectives. The subject of racism is broad and complex and it takes a lot to unpack. It is also something I am still learning about as I hope others are as well.The dude in the video has a white supremacist website called American Renaissance. This video is from Trumps first election 2016, but their site is still current and addresses Trumps current immigration policies and how good they will be for the country.I would love to believe we all have the same rights as humans in the USA, but sadly, that isnt true. For example, now that abortion has been made illegal in some states, that has affected the poor. They cannot afford to travel to a state where it would be legal, that privilege is not available to them. Now when you tell me that is poor people, not race, check out this link:[https://www.statista.com/statistics/200476/us-poverty-rate-by-ethnic-group/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200476/us-poverty-rate-by-ethnic-group/)I am glad you have Asian and Spanish friends as a white female in NYC. No Black friends, but maybe next year? I am also glad you said you were white, good for you. Do you pay rent in NYC? It can be really expensive.You said you didnt watch the whole video, but you had to respond to my post. It seems like it struck a chord. I want it to be clear, I am not saying you are racist, you need to determine that for yourself. Just like anyone reading this post. My feeling is we live in a very race driven world and the question is, are we prejudging? Do we truly understand the issues at hand? Are we the privileged in other peoples eyes and if so, how does that affect our judgement and understanding of the other?My fear is that Trumps immigration policies will be abused and will hurt the lives of those less fortunate. If you start to pull on the thread of racism in the United States, you will see the risk these policies bring forward. I do not believe everyone who voted for Trump are racist, but I do believe all racists voted for him.","title":"How do you as a Trump voter accept or disagree with this persons reasoning why it is good Trump won?"},{"text":"The Matriarch's coming to fuck us all into the dirt.

There's still 40% of California's precincts that have yet to be counted, and that's before it even gets to mail-in votes, etc. It could be weeks before all of those votes are counted.While, yes, Trump will pick up a bunch of votes as well, Kamala may very well pick up a much larger amount.

Entire article is worth reading. ---While the Pentagon and the White Houses national-security apparatuses were still moving toward war (John Kerry told me he was expecting a strike the day after his speech), the president had come to believe that he was walking into a trapone laid both by allies and by adversaries, and by conventional expectations of what an American president is supposed to do.Many of his advisers did not grasp the depth of the presidents misgivings; his cabinet and his allies were certainly unaware of them. But his doubts were growing. Late on Friday afternoon, Obama determined that he was simply not prepared to authorize a strike. He asked McDonough, his chief of staff, to take a walk with him on the South Lawn of the White House. Obama did not choose McDonough randomly: He is the Obama aide most averse to U.S. military intervention and someone who, in the words of one of his colleagues, thinks in terms of traps. Obama, ordinarily a preternaturally confident man, was looking for validation and trying to devise ways to explain his change of heart, both to his own aides and to the public. He and McDonough stayed outside for an hour. Obama told him he was worried that Assad would place civilians as human shields around obvious targets. He also pointed out an underlying flaw in the proposed strike: U.S. missiles would not be fired at chemical-weapons depots, for fear of sending plumes of poison into the air. A strike would target military units that had delivered these weapons but not the weapons themselves.Obama also shared with McDonough a long-standing resentment: He was tired of watching Washington unthinkingly drift toward war in Muslim countries. Four years earlier, the president believed, the Pentagon had jammed him on a troop surge for Afghanistan. Now, on Syria, he was beginning to feel jammed again.When the two men came back to the Oval Office, the president told his national-security aides that he planned to stand down. There would be no attack the next day; he wanted to refer  the matter to Congress for a vote. Aides in the room were shocked. Susan Rice, now Obamas national-security adviser, argued that the damage to Americas credibility would be serious and lasting. Others had difficulty fathoming how the president could reverse himself the day before a planned strike. Obama, however, was completely calm. If youve been around him, you know when hes ambivalent about something, when its a 51C49 decision, Ben Rhodes told me. But he was completely at ease.Obamas decision caused tremors across Washington as well. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, the two leading Republican hawks in the Senate, had met with Obama in the White House earlier in the week and had been promised an attack. They were angered by the about-face. Damage was done even inside the administration. Neither Chuck Hagel, then the secretary of defense, nor John Kerry was in the Oval Office when the president informed his team of his thinking. Kerry would not learn about the change until later that evening. I just got fucked over, he told a friend shortly after talking to the president that night.","title":"The U.S. doesnt need to care about race or gender for presidents.

Presidents make appointments and then spend most of their time on national security and foreign policy issues, gaining access to a large trove of classified information that they had never known as candidates, and have to synthesize that information and make decisions for the entire nation on the fly. That's why intelligence and analytical skills matter to the job. Obama is clearly intelligent; Trump has a much more analytical mind than people give him credit for, if you paid attention to his decision-making and some of his calmer interviews. Kamala has never shown any of these things.Moreover, the way that Obama thinks about foreign policy is very similar to the way that Trump, Vance and Gabbard think about foreign policy - they are Jacksonian realists, and a dose of realism is sorely needed at the top. Realists are less likely to put the U.S. on a path towards a hot war with nuclear-armed states - an event that could well signify the extinction of humanity. Most of the post-90s establishment elite candidates like Bush Jr., Hillary, McCain, Romney, Cruz and Kamala either subscribe to Wilsonian idealism or have never really thought carefully about foreign policy. There's a significant portion of us that would vote for Obama and refuse to vote for Kamala for this reason alone.Most notably, Obama decided against starting a war in Syria, which in retrospect likely avoided a disaster. Obama took all the information that he was receiving from a dozen different agencies and advisors, spent days critically analyzing it, judged that Syria would be a trap worse than Iraq or Vietnam, and chose peace, resisting the entire foreign policy establishment in Washington. He took the political fallout from going back on his \\"red line\\", willingly. That's a remarkable act of political courage, something which Kamala has also never demonstrated. Kamala spent 4 years as VP dodging the single issue that the president assigned her to cover.\\n \\nPut Kamala in that scenario with Syria; she likely would have listened to the neocon establishment and gone ahead with the war because she's self-admittedly clueless about foreign policy.","title":"The U.S. doesnt need to care about race or gender for presidents.

I replied to another person just now with all the points why I didn't vote for Trump and why I'm a democrat, so I'll reply with the same points. Also, I'm not a person to start a fight or argue, so anyone reading this, please don't fight or argue with me, this is just why I, personally am a democrat. Perhaps that'll change in the future, but for now, this is why:The first issue which was the main one - Trump's tax cuts. He promises tax cuts, and he'll give tax cuts, but they are for the rich, not the normal working American. Meaning it benefits those who are making from $360,000 - $914,000 a year. If you're in that bracket, you'll receive a tax cut of -$7,160. If you're making more than $914,000, you'll receive a tax cut of -$36,320. However, if you're not in that bracket, the average American will have to pay more. The poorest, so those making $0-$28,600, will have to pay +$790. Second class, so those making $28,600-$55,100, will have to pay +$1,430. The middle class, so those making $55,100-$94,000, will have to pay +$1,530. Fourth, so those making $94,100-$157,500, will have to pay +$1,790. Fifth, so those making $157,500-$360,000, will have to pay +$610.Then, Trump's tariffs. That means if he implements this, we'll have to pay it from our pocket's. Corporations won't pay them, even if he has said they will. They won't. That means, everything will become even more expensive. For example, if a shirt in China costs $5 to make, the corporation will sell it for $10 in the USA, so they have $5 profit. But, it Trump's tariffs are implemented, the shirt will now cost $5 to make, but to get it into USA from China, it'll cost 60% more. So now it costs $8 for the corporation. Do you think the corporation will still sell it for $10? No. It'll sell it for $13. These are the tariffs: If it's coming from China, it's 60%. If it's from Mexico, it's 25%. If it's anywhere else around the world, it's 20%.Also, it's good to mention that we're currently under Trump's economy. That's why everything is currently so expensive under Biden's presidency. When Trump was in office in 2017, we were under Obama's economy. The economy the previous president implements works under the next president. I just wanted to mention this, since a lot of people don't realise this. This is going to upset a lot of people by me saying this, but I did vote for Kamala. Not because I'm a far leftist, but because she represented my interests the best. As in, she was planning to implement tax cuts for the middle class. She was going to make sure the rich pay fair taxes, not get tax cuts. From her own words, she said, it's not fair that teachers, nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate, than the rich and big corporations. And I agree with that, that's why I voted for her. These are the tax cuts she wanted to implement for the normal, working class people. The poorest making from $0-$28,600 would've gotten a -7% tax cut of -$1,130. Second, making from $28,600-$55,100, would've gotten a tax cut of -3,8%. Middle class, making from $55,100-$94,100 would've gotten a -2.7% tax cut of -$1,980. Fourth, making $94,100-$157,500 would've gotten a tax cut of -1,8%. Fifth, making $157,500-$360,000, would've gotten a tax cut of -1.4%. The rich, however, making $914,900 or more, would've gotten a +4.1% tax increase, on average of +$121,460.Hopefully this helped you understand me and once again, thank you for asking!","title":"I'm a democrat, but I want to congratulate you all on the victory!

The first is that the public service loan forgiveness for people like teachers, nurses, first responders, and other public service roles that lowered the burden on the people that went into those needed fields with abysmal pay and hours was effectively stopped under trump's administration. Another is that since wages stagnated, many people were having issues paying down the interest instead of the principle. Before some of the things like PAYE were enacted, you couldn't tie your loans to your income, effectively if you were ever laid off or your income fell , you couldn't make payments, and that ruined credit scores. What Biden's admin proposed was forgiveness for predatory schools, the ability to tie income to pay, forcing the principle to be paid first instead of at discretion and preventing interest from being aggregated with it. Essentially as you pay of the principal, the interest won't accumulate as much, and not taking interest of interest accumulation. The other thing that happened was that they actually processed public servant forgiveness.It's not about not paying the loans, it's about not paying twice the loan taken out, and having safeguards against catastrophic life events.","title":"Trump's win brings uncertainty to borrowers hoping for student loan forgiveness"},{"text":"Me too, let the rest of the country pay $5 and $6 gas for a stupid train in the dessert that no one wants for decades without any track being put on the ground.","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"Nice!!

Like a snake gorging on its own tail, domestic disrupters are weaponizing Americas First Amendment to get rid of it so that the oligarchs funding them can drill, shoot, pollute, and defraud American consumers with impunity.","title":"Elon Musk's biggest campaign contribution to Trump: Weaponizing the First Amendment"},{"text":"Fuck No. Thats some totalitarian shit.","title":"Trump says his mass deportations are not a \\"question of price tag\\""},{"text":"I'm not American but I think from the surface, if we disregard the two wings on the same bird concept, based on what I've seen or heard so far.JB might have preferred to be the only one to beat trump.

There's definitely some kind of sabotage going on from JB's end, Kamala's campaign planners (SNL, interview excuses, celeb endorsements, etc), and the people on the Dem side are a little gone off, with Tim Walz (wrongly remembering events, unable to handle the gun, kind of lame streaming with AOC), Gretchen Whitmer (feeding the chip), making use of older presidents (Obama \\"lecturing\\" the brothers, Clinton admitting the the border should be secured).I think JB finally gotten his revenge since Kamala lost. And Kamala is finally able to take the stress off her back since it's finally over. Maybe they knew they were going to lose so they went to rest early and she wasnt able to give the speech right away when the result were out, they were both able to do a good closing. There's a lot of lax in the Dem campaigns in round, either too confident and/or too incapable.

I'm not a person to start a fight or argue, so anyone reading this, please don't fight or argue with me. But since you asked, this is why I didn't vote for Trump and I'm a democrat.The first issue which was the main one - Trump's tax cuts. He promises tax cuts, and he'll give tax cuts, but they are for the rich, not the normal working American. Meaning it benefits those who are making from $360,000 - $914,000 a year. If you're in that bracket, you'll receive a tax cut of -$7,160. If you're making more than $914,000, you'll receive a tax cut of -$36,320. However, if you're not in that bracket, the average American will have to pay more. The poorest, so those making $0-$28,600, will have to pay +$790. Second class, so those making $28,600-$55,100, will have to pay +$1,430. The middle class, so those making $55,100-$94,000, will have to pay +$1,530. Fourth, so those making $94,100-$157,500, will have to pay +$1,790. Fifth, so those making $157,500-$360,000, will have to pay +$610.Then, Trump's tariffs. That means if he implements this, we'll have to pay it from our pocket's. Corporations won't pay them, even if he has said they will. They won't. That means, everything will become even more expensive. For example, if a shirt in China costs $5 to make, the corporation will sell it for $10 in the USA, so they have $5 profit. But, it Trump's tariffs are implemented, the shirt will now cost $5 to make, but to get it into USA from China, it'll cost 60% more. So now it costs $8 for the corporation. Do you think the corporation will still sell it for $10? No. It'll sell it for $13. These are the tariffs: If it's coming from China, it's 60%. If it's from Mexico, it's 25%. If it's anywhere else around the world, it's 20%.Also, it's good to mention that we're currently under Trump's economy. That's why everything is currently so expensive under Biden's presidency. When Trump was in office in 2017, we were under Obama's economy. The economy the previous president implements works under the next president. I just wanted to mention this, since a lot of people don't realise this. This is going to upset a lot of people by me saying this, but I did vote for Kamala. Not because I'm a far leftist, but because she represented my interests the best. As in, she was planning to implement tax cuts for the middle class. She was going to make sure the rich pay fair taxes, not get tax cuts. From her own words, she said, it's not fair that teachers, nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate, than the rich and big corporations. And I agree with that, that's why I voted for her. These are the tax cuts she wanted to implement for the normal, working class people. The poorest making from $0-$28,600 would've gotten a -7% tax cut of -$1,130. Second, making from $28,600-$55,100, would've gotten a tax cut of -3,8%. Middle class, making from $55,100-$94,100 would've gotten a -2.7% tax cut of -$1,980. Fourth, making $94,100-$157,500 would've gotten a tax cut of -1,8%. Fifth, making $157,500-$360,000, would've gotten a tax cut of -1.4%. The rich, however, making $914,900 or more, would've gotten a +4.1% tax increase, on average of +$121,460.","title":"I'm a democrat, but I want to congratulate you all on the victory!

So any insults you may perceive from my comments are towards those who thought staying home would send a message to care about Gaza... Forgetting that allowing Trump to take over likely means the end of Gaza and the West Bank as we know it Second, that elitist attitude isn't helping anyone. We're just as average American as anyone else, we just have different interests and hobbies. Some people can name all 53 players on an NFL team, some people can grow amazing plants, some people know the minute differences between a '65 Mustang and '74 Mustang, and others like us as plugged into politics. At the end of the day they're all just hobbies we get into that we find interesting, one isn't better than any other.I had the sewer line in my house crack on Friday and back up into our house. Spent the weekend living on couches and got handed an $8500 bill first thing Monday morning that insurance won't cover and neither will the $500 we have in savings. Not to mention the $2000 deductible we have on the remediation and repairs inside the house and the pile of sentimental items that have been ruined. And that's all on top of all the other types of stressors you mentioned, except we need $3000 for his baseball team not hockey... And then money for Christmas...

Insulting people seems to have been proven on Tuesday to be an overwhelmingly popular and effective tactic.And lastly, I didn't wake up crying on Wednesday. I actually haven't cried or anything yet about the election. I'm still stunned. Shocked that anyone, let alone a majority of people, think this is the right way to go. Disappointed to learn my fellow Americans can at best be this indifferent to (and at worst excited about) the tens if not hundreds of millions of people around the world who are going to have their lives turned upside down by deportations and discrimination in America and by aggressive autocrats emboldened by a new more hands-off America that no longer seems interested in helping those in need in Gaza or Ukraine or anywhere else.

Period.The media held double standards, moreover. When the 5th estate is actively working against you while hiding the flaws of the other candidate, as he drives ratings and eyeballs and record profits when he's in power, then you have a big fucking problem. You no longer have an honest broker. And then you turn others toward untraditional news sources that are rife with misinformation and propaganda, and more easily manipulated by nation-states directly (everyone quickly forgot when it came out *a lot* of right-wing Podcaster and news sources were funded by Russia...).Kamala ran one of the better campaigns in the 21st century. Obama played more toward the historic nature of his candidacy, which felt like a breath of fresh air after Bush and the economic collapse, but I feel her campaign was better on the merits.\\nShe constantly detailed plans she had for the middle and lower class, as well as small businesses. In multiple speeches and rallies. She had it on her website, a 86-7pg policy doc. It was for available for anyone who bothered to look. Trump had nada. Zilch. He had buzzwords, projection, denigrating attacks, loose rhetoric as it related to the economy. Just demagoguery everywhere all the time. And he won. I'm sorry, but you can't fix stupid. And you can't hold one candidate to a standard of being an adult while treating the other as unserious and as a child to be indulged.And the people who keep saying she was never elected to be Nominee - she was the VP on a ticket with the President. They got the most votes in a Dem primary ever. Together. What does the Constitution say if something happens to the President? The VP steps in.Well, why would that not make the same sense for the ticket? I voted for Biden knowing she was VP and would take over when he invariably died. I voted for the ticket during the primaries. All of a sudden, my vote, and those of tens of millions of others, didn't count?

Bank reserves is also not money and they weren't utilized until 2008 when congress gave the fed permission to pay interest on reserves. There was less than 100 billion in bank reserves until 2006-8, it's grown to over a trillion since. The only reason the banks can't exist without the fed is because they couldn't settle their balances everyday without them and their master accounts.","title":"Kamala was never intended to win.

IMO, he is a deplorable human so I will just start with that. Where I think you may reconsider your argument is something more related to the values you speak of specifically (bigotry), rather than Trump specifically. This response might incite rage on the surface but we have a two party system: its this or that. What follows is many people likely voted for a candidate yet did not fully support their entire political view. For example, its likely many Liberals - who typically are more pro-social, support constitutionally based rights like privacy and equality - probably do not support Kamalas role in Gaza. We must extend the same respect to those who voted Trump even if it hurts a little. What this means is there is a need for real conversation. Like a fully fledged vulnerability type deal, no sound bites, not rhetoric; but pure, open heart to heart engagement. While this is really challenging when some lack the ability to navigate conflict with respect, its just as wrong to label them bad as it is in reverse. We must be mindful of hypocrisy, and please know I mean this with the most respect. If we wish to be understood, we must first seek to understand. Many, many, many of us forget that first part.

For example, if theres a 20% tariff on imported cars, the price of those cars rises by 20% (or more, depending on the situation). Importers, distributors, and retailers often pass these costs onto consumers, making imported products more expensive.Higher Prices for Local Products:** *Domestic producers who make similar products now face less competition from foreign goods, allowing them to raise their prices. They might not match the full tariff amount but still increase prices since theres reduced competitive pressure to keep them low.Rising Costs of Raw Materials and Components:** *Tariffs arent limited to finished goodsthey often apply to raw materials or components, which can lead to higher production costs for local manufacturers. If a tariff is applied to steel, for example, car manufacturers and construction companies that use steel will face higher costs, often passing those on to the end consumer.Inflationary Pressure on the Economy:** *Tariffs can contribute to overall inflation, where the prices of goods and services rise across the board. When production costs go up and demand shifts toward domestic goods, the general price level in the economy can increase, which affects everything from food to clothing to electronics.Supply Chain Disruptions:** *Tariffs can also affect supply chains, making it more costly or complex to source materials. This can lead to shortages or delays, pushing up prices further as demand rises faster than supply.*That, is what a Tariff is, and Trump wants to put **these** on everything the US imports and actually run the country 100% on Tariffs...","title":"Trump's win could lead companies to push up prices.

For example, if theres a 20% tariff on imported cars, the price of those cars rises by 20% (or more, depending on the situation). Importers, distributors, and retailers often pass these costs onto consumers, making imported products more expensive.Higher Prices for Local Products:** *Domestic producers who make similar products now face less competition from foreign goods, allowing them to raise their prices. They might not match the full tariff amount but still increase prices since theres reduced competitive pressure to keep them low.Rising Costs of Raw Materials and Components:** *Tariffs arent limited to finished goodsthey often apply to raw materials or components, which can lead to higher production costs for local manufacturers. If a tariff is applied to steel, for example, car manufacturers and construction companies that use steel will face higher costs, often passing those on to the end consumer.Inflationary Pressure on the Economy:** *Tariffs can contribute to overall inflation, where the prices of goods and services rise across the board. When production costs go up and demand shifts toward domestic goods, the general price level in the economy can increase, which affects everything from food to clothing to electronics.Supply Chain Disruptions:** *Tariffs can also affect supply chains, making it more costly or complex to source materials. This can lead to shortages or delays, pushing up prices further as demand rises faster than supply.*That, is what a Tariff is, and Trump wants to put **these** on everything the US imports and actually run the country 100% on Tariffs...","title":"Trump favors huge new tariffs.

A foreigner who's never gone beyond working visa status discussing the virtues of a presidential candidate with the sort of person who doesn't have to mass at the gate pre-departure. We could not be more out of touch and more useless to Harris as supporters. Sure, Harris was offering solutions but she wasn't communicating them in a way that resonated with the man on the street. Add to that, people are tired of being poor. I've been poor and it sucks, but I knew I wouldn't grow up to be poor because education and hard work offered an out back then. Hell, I was able to buy my first house thanks to money I'd saved up working in fast food while studying. Fast food! For gen z, that social contract is irreparably broken. They can do everything right and still not get anywhere. It's laughable to think of a young person today buying a house with money they'd saved from a part-time job doing menial labour.People are poor and they're tired and four years of Biden and Harris did a lot for the big picture but nothing for them on a personal level. Why should they cheer for the market when they see no tangible benefit from its gains? Structural reform doesn't put a meal on the table either.

As social-distancing waned, people started spending again, and they started spending A LOT, but supply-chains were still ramped down and it would take awhile for production to get back to normal. You had a uniquely high rate of consumer spending on a significantly smaller basket of goods, services, and labor. THIS is when prices really started shooting up dramatically. More supply, the same amount of demand= prices stay the same, because people have shown that they are willing to pay those prices.This isn't quite right. Ceteris paribus, more supply relative to demand will decrease prices. The reason that you aren't seeing prices go back down to 2019 levels is because the entire economy has now adjusted to the increased money supply. A dollar is worth less in 2024 than it was worth in 2019, because there are more dollars in circulation relative to the economy's net goods and services. Prices will never go back to what they were in 2019 unless and until there are productivity gains that outpace inflation, or there's a major depression (which is far worse for people's well-being than high-inflation, generally), but this doesn't doom people to forever be poorer, because what will happen (and has been happening slowly for the last couple years) is that wage-increases start to outpace inflation, so even though everything now has a higher price, you might have an even higher income. Does that all make sense? Why wouldn't they just make more houses to meet the demand,  but keep selling them for high prices?Because when there's less scarcity, there's less competition between buyers for the same houses, and when there's less competition between buyers for the same houses, that means each prospective buyer has more alternatives available to them that can accommodate their preferences, so homeowners and developers can't demand as high of a price.","title":"CMV: Housing prices can only drop substantially if we have a depression"},{"text":"And even if they get that factory running they deported all the cheap labor and paying the minimum wage of Karen mckarenface factors into the suits justification to make that 15 into a 20.","title":"Trump favors huge new tariffs.

I paid attention to politics in 2012, when I had to watch the debates for an extra credit assignment. I grew to like Biden after that Paul Ryan debate. I grew to realize Dems were more aligned with I believed in and with what my faith thought me. The ACA/Obama care as fundamental important for me growing up. As I grew older, I stayed pretty lib. Then trump got elected, I was disappointed, cried at Disney that winter when I saw the hall of presidents, and heard Obama's oath. Hoped Trump the best. I kinda zoned out of politics, and I started to listen to long form YouTube videos for my commute to college, and Stephen Crowder and Ben Shapiro would pop up on my feeds. I started to consume their content, and when they would visit my pretty liberal campus, I would listen to the students try to debate him (I am in the background of some of their videos). I agreed with their arguments at the time, and I felt he heard my grievances. I became more conservative. Then I was lucky enough to find an Biden clip, and listen to it. He was talking about working class values or something of that nature. He started talking about his faith and his growth. I have left the church by that point, but fundamental believe in its principles. I realized that little boy who watched Biden when he was young would not approve of me. This hate based approach isnt part of my ideals.  I started to do my own research and found out deep in the pipeline I was and found my way out. I volunteer for the Dem Senate candidate in 2018, and been invested in Dem politics since. For young men who struggling in the world, the alt right pipeline is strong.

The person manages White House staff, organizes the president's time and schedule, and maintains contact with other government departments and lawmakers.?The low-key Wiles, 67, will be the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. Trump is considering a wide array of people for top jobs in his administration, many of them familiar figures from his 2017-2021 presidency, four sources said.?Wiles, a long-time Florida-based political strategist, and fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita are credited with running a more disciplined operation for Trumps third presidential bid compared with his past campaigns.?Several people who have worked with Wiles said she would provide stability and sage counsel to Trump in the White House. Trump ran through four chiefs of staff - an unusually high number - during his 2017-2021 term as they struggled to rein in the famously undisciplined president.?Wiles previously worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and helped Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis win election in 2018.

Let's hope he lets RFK do a better job than he did when he was going to \\"drain the swamp.\\" That never happened.When you elect a politician, they're supposed to represent you and follow through on their campaign promises...

That's not real. And if you're going to believe a politician is your hero you might as well believe in the Easter Bunny &amp; Santa Clause.Again, MAN UP and hold them accountable. Again, I voted for him too but I GUARANTEE the agenda is not the one promised on the campaign trail. Why? Because it never is.But instead of holding them accountable, people defend them because their ego isn't strong enough to admit imperfection in themselves or the candidates they voted for.Also, the level of worship you guys have for Trump is homoerotic. I like him too. But if you bend over and defend him every time he waffles on a campaign promise he's never going to do anything for you. MAN UP.PS. This Biden nonsense is tabloid stuff.
