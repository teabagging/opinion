Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971, and his parents moved there due to the political climate of the time. His father, Errol Musk, was originally from Canada, but his family moved to South Africa, where they lived during the apartheid era, which his parents considered a more \\"favorable\\" environment. Apartheid (1948-1994) was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination, largely enforced by the National Party, which was aligned with Afrikaner nationalism. Afrikaners are not nazis, they closer resemble fascists. Afrikaners are Dutch-descended South Africans who developed their own distinct identity under the system of Afrikaner nationalism. This group promoted ethnic and cultural superiority, particularly of the white, Afrikaner-descended population, and they played a central role in enforcing the apartheid system.\\n- They don't have control of all media outlets, that's an absurd claim.

I dont doubt germanys want for control of the world but you had more of a chance surviving Hitler than trump. Price of eggs is too high? Deport immigrants. Gas prices are too much per gallon? Enact tariffs on everyone including our closest allies. At least in Nazi germany for those who werent Jews they lived an ignorant and peaceful life. In America everyone suffers and they think its for the good of the country because of the man in charge. When we talked about Hitler we talked about the end of humanity. Something most people think is just the idea of consciousness. Empathy. But when you think of Trump you should think of extinction. What happens when a plague hits America? Dont trust science, dont get the jab, its like the flu, liberals want you inside to keep you from living. What happens when disaster strikes democrat cities? They shouldve voted for me, nobody cares Im going on my 234th golfing trip, etc. What happens when a foreign power doesnt resign power or transfer ownership to us? Its our only option, we cant back down in the face of wokeism, we need it for the gulf of America, nuke them. Trump doesnt care about breaking societal norms, the law of America or internationally, or anybody for that matter. Using nuclear Armageddon wont bother him. Hell live in luxery while all his supporters and American citizens have their faces melting off and say well at least we dont have to deal with Bidens cost of eggs. Whats worse than concentration camps? Death to the human race. At least Hitler had a plan to keep the human race alive (albeit the worst way imaginable but at least humans would be alive) while Trump wouldnt care if everybody died as long as he had whatever prostitute he fell in love with recent to whatever event to cause extinction","title":"CMV: Nazi America is worse than Nazi Germany"},{"text":"He looks good in a hoody though.","title":"Sen.

Now, Im no theologian. So I cant say for certain whether this was indeed Gods plan.\\n\\nFrankly, though, I think it makes a lot more sense than the risible twaddle that was subsequently spouted at Trump by an actual bishop.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the president attended a service at the Washington National Cathedral. And astonishingly, one of the speakers �C a female bishop named Mariann Edgar Budde �C decided that this was the perfect opportunity to lecture Trump about his policies on trans rights andimmigration.\\n\\nLet me make one final plea, Mr President, she sniffed. In the name of God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families �C some who fear for their lives\\n\\nSorry, what? If any children fear for their lives right now, it can only be because theyve been listening to scaremongering propaganda from Left-wing activists. None of Trumps policies put gay or trans peoples lives at risk.\\n\\nAnd while were on the subject: could this bishop please clarify her position on gender ideology? Does she genuinely believe that some children are born in the wrong body? Because, if its the wrong body, that means God made a mistake. Does this bishop think God makes mistakes? And if so, does she tell Him this in her prayers?\\n\\nDear God: whoops! Looks like You screwed up again, and put another little girl in the body of a little boy! I cant believe You keep making this same dumb error! I thought You were meant to be infallible! Youd better pull Your finger out, or Im going to start worshipping some other deity!\\n\\nArguably, though, her comments on immigration were even more absurd. Some immigrants may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, she told the president, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\\n\\nWell, obviously. But Trump didnt pledge to deport the ones who are not criminals. He pledged to deport the ones who are. Does this bishop really think hes going to kick out everyone who was born abroad? That hes about to deport Elon Musk (born in South Africa), or his own wife (Slovenia)?\\n\\nThe whole sermon was utterly toe-curling. Especially given that this is precisely the sort of pompous, patronising, progressive drivel that, a mere two months ago, the American public rejected at the ballot box. They were sick of being lectured and scolded about these issues. So in truth, this woke bishops pathetic attack on Trump sums up why he won.\\n\\nOn top of that, many people will doubtless be wondering what exactly the bishops comments have to do with religion. If she can point to the chapter of the Bible where Jesus says Trans women are women, and deplores the severity of the US immigration system, Id be fascinated to read it.\\n\\nIn my view, though, the main question is: why on earth did she do this? Did she really imagine Trump would think: Say, this chick in the smocks got some great points. Why shouldnt we let millions of illegals live in our country? And why shouldnt we let dudes compete in the ladies boxing ? Im gonna rip up all the promises that got me elected, and govern just like Kamala would have!\\n\\nMaybe. Or perhaps she knew it was futile �C but said it anyway, because she just wanted applause from other liberals. Which is, lets face it, the number one reason why most modern liberals say anything.","title":"This woke bishops pathetic attack on Trump sums up why he won"},{"text":"I deleted Tok Tok when they started bowing to Trump...","title":"Is TikTok blocking anti-Trump content?

Efforts to improve diversity, the order reads, \\"deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement.\\" This paean to the importance of \\"excellence\\" and \\"hard work\\" comes from a man who, a mere five years ago, looked a row of medical researchers and doctors in the eye and suggested he understands science better than they do, despite having not studied it for a day of his life. He then theorized that Lysol and bleach be used to treat COVID-19 patients \\"by injection inside, or almost a cleaning, because, you see, it gets in the lungs,\\" aware of the basic scientific principle that painting your lungs in poisonous substances will kill you. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; The new executive order insists that recruiting diverse applicants is \\"diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination.\\" It was signed by a man who has nominated Pete Hegseth, an understudy Fox News host, to run the Department of Defense. Hegseth's only prior administrative experience comes from running two small-time charities into the ground, resulting in his removal from leadership. This ode to the value of skills and knowledge comes from the same half-literate president who also nominated Robert Kennedy to run the Health and Human Services agency, even though Kennedy claims cognitive decline from a brain worm and also refuses to accept the overwhelming scientific evidence showing vaccines are safe and effective. The only reason the alleged testament to \\"merit\\" is even readable is because someone other than Trump wrote it. The \\"merit\\"-loving president famously can't get through a 240-character social media post without multiple grammatical errors and misspellings. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; All three of these men embody the concept of incompetence, but they are white, straight and male. When Trump or any MAGA devotee is talking about \\"merit\\" or \\"excellence,\\" that is what they mean: whiteness, straightness and maleness.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; And the more incompetent or ignorant the straight white man is, the more he is held out as the exemplar of \\"merit\\" in MAGA-speak.","title":"Donald Trump's war on DEI is not about \\"merit\\": Executive orders attacking DEI are about promoting unqualified white men over diverse candidates"},{"text":"As a die hard 49er fan, can confirm that much change is demanded.","title":"Trumps First Moves: Toward More War, Nothing for Workers"},{"text":"Here's Tim Walz doing the exact same gesture:\\n\\nhttps://x.com/thejefflutz/status/1882089214847975646","title":"Ironic or hilarious?"},{"text":"Your mother is so woke that your dad turned woke!\\n\\n\\nDoes this make senseno but so doesnt the term woke.","title":"This woke bishops pathetic attack on Trump sums up why he won"},{"text":"Say youre mad about the Gulf of America, without saying youre mad about the Gulf of America.","title":"How can Trump rename the gulf of Mexico, it's not in the USA and the rest of the world has no obligation to use the new name?"},{"text":"It's not just that.

If voting was removed in a non-discriminatory manner (universally and regardless of class, race etc.) it would still be a violation of the right to vote. Framing the right to  vote as a negative right fundamentally makes no sense because (a)it requires the state to provide a democratic government where policy decisions are accountable to the votes being cast (making it inherently a positive right) and (b) because the right to vote in practice demands that the state provide people with the infrastructure (voting booths, election security etc.) to actually carry the right out.\\n\\nHistorically, right to petition in the US means to more than being able to voice grievances about the government without being persecuted(ie. it was originally articulated in response the perception that King George was ignoring the grievances of the colonies in the lead up to the revolution). Rather, it refers to the more significant right of having a channel of communication to the government, so that the grievances of the public are at least heard even if not acted upon. In practice, this takes the form of government offices providing official channels of communication through which the public can petition.\\n\\nThe right to access the legal system, and the right to seek justice comes part-and-parcel with the common law tradition (which isnt explicitly written in the US constitution, but which does form the basis of the US legal system and is explicitly used by judges in their decisions. In fact, most of how we interpretdue process is based in common law). If anything, US jurisprudence has strengthened this right compared to its common-law predecessors, seeing as it has a much stronger tradition of judicial review than its English counterpart. In terms of constitutional law, the right to sue would be captured under both the due process clause and the petition clause.","title":"How 9 Popular YouTubers Helped Trump Win a Second Term"},{"text":"Its quite consistent.

These elites rely on infrastructure, labor, and consumer markets to maintain their dominance, so the focus should be on targeted disruption by blocking supply chains, staging coordinated strikes in key industries, and boycotting companies that serve as their power bases. Pair this with public actions that expose how their wealth harms everyday people, making the injustice impossible to ignore. (I feel like that part is kind of happening already)\\n\\nBillionaires thrive on division and apathy, so uniting diverse groups like workers, students, unions, and activists is essential. Use decentralized organizing to make the movement harder to dismantle and avoid relying on hierarchies they can infiltrate or co-opt.\\n\\nWhen they dont care about public opinion, shift the pressure to what they do care about: control and profit. Disrupt infrastructure, block access to resources, and organize mass civil disobedience, like debt strikes or boycotts, to hit them where it hurts. Build alternative systemsmutual aid networks, cooperative businesses, and grassroots initiativesthat reduce dependence on their monopolies. Extreme measures, like shutting down ports or occupying their headquarters, must be framed as necessary responses to unchecked power. By staying focused, nonviolent, and relentlessly strategic, you can erode their influence and show that even billionaires are not untouchable.","title":"Donald Trump Controls a Publicly Traded Company.

Kennedy (the 35th President of the United States 1961 �C 1963) signs Executive Order 11110 which returns to the United States Government the power to issue currency, without going through the Rothschilds owned Federal Reserve. \\n\\nLess than six months later on November 22nd, President Kennedy is assassinated by the Rothschilds for the same reason as they assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865; he wanted to print American money for the American people, as oppose to for the benefit of a money grabbing war mongering foreign elite. \\n\\nThis Executive Order 11110, is actually rescinded by President Lyndon  Baines Johnson, an alleged Crypto-Jew (the 36th President of the United States 1963 to 1969), in one of the first acts he carries out as United States President. Another, and probably the primary, reason for Kennedys assassination is, however, the fact that he made it quite clear to Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, that under no circumstances would he agree to Israel becoming a nuclear state. \\n\\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz on February 5, 1999, in a review of, Avner Cohen's book, Israel and the Bomb, states the following on this subject, The murder of American President John F. Kennedy brought to an abrupt end the massive pressure being applied by the U.S. administration on the government of Israel to discontinue the nuclear program... The book implied that, had Kennedy remained alive, it is doubtful whether Israel would today have a nuclear option. \\n\\nA point of interest here, is that Kennedys wife, Jackie Kennedy, was Jewish. This is revealed by Gore Vidal, in his autobiography, Palimpsest �C A Memoir. It turns out Vidals  stepfather, Hugh Auchincloss, subsequently wed Jackie Kennedys mother, Janet Bouvier. This story was also covered in the New York Times on November 9, 1995.   \\n\\nAlso for those of you who saw the Oliver Stones JFK, which came up with a different conclusion with regard to the reasons for Kennedys assassination, you may wish to know that Oliver Stone is Jewish.","title":"Despite former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other government officials telling Trump not to release the JFK files in his first term, President Trump tells Sean Hannity he will release the files Immediately."},{"text":"That's all it took.","title":"Immigrants Rights Advocates Sue Trump Administration Over Fast-Track Deportation Policy | American Civil Liberties Union"},{"text":"To become the first Trillionaire by any means necessary.

They let us know where diseases are occurring around the world that could affect our health here or if we travel.

First let me preface by saying, as I see it, DEI is just a rebranding of \\"affirmative action\\", which is important because it should be evaluated over a longer term than we've been calling it DEI.\\n\\n1) The problems with AA/DEI are concrete, specific, visceral, and anecdotal. You can point to specific people who these systems screwed over, specific contracts that are working inefficiently, high budget and/or low quality because of its convoluted market meddling. But the benefits of it are fuzzy, abstract, probabilistic, and statistical. No minority business wants to say \\"we only got the job because of AA/DEI\\". That can mean either having to look at the ugly reality of a bigoted society, or on the other side, admitting that you're not good enough and didn't actually deserve it. Both are unpleasant. So our view of the effects of these programs is going to skew more negative than they actually are.\\n\\n2) Probably there were times and places when AA/DEI really were needed. Maybe that time still includes now, maybe it doesn't. Success ultimately means ending these programs. But because of the difficulty of accurately assessing the true need of these programs, it's hard to say when they should stop. There won't be a magic day in which all bigotry is ended and now we don't need it anymore. Instead the scales tip slowly toward the negatives outweighing the positives. And even if we were to somehow objectively correctly determine that these programs are now a net loss and should end, there will still be some cases of people who justifiable needed it and will be thrown into a prejudiced system, and that sucks.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"Hawk Tuah?","title":"President Trump SCORCHES his enemies: I went through four years of hell with this scum I had to deal with.

Likewise, the early embryo has two systems of ducts, Wolffian and Mllerian ducts, which are capable of developing into the male and female reproductive tracts, respectively. Once the SRY gene product stimulates the indifferent gonad to develop into a testis, the testis begins producing two hormones, testosterone and anti-Mllerian hormone, or AMH. Testosterone and one of its derivatives, dihydrotestosterone, induce formation of other organs in the male reproductive system, while AMH causes the degeneration of the Mllerian duct. In females, who do not contain the SRY protein, the ovary-forming pathway is activated by a different set of proteins. The fully developed ovary then produces estrogen, which triggers development of the uterus, oviducts, and cervix from the Mllerian duct.\\"*\\n\\nI don't know why, but blatant misinformation about human reproduction seems to be quite common in far-left circles in order to drive certain agendas, such as the idea that humans can change sex.","title":"Trumps Trans Ban Defines Everyone as Female  But Thats Not the Problem"},{"text":"To be blunt, if anything she was overly kind about it.

Who the Sutta is addressed to ( ie:- important to know what is their job, background, level of education, place they are from, and prior contact with the Buddha or Arhats ) and who is addressing the topic.\\n\\n2. Why does this Sutta even exist? Is it an answer in response to a question? Is it a response to a specific problem? Was it a private conversation that got recorded?\\n\\n3. What is the context the Sutta is set in ( back ground narrative or sometimes known historical context involving the people and also social norms of the day ).\\n\\n4. ( Optional ) How does it connect to other related Suttas? For example some Suttas are clearly addressed to the same person three to four times OR was addressed to the same village or same group.\\n- Some Suttas for example makes no sense if you fail to realise that it is a carry on conversation from a prior inquiry.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, there is a Sutta often mistaken in the 20th and 21st century to demean women when in fact its purpose was to reframe Anathapindikas mind.\\n\\nThe person being addressed is Anathapindika ( who we know a lot about and is likely a real historical person ) who was a merchant under the patronage of King Bimbisari. He was a generous merchant and fellow, and ran a charity. His wealth is acquired primarily through trade, not land. He was a first generation merchant who did good. He also so happened to be trading in a time land hoarding by the noble class in Bimbisaris kingdom was the norm so he did not own much land.\\n\\nAnathapindika also had only daughters. When Anathapindika had another daughter he lamented, and wished he had a son to continue his line ( aka in ancient India as carrying on his successful business ) and traditions.\\n\\nThe Buddha then consoled Anathapindika, telling him daughters can be as good as sons in that they can have vast moral virtues. Moreover such a virtuous woman may one day have a son who she will raise virtuously and be as good! ( so a son is only good if they are virtuous )\\n\\nThis is actually a jab at Anathapindika to remind him that line is not all, but moral virtue stands higher than all. It is to remind Anathapindka that yes he wants sons, but he has daughters and they can have moral virtues too.\\n\\nYes due to the laws and tradition of the time they cannot inherit his business, and because he lacks land they cannot be gifted it and become a landowner ( the Buddha was explicitly approving of women being allowed to inherit land from their parents, or purchasing it if they have money ), but ultimately that does not matter. What matters is moral virtues, which his daughters if raised well will be wealthy in.\\n\\nAlso this is a jab at male heirs as around the time of Anathapindikas last daughters birth there were a lot of strife between Prince Ajatassattu and King Bimbisari and the general public opinion was that the Prince was not half the father in terms of skill and also moral outlook ( and was a diplomatic disaster ). In the nearby kingdom, King Pasedanis son was also going awol, and part of this was attributed to Pasedanis Queen being quite power hungry ( thus the jab that a virtuous mother will raise a virtuous son ). Then there was Bimbisaris rival whose son was squandering wealth, and also a jab at the rivals wife who was impulsive and intemperate in nature. All these were public knowledge and events of each are mentioned elsewhere ( like clearly a Sutta to Bimbisari has to be shortly after seeing Anathapindika as the Buddha told Bimbisari that Anathapindika welcomes another lovely daughter  actual word used by the Buddha ).\\n\\nSo when you realise this context, it has nothing to do with women at all!! It was a jab at Anathapindikas assumption a male heir is even going to carry on the line, and forgetting that moral virtue matters way more ( and this was the traditional interpretation of this Sutta ) and his daughters can have moral virtues ( which all these sons clearly lacked ).\\n\\nAnd Anathapindika knew it was a jab ( despite its consoling nature ) because he never raised this topic ever again, and we know from Suttas from probably a decade later he raised his daughters well and lovingly. We also know one of his daughter became a landowner as she welcomed Ananda after the Buddhas passing to her land ( which she inherited from her dad ).\\n\\nWe also do not have Suttas after this telling us he yearned or sought for more children, so he must have got the point ( and probably seeing four kingdoms princes turned King gone rogue and literally restoring their parents kingdom and seeing two of his trade rivals family destroyed by useless sons made the Buddhas point clear to him ).","title":"The GOP Wants to Deport the Bishop Who Begged Trump for Mercy (She's From New Jersey)"},{"text":"[The new standards to be considered a progressive should be at least support of: raising the minimum wage, Medicare For All, A Green New Deal, and Expand SCOTUS : r/TheMajorityReport](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/1gv9yn1/the_new_standards_to_be_considered_a_progressive/)\\n\\n[Leftwing politics is very popular.

Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\\n\\nDisdain for the Recognition of Human Rights\\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \\"need.\\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\\n\\nIdentification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause\\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\\n\\nSupremacy of the Military\\nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\\n\\nRampant Sexism\\nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\\n\\nControlled Mass Media\\nSometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\\n\\nObsession with National Security\\nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\\n\\nReligion and Government are Intertwined\\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\\n\\nCorporate Power is Protected\\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\\n\\nLabor Power is Suppressed\\nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .\\n\\nDisdain for Intellectuals and the Arts\\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\\n\\nObsession with Crime and Punishment\\nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\\n\\nRampant Cronyism and Corruption\\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\\n\\nFraudulent Elections\\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.","title":"Trump grants temporary security clearances to officials who have not been fully vetted"},{"text":"If you would genuinely be in favour of rounding up CHILDREN from school and shipping them off to deport them (whatever that entails) I honestly don't know what to say beyond this - you're a real piece of shit.","title":"Trump administration authorizes ICE to make arrests at schools, churches"},{"text":"That was a Nazi salute, not a dab.

The FBI doesn't provide security for the Capitol. They did inform the Capitol police of potential for something to happen prior to January 6th. The FBI is not an organization that can prevent a mob of people from traveling on foot from the site of the rally to the Capitol Building; they aren't police, and they aren't the National Guard. It was possible for government to have done something earlier to stop the insurrection, but Trump didn't for obvious reasons.   \\n   \\n2. Merrick Garland wasn't the Attorney General when January 6th happened. The Justice Department can't declare someone ineligible to run for President.    \\n   \\n3. Didn't properly communicate to the American people? There were *ten* public hearings over the course of two years specifically about it that concluded with the recommendation that Trump be criminally charged. They were all over the news everywhere. Garland appointed a special investigator and Trump was charged as a result of those hearings. I'm sorry they didn't break everything down into a TikTok video for you.         \\n    \\n4. The delays that led to a lack of charges were the result of the Supreme Court's handling of the case. They were asked to and were capable of examining the cases in January of last year and rejected them, only to pick them up later after Trump was found liable for fraud and his other criminal cases were ready to proceed. They delayed for months again, only to issue a ruling that made him nearly immune to prosecution and large portions of evidence against him inadmissible. They were also responsible for striking down the Colorado court rulings that said Trump was ineligible. \\n     \\nYou want an explanation that isn't a book, it's pretty simple. Republicans fucked with every part of the system to make sure the result you see right now happened. Aileen Cannon is corrupt. The Supreme Court is packed with corrupt Republican justices that interfered with and undermined any efforts to hold Trump accountable. Georgia Republicans are corrupt, and did everything possible to interfere with and undermine the election interference case there. Mitch McConnell did everything possible to ensure that judges and justices were in place to force this outcome.     \\n     \\nThe institutions meant to protect the country from these things failed because Republicans started sowing the seeds to cause that to happen when Nixon was forced out, and there was no justice because half the country doesn't even care.     \\n     \\nPeople are always angry at not being saved and not being informed enough, but they never seem to direct it at the people who are actually responsible for doing all the terrible shit we see. If you want the answer to how everything happened that you're so angry about, you'll find it when you ask why that is.","title":"Trump claims FEMA is getting in the way and pitches abolishing it during first interview since return to White House"},{"text":"Not while we are still waiting on the Diddy list and the Epstein list.

Why are you making that seem like a bad thing? In your third paragraph you again say you can buy a \\"killer for hire\\" which is just not factual at all. You've bought into the propaganda but that's okay you can start learning from here. And there's more good than bad that comes from a free market. Let's say someone needs anti anxiety meds but aren't able to afford insurance in the US, they would be able to buy them. Let's say someone is on the brink of suicide and desperately needs anti depressants but aren't able to afford it or even get into a doctor to get a prescription, now they would have a route towards feeling better. Those are a few of the countless examples of good that can come from having a truly free market.

If it was up to me, Id support a combination of some sort of amnesty for people who are here already, a total overhaul of the legal immigration process to make it much easier to come in legally, and yes, enforcement at the border to prevent trafficking of drugs and people. Of course, I also realize that this is highly unrealistic in the current political climate.","title":"Trump is officially president."},{"text":"DemocratIC.

That hasnt happened because as annoying and horrible as political parties may be at changing during certain times, they are primarily in the business of winning elections.\\n\\nThey adapt, they change. Sometimes they make terrible decisions, I will concede that (2016 Dems, 2022 GOP, 2012 GOP, and the 2010 Dems come to mind). But the Democratic Party is in the business of winning elections. The current DNC leadership is imperfect  no one is perfect. But no matter who becomes chair they will try to win. Politics isnt like a video game or a sport where one team can self sabotage.\\n\\nBut I do agree that we need a new strategy going forward and we are at risk.

We interface with our DEI team regularly and are always looking at how to increase diversity in our applicant pool.\\n\\nNote that I said \\"applicant pool,\\" not \\"employee population.\\"\\n\\nI think there is fundamental misunderstanding of how these programs are **supposed** to work. The point isn't to choose to hire someone because they're a POC -- it's to recognize that POCs have a different mentality when applying for jobs, and get on their level. For example, many studies have shown that black people are more likely to self-select out if they don't meet all the requirements for a job and won't even apply, where white people are more likely to shoot their shot, leading to a pool that skews white. The point of the DEI program is to go where POCs are -- as an example, HBCU alumni job boards, or offering the job description in Spanish -- so that they know they're welcome here and we specifically want them to apply. \\n\\nFrom there, it's all about qualifications. I won't lie -- I have had hiring managers who also fundamentally misunderstand how these programs should work, and they say things like \\"we'd like to hire a person of color,\\" and my job is to **shut that down immediately.** I will send them the people who are most qualified for the job, regardless of race, and make sure that when they reject candidates, they are providing solid feedback as to why (\\"not a culture fit\\" doesn't fly). \\n\\nThe idea is that by increasing the diversity of the pool, we will naturally have a more diverse employee population. It's NOT about hiring someone because of the color of their skin, their gender, their pronouns or anything else at all.\\n\\nNow of course there are places that do it wrong. Harvard is a famous example, and I have no doubt that many colleges/universities are abusing DEI and giving the programs a bad name.

According to Mesa, Hernndez and a group of youths were throwing rocks at him while he attempted to detain a suspect along the U.S. side of the border. Mesa stated that the rock-throwing posed a threat to his safety, prompting him to fire his weapon across the border, killing Hernndez.\\n\\n&gt;However, eyewitness accounts and video footage contradicted some of Mesa's claims. Critics argued that the force used was excessive, as Hernndez was unarmed and allegedly not close enough to pose a significant threat. \\n\\n&gt;Following the 2010 cross-border shooting that resulted in the death of 15-year-old Sergio Adrin Hernndez Gereca, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa Jr. was not criminally charged or disciplined by U.S. authorities.  The U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute or extradite him for the incident.  In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hernndez v. Mesa that the Hernndez family could not sue Agent Mesa for damages, citing concerns over extending legal remedies to cross-border incidents.  As a result, Agent Mesa faced no legal consequences in the United States for his actions in this case.","title":"Trump shuts off access to asylum, plans to send 10,000 troops to border | A briefing document provides an early glimpse into the real-world application of Trumps executive orders on immigration and the border"},{"text":"In my experience, \\"quotas\\" don't exist, as in it's literally illegal to write down a number of blacks or hispanics you need, but informal hiring goals are a very real thing.

Let me break this down:\\n\\nYour free market argument assumes we're starting from a level playing field, which we aren't. I work in tech, and I've seen firsthand how \\"culture fit\\" interviews systematically filter out qualified candidates who don't match the existing demographic. The market isn't actually free when unconscious biases are baked into the system.\\n\\n&gt; if you allow a view to form that minorities are receiving opportunities not on merit, but on race alone, it undermines the entire racial group\\n\\nThis argument falls apart when you look at actual data. Studies show that companies with diverse leadership outperform their competitors by 36% in profitability. These aren't charity cases - they're smart business decisions. The \\"horror stories\\" you've heard are just confirmation bias - nobody talks about the countless successful diverse hires because they're just... doing their jobs normally.\\n\\nI actually agree with your third point about systemic issues, but here's the thing: we can work on multiple solutions simultaneously. Waiting for educational reform to fix everything means losing out on an entire generation of talent. DEI initiatives are like a pressure release valve - they're not the whole solution, but they help prevent the system from completely stagnating while we work on deeper reforms.\\n\\nYou mentioned Harvard's case, but consider this: without any DEI policies, we'd basically be saying that the current power structures, built on centuries of exclusion, should just... stay that way indefinitely. That's not free market - that's just preserving inherited advantage.\\n\\nThe real question isn't whether DEI is perfect - it's whether the alternatives are actually better. So far, I haven't seen any better solutions for breaking up entrenched power structures while maintaining business performance.","title":"CMV: DEI is (Almost) Always a Fundamentally Poor Idea"},{"text":"Can I come live in your world?","title":"House passes Laken Riley Act, sending the first bill to Trump to sign into law"},{"text":"You can disagree all you like,  but what i posted was the authors own words describing who was not considered \\"under the jurisdiction of.\\"","title":"The illegal immigration hearing"},{"text":"Capitalism*","title":"Only an issue when it's someone around Trump"},{"text":"This is what victory feels like.
