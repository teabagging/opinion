Iraq taking Kuwait would have allowed Saddam the ability to disrupt and exploit the oil trade in the region, and eventually consolidate enough power to be more than a rogue dog on a leash of US foreign diplomacy. Why would he need our trinkets if he could disrupt western access to oil and reap the benefits?The US paid Iraq to aggressively make trouble with Iran, who has the longest border on the Persian Gulf. Iran emerged as a power hostile to US interests in the region after the Shah was overthrown by parties who were upset by the Shah's cooperation with the west and liberalization at the hands of US diplomacy. Following the full decline of relations with Iran, the US spent significant sums of money creating a friendly nation bordering Iran from which to stage a long term economic (and bang-bang) war against Iran.Iraq invading Kuwait was basically Iran 2.0 for the US; Yet another cooperative trading partner giving the US the finger and cutting them out of the cheap oil deals. The US knew Saddam was killing Kurds in the North, and was using internationally banned chemical weapons in Iran from 1980 to 1988. It wasn't until Saddam started fucking with the tankers in the gulf that the US decided to kick Saddam's teeth in.Iraq II was a strategic move in the now decades old proxy war with Iran. It was about controlling the gulf and standing up strong military industrial complex assets with which to monitor Iranian activity in the gulf and ensure that oil continued to flow out of the middle east, to the west. It was not simply \\"for the oil.\\". It was to further drive a wedge between the rest of OPEC and Iran. The US views Iran as a hostile state, and has largely gotten the rest of the Persian gulf to play ball with their trade interests. Iran, on the other hand, wants the US the fuck out of the region. The Ayatollah rose to power in Iran due to popular frustrations with western influence in the region. In Iraq, we had helped stage the Ba'ath coup, and just six months after the coup in Iran, we installed Saddam Hussein as a dictator. He began a war with Iran fewer than six months after his rise to power, with US monetary and arms support.US involvement in Iraq has **always** been about Iran.","title":"CMV: you can not make a logically consistent argument as to  why NATO overthrowing Slobodan Milosevic was justified but America overthrowing Saddam Hussain wasn't"},{"text":"But they are throwing their weight around.

It was not used as a justification for the invasion in either Desert Storm or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\\\\ chemical weapons,targeting civilians and merchant vessels are blatantly illegalThis also occurred in 1988, and Iraq ceased military use of chemical weapons in 1991. These acts were not the pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\\\\ he invaded Iraq and Kuwait completely unprompted couldn't one say that he would start another war?You mean Iran in the first bit. The US provided Iraq with funding and arms with which to wage war with Iran, and ignored its use of chemical weapons in the 1980 offensive in Iran. The US did condemn the use of chemical weapons by Saddam in 1984, but continued to provide military assistance to Iraq. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the US became concerned that Saddam Hussein might be plotting to consolidate regional control over access to oil and shipping lanes through the region. They felt that if Kuwait was not protected, Iraq might begin to gain enough power that he might actually stand a chance to consolidate the economy of the whole region and disrupt western interests in the middle eastern oil trade. NATO agreed, and chose to collectively intervene in 1991, resulting in the surrender of Iraq and a ceasefire agreement as well as heavy sanctions and concessions following the war.The pretext of the 2002 invasion of Iraq was on the basis of violating these UN sanctions that were put in place following the 1991 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq sold oil, which was sanctioned at the time, via a loophole that allowed them to sell oil in order to purchase food, but then funneled the money from these sales into the procurement of military weaponry. They also sold weapons and provided aid to rogue actors that the UN security counsel had declared to be terrorist organizations, specifically the Palestinian Liberation Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization, a terrorist splinter faction of the Palestine Liberation Front. The final straw was when Saddam Hussein ejected UN weapons inspectors from his country and signaled he would no longer honor the terms of UNSC resolution 681. The UNSC put together a new set of resolutions, which demanded certain concessions, or they would authorize joint invasion of Iraq. Saddam refused to comply with this new resolution, and the second NATO invasion of Iraq began some months later.The reason your argument is so flawed, comes down to the justifications you are using. Let's break this down a little more simply. Your use of the Kurdish genocide in the 1980s in particular as a justification for the Iraq war in 2001 as one of the primary threads to draw parallels to the Kosovoan genocide is obviously flawed because the US response to Slobodan's genocidal acts came within 12 months of the initiation of hostilities, yet the US's response to Iraqs genocide of the Kurds simply never came. The Iraq war was not at all based on Saddam's genocide; The US was quite happy to fund him while he was doing it. We only invaded him in 1991 because if he controlled Kuwait, he would become sustainably wealthy and it would be difficult to keep him destabilizing Iran for the trinkets the US was throwing his way. Further, Iraq controlling Kuwait would give him significant leverage over the entire region's oil trade, damaging US and European interests.US involvement in Kosovo had quite a bit more to do with Russian foreign policy than the Genocide, but in the case of both Kuwait and Kosovo, preserving a nation's sovereignty to harm the economic opportunities of a foreign adversary in the face of eradication of a people is clearly a lesser evil than providing arms to a nation that is committing genocide, condemning their genocide, but still encouraging them to maintain an armed conflict against a mutual adversary.**TL;DR:** What the US did in Kosovo is logically and morally very different from what the US did in Iraq, on the basis that we had no hand in aiding Milosevic in his genocide, yet we very much did Saddam's.","title":"CMV: you can not make a logically consistent argument as to  why NATO overthrowing Slobodan Milosevic was justified but America overthrowing Saddam Hussain wasn't"},{"text":"Exactly where a right hand would land tbh.","title":"Its always the left eye"},{"text":"[Cats are cute](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mastodo-neoliber-al/cache/media_attachments/files/113/530/975/817/266/190/original/decba7edcc932005.jpg)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The CIA are a mess rn.

Those are all unreachable ideals, the best you can do is the least worst option. Keeping in mind not acting is also a choice &amp; you are no less accountable for the consequences. Your damned if you do &amp; you are damned if you don't. What makes an action legitimate is the process by which the decision is made &amp; the extent to which that process is corrupt or ignoble. Institutions like courts, laws, The UN are just tools to protect against the abuse of power &amp; maintain a monopoly on the use of violence while using it as judiciously as possible.

We werent doomed to lose because egg prices were high, we were doomed to lose because we werent willing to fundamentally change the system that resulted in those prices being high. Voters took a chance with Trump because he seemed like he *would* fundamentally change the system (albeit in ways that most informed people would be totally opposed to).","title":"The Electoral Problem for Democrats: Its the Neoliberalism, Stupid"},{"text":"I mean thats kinda exactly what a fall looks like.

But this may be the most interesting and unexpected, proving that politics is more a subjective than an objective/rational enterprise:Second, voters open to Trump or to sitting out were and still are deep in what I term the credulity chasm: finding the right-wing Project 2025 agenda repugnant but waving it away as unlikely to come true. In an August survey the Research Collaborative conducted with Data for Progress, 58 percent of Democratic voters believed that Republicans would implement the Project 2025 agenda if they achieved power, with 28 percent stating theyd try but fail and 14 percent assuming they wouldnt even attempt it. In contrast, 21 percent of Republican voters perceived the Project 2025 agenda would be enacted, 28 percent said it would be attempted without success, and a majority  51 percent  believed Republicans would not set out to implement this agenda. This incredulity persists. In a post-election survey the Research Collaborative fielded with Hart Research, Harris voters broke 87/13 on whether its likely versus unlikely that Trump will deport millions of immigrants including those here legally, but Trump voters split 60/40 on this. Only 18 percent of Harris voters think a national abortion ban is unlikely, whereas 69 percent of Trump voters give this response. Indeed, on our battery of what is likely to happen under a Trump administration and the attendant outcomes, Harris and Trump voters are almost mirror opposites in their predictions.

Literally Bernie Sanders, himself, was a super delegate in 2016.The DNC furthermore repeatedly asked the media not to include the super delegates in their delegate totals.Finally, there isn't any real evidence that super delegates caused anyone to support Bernie any less than what one might get with simple endorsements.  Hillary did best with people with more actual experience with previous Democratic primaries, while Bernie did best people with less experience with previous Democratic primaries.

But it should not be the cause and reason to why we as humans, have refused to evolve our beliefs, and values, we instead pushed for further comfort to ourselves, and further feed the desires we were tempted with.Instead of running away to America, and kicking over the Natives, what if our ancestors, founders, stayed and stood up for a more understanding society. People might have died, been prosecuted, but guess what? That happened when the US screwed over the natives, they were robbed, violated, killed, prosecuted, just as our founders ran from. Instead of revealing smoking and other drugs once handed out like candy, were found dangerous, companies instead suppressed information and lied to protect their own interests and desires that only extended to themselves, not for some push for a growing world and understanding.   \\nI personally, was not perfect, although I could sit back and say I was a complete victim and I owe nobody, I can't deny I have made selfish mistakes, I have hurt people as they have hurt me, albeit not as severe, but it doesn't dissuade the fact I would be a hypocrite for believing I don't deserve to live, learn, and grow in this sick world. Because even though it probably will never be the Eden some people believe they deserve, if we can make it our own Eden the best we can, while not impeding on people trying to achieve a similar healthy goal, we might just end up at that Eden because we didn't need to be given our life path on a silver platter.Even if anyone is just beyond even chancing or at least co-existing with this, through sickness or choice, like a sick person who commits a crime without a proper grasp at the full extent of their actions, they will be given pity by the good power. If our flawed legal systems can even sometimes, correctly mold around, and understand a sick person and their situation that promoted and encouraged their actions in question, from undeserved punishment, or unintentional harm that they wouldn't be able to even properly understand or have a chance to reflect and grow from, the beings above us that are up there for a reason (Because we aren't because we are here, and we all here need to be here because of our deep flaws and kinks in the rope that everyone has).

I believe they don't want the least, they would rather try and work things out post-living with the absolute goal of reuniting you with the ones you do care about, those you haven't met, and to achieve the dreams beyond this world like being given a endless digital canvas, over the pad and paper you once grew up with.The later opinions I share are subjective, but what I can believe isn't, that at the end of the day the higher power is always watching, \\"evil\\" is played for fools, and sometimes I believe they do torment and tempt us with poor choices and beliefs, but I believe those can happen because we need that pushback from the good, to encourage us to the good, and I don't think \\"the good\\" would want to have to pretend to encourage anything except that which would take us beyond the pain we can often trap ourselves in, but they have to let us develop on our own, learn, and create our own desire and understanding to thrive and continue on, rather than have them just force us as such.","title":"You live in Satans kingdom"},{"text":"Or a window","title":"Its always the left eye"},{"text":"That would be amazing!","title":"EPIC: Elon Teases Possible New Media Acquisition That Would Drive the Left Insane"},{"text":"lol probably so, just dont think its vril myself.

It is their fault they didn't get up and push a character arch for themselves, if we call it that.It is self admittedly hard, even for me to separate what I wish was the reason life was dirty, vs what we do know, and we can move on with.I struggle from PTSD and anxiety nearly everyday, and this isn't clout I'm spitting for, the simple fact is I could easily gaslight myself into believing I was wronged through childhood and through education because the evil Archons or something are the reason my surroundings were not friendly, welcoming, or always peaceful.I could lie to myself, and craft a religious narrative around the idea my religions enemy is the reason my life was shit, but that's alleviating having a straight perspective at what we can know now.It might be true, this is a soul trap.

Looking at the situations I've experienced, and learn from them so the dirt path I walk and leave behind, doesn't kick dirt against others who aren't at the same understanding of mentality or progress, or are on a whole different path than me.I can look out for them, give a suggestion, be a friend, but at the least, if I have to walk away, I want to make damn sure that if we one day meet back at the path we met, to look back, I would hope there can be a mutual understanding of the faults we both may have made to each other, and the good we did commit, whether to the person, or for ourselves then on due to the encounter(s) we did have.If this is a soul trap, trying to expose it isn't going to make you an awesome tressure to be \\"saved\\" from the soul claw trap.If such a concept existed, and if we are in a soul trap, we escape by making the best of our situation, and evolving the mental muscles beyond the mind that are hard to strengthen, which is understanding, responsibility, and initiative, and knowing when to let go.(1/2 Because it wouldn't let me send this longer)","title":"You live in Satans kingdom"},{"text":"Oh, just wait.

[...] As part of the deal, Republicans have agreed to the schedule. Previously, they were forcing procedural votes in order to slow down the confirmation process. The issue with the deal, however, is that all of the judges will be district court judges rather than circuit court judges, meaning that Republicans will likely get to appoint the replacements for the four pending vacancies on the circuit court level, potentially giving Republicans even more control over the federal judiciary on the appellate level.","title":"Categorically unacceptable: Advocates say Dems letting Trump appoint \\"radical extremist\\" judges"},{"text":"Sadly, the text of the current bill doesnt give them much. The decision to revoke tax free status lies solely with the Secretary of the Treasury. For reference, Trumps current pick is hedge fund manager [Scott Bessent,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/politics/scott-bessent-treasury-secretary-trump/index.html) who was a financial policy advisor for the campaign. [The bill](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr9495/BILLS-118hr9495eh.xml) allows the Secretary to rescind the tax-free filing status of a non-profit that provides material support or resources to a terrorist supporting organization within a three-year period from the notice. Designation of terrorist organizations is done, without oversight, by the Secretary of Homeland Security (the current nominee is [Kristi Noem](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/kristi-noem-homeland-security-secretary/index.html)) by notifying Congressional leadership per [8 USC 1189.](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1189&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim) There are provisions for a judicial review, but I dont think I need to show anyone references of how *that* might play out. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines a non-profit is in violation of this bill, they are required to notify the non-profit, which then gets 90 days to either demonstrate to the Secretary they did not provide material support, or made reasonable efforts to have such support or resources returned and certify in writing that they will provide no further support.There is no provision requiring the Treasury Secretary to publish their findings or methodology. The removal of tax-free status can be reviewed by the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or by US District Courts, but there is no requirement for either, nor does a dispute of the designation by the non-profit trigger either review process. Additionally, there is no provision to *remove* the designation if a review finds it to be erroneous. The Treasury Secretary would essentially have to agree with the findings of the appeal to remove the designation. If this bill concerns you *(and it fucking should),* you should [contact your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm) and urge them not to take up this bill in the Senate. If youre **fucking concerned** that your Representative voted to pass this bill, with full understanding of its impacts due to [a letter to Congress from the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/documents/civil-society-letter-to-congress-opposing-hr-9495), co-signed by **150 non-profit organizations,** I strongly urge you to [contact your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives).

But of course you don't actually need capitalism's abusive exploitation to survive. You can make do with less meat and eggs and milk and eat more grains and vegetables. That's a choice.we have enough food to feed the world yet people continue to starveWe have enough food to feed the world because we produce so much. We produce so much by using exploitative practices. If we stopped doing the exploitative practices everything would cost more. Which is the thing you are trying to say would be bad.we know sweatshops exist yet we still are happy to consume fast fashion - all because capitalism creates artificial scarcity, demands competition within an abstracted marketplace, and creates the need for profitYou know exploitation existed before capitalism right? Like literally slaves and colonialism predate capitalism?If we all lived in small villages which provided all our necessities and where we could trade goods amongst ourselves with equal footing, we absolutely would refuse to trade with the business owner who would beat their staff or the farmer that would unnecessarily abuse their animals (this is just an example, not saying we should go back to this system).This argument makes no sense and comes from a bizarre place of leftist agrarianism. If we all lived in small villages everything would cost more and every resource would require more labor to create. We would therefore be MORE desperate, not less, and the farmer who abuses his animals would be the cheapest and therefore best option. Nothing about the scenario you described has changed the economic argument you were trying to make before. People will not suddenly develop morals just because they live in a small town - if anything the opposite is true.I know of egg farmers who would love to minimise suffering done to chickens, however its simply not economically viable to do so, and under the current system, market forces would soon bankrupt them.That's because of consumer choices. And of course it's not true either since there are many ethical chicken farmers who proudly advertise their ethicality and reach audiences because of it.capitalism forces the hand of many people and provides a convenient smokescreen to obfuscate many of these harmsIt does provide a smokescreen, which makes me ask: why are you trying to empower that smokescreen? People have the ability to make actual choices and they are choosing the path of cheaper goods in exchange for animal torture. It is a choice they are deliberately making and they could choose not to make. It is not \\"forced\\". Even in a socialist economy, whether worker-owned cooperatives or state-owned enterprises, people would still have to choose between animal welfare and production efficacy. If people won't choose animal welfare in a capitalist economy what makes you think they'd do it in a socialist one?","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":",,,,, her hair","title":"Jan 6 was not a insurrection it was a democrat hoax to entrap innocent people of a crime to steal the 2020 election."},{"text":"Here's a sneak peek of /r/jordan using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/jordan/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!\\\\#1: [? ](https://i.redd.it/q10yalu87cuc1.jpeg) | [182 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/1c3g86m/?/)  \\n\\\\#2: [The kids are alright.](https://i.redd.it/s37jing0izec1.jpeg) | [25 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/1acaryy/the_kids_are_alright/)  \\n\\\\#3: [ ?  ? ?? ??  ??  ?? ? ? ?? ??  ??](https://v.redd.it/niyggkdyt2vc1) | [170 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/1c6g6u8/_?__?_??_??__??__??_?/)\\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ^^[Contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| ^^[Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| ^^[Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/) ^^| ^^[GitHub](https://github.com/ghnr/sneakpeekbot)","title":"Jordan evicts Palestinian refugees, demolishes homes for road expansion project"},{"text":"This article perpetuates the willful ignorance of the American people.

We knew that racism and misogyny would impact the race, and create a headwind for the Harris campaign. It was a given. But the happy happy joy joy Liz and Bernie sitting in a tree endorsing the same nominee campaign track was an absolute failure to read the moment. No meaningful bloc of voters wanted what Cheney was selling. It was the same thing many people were saying but the campaign gurus clearly thought the fact that *she* was saying it would substantially shift votes. I cant believe it even now that Im typing it. In hindsight people really wanted what Bernies been selling all along. Not a high faluting defend the constitution lede (which Im definitely here for), but unapologetically prioritizing jobs, housing, healthcare. And yet he took a backseat to an Iraq War pyschos daughter in the home stretch. They wanted to have Bernie defending their left flank instead of centering his themes. Probably Trumps most popular act as President was his infamous stimulus check, a political outcome forced on him by Dems but for which they amazingly failed to get any enduring credit. It was purely universalist, socialist af, until he and his fascist minions stole glory and co-opted it. He also did PPP and EDA which saved tens of millions of jobs and kept primary industries functioning. Again only because it got forced upon him from the left given harrowing economic data. Hammer, anvil. Now Id say the Harris platform started to come into form with a fairly Bernie-esque silhouette. Lowering taxes for the poor, raising them for the rich, first-time home-buying and startup business support, child tax credit etc. Of course we can say was too late/not enough etc etc. But it may age well as Trumps chickens already be coming home to roost. Those ideas represent something to build upon into 26. Id a)  dispense with the implicit apologist tone re: progressive policies, and b) err more on the side of universalist policy models. They just come across as fair to voters, and tend to be highly progressive in addressing people in the most acute need, directly. Like Trumps check. On an related topic Im utterly flabbergasted why they didnt hammer Trump relentlessly on where he left the country in 2020. - Hundreds of thousands of Americans dying horrifying slow deaths from preventable disease\\n- A massively botched quarantine that had all the inconveniences but a fraction of the success it could have had\\n- Unprecedented decline in social activity and increase in mental health crises\\n- Widespread and profound isolation and prolonged fear\\n- a corresponding economic collapse averted only through what was arguably the most socialist subsidy program since FDR\\n- Insurrection and civil strife, a literally smoldering occupied Capitol with dead police and civiliansI mean when was the last time people had it that hard, had their lives so quickly turned upside down- all together, all at once?

It's already been brought to light publicly that millions of these immigrants are receiving MORE MONEY than a lot of us citizens are, Even getting put up in five star hotels and given credit cards loaded with funds. The amount of money it takes to house and provide benefits to these people IN ONE MONTH  despite the fact they are not supposed to be here surpasses the amount it will cost to throw them on a damn plane and drop them off in their country. I've heard rumors that some of these people are getting 2,000 to $3,000 a month. That's utterly despicable and unacceptable besides the American people have decided by voting for Trump that they want these people gone And it is our country after all... If the politicians want to support these people out of their own pockets using their million dollar net worths from using internal secrets to beat the stock market then fine by me, but it's not out of their pockets because they don't use their own money THEY USE OURS! So let the debating stop America has spoken on Trump's mandate by voting for him we want these people gone and we want them gone now. We the American people decided we wanted Trump after he told us what he wanted to do, we've made up our mind.For the record it has nothing to do with racism, or judgmental natures, or being greedy, it simply has to do with logical common sense. If your neighborhood is on fire you are going to save your children before you save your neighbor's children - your average liberal Kamala Harris supporter would say that means you're going to leave your neighbor children to die, when in reality what that means is you are going to save your children and then immediately try to run over and save the neighbor's children. AS ANY SANE PARENT WOULD DO sorry but I take care of me and mine first. That is not to say I would leave the neighbor's kids hanging mine just have to come first, And that is not even a hard thing to decide. That analogy works for the country as well we need to worry about America and their legal citizens first, our tax money supports our economy therefore it is our money therefore it is our economy and OUR COUNTRY.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"Color me not the least bit surprised.??","title":"Bombshell House Judiciary Report: Criminals, Sex Traffickers Used Biden-Harris Parole Pipeline to Get into U.S."},{"text":"This headline is 100% misinformation!

Thanks to the EV market, those volumes of batteries aren't even that large.Moreover, [the NREL Seams study](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/seams.html) found that building an HVDC supergrid to connect the continental US would in fact *save money* even with the current electricity mix.  Looking at the [full paper](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/76850.pdf), Table 3 shows that a national-scale HVDC macrogrid would require about $48B of investment, a drop in the bucket as compared to the $2,360B in operating costs over the 35 years analyzed.From a technical standpoint, a reliable US grid powered solely by solar+wind+storage is a *solved problem*.\\n When you account for all the extra storage, transmission upgrades, and redundancies needed to make 100% renewables work, the costs go way up. Nuclear has a higher upfront costBoth technologies are essentially all upfront cost.[Weighted by capacity, solar and wind cost about $1.5B/GW](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63485), and the US averages about 450GW of power consumption, so the grid described in the paper above would cost:  \\n * Generation:  450GW x $1.5B/GW x 2 = $1,350B  \\n * Storage:  $500B (from above)  \\n * Transmission:  $48B (from above)  \\n * **Total:  $1.9T**To get an equivalent price, even with the generous assumptions of (a) 100% capacity factor, and (b) no demand peaks, nuclear's cost-competitive price would be:  \\n * 450GW x N = $1.9T  \\n * N = $1.9T / 450GW  \\n * N = **$4.2B/GW**[Peak demand can be 60% higher than average demand](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60602), which could be handled by perhaps 2-3h of storage, so another $100B.  Realistic capacity factors in the USA are very high, 90-95%, so another perhaps 7% there, or $130B, taking the per-GW cost to about $3.9B/GW.That price is probably too low for the USA to achieve, but it's not totally outlandish -- while labor costs differ, Korean reactors are typically not that much more expensive, and Chinese reactors can be cheaper.  So it *may* be a feasible alternative!However... Time:...this one is the real problem.The world (much less the US) is installing new wind+solar at about [100x](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/solar-power-continues-to-surge-in-2024/) the rate of new nuclear, or about 20-25x even after adjusting for capacity factor.  [History shows that it takes about 15 years to 10x a heavy industry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20437-0), so it would be about *2050* by the time new nuclear could get up to where wind+solar are *today* (20 years to 20-25x + 5 years to finish that set of reactors).Delaying decarbonization of our power generation in the *hopes* of a nuclear rennaissance would add *at least* 0.5C to peak warming.  Due simply to logistics, the *only* option to significantly reduce emissions before 2050 is continued deployment of renewables.","title":"CMV: The USA can and should transition to 100% renewable electricity and its better than nuclear.

I think its the same frustrations being expressed but without the class analysis element. Personally I think that lack of class analysis makes their positions fairly incoherent though and led to them getting co-opted by the billionaire class fairly quickly. A lack of analysis of things like capital and class interests is what separates libertarianism from its anarchist analogues on the left though, in many other ways they are quite similar. I cant tell if this is actually an inflection point or not. The last Trump presidency saw him essentially just do a bunch of stuff that I think any Republican would do just with his own personal flair. I have a feeling this presidency wont be much different. I dont think hell actually take on institutions like the state department and cia, maybe Im wrong though. The left is in disarray because the DNC doesnt have a coherent mission. This is largely due to them being completely captured by the donor class in my opinion. I hope that this changes but I dont know if it will tbh.

One important thing that my link left out is district magnitude--the number of representatives per district. This is probably the most important variable when designing a PR system. The larger the district magnitude, the more fragmented the party system. (In fact, there's a formula, the \\"seat product model\\", developed by the political scientists Shugart and Taagepera, which can predict party fragmentation quite accurately based only on total number of seats and mean district magnitude!)So anyway, to avoid a hyper-fragmented party system, you can choose PR with a moderate district magnitude (say, around 5-10). This is a good middle ground that gives voters more choices than a 2 party system, while still only electing parties with at least moderately high support. This forces them to reach out to at least a few voters outside their base.The stuff you said about a 2 party system facilitating pandering to moderates sounds kind of like the median voter theorem. It may have explained out politics well at one time, but we've seen empirically that this is no longer what happens (at least in US politics since roughly the start of this century). Part of it may have to do with primaries--one of our more pathologically unique institutions in this country--but a big reason the median voter theorem fails, purely from a mathematical perspective, is that it assumes issue preferences are one-dimension (L-R). In reality, this isn't the case. So, for instance, the GOP can appeal to voters on cultural issues, even though it's far to the right of the median voter on economics.","title":"U.S. Rep.

Only works if all the supermarkets manage to do price fixing.

And thats where immigrants come in with their [UN debit card](https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/09/the-mysterious-un-debit-cards/) and other [local debit card programs](https://nypost.com/2024/03/26/us-news/nyc-begins-handing-out-prepaid-debit-cards-to-migrants-in-controversial-program/) Why do you think car prices have stayed as high as they soared to during covid? It was cause of covid for some reason, right?The answer for why the prices went soaring during Covid and stays at the same level can be understood by taking one quick glance at the [Federal ReserveBalance Sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) aka \\"How much the money printers are printing\\"Initially they used the excuse of [Repo Market Crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_events_in_the_U.S._repo_market) to start the money printers to fund the pandemic.As the pandemic started trailing off, they passed \\"Inflation Reduction Act\\", which was another excuse to keep the money printers printing, to fund \\"green energy\\" and other progressive agenda. Other excuses to keep the printers running - Ukraine war.In today's economy, the monetary inflation (aka increasing money supply) is the primary cause for price inflation because the newly supplied money is coming at the expense of reduced value of all existing money. Market economics 101.\\"But Keynesians tells us we can keep printing money ...\\"Yes, as long as you can artificially keep up the demand for that money by forcing all countries to use USD to buy Oil, and you eliminate any \\"dictator\\" who dares to [create their own stable currencies](https://theecologist.org/2016/mar/14/why-qaddafi-had-go-african-gold-oil-and-challenge-monetary-imperialism) not bound to the imperial petro-dollar.And, as long as they can keep up with the [forever wars](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_IGU_7alJ80) necessary to keep enforcing this financial paradigm on the world. As this paradigm comes crumbling down with the increased awareness of the people, the prices catch up to the monetary inflation.What people get wrong about the illegal immigration is not that immigration caused the prices to go up/down OR deportation will cause the prices to up/down. Its the opposite. Monetary inflation to fund the pandemics and wars is what made it necessary to bring in mass immigration, and as the fiat USD falls flat on its face with increasing [de-dollarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedollarisation) the population will need to be reduced whether people like it or not.Even if the millions of illegals cannot be physically deported, does not matter. The market will take care of this.Once the charade ends and the dollar starts crashing, and their debit cards start going dry, and the conflicts in their home countries can no longer be funded anymore, not just illegals, but a lot of legal immigrants will start making their way back home.The future will be bright, not just to US but to the whole world.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"This is a conspiracy sub so maybe there was a coordinated effort by the capitalist class to gouge the middle and lower classes, stretch them so thin, that they become susceptible to propaganda one way or another.

Great video thanks for the link. Supreme gut dysfunction seems pretty spot on to what long haulers experience, and I've also struggled with candida my whole life. Did you know a new strain was making its rounds during COVID, and this one can transmit via skin contact? It also reacts to radiation on its own. It's called candida aureus.I use coconut oil to keep it under control, but when I don't use it, my god what a crappy experience.I'd wager the faster learning as well as increased appetite and gut mobility is likely because rf-emf radiation is (very) cholinergic, which can speed peristalsis (movement) through the gut, and increases learning. Also makes you depressed.5g also causes a ton of static, ozone, can use human skin pores as receivers, and (can) cause eyelids to flicker. The general consensus in the news when 5g was released stated that people worldwide reported the  \\"sensation of static\\". People with high acetylcholine naturally, overmethylators, and the autoimmune crowd, are especially susceptible. I have a theory, and it's 2 things - long haulers are generally female, and wear glasses/jewellery. Metals can absorb and transmit certain wavelengths, like millimeter waves, hence the \\"flickering eye thing\\" we have. Secondly, body hair is protective, and I'd wager that's largely why the rats and males are more protected.Another thought, the nerve dysfunction seen in long haulers is in 2 spots - a nerve in your chest, likely the phrenic, (chest pain) and the back of the neck (neck pain), just below the brainstem. This is fairly spot on to radiation injury nerve damage. When those are activated, it activates the diaphragm, causing you to inhale. Scientists keep looking for a cause for low oxygen utilization in long haulers, when I'd say they may consider the opposite. Hyperoxia.I mean COVID may have just tipped the scales in susceptible individuals, to wreck the lungs and nerves  just enough to be sensitive to external stimuli (apparently it can cause chorea: a susceptibility to pressure changes and radiation sources). Who knows. The people who set up 5g would rather kill us all than give us honest answers.","title":"What happened to the 5G conspiracy?"},{"text":"It's a bold strategy, lets see how it works out for them.","title":"Harris is Democrats preferred choice for 2028"},{"text":"Ironic that's literally the week after my birthday too","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 22, 2024"},{"text":"I dont think we'll Gaetz to the truth","title":"Matt Gaetz ??: What Actually Happened"},{"text":"Dems: We're gona make Mike Johnson's life hell!Democrat Voters: How?Dems: By rolling over on our backs and peeing on our bellies!","title":"House Democrats prepare to make Mike Johnson's life hell"},{"text":"I think the \\"logic\\" is that by putting a ridiculous pick first, a loony who's more qualified being appointed instead looks reasonable.

Evidence-based research suggests that advancements in technology, such as in-ovo sexing, are becoming more feasible and cost-effective. By investing in and prioritizing these technologies, we can eliminate the need for culling altogether, thereby addressing the ethical concerns associated with the practice.Furthermore, the argument that exporting surplus meat destabilizes developing nations' economies overlooks the potential for creating sustainable and equitable food systems. By collaborating with these nations to develop local poultry industries, we can foster economic growth and reduce dependency on imported meat. This approach not only addresses the ethical concerns of culling but also promotes global food security and economic stability.In conclusion, while culling may currently appear to be the least cruel option, it is crucial to consider the long-term ethical and economic impacts.

So these companies have zero incentive to move towards a free model. They have to take the time and money to set up such a system and theyd receive no reward. Like I said, they *don't really have a choice* but to change. It means absolutely fuck all if they don't feel like it, their power means diddly squat in the end. The system will either change, or it will *be changed*.Even if we ignore that and just skip to the part where production is automated and the costs are very low to free, there is still other jobs and labor involved. Running those companies, running the government, keeping the infrastructure going, transportation, maintenance etc. people will still work and be paid for their labor. So lets just say to get around this, the goods arent free but maybe just really really cheap. Again, the *vast* majority of things can be automated, leaving basically just art, politics, and science. *Everything* else can be taken care of, robots at every level just as there were once humans at every level, with only very minimal input from us like \\"hey, make a building over here\\". And things aren't free, that's not what UBI is and I feel you literally didn't even look it up (it's like you *want* to aggressively misunderstand what I actually believe), UBI is just where things still cost the same and you still get a wage, except it's from the government and work, opening a business, and other such capitalist activities are an optional add on (survival should NOT be monetized!), so in a way it's like modern social programs but universal and actually livable in roughly middle class conditions despite increasing wealth through work or business still being an option, like you can make art with help from your new fancy AI tools (to enhance human art, not replace it) and sell that online for extra income, but a livable wage becomes a *right*.I understand the initial premise, that you think goods could be automated and produced in such abundance that they could be given freely. But my point is that 1. There is no incentive for companies to give the goods away freely. And 2. The random assertion that this automation in any way supplies the government with enough funds to give everyone a UBI. Again, if the economy that supports you can support you *without* your participation in it, then you've achieved post scarcity. And it's bold of you to assume companies would even *exist* in the way they do now with corporatism and a borderline oligarchy. They'll try to resist most likely, but it's irrelevant to billions of people. It'd be like a bear fighting off millions of angry insects; the bear dies despite killing countless insects, and the insects as a whole move on as usual.So Ill ask one more time.. where is that free money coming from ??Where all free government money comes from; the fact that it's made by the government. The economy becomes very different in this case, not quite communist or anything but definitely not the kinda world where work is mandatory for survival. The money just *exists* or can be made, they don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for it??. Make money, distribute money, give goods in exchange for money. That's called an economy, and the only difference is jobs being cut from the equation unless you want more money, then it's more like now where you accumulate capital from a business, job, or freelance work.","title":"CMV: Automation can only be a good thing."},{"text":"I am already smarter about it.Work in the supply chain.

However, inflation is actually a natural force. Inflation happens if we want it to or not. You are correct, in that, some of the inflation we see is artificial in the sense that a company arbitrarily decided consumers can, and will pay more. However, the idea that inflation as a whole doesnt naturally occur isnt quite correct.Eggs are a great example of inflationary pressures. Egg production decreased earlier this year (or was it last year? I cant remember.) because of avian flu and requirements to depopulate (kill) birds that could possibly be infected. Less birds == less eggs. Less eggs, but sustained egg demand == higher prices. Eggs, at least in my area, reduced in price once things stabilized (more chickens were born and more eggs are being produced), so for me, and Id imagine a sizable portion of the US, got to see Supply/demand in action. Theyve also got to see eggs inflate 15% (Im making up a number here, its technically not important for an example) and then deflate by 6% when supply came back. (Again, arbitrary percentage decrease, its non impactful to the example).Eggs didnt go back to their original price because the company selling the eggs AND/OR the market you buy them at looked at what happened and went well, people still bought eggs at $4, theyll probably still buy them normally now at $3.75 &lt;&lt; thats the artificial bit. Im also sure, likely the farmer, decided Ive gotta make up for the losses of the birds that I had to depopulate, so Ive gotta keep prices inflated for a bit until I recover these losses. Even though the feds/some insurance company will probably pay them out for a portion of their losses, and then eggs never go back to their original price because companies and people continue to purchase them. Everything else is just the economy/people/businesses doing what they do. When it comes to your note on businesses causing crises artificially, that, to me at least, doesnt add up. The spirit of your comment I can understand, and what I think ultimately is happening is more along the lines of: as a business I can take on more risk, and even if I really fuck up, Ill probably get bailed out. We saw this exact thing play out in the 08 financial crisis. A lot of people knew what was going down, or were purposefully remaining ignorant to the problem, and when shit fell apart they went ? well how the fuck could I have known?! And our government said you right, heres some cash. Pay us back when you can. Sorry about your luck. (Printing money artificially created inflation) What the government does about something like that is completely dependent on the size of the business too big to fail kinda thing, so not every company gets the same privileges, but the big dogs for sure get the special treatment. Overall though, the fed/government/people all want SOME inflation because thats what drives the stock market (in part) because profits rise. So your 401K /IRA / Pension or whatever goes up over time, rather than stagnating. Also, if you make more money and can buy more things (causing inflation), you generate more revenue for companies, and the cycle continues. *this is all simplified. Im not claiming to be an economist or an expert, but I know a pretty good deal about supply, demand, and basic economics.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"Right when the US stages a coup to topple a Russia friendly regime in Ukraine.

Disposal/pollution can be solved by recycling. Wind turbines last for 20-25 years. Batteries will still be needed, yes, but well need far fewer than without overbuilding. Painting one blade of each wind turbine reduces bird deaths by 72%. Wind currently provides 10% of US electricity and only results in 1 million bird deaths per year. As opposed to 80 million killed by automobiles, 90 million killed by pesticides, and 365 million killed by cats. If we multiply our wind turbines by 20 times and cut out 72% of the deaths via painting, that brings us to 5.6 million bird deaths per year which is very small compared to other human activities.  wind is practically non-existent as part of any energy grid I am aware of 55% of Denmarks electricity generation comes from wind. 29% for the UK, 37% for Ireland. 46% for Kansas.

The first problem is that the government doesnt produce goods and services, those are mostly privately owned companies who only run those companies for profit. So these companies have zero incentive to move towards a free model. They have to take the time and money to set up such a system and theyd receive no reward. Even if we ignore that and just skip to the part where production is automated and the costs are very low to free, there is still other jobs and labor involved. Running those companies, running the government, keeping the infrastructure going, transportation, maintenance etc. people will still work and be paid for their labor. So lets just say to get around this, the goods arent free but maybe just really really cheap. Last thing, you insist those who dont work or dont want to work will just receive a universal basic income. This is still unanswered where the government is getting the money to supply that. I understand the initial premise, that you think goods could be automated and produced in such abundance that they could be given freely. But my point is that 1. There is no incentive for companies to give the goods away freely. And 2. The random assertion that this automation in any way supplies the government with enough funds to give everyone a UBI.

Because of fake news. It's not just a insult hurled for no reason. They had an agenda to push, so they took so many things he said out of context and presented as fact without actually giving the full quote. There's too many cases to provide substance to this claim. But it doesn't take very much research on your own to see that Trump is not a rascist, he's not a nazi, and he's not even out to eliminate abortion. He's also not about that project 2025 bs. He's trying to eliminate big government and put more rights back into the states control. Plain and simple.It's why so many democrats and independent voters went with him. They're tired of the political games. They're tired if big government officials saying they're for us while they pocket millions and doing nothing for us.His image has been run through the dirt by the media because they're controlled by his biggest opponents. MSNBC, ABC, CNN, and many others just wanted to control voters by reporting inaccurate news stories.And they didn't hold back any punches. His assassination attempts was portrayed as not that serious and many hardcore left leaning people are still convinced it was staged; even though all evidence in the case clearly states it was not in both cases. The bigger story in the first attempt was hardly covered on the left leaning media, that had secret service was so inept at their job that Trump very easily could have died that day had fate not intervened.It's not just about supporting Trump in this case. It's was also about choosing the best candidate. Kamala was not chosen by her party. She just jumped in when Biden dropped out, and focused more on her image instead of being clear on her policies. The woman seemed unprepared, rude, and flat out not a good candidate. I'm a person in the middle, not a republican or Democrat. And I felt she was more concerned about getting votes instead of fixing America's problems. Her speeches were given to hand selected audiences, her celebrity endorsements were paid for clearly, and her interviews were few and short in content.It's not about orange man bad. It's about fixing our economy. It's about cutting down waste in our government. It's about saving the middle class. The left is wrong and not about fixing any of these things. They're more or less treating our citizens like we're all children, and abusing the minorities as charity cases and talking points instead of treating them as if they were human beings.I could go on for hours about how this election was a lot of bs from the left. But the Right won because they did the exact opposite of the left. They confronted the issues. They were clear on their intent. And yes, not every policy is going to be \\"good\\". But they did something the left didn't do, they told the American people their intentions. And that's why people voted.","title":"Wanting to Understand"},{"text":"Maybe you replied to the wrong comment, but i was just letting you know that the US is not a member of the ICC  because you said they rejected the arrest warrant.I think the us should be a member and i also think that those arrest warrants are justified.Edit: i also think Harris was still a better choice than abstaining  for those who care about Palestinians.

The Trump team and the team who are involved with Project 2025 are incredibly intertwined.The Heritage Foundation and Trump have both bragged about how he implemented a high percentage of their proposed policies, even more than Regan.If anything in politics is real, its stuff like this. Politicians are puppets to the people actually writing up these laws.The Heritage Foundation isnt the only one doing this type of stuff, and there are outside organizations representing a wide range of views trying to get their policies passed. The issue is that many of them dont have much power, while some do. I would say when a president is implementing over 65% of your proposed policies, then you have a fair amount of power and thats exactly what the Heritage Foundation is.With this being said. I dont think this is how our political system should work at all, but it doesnt inherently make the idea of think tanks and lobbyists as being all bad. At the end of the day imo, its up to you to decide whether or not you agree with the ideas being put forward.I can say for me personally, I certainly dont agree with many of these ideas and the fact that the same people are involved with both the heritage foundation and Trump teams is a little concerning.  It puts some serious weight behind these ideas and shows theyre not just being thrown out for the heck of it.To me whats really concerning is that this isnt even a Trump administration issue.

You've been convinced by people whose best interests align with ensuring you refuse to rock the boat and accept the lesser-of-two-evils line. People keep telling me that doing so means a chance for progress tomorrow, but in reality that never comes - again, without direct action, organizing, protests, and riots.I am aware of the benefits of civil unrest. I know that many rights were fought for on the streets rather than in the voting booth, but I also know that such actions are much more dangerous when Trump is in office. So who knows, maybe this administration will wake everyone up. Maybe things will get so bad that everyone has to revolt and we build a beautiful new tomorrow just like in the French revolution... except that was a horrific mess just like this one would be. I know what I'm doing. Only you can decide what you do.I appreciate your passion. I really do, but Trump is a singular threat to this country, this experiment in democracy. Perhaps you have not heard him say that he wants to use the military against political opponents. Perhaps you have not seen reporting that his first executive order is aimed at removing high ranking officers who might object to his authoritarian rule. Perhaps you've not heard him say he wants retribution against news organizations that were critical of him. I have. If he does the things he says he wants to do with presumptive immunity thanks to the supreme court, then our protests and riots won't be for a higher minimum wage - they will be for survival.So, if Trump has all the democrat congress members killed (he's named Pelosi and Schiff by name as \\"enemies within\\"), then perhaps you can cheer as they are all replaced by sycophants because hey, at least they're not democrats, right? If Project 2025 is implemented and many are convicted of the capital crimes of being gay, or criticizing Trump, or maybe just being the wrong nationality...If he does round up millions of immigrants (both legal and illegal) and puts them in slave labor camps (thanks 13th amendment)...If he does all of these things, I hope you can look down on us from your moral high ground as many of us die for your L.","title":"White Supremacist Incidents Are Rising Across the U.S. Flash demonstrations intended to spread fear and anxiety are happening almost weekly, say experts who track the incidents."},{"text":"Lol.

Easter time 2025, the Spiritual Hierarchy of the esoteric religion becomes exoteric as the [Great White Brotherhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Brotherhood), which includes a fake Jesus, fake Mother Mary, and fake Buddha, begins revealing itself to the world to unite the world in the global religion designed to be the religion of global communism. These spiritual beliefs are ordered in such a way that a true believer would naturally believe in and support global communism. In contrast to Christianity, which has historically been a major roadblock to communism. There is only one sin: the sin of separativeness. Alternatively, the sin against Oneness. Oneness is associated with light, love, and goodness. Separativeness is associated with darkness, hate, and evil. This Oneness seeks to eliminate all individuality and individual personalities and individual wills. The few are sacrificed cold-heartedly for the benefit of the many.

They generally appear to be incapable of second order thinking, which certainly makes it difficult to delineate cause from effect.Recent high inflation was the result of 1) the pandemic and how it was handled; 2) companies taking advantage of the increasing prices to pad their bottom line.Due to the fact that interest rates had been kept irresponsibly low for such a long time (Trump threatened the Fed when they were planning to raise the interest rates while the economy was booming) that they couldn't lower rates to alleviate the economic impacts from the pandemic, so they had to print way too much money to keep the country afloat.  The fact that the PPP loans were forgiven had a huge inflationary effect, and was completely unnecessary.  Vastly larger sums of money were printed during the Trump admin (including tax cuts for the rich), and that printing of money is what primarily led to high inflation for several years.

Your analysis is wrong - I understand you want to interpret third party votes and non-votes as \\"for Trump\\", but again that is because you're refusing to listen to the people telling you their truth. I understand selling out your conscience is something you're more than willing to do to get ahead. Not everyone is like you in that regard.Politicians are best evaluated not on what they say, but what they do. If I had a dime for every broken promise and post-election 180 that I've gotten from Democrats just in my 2 decades as an active voter, Jeff Bezos would be my bitch. So people listen to their words, to what they're stumping on, how they're responding to voters who aren't satisfied with them. That message was a very clear \\"nothing is going to change, it will be business as usual', meaning broken promises were incoming.We can't fix corrupt congress if we keep electing *the same boobs back into congress*, and the Democratic Party refuses to tell incumbents it's time to sunset and start ramping up fresh blood. Instead they block primary challengers at every level, especially more progressive ones. The Party is a roadblock to progress.Conservatives are followers. They will follow their leaders regardless of what their leaders do. No amount of crime will sway them from that path. They are solely dedicated to achieving power by any means necessary.You keep talking about \\"the world we live in\\" as if all of these things are inevitable and cannot be changed. They can be changed, and they require above all people like yourself to unhitch themselves from these tired talking points. Because ultimately its stances like yours that is killing any chance of progress. You just accept the way things are and hope that someday they'll organically change.Do you forget how we won every single solitary right we have? Organizing, direct action, protest, and yes - rioting. Every single one was secured through those means. Not through the ballot box, not through organic change, but because enough people got tired of the status quo and threatened to burn the whole shit down to the ground if they didn't get their way. The movers and shakers of the world do not like this fact, hence the overwhelming efforts to encourage folks like yourself to self-limit their possibilities. You've been convinced by people whose best interests align with ensuring you refuse to rock the boat and accept the lesser-of-two-evils line. People keep telling me that doing so means a chance for progress tomorrow, but in reality that never comes - again, without direct action, organizing, protests, and riots.I've been voting for 20 years mate. 20 straight years of voting in, participating in, being an election judge, even running for local office.

Nothing of substance has improved in that time.It's often said that the \\"definition of insanity\\" is doing *the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.* We've been doing this business-as-usual realist bullshit for decades now, and we've gotten the same results each time. It's not working.Politics is a participatory arena, there are no spectators. If you want change in the world, you have to be willing to fight for it, and that means occasionally taking the L so you can yeet bad actors and roadblocks. But every day you stand as a \\"realist\\" claiming that capitulation and following the establishment is the only way forward, you participate in condemning all of us to a dark future.Find your courage and be willing to fight for what you want to see. The Democrats got bitchslapped this election, this is the time for the party to completely retool and find a new strategy. Business-as-Usual ain't working. Blaming people who didn't vote the way you wanted is not going to get you anywhere. We're here, telling you exactly what needs to happen to give us a modicum of hope.

The government shouldn't pay for them and they need to stop paying for the world's problems.As far as Big Ag is concerned, most of the companies hire non-citizens through the H2B work program that pays anywhere from $18-22/hr, and all of those jobs are listed locally before they can hire foreigners and contract with them. According to the farming and agricultural subs on all of the social media platforms, this program is going to be expanded, so people who don't work within agriculture need to calm down. I'm not going to pretend to care about the hospitality or construction sectors that are responsible for hiring so many illegal immigrants. Important to remember that if you can't afford to pay your employees legal wages, you shouldn't own a business. If you own a business and want to hire immigrants, then sponsor them to work here legally. Restaurants and cafes are primarily entertainment anyhow... and most of them serve low quality food. People who hire illegals should suffer the consequences along with the people who have come here and not taken the proper bureaucratic routes. Sanctuary Cities should be made illegal.

It is\\n  a website dedicated to reporting on news and they are strongly\\n  anti-war as the name would suggest.  You can find more about him\\n  here:https://original.antiwar.com/author/scott/First some background:Most people don't understand the purpose of the CIA.  They tend to\\n imagine it as a sort of James Bond-style spy thingy where they do spy\\n stuff.  However in the real world what they tend to concentrate on is\\n manipulating political outcomes in other countries and gathering\\n intelligence to that end.  They do this through a combination of\\n propaganda, financing NGOs (non-government-organizations) and\\n supporting politicians and other groups that are likely to support\\n furthering the Federal Government's interests abroad.There are other other departments, like the State Department, that\\n also do propaganda, financing NGOs, etc etc.Some of the things CIA get involved in in the past was like the\\n overthrow of Iranian government in the 1950s.You can read a bit about it here:https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/690363402/how-the-cia-overthrew-irans-democracy-in-four-daysDuring the 1900s oil was discovered in Persia and it was developed by\\n APOC (later renamed AIOC, and is now known as BP (British\\n Petroleum)). The combination of this early exploration and\\n development combined with British military invasion during WW2\\n resulted in the oil in Iran essentially being owned by BP.After years of being upset about the lack of money BP was paying them\\n the Iranian government nationalized the oil fields and created their\\n own oil corporation.The result was the British government complaining to Washington DC and\\n claiming that Communists were somehow involved or that Iran was\\n likely to fall into Soviet sphere of influence. Or something like\\n that.The result was the (then new) CIA was set in to overthrow the Iranian\\ngovernment. They helped recruited old pro-Nazi Iranian general the\\nBritish inprisoned during WW2 and finance a military coup under his\\ncontrol.This first coup failed so the CIA tried again with more direct\\nAmerican control.  The second coup succeeded.They then went and grabbed the Son of the old King of Iran and said he\\n was the rightful heir of Iran and installed him as head of a puppet\\n government.After which American oil corporations took control over the country's\\nresources until the Iranian revolution in 1979.This is the sort of thing that the CIA was involved in all through\\n the cold war.  They financed many violent \\"counter revolutionaries\\",\\n provided material support and trained them on various terrorist\\n tactics and torture techniques. (they have found CIA manuals).  They\\n would recruit military leaders and have them trained in the USA\\n before setting them lose in other countries.They were involved in various \\"proxy wars\\" around the world in places\\n like Chile, Greece, and more then a few countries in Asia and\\n Africa. It is very likely the helped support a (failed) military coup\\n in France against De Gaulle's government in 1961 (Algiers putsch),\\n etc etc etc.All of this is pretty well documented history, although things like\\nthe CIA participation in Algiers Putsch is hotly contested.So they are not just making this shit up.It is Scott Horton's (and many other's) contention that the CIA never\\nceased in this sort of activity.  And the combination of CIA, USA\\nState Department, and other actors helped support various pro-West\\nfactions in the various \\"Color Revolutions\\" in the 2000s.https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/why-the-color-revolutions-failed/\\nThis is a important contention because, like all modern conflicts, the\\nWar in Ukraine did not \\"start\\" with the invasion by Russia. It is\\nsomething that was brewing for a long long time there are a lot of\\ncomplicated and shady things going on for years.Ukrainian government was formed in/around 1991 by Russian government\\nin the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet government and the Eastern Block.Ukrainian government was never particularly popular and was known to\\nbe extremely corrupt. Which it absolutely was.  Various major\\npipelines run from Russia into Germany and other European nations that\\nwere always a source of bribery and extortion by the Ukranians, which\\nwas treated as just a normal cost of doing business in that area.The Donbass Region of Ukraine was contested region since pretty much\\nday one with various attempts by the population to gain political\\nindependence. Starting with petitions and ballots and ending with\\narmed conflict. Eventually the Donbass region became a \\"Autonomous\\nZone\\"... that ultimately created a independent government even though\\nit was technically part of Ukraine under the \\"Minsk Protocol\\" around 2014.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements#Elections_in_the_DPR_and_LPR\\nIt is essentially the contention of people like Horton that...The immediate origin of the modern conflict started with various IMF loans to\\nUkraine being rejected or otherwise falling apart.  This involved the\\nregime of President Viktor Yanukovych and the state-owned gas company\\nNaftogaz debt to Russia.Essentially Ukraine tried to make arragements to borrow a lot of money\\nfrom western-backed IMF, which fell through.  And ended up with a much\\nmore affordable lending agreement with Russia to finance their energy\\nconsumption.https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2012-04-04/ukraine-becoming-dependent-russian-loansWestern governments, particularly Neocons in Washington DC grew\\nconcerned over the increasing Russian influence over Ukraine.Because of this the CIA, the USA State Department, and other groups\\nbecame heavily involved in orchestrating the Ukranian Revolution of\\n2014 and ousting Yanukovych from office and replacing him with a very\\npro-EU government.After the revolution the Ukrainian government attempted to re-assert\\nitself into the Donbass region through a series of military conflicts\\ninvolving \\"Pro-Russian Separatists\\" and the Neo-Nazi Azov\\nBrigade.https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/ukraineLeading to various humanitarian disasters and ultimately the\\ninvasion of Ukraine by Russia.This is the contention of people like Horton.\\nThe Neocon position is, more or less, none of that history is\\nparticularly relevant.  That Russia has been playing fucky-fucky in\\nthat area of the world after the largely uncontested invasion of\\nCrimea. And the unprovoked attack on Ukraine was just another example\\nof Russian expansionism and aggression brought on by lack of serious\\ninternational response.A important thing to understand that this is a intensely complicated\\nconflict with history going back 1000s of years.It is very difficult for western people to understand the\\nphilosophical, religious, and cultural issues that is backing Russia's\\ninvasion of Ukraine. There is a whole history with Moscow being \\"The\\nThird Rome\\" and \\"Land Power\\" versus \\"Sea power\\" that really doesn't\\nmake sense to people in the USA. For many in the Eastern Orthodox\\nChurch there is a huge amount of religious relevance to these sorts of\\nconflicts.The whole thing is very confused and insane as far as Western\\ngovernment's perceptions go. It is extremely hard to tell how much of\\nthis sort of thinking is the result of government manipulation of the\\npublic or how much is actual genuine.Also political manipulation goes both ways.  Even internationally.There is a tendency to assume that major international events are the\\nresult of the struggle between \\"Great Powers\\".  That important things\\nhappen in smaller and lesser countries not through a natural process,\\nbut as a result of manipulation from China, Russia, EU, USA, or\\nsomething like that.However that is rarely exactly correct.  A lot of it is just people\\nresponding to unexpected things and trying to twist them towards their\\nadvantage.  And that political manipulation is often from smaller\\ncountries to bigger countries.  All you have to do is look at the\\nhistory of African governments and their manipulations of Western\\ngovernments in the cold war to see it is true.The USA Federal government and its agencies are increasingly ran by people\\nwho are pretty incompetent. They come from privileged backgrounds and\\nhave worked in politics their entire lives. They have very little\\nreal-world experience outside of the political parties. Even though\\nthey control a lot of money and power... it is possible for them to\\nbecome manipulated and tricked.They just lack a lot of the experience in dealing with very\\nintellegent people with a huge amount of life experience dealing with\\ncorrupt government officials, black markets, criminal gangs rising to\\nbecome political leaders, etc..So if political groups in Ukraine wanted USA assistence in \\noverthrowing the government in 2014... it wouldn't be very difficult\\nto trick USA officials into giving a lot of support.In the end it is very difficult to know who is manipulating who and\\nhow much is it is just naked Russian agression, etc etThere is no innocent governments here.  Ukrainian government is\\nintensely corrupt. So is Russia's. The EU and USA are ran by a lot of people\\nwho really are quite clueless. So in a way both Horton and Neocons are wrong. People are going to be\\ndebating this stuff for centuries. There is just so much that we can't\\nknow and all we can do is fill in the blanks with our imaginations.","title":"Scott Horton demolishes neocon"},{"text":"I dont think its solely a listening problem.

That money was not just handed out to people.Biden has stabilized the economy, and inflation is at 2%. The GDP is up, and wages have slightly outpaced inflation. Prices are still being kept artificially high by corporations intentionally because they can get away with it.An example is washing machines. Trump put a tarrif on Chinese washers making them $100 more expensive. Instead of selling all the washers at the existing price, American companies raised the price of American made washers to match the Chinese made washers. They also raised the price of dryers by $100 to match the washers. Price gouging!Kroger has actually admitted to price gouging. When their costs go up 7% corporations raise prices by 15% using inflation as an excuse. Corporations have been making record setting profits. Corporations are bleeding us dry.

This is why the conversation consistently is framed as those are the only two options. Progressives have other options: vote third party, or stay home. All are valid if you feel disenfranchised and dismissed by the parties.Listen, I hate the two party system as much as just about any progressive, but I'm also a realist. Protest voting for a third party candidate in this election, was a vote for Trump. Choosing to not vote was a vote for Trump. I would love to go to ranked choice voting (even though it has its own issues) or have multiple parties like other countries, but when one side is literally talking about implementing authoritarian rule in America, I think we have to hold off on our dreams to deal with the current reality.What was spread the most was not her policies, in fact I heard very little about her policies. What I DID hear a lot was about Trump. What I did hear was how they're weird. That's what carried with supporters, those were the messages spread.Well I'm sorry you didn't listen to her talk about her policies. Her message was out there, and it was laid out very well on her website.You make a fair point about how those policies are not as progressive as other ones she could have campaigned on. I agree that higher taxes for the wealthy and guaranteed livable wages / healthcare / education / childcare are much bigger issues. I've given up on any single candidate giving us all of the  things I dream of having in America all at once because of how corrupt our congress is. I would love to see a big shift in American policy, but it looks like we have to move the Overton window one election at a time little by little.This election, we took a major step in the wrong direction.I?myself cannot vote for Democrats any longer. My own Rep, Angie Craig, had to walk back support for a bill that will allow the administration in charge to declare NPOs they don't like as terrorists. She said she initially supported it because of tax credits for americans held hostage by terrorists... you know, the tiny miniscule number of people in the world who meet that criteria, while completely ignoring the ramifications of the policy on her constituents. This is on top of routinely being on the wrong side of history (censuring Rep. Talib, for example).When I did try to participate in the Democratic Party as a progressive-leftist, the message was clear: fuck off. Party Leadership wants nothing to do with progressives or progressive policies.When a political party tells me in plain language my presence, my voice, my vote is not important to them, I listen.I'm sorry this happened to you. The biggest difference between the two parties is that of cohesion and focus. The republicans want one thing: more wealth for the wealthy. They have made a concerted effort to focus all of their culture wars into riling up their base to vote R no matter how badly it hurts them. Meanwhile, the democrats have a large coalition of many varied groups who want different things. I wish it was more grassroots and that there was less influence by the wealthy on the democrat side. That is not the world we live in though...We had to choose between a single step forward or several miles backward. We chose to go backward.","title":"White Supremacist Incidents Are Rising Across the U.S. Flash demonstrations intended to spread fear and anxiety are happening almost weekly, say experts who track the incidents."},{"text":"A better question would be if she wants to stay here or return to where her ancestors were \\"stolen\\" from.","title":"House Democrat erupts during DEI hearing: 'There has been no oppression for the white man'"},{"text":"I think *well informed* swing voters are pretty rare, which is what a lot of people think swing voters are.

Ill push back:-Patriots support our troops. Support of our troops means not sending them to be killed on foreign battlefields  or even risk such a fate  to advance unjust and unsound foreign policy. -The US foreign policy of risking nuclear war over a territorial dispute in Eastern Europe is not just or sound. In fact, since the Soviet Union collapsed, the US had known that NATO expansion would greatly antagonize Russia, risking wider war. Remember Obamas retort to Mitt Romneys hawkish stance to Russia in a debate? The 1980s called and it wants its foreign policy back. The Obama administration collaborated with Russia in the global fight against Islamic terrorism. Previously, the US supported Putins rise to power, praising him as more sober and pragmatic partner than Yeltsin. -In foreign policy realism, which the US practices, you *must* treat your enemies as rational actors. Treating the enemy as a rational actor in a game of global chess does not mean you are supporting or adopting the values of your enemies; it means you are being strategic so as to maintain the balance of the Great Powers of the world, and US hegemony. To be strategic is to prevent war, death and suffering, which is a greater good to humanity than virtue signaling. In his attempt to take Ukraine, Putin is pushing back against NATO expansion, which is rational for any Russian leader. For perspective, US foreign policy was built upon the Monroe Doctrine adopted by President James Monroe around the 1820s. The doctrine stated that any European power attempting to encroach on the affairs of the entire hemisphere would be met with US military resistance. The Cuban Missile Crisis is one example of the US enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. Putin has his own version of it, as do all the other Great Powers.-The US has spent some 75 years supporting dictators across the world in unjust coups. And you want to know how WWII ended? The US alliance with the Soviet Union  headed by one of the most brutal dictators in history, Stalin. Did our alliance with Stalin also mean we were adopting his values? Could the US soldiers perishing on the front lines not have called themselves patriots in supporting our alliance with Stalin? I dare you to tell a WWII vet that to their face.

What I DID hear a lot was about Trump. What I did hear was how they're weird. That's what carried with supporters, those were the messages spread. I do need to push back on a few things here. Those policies aren't \\"progressive\\". Increased small business loans - who benefits from that? Small biz entrepreneurs, most of whom aren't average working-class people trying to make ends meet - those folks can't even take the time or risks to go into small business because they can't afford a day without health insurance. Small businesses are among the worst offenders when it comes to labor laws: wage theft, OSHA violations, etc. are more common with small businesses because their staff doesn't have dedicated teams to ensure compliance, and small business is rife with cronyism and nepotism.Increased child tax credits are nice, but they don't change that wages have stagnated for decades.Help for first time home buyers - who does that ultimately help? Builders and developers. People needing those programs are struggling to raise the funds to pay existing bills. A lot of people have shot credit, so they'd never be able to take advantage of these programs.Progressive policies are policies that actually help a large swath of the working class. Universal Healthcare would unburden americans currently paying out the ass for medical care. Increases to the minimum wage would give people real buying power that they could use to energize their local economy. Universal free pre-k would unburden parents from the exceptionally ridiculous costs of having and raising a child. People can barely afford the bills they have, can't raise or maintain a emergency fund, and countless have no retirement saved - because they can't.Was this election critical? Yes, it was. Which is why seeing the same strategy being used that has been used for decades now was so alarming. No lessons were learned from past failures. When people feel disenfranchised, they have no reason to participate.I myself cannot vote for Democrats any longer. My own Rep, Angie Craig, had to walk back support for a bill that will allow the administration in charge to declare NPOs they don't like as terrorists. She said she initially supported it because of tax credits for americans held hostage by terrorists... you know, the tiny miniscule number of people in the world who meet that criteria, while completely ignoring the ramifications of the policy on her constituents. This is on top of routinely being on the wrong side of history (censuring Rep. Talib, for example).When I did try to participate in the Democratic Party as a progressive-leftist, the message was clear: fuck off. Party Leadership wants nothing to do with progressives or progressive policies.When a political party tells me in plain language my presence, my voice, my vote is not important to them, I listen.","title":"White Supremacist Incidents Are Rising Across the U.S. Flash demonstrations intended to spread fear and anxiety are happening almost weekly, say experts who track the incidents."},{"text":"What if some variation of fascism is the only way to beat whatever current version of Marxism is being propagated at a nation by the globalists?Is it possible to have a benign fascism?","title":"What if Hitler and Stalin are the same person"},{"text":"TBF It depends on who's in charge.

There are also ways in which the killings of humans and animals are the same, but I will focus on the differences and how, I believe, those differences give rise to a coherent worldview that opposes causing animals suffering but not killing animals. Humans have the potential to have hopes and dreams of the future, to anticipate a future life, and to aspire to future outcomes. Animals, so far as I'm aware, don't have the same ability to have a well-developed sense of future. They don't dream of a future; they don't have plans for next year. This complete living-in-the-moment-ness is part of what animals bring to our lives. They have a perspective that we don't. They are unencumbered by dreams of the future, the fear of failure, the regret has dreams unrealized. Part of the moral wrong of killing a human is depriving the individual of their future. When someone is killed, they are deprived of their present as well as their future. Animals are not deprived of their future because it's not within their cognitive capabilities to conceptualize the future. Indeed, for some species, the evidence of any form of self-awareness is mixed, at best. For such animals, in their death, they don't even have a concept of self that is being taken. As an intermediate case that demonstrates the importance of cognition in evaluating the morality of killing animals, many people who accept the killing of domesticated farm animals would object to the killing of dolphins, elephants, great apes (gorillas, chimps, bonobos, and orangutans) as they seem closer to humans in their cognitive abilities. These species appear to have a greater capacity for self-awareness, for future desires, and so on. Thus, the justification for killing them must be greater. For example, many people would support research that causes the death of a chimpanzee if that research leads to medications that can save human lives, but the same people would oppose the killing of the chimpanzee for food.)And while it may be permissible to kill (at least some) animals, they do experience pain and pleasure. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, I would say that anyone who's had a pet can understand their ability to experience joy, pleasure, and love as well as fear and anger. Because animal do have this palpable experience of the present (indeed, it is the entirety of their consciousness), we have an obligation to minimize their pain and suffering, while they are alive. Hence the position that \\"You can be against animal cruelty and eat meat.\\"","title":"CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing"},{"text":"Exactly.

Progressives don't see a \\"border crisis\\", they see failed immigration, drug, and foreign policies. Progressives want to reduce immigration primarily by stopping fucking up other countries so folks feel the need to come here in the first place.This is the difference between progressives and both Liberals and Conservatives. The latter groups are incapable of seeing the larger picture, seeking out the root cause of whatever bad is happening, and addressing *that*. They instead choose time-after-time the most cruel and abusive solutions to the symptoms of the root cause, ignoring the root cause itself.Illegal immigration is the symptom. The root cause is our disastrous foreign policy, a broken legal immigration system, and our drug addiction that we pretend we don't have. Change foreign policy, correct the problems of the legal immigration system so that people can be documented and identified, and aggressively handle our drug addiction problem through a trifecta of universal healthcare including mental health care, a robust social safety net, and decriminalizing consumption and seeking out harm reduction strategies like safe-use sites with a domestically produced supply of drugs that's regulated and controlled, and most importantly, cartel free. This would also have the added bonus of directly addressing the homelessness and addiction epidemics while simultaneously cutting off the supply of money fueling cartels.We certainly don't want anyone being rounded up, we don't want to see our government engaging in inhumane practices, putting people in cages, or generally treating *illegal immigration* like a goddamn felony. If someone is undocumented, the logical thing to do is *document them*. Not deport them. Not throw people back into an unstable, hostile, and dangerous environment. Our nation was built on immigration. Every single one of our ancestors were people who either just showed up or people brought here enslaved. Ellis Island processed immigrants same-day on a \\"ok, you're not diseased, here you go, oh and we changed your name because it's too hard to pronounce.\\" There's absolutely no reason we can't continue this today. They're not taking anyone's jobs. Who the hell growing up in America pines for... working as a maid? Picking fruit and vegetables seasonally? No one born and raised here is lining up for those jobs. More residents = more taxpayers, more taxpayers means more investment, more investment makes the economy go brrrrrrr. Document them, tax them, and if and only if they fuck up and commit a serious crime, then give them das boot. It would be not only a hell of a lot cheaper, but it would actually make money. But, no, we'd rather throw billions at border fences and detention centers, because that's cooler than accepting immigrants with open arms, documenting them, telling them here's the rules and expectations, go forth and thrive.","title":"Whose side are you on?

The net pollution impact of solar is less positive than you'd expect and definitely not as good as something like Nuclear as a result.Wind is widely considered to be basically the worst renewable. It takes an absurd amount of space, creates a lot of noise pollution, is an eyesore and has a negative impact on animal life (RIP birds, then the stuff birds eat balloons in population).

Their reactionary nature will undermine our technological growth too though, as they are quite AI/automation skeptical. We can't oppose globalization or automation, if we do, prices go up.

To the contrary, in four swing states  Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin  she actually won more votes than Biden did in 2020.WHY DOES NOBODY REMEMBER THIS? I have read so many articles analyzing Kamala's performance that miss this detail. Kamala performed well where it mattered because Democrat voters in solid blue states didn't care enough to turn out. Because why would they? ITS A SOLID BLUE STATE. I'm tired of postmortems focusing on Democrat vote ratio declines in states that just. weren't. important. So what if Democrat turnout declined among voters in California? Its fucking California! We would have won it anyways.This is why I find the exit polls revealing a sudden increase in conservatism for young men and minorities irritating. These are traditionally low-motivation voters. Is it not possible that Democrats within those groupings decided not to vote in solid states? That they, CORRECTLY, realized that their vote didn't count in these regions due to the electoral college? Meanwhile, MAGA supporters within those demographic groups turned out anyways, because, well, THEY ARE MAGA SUPPORTERS?Now, its still definitely possible that the younger generation is more conservative, and that Democrats are losing their stranglehold on the minority vote. But I don't think the evidence currently being parroted (oh, democrats lost 20 million voters, so many of them were minorities, all those precious minority votes, woe is me etc.) is reliable.
