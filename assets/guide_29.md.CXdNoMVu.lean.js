More the DA. And yes, I think there's a similar argument around Hunter Biden. Basically in both cases it may be reasonable to argue that they were singled out for prosecution because of who they are. Ideally the system shouldn't work that way, but we all know that it often does. But singling them out for prosecution also doesn't make them not guilty (or guilty, for that matter).You see an analogy of this a lot with black people driving. They seem to get pulled over way, way, more often than white people. Now that doesn't mean that every black person who gets pulled over wasn't breaking some traffic law... Heck everyone breaks a bunch of traffic laws just driving to the grocery store. So if all those cases went to court, you would see a disproportionate number of \\"guilty\\" black drivers. But that's really happening because of the selection effect from who the cops pull over and charge. It might be that white people drive worse and break the law even more often, but their crimes get hidden by the fact that the cops don't pull them over as much. Hunter Biden and Trump might both be guilty of stuff - heck they probably are... But that doesn't also mean they weren't selectively targeted for prosecution. Now, in Trump's case, he's been in court a lot - and even before his time as president - so who knows... Maybe he's have been charged either way...

That's what the Democratic party and Sanders keeps pushing, but it's wrong.study after study found racial resentment a far bigger driver of support for Trump than economic anxiety. Neither Trumps core support, nor the drift of formerly Democratic voters to him are well explained by economic desperation. Like many cynical maxims that are not even true, it is kept aloft on a cloud of smaller, equally persistent, falsehoods. There is a trope that most Americans work paycheck-to-paycheck. They dont. The median American has savings. Politicians on both the left and right love the rhetoric of Americans working multiple jobs to get by. In reality, less than 5% of the labour force does so (and that includes upper-class professionals like a lawyer who does consulting on the side). Nor is it what voters themselves say: The average American thinks democrats are far too liberal. They see the party as to their left on both economic and social issues. Only 6% said they thought Harris was not liberal enough. This is not an electorate crying out for socialism, turning away from Democrats because they havent seized the means of production.Finally, the narrative (hereafter called the poverty narrative) often assumes an outdated (and decidedly masculine) vision of a frustrated proletariat of laid off coal miners, quite at odds with the reality of life for most working Americans in the 21st century. The 23-year-old barista serving you coffee at Starbucks, who lives with roommates in a small apartment, who doesnt have job security, or the ability to pursue her goals in lifeshe most likely did not vote for Trump.

But the index was higher most recently in June 2021, at 102.5; the highest ever recorded in the survey was 108.6 in August 2018.2/ Were looking to save maybe $2 trillion and itll have no impact. Actually, itll make life better but itll have no impact on people. Its not like  we will never cut Social Security, things like that. Its just waste, fraud and abuse.  \\n  \\nThis lacks evidence: To reach $2 trillion in cuts, Trump admin would need to eliminate all discretionary spending  including Trump policies on mass deportation, enhancing border security, protecting farmers, &amp; more military funding. Cutting all discretionary spending would, without a doubt, have an impact on people.3/ I won youth by 34 points.  \\n  \\nFalse: Trump made significant gains compared with Republicans in recent elections, but exit polls show he still lost the youth vote.

Brief for United States 46. But it nevertheless contends that a jury could consider evidence concerning the Presidents official actsfor limited and specified purposes, and that such evidence would be admissible to prove, for example, [Trumps]knowledge or notice of the falsity of his election-fraud claims. Id., at 46, 48. That proposal threatens to eviscerate the immunity we have recognized. It would permit a prosecutor to do indirectly what he cannot do directlyinvite the jury to examine acts for which a President is immune from prosecution to nonetheless prove his liability onany charge. But [t]he Constitution deals with substance, not shadows. Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867). And the Governments position is untenable in lightof the separation of powers principles we have outlined. If official conduct for which the President is immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on chargesthat purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct, the intended effect of immunity would be defeated. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756. The Presidents immune conduct would be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of generally applicable criminal laws. Use of evidence about such conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct, would thereby heighten the prospect that the Presidents official decisionmaking will be distorted.

Check out the wiki page on Milei's political positions:**Abortion and euthanasia**Milei opposes both abortion and euthanasia,[48][49] grounding his views in propertarian terms, as he sees it as violating the non-aggression principle.[50] He considers abortion to be a violation of property rights and equates it with theft.[51][52] Milei holds that abortion is morally indefensible, even in cases of rape,[53] and supports it only when the mother's life is endangered.[54] He plans to hold a referendum on Argentina's 2020 abortion legalization law and has indicated he would support its repeal.[55] He has stated that his opposition to abortion is based on what he said is an \\"unrestricted right to life\\". Arguing about the beginning of human personhood, he said that life begins at conception.**LGBT rights and marriage**Milei is indifferent to same-sex marriage; he sees marriage as a contract and is opposed to it as an institution.[57] He has also stated that homosexuality is a \\"personal choice\\" and is not a disease,[8] stating that he would respect any type of consensual sex, hyperbolically including sex with an elephant.[58][59] On the topic of transgender rights, Milei has stated that he \\"does not care\\" about gender identification \\"as long as you do not make me pay the bill\\", and compared it to identifying as a cougar.[60][61] In reference to public funding for gender-affirming care and public education, he said: \\"I have no problem, but don't impose it on me by the state. Don't steal money from people to impose someone else's ideas on them. That is violent.\\"**Education**Milei supports school choice, and wants to implement an education voucher system to privatize and decentralize education by \\"giving the budget to parents\\".[55][22] He intends to eliminate the law that makes comprehensive sex education (CSE) in schools mandatory,[64] which he has linked to brainwashing,[65] and said that students are \\"hostages of a system of state indoctrination\\".[66][67]**Health care**Milei wants to privatize public health care providers.[22] Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina, he opposed mandatory vaccination.Drugs and sex workIn Argentina, drugs are decriminalized. Milei voted against the cannabis law in Congress as a National Deputy. Although his coalition's government program proposes to pursue drug trafficking and he commented that one of his biggest concerns is that many young Argentines fall into drugs, Milei supports drug legalization within the context of a free society. He has compared drug use to suicide,[69] and cautioned: \\"If you want to commit suicide, I don't have any problem. Drugging is committing suicide gradually. If you want to get high, do whatever you want, but don't ask me to pay the bill.\\"[57] Milei also said that he had smoked marijuana only once and recalled: \\"I remember laughing a lot.\\"[57] Regarding sex work in Argentina, which is legal (with the exception of brothels and pimping) and is not discussed in the coalition's program, Milei sees nothing wrong with paying for sex, considering it a \\"free transaction\\".**Gun laws**A supporter of law-and-order politics, Milei endorses the unrestricted ownership of firearms,[71] saying that Argentina needs the forces \\"to have authority again\\".[8] Gun laws in Argentina are restrictive. According to his party's electoral platform, Milei proposes the \\"deregulation of the legal market\\" for weapons and \\"the protection of its legitimate and responsible use by the citizens\\".[72]**Immigration and foreigners*'Argentina is one of the few countries whose constitution establishes the promotion of immigration as one of the duties of the state; Argentina and the United States accepted more immigrants than any other country around the turn of the 20th century.[73] Milei's 2023 presidential platform includes restrictions on immigration.[74] He stated that he would prohibit the entry into the country of migrants with a criminal record, and said that he wanted to expel those who commit crimes.[75] Milei's platform also proposes to restrict free education and universal healthcare for foreign nationals.It's not perfect but he's far from an Orban or any European soccon.","title":"Milei and Trump"},{"text":"This is some chilling shit.

As for CA, AZ, NM, the US did go to war with Mexico, and they did in fact enter Mexico City. But they broke tradition. By all rights the US could have, and really should have conquered Mexico. But they backed off and forced Mexico into numerous treaties, one of them being the treaty of hidalgo, that said the US would buy the land of those states from Mexico.

It is the legacy of Matthew Shepard and Breonna Taylor and Emmett Till.When local authorities would not investigate civil rights violations C or were violating rights themselves C communities have had to rely on federal investigators to fill the gap in justice. The question these communities will ask over the next four years is who the civil rights division under Donald Trump will protect.Trump plans to tap a loyalist whose civil rights rsum largely consists of culture-war battles over campus free-speech issues and attacks on diversity initiatives to helm the justice departments civil rights division. The move puts at risk hundreds of active investigations, from police misconduct to employment and housing discrimination to abuses in jails and prisons.Trump intends to replace the assistant attorney general, Kristen Clarke, the current chief of the civil rights division and the first Black woman to lead the division, with Harmeet Dhillon, a Maga darling and fixture in rightwing media....The civil rights division is the primary federal enforcer for over a dozen provisions of federal law including the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Uniformed Services Civil Relief Act, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.The division also enforces anti-discrimination laws for immigrants under the Immigration and Nationalization Act, eliciting settlements with companies C usually with fines for small companies of under $100,000. But the division has larger targets. Apple, Meta and Facebook each signed multimillion-dollar settlements over visa discrimination under the Biden administration.The civil rights division has been investigating Elon Musks aerospace and satellite firm SpaceX since 2020, alleging that SpaceX erroneously relied on export control laws to restrict its recruiting and hiring to US citizens and lawful permanent residents....While Trump publicly repudiated the policy initiatives of Project 2025 during the campaign, he has announced his intent to appoint many of its authors to positions of authority in the incoming administration. Project 2025 proposes a fundamental inversion of the mission of the civil rights division.Even though numerous federal laws prohibit discrimination based on notable immutable characteristics such as race and sex, the Biden administration C through the DoJs civil rights division and other federal entities C has enshrined affirmative discrimination in all aspects of its operations under the guise of equity, the document states.Federal agencies and their components have established so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices that have become the vehicles for this unlawful discrimination, and all departments and agencies have created equity plans to carry out these invidious schemes.Project 2025 advocates for the Trump administration to pack the division with political appointees and to eliminate the use of disparate impact in civil rights enforcement, which undercuts measurements of discrimination. It also proposes that the department should spend its first year using the full force of federal prosecutorial resources to investigate and prosecute all state and local governments, institutions of higher education, corporations, and any other private employers who are engaged in discrimination in violation of constitutional and legal requirements.Discrimination in this context refers to government agencies pursuing diversity initiatives that ensure minorities have proportional representation in hiring and promotions.The conservative playbook also proposes taking investigatory responsibility for voting rights cases away from the civil rights division and giving it to the criminal division, with a mandate to prosecute Pennsylvania elections officials who distributed absentee ballot applications in 2020.The civil rights that are enjoyed by all today have been a product of many hard-fought battles over the years, and to see many of these efforts potentially watered down or put aside with the incoming administration should be of deep concern to all.","title":"Fears for civil rights as Trump taps Maga darling for key justice department role | Rights leaders worry that Harmeet Dhillon could harm work into police misconduct, discrimination and hate crimes"},{"text":"Yes.

It's not an argument that relies on what we think is best, it's an argument that relies on the fact that there is literally, no presidential immunity clause, yet their are for other positions. That is an indisputable fact. Now, if we accept it, the question becomes why is there no immunity clause? Why not write one if they knew how to do such a thing? I do not think it is likely they chose not to, despite wanting the president to have immunity. Why do such a thing? Why purposefully omit parts of the law that you wish later generations to follow? If we rule that out, then we must accept that it was either not wanted, or it was wanted but accidentally left out. I think the accidentally leaving it out is unlikely, as they wrote immunity clauses for other positions. Also, even if they did leave it put by mistakes, I do not think we should run the country based on why could be the law, but isn't. This leaves us with the last case, which is, it was left out, because they didn't want the president to have such immunity, which I already discussed. These are all cases. We know they didn't write immunity, they either wanted presidential immunity or they didn't, and they either left it out intentionally or with intent. Now, I do conceed, that regardless of law, some degree of leeway during wartime is a good idea. Though, I think some degree of leeway is good for every citizen, not just the president. We don't want to be the country that locks someone up because they stole a loaf of bread to feed their family. Circumstances, even if not explicitly written into law, should be considered when trying anyone of a crime. And I don't feel this contradicts my earlier point about following the law as written. We should rule based on what laws are written, but laws cannot cover all possible circumstances, hence when discussing sentences judges should use discretion. If a president saves millions by breaking the law, they shouldn't be sentence to jail anyone than someone stealing to feed their family should be punished. That's my take anyways, but it's one not based in logic, hence I understand if you don't agree.","title":"Trump not eligible for immunity in New York hush money case, judge rules"},{"text":"Or have an abortion","title":"Trump says there are problems with vaccines, rejects mandates"},{"text":"Now, now.

That is not an economic qualification. You helped them with an IMPLAN analysis. 2. Stagflation is high inflation, relatively high unemployment, and anemic economic growth. Let's take a look at the factors that will cause each.High inflation: tariffs; we know that the Trump &amp; Biden tariffs (2018, but continued) were inflationary. We know that the TCJA, with its contribution to government debts and deficits, were inflationary. We know that mass deportations are inflationary, especially in the construction, ag, restaurant, and cleaning sectors. We also know that Trump is a deficit spender.High unemployment: reduction of federal workforce (about 2% of total U.S. workforce). Reduction in immigrant labor without a domestic (or existing immigrant) labor pool will lead to economic contractions which will slow a number of sectors (again, ag, construction, restaurants) that are already operating with significant constraints in place.Anemic economic growth: tariffs, TCJA, deportation, and reduction of federal workforce would all impede economic growth; substantially so.So, yes, it has to be a collision of economic policies, but none of these are out of the realm of possibility given that they have been EXPLICITLY LINKED to Trump's incoming administration.","title":"Americans may have to actually brace for stagflation with Trump tariffs"},{"text":"Not if theyre for religious schools, theyre not","title":"Milei and Trump"},{"text":"Right wing propaganda works.

This tends to come up a lot during wars. Again, it seems like the framers intended to have the president be able to move quickly, when needed, to protect the country... And then for the Congress to check the president through legislation, budget controls, and, ultimately, impeachment. But these things have fallen apart because Congress is so broken and ineffective. To me, the issue to fix in US governance is Congress. They're supposed to be the most powerful branch and much relies on them, but they're a broken mess.

They will not cut the military budget so that leaves things like education, employment, transportation, social services to cut.

Carter kept active with his habitat for humanity as well as a healthy exercise regime. Biden is an avid cyclist. What does Trump do? He lifts burgers and diet coke to his mouth and then chases it all with adderall and a host of other medicines that probably shouldn't be mixed together. He spends most of his day sitting on his ass watching TV. Golf isn't a physically demanding pastime and even then, he rides around in an electric golf cart and STILL gets winded just shuffling his fat ass over to the tee. Trust me, even with the best healthcare, that fat bastard is on death's door. Besides, if the leaked info about his health is be believed, the damage has already been done. He has a cardiac calcium score of over 600... meaning his arteries are mostly stone and he is at high risk of heart attack and stroke.

Most notable manifestation this is the society-wide denial of the Armenian Genocide - but that denial is part of something very systemic in Turkish society and culture.It's not that different substantively from Russians who feel aggrieved by the fact that post-communist European states are no longer Russian vassals.

Removing 3.5% of the workforce could disrupt these sectors, leading to job losses for native-born workers (who rely on those industries) and lower overall productivity.GDP per Capita Misinterpretation: A smaller GDP paired with a smaller population might artificially increase GDP per person, but it doesnt reflect real economic gains. This is because the economy would contract, businesses would close, and wages would stagnate in sectors heavily dependent on immigrant labor.Consumer Demand: Undocumented immigrants contribute to consumer spending, which drives GDP growth and job creation. Reducing this population diminishes overall demand and hurts businesses.While undocumented immigrants may use public services like education and emergency healthcare, several studies show that:Limited Welfare Eligibility: Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for most federal welfare programs, including Medicaid, SNAP (food stamps), or federal housing assistance. Their U.S.-born children (citizens) may access these services, but attributing the full cost to undocumented parents is misleading.Healthcare Costs: While undocumented immigrants can access emergency care (mandated by law), studies show they contribute more in taxes to programs like Medicare and Social Security than they use. For example, the Social Security Administration estimates that undocumented workers contribute $12 billion annually to Social Security but receive no benefits.Education Costs: Providing education for all children, regardless of immigration status, is a constitutional requirement (Plyler v. Doe, 1982). Educating childrenwhether documented or nothas long-term economic benefits, as educated individuals contribute more in taxes and productivity later in life.The idea that undocumented immigrants are primarily low-skilled overlooks their economic role:Filling Labor Gaps: Undocumented workers often take jobs that native-born workers are unwilling to do, particularly in agriculture, construction, and service industries. These sectors face critical labor shortages without immigrant workers.Upward Mobility: While some immigrants start in lower-wage jobs, many transition to higher-paying roles over time, and their children often pursue higher education and professional careers.Economic Growth: Immigrantsdocumented and undocumentedare a key driver of innovation, small business growth, and workforce expansion. Removing them would exacerbate demographic challenges like an aging workforce and declining birth rates.An honest analysis requires looking at both costs and contributions. Undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes, fill critical labor gaps, and contribute to long-term economic growth through their children and workforce participation. While there are costs associated with public services, studies consistently show that their economic contributions offset or outweigh these costs over time.","title":"Trump wants immigrants gone.

Almost nothing changed with the work when people went remote. Other than a massive improvement in work life balance for the average employee who no longer had to get up at the crack of dawn to get their kids out and then commute in and out of work. Saving on commuting costs and the improvements in the mental state for avoiding all that BS was in many ways like or better than getting a raise. But companies have real estate and they pay a lot of money for that space and dont want it sitting at 30-50% occupancy. And I know a LOT of people whose companies told them they were doing great and then suddenly demanding they come back and it went a lot like this:Wow. We know its tough to make your home your work space as well, but we are doing great. Thank you for the continued effort!Hey, its been a year, which is longer than we thought but we are seeing tremendous results and thank you all for that effort.Hey. Its time to come back into the office!  We are better when were together!But youve been telling us how great we are doing and this is actually really convenient for so many of us who are often working via the phones or emails anyway. Yes, but our culture is better when we are in the office. Come on back.Actually, this years engagement survey shows highest results for satisfaction and engagement over the past four surveys.Come back or youre fired.Bye. Wait. No you cant leave. We cant hire anyone for in-office jobs!Then as inflation picked up that kind of inverted a bit. But its not because people were massively more productive in the office. In fact, when I go into the office now I often spend my time doing the exact same thing I do on days from home - I meet virtually with people in the same building because people have gotten used to that convenience.  The only difference is Ive lost 2-3 hours of my day to a commute and $40 to parking. Lastly, most people in the US are at-will employees and not under contract. So thats mostly a non-issue. But employment contracts can be amended. It happens all the time.

This year, they are expected back as authorized electors to sign legitimate certificates that formalize Trump's recent victories in their states.As states take the next step in the transfer of presidential power, some legal and election experts see the return of these eight criminally charged electors as reminders of how much leeway state political parties have in choosing potential electors and how much Trump has come to dominate Republican parties across the country....Presidential electors are usually leaders of state or local political parties or other longtime party supporters.\\"A lot of states are quite lax about the qualifications and who can serve and how they behave,\\" says Julia Azari, a political science professor at Marquette University.In Wisconsin, where unauthorized Republican electors also signed a false certificate in 2020, those electors are now banned by a settlement agreement from serving again in any U.S. presidential election with Trump on the ballot.But there are no similar legal barriers for the criminally charged electors in Michigan or Nevada.\\"Even if they had been convicted, at least under Michigan law, it would not preclude them from serving as electors,\\" says Barbara McQuade, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a former U.S. attorney during the Obama administration. \\"I think probably the biggest worry is that people might have some doubt in the integrity of electors who have been accused of abusing that power in the past.\\"If there is any worry, that has not stopped the GOP of Michigan or Nevada from selecting these returning electors to sign their states' official Electoral College certificate this year, McQuade adds.\\"To include somebody who has been previously accused of forging that document or falsely attesting to a document like that makes an interesting statement, I think, about the charges,\\" McQuade says. \\"I think it says that they think the charges are insignificant, unimportant or may be some sort of badge of honor.\\"...\\"All of these people certainly are entitled to a presumption of innocence and a due process and a fair trial,\\" McQuade says. \\"But I think it's important for [the state attorneys general] to see through these prosecutions so that people understand that this was a big deal and not something that we just kind of shrug our shoulders at and move on.\\"That even with this cloud hanging over them these people are able to be appointed to serve in the same capacity indicates that the party is not concerned about these charges. This also speaks to the holes we have in legislation that doesn't restrict who we place in positions of trust and power. It's long past time that these issues are addressed in a meaningful way.","title":"'Fake electors' from 2020 are casting 2024 votes for Trump while facing felony charges"},{"text":"Is doge team staffed with volunteers.

Disney-owned ABC News last week agreed to pay Trump the huge sum to settle a defamation suit he brought in March after star anchor George Stephanopoulos said on-air that the former president had been found liable for rape. A New York jury found Trump liable in a civil case for sexual abuse, but not rape. While Stephanopoulos in May said he would not be cowed out of doing my job, on Saturday he and ABC expressed their regret over his comment about Trump. The networks decision left some lawyers, journalists and media executives puzzled  and prompted fears that Trump, who has threatened libel lawsuits against news media for decades, could use presidential power to muzzle the press.  I genuinely dont know what ABC was thinking when they agreed to do this?.?.?.?Unless there is something we dont know, it looks like it was a weak suit, said Genevieve Lakier, a law professor at the University of Chicago. For ABC to give in and settle so quickly, surely it will embolden similar suits. I am disturbed. ABCs decision to settle was dangerous and would have a chilling effect, said Samantha Barbas, a University of Iowa law professor. It will embolden Trump and his allies to keep bringing these libel suits. If they feel they can silence the press or control the press, intimidate it in any way, thats going to be a real incentive for them to come forward with more claims. Trump on Monday said he would bring additional defamation lawsuits against media groups. I think you have to do it because theyre very dishonest. We need a great media. We need a fair media, he said. We have to straighten out the press. Our press is very corrupt, almost as corrupt as our elections.!ping SNEK","title":"Libel warfare: ABCs payout to Donald Trump sends a chill across US media | Disney-owned networks $15mn defamation settlement has alarmed advocates of press freedom"},{"text":"It's not uncommon for an American candidate to run as one thing  and then suddenly have a change of heart when they win the election.

The forces include militia fighters and Turkish uniformed commandos and artillery in large numbers that are concentrated near Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in Syria on the northern border with Turkey, the officials said. A Turkish cross-border operation could be imminent, one of the U.S. officials said. The buildup, which began after Bashar al-Assads regime fell in early December, appears similar to Turkish military moves ahead of its 2019 invasion of northeast Syria. We are focused on it and pressing for restraint, another of the U.S. officials said. Ilham Ahmed, an official in the Syrian Kurds civilian administration, told President-elect Donald Trump on Monday that a Turkish military operation appeared likely, urging him to press Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to send troops across the border. Turkeys goal is to establish de facto control over our land before you take office, forcing you to engage with them as rulers of our territory, Ahmed wrote to Trump in a letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal. If Turkey proceeds with its invasion, the consequences will be catastrophic. A spokesman for Turkeys embassy in Washington didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. The threat from Turkey has left the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who are joined with U.S. troops in northeast Syria to hunt the remnants of Islamic State, in a vulnerable position weeks before the Biden administration will leave office. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Turkey last week to discuss Syrias future with Erdogan and seek assurances that Ankara would curtail operations against the Kurdish fighters.!ping MIDDLE-EAST&amp;FOREIGN-POLICY","title":"U.S. Fears Military Buildup by Turkey Signals Preparations for Incursion Into Syria | Kurdish officials are urging Trump to press Ankara to head off an invasion"},{"text":"Not that much.

The ceremony will take place on the steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, with Chief Justice John Roberts expected to administer the oath. Trump has promised an \\"uplifting and unifying\\" inaugural address, contrasting with his 2017 speech. Outgoing President Joe Biden will attend, ensuring a peaceful transfer of power, while thousands are expected to gather at the National Mall. Foreign dignitaries, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn and Argentine President Javier Milei, have been invited, but Chinese President Xi Jinping is not expected to attend.Following the ceremony, Trump plans to sign over two dozen executive orders aimed at reversing Biden-era policies. These include expanding immigration enforcement, resuming border wall construction, and boosting domestic energy production under the slogan \\"drill, baby, drill.\\" He is also expected to issue pardons for individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. A parade along Pennsylvania Avenue and evening inaugural galas will celebrate the occasion.

While it's results were subjective, I believe our life here works like that. But it's in a way, 4D chess. While we can desire to favor someone for something, but that also has a reaction on the opposite. As we are divided things appear random, and our own choices and views on a specific concept (Like a politician) affects a small portion of way life will go. I believe many of us come here because it's the real life equivalent of a \\"ranked\\" mode (like in a video game). You come here with risk, and you may get bumped down here, you may bump up, but at the end of your match (life) if you played through to the end the best you could, and if something terrible happened due to sickness of health or mind, there would be understanding and that isn't a ticket to \\"Go reincarnate, naughty!\\"  \\nit's more of a \\"Hey, we know you didn't want to do that, and there's plenty of experience to draw from what you've seen to where you wouldn't want to do this again anyway, we don't want to rub your nose in anything, and you don't need it.\\"Each incarnation of this life we strive to \\"do our best\\" in something or just \\"try, try again, or just try\\" so that we develop that muscle, that experience, that ability to naturally have a chemical reason in our minds to try it, and possibly learn it, or learn to hate it, learn to do it, learn not to do it. A person may struggle with an addiction, but they try to kick it, but fail, and pass with this unaccomplished. They aren't judged by a compile of their overall life, but by sections, and if there's a section (that is important) that one fails at, I believe not even that is warrant to \\"reincarnate\\", rather they go to a metaphorical classroom, the \\"matrix\\" equivalent to summer school. Where it isn't a punishment, you aren't stuck there forever, you know exactly where you are and you aren't meant to forever be there, (Even less than we may feel being here on Earth.) You are put through fine tuned experiences to train that muscle, and if you get the grasp of the concept, (Like having the will to have a faith in oneself so that they may kick an addiction and explore life rather than abandon any chance of it) is enough for them to be released to the same place any, and everyone else will go when they behave.

He is going to try to force news outlets to give up anonymous sources, he will put broadcast licenses in jeopardy, and he will have the FBI act as his secret police to harass or imprison people he thinks are out to get him. The way we've seen Kash Patel and Pete Hegseth also threaten these lawsuits against people for speaking out against them, even when what they're saying is plainly sourced, shows this is a coordinated plan of attack by Trump and his team. And the scary thing is that it seems to be working. Just look at the money donated to Trump by Amazon and Meta, by the bizarre way ABC settled Trump's lawsuit against them, or the way that the Washington Post and the LA Times are now forcing their editorial staff to kill negative opinion pieces about Trump.

Until recently, many assumed that a second Trump term would further exacerbate relations between the two countries. After all, although the initial tensions entered the relationship after President Barack Obamas pivot to Asia, it was Trumps first presidency when things really went sour between the two countries.But now the president-elect has made the surprise move of?[extending an invitation to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, to attend his inauguration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/12/15/xi-jinping-to-hulk-hogan-guests-honour-trump-inauguration/). This is a highly symbolic move, as foreign leaders do not usually attend American presidential inaugurations C much less foreign rivals. This has left many, especially those in the markets, scratching their heads.In the days following Trumps victory in the election, the US dollar rose. Markets were factoring in a bout of inflation that might be initiated by an increase in tariffs. Such a bout of inflation would force the Federal Reserve to raise rates, and this would mean a higher value for the dollar.But now the?[markets are sending a different signal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/09/donald-trump-policies-tip-us-into-recession/), with Wall Street behemoths forecasting a?[decline in the dollar relative to the euro](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/09/18/jd-vance-wall-street-try-bring-down-donald-trump-liz-truss/)?of anywhere between 2pc and 7pc in 2025.What is going on?

This decision follows a historic trial earlier in 2024, where Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of felony crimes. The charges stemmed from allegations that Trump orchestrated the $130,000 payment during the 2016 presidential campaign to suppress damaging claims, with reimbursements falsely recorded as legal expenses. Despite denying the affair and wrongdoing, Trump has consistently framed the case as a politically motivated attack.The conviction remains intact as Trump prepares to assume office next month, though his legal team continues to pursue additional avenues for dismissal. Prosecutors argue that the conviction should stand, even as some considerations are being weighed for his upcoming presidency. Sentencing is set for July 2024, with potential penalties ranging from fines to prison time, though the exact outcome remains uncertain. This case underscores the unprecedented legal and political challenges surrounding Trumps return to office while under criminal conviction.","title":"Judge rejects Trumps bid to toss hush money conviction because of Supreme Court immunity ruling"},{"text":"If they are orchestrating it, you can bet they will have moved their money accordingly before.","title":"Trumps DOGE Team Is Asking Potential Appointees If They Can Abolish the FDIC"},{"text":"Arent you guys forgetting about Alibaba and ARM?","title":"Softbank CEO and Trump announce $100 billion investment in U.S. by firm\\n"},{"text":"I'm not sure \\"four years of solid authoritarian shitshow\\" is going to be a fantastic experience, though.

Unfortunately, deciding whether that's the case falls onto the judicial branch of government, where the ultimate authority, SCOTUS, is a deeply corrupt, completely partisan fiesta of clowns. Who not only didn't rule according to the Constitution, but went out of their ways to hamper individual states from doing so as well, by rushing to rule that they couldn't decide who could or couldn't be on the ballot regardless of what the Constitution says. Even though the running of elections is a power explicitly delegated to the states.Then they went ahead and, like the cowards they are, refused to explicitly rule one way or another on the insurrection case themselves either, *de facto* ruling for Trump by default, while simultaneously trying to avoid the backlash that actually coming out and saying either \\"this clear instance of insurrection is actually not insurrection\\" or \\"yes, he is an insurrectionist, but we don't care, he goes on the ballot regardless\\" would have had. Of course, the fact that that makes their current very serious reading of the Constitution \\"insurrectionists are ineligible to hold office, but nobody other than us is allowed to check that eligibility, and we don't *have* to check it either if we don't feel like it\\" is just as disgraceful.

Or just moving? You sound like a great candidate for a Montessori school.          \\n           \\nAddressing your points in order:         \\n1. School shootings are very scary. But also all shootings are very scary, and they arent more likely to happen in schools than they are in malls, movie theaters, sports games, or other venues. Your children will suffer if they cannot go any of those places without you. Uncertainty is a part of life, and I think that going out in public is worth a bit of added risk.        \\n        \\n2. You can pick a school that doesnt use tablets. The last school that I worked at gave students laptops at age 12, because learning to type is going to benefit them in later life. But also theres plenty of private schools that barely use screens. I also question how much better youll be able to avoid them than the schools, when so much homeschool curriculum is online in the later years.      \\n             \\n3. I feel like this is gonna vary a lot school to school, but again, private school. You can ask how they teach math and science. You can also supplement what they teach (kumon, khan academy, crash course, whatever) if you dont feel like your kid is benefiting.        \\nI will also say that I like new math, but its not the opposite of repetition. You need to know your times tables like the back of your hand to be able to play around with bigger numbers later, or it gets too complicated.         \\n           \\n4. Private school, again. Not all schools are like this. Montessori is like the opposite of this. Its still a lot of time indoors, but plenty of them have lots of play-based activities every day.       \\n         \\n5. I honestly feel like this is a red state thing, the only books banned at my last school are actual pornography (ie 50 shades of gray). If youre willing to change your whole life to devote it to your childs education anyway, you could also just move somewhere bluer. Bonus that shed have a peer group whose values probably align with yours a lot better.                 \\n               \\n6. Do you want your six-year-old to be taught really gritty parts of history? Ive never taught that Thomas Jefferson raped his slaves because I taught *young* kids, but I dont think it was whitewashed either. One of the writers of the Declaration of Independence, who was also the 3rd president was the gist of it.         \\nAlso, if you havent been to school in 20 years, you probably dont know how whitewashed itll be. Popular sentiment has changed. Its more likely to have a conservative narrative if you live in deep red territory, but again, its gonna be easier to move than to study, craft a curriculum yourself, and teach it well when theyre old enough to learn about rape.        \\n               \\nIt seems like you want to homeschool because you dont trust the schools where you are, and that you find the views of most people around you dangerous/offensive. But Id posit that its easier to  move or find a likeminded school than it is to homeschool. Teaching is a full time job, and it sucks if you dont enjoy it.          \\n          \\nDo you want to study what age-appropriate literacy and numeracy look like? Test their milestones regularly? Will you make sure theyre working on gross and fine motor skills? Will you find them opportunities to try out art, music, and foreign language? Can you engineer situations for them to practice conflict resolution? Are you willing to be the bad cop who makes your kid do stuff they hate for hours every day, if they need it? Its gonna involve spreadsheets. What are you gonna do when theyre already pissing you off and acting up, but you dont get a break from them because youre their mom as well as their teacher?            \\n               \\nNot saying its impossible, but its *much* easier to find a good private school than it is to do all of that. This isnt even getting into the socialization stuff, or my husbands problems with secular homeschooling. I hope that gives you something to think about.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Assuming the point of the presentation is getting them to avoid their grotesque desires, then isnt this a good thing overall.

If your arguments were along the lines of the move away from phonics has been a disaster for child literacy, I would rather educate my child early on at home to ensure insulate them from the literacy crisis and teach using efficacious methodologies then I might feel differently, but I doubt you are nearly as well-equipped to teach reading or the many, many other skills that children need to pick up early on as the people who currently do it for a living.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"And California is going to keep counting until they can claim he didn't.?","title":"Remember when they said republicans would lose every election because of changing demographics and it was a party full of old white voters?

However foundational political science declares that states are also based on the consent of the governed. And Americans in general dont like being ruled.If the government pulls the military ripcord then people at large will demand liberty and accept death if thats the only alternative. I think Trump is an old fart who just wants to lounge around while playing and his cronies and ostensible allies such as John Thune against each other, who have their own political interests that theyre manipulating so I rate the risk of cancelling elections and imposing martial law as Extremely Low (still terrifying that there is this risk at all because I, a trans and autistic nonbinary person in DC who is heavily dependent on functioning services, would probably die if I didnt manage to flee, but I genuinely think Trump is more going for Warren G. Harding style kleptocracy). I therefore rate the risk of an oligarchical republic with figurehead Presidents as Medium Confidence due to, again, the chances of a blue wave in 26-28 being high as corruption is exposed in real time, if not by the mainstream media being sued into compliance then citizen journalists. Theoretically the President CAN declare martial law and suspend habeas corpus but the Supreme Court in ex Parte Milligan said that if civil courts are functioning that cannot happen. In newer democracies that usually leads to coups, but they also have weaker, less diverse civil societies and usually not strong federalist systems like we have.

And that \\"event\\" was Covid.Covid was perfect because:1) It scared everyone, or most people at least.2) It was intentionally divisive, so people were arguing with each other instead of keeping their eye on the prize (economic aspect)3) Covid was PERFECT for causing inflation:  \\nJust like the document planned, they used \\"Covid\\" to give people and businesses money directly. \\"Helicopter money.\\" BUT WAIT... THERE'S MORE!Covid also was used to shut down and manipulate supply lines, under the guise of \\"safety.\\" But none of it was real... It was all a scheme to increase demand (giving people money) while simultaneously constricting supply.Naturally, that leads to INFLATION.4) And why would they want inflation? The over-flourishing economy (based on money created out of thin air) caused the inflation so they HAD to increase interest rates.5) And increasing interest rates was what it was all about.Now the Fed interest rates are high again, and they can use those interest rates to manipulate the economy as they always have. There is the \\"reset.\\"\\\\---So what was the SEFF? People who know what I'm talking about may remember the \\"repo crisis\\" of 2019, where interest rates for short term loans between banks shot up overnight from a fraction-of-a-percent to over 10%.

I worked with students with autism, many who are not verbal. Ive had former friends say things like children with autism should be allowed to be aborted. But we dont even know they have autism until several years after they are born  I will say a lot of the kids Ive seen medical records for who have severe non-verbal autism  a lot of their mothers drank or did hard/prescription drugs while they were pregnant. One of the kids I saw, his mother was addicted to morphine. Im not a doctor and I dont know if there are studies about things like this, but look at the people who are always saying that vaccines are the problem. Literally the guy who said heroin made him a better student and I wouldnt be surprised if MTG does prescription drugs or something like that too.And then of course some things are just genetic and happen naturally. But I am sick of people demonizing children with autism. There is a very wide spectrum and I think being given certain tools can help children develop well. I know at least two people with autism who are very high functioning and you would never even know they are autistic. There are so many examples of people with high-functioning autism who are very successful and contribute to society in really meaningful ways. Its just wild this country still says sickening things and then also believes theories that have been debunked time and time again.","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene roasted online for unequivocally saying vaccines cause autism"},{"text":"??\\nHe is a pig","title":"Trumps Border Czar is a terrible person."},{"text":"Interesting!
