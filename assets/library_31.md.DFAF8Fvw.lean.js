There are specific ways evidence must be obtained for it to be admissible in court. There are specific ways that these issues need to be investigated and the vast majority of these people have no idea what they are. A lot of the evidence they collect against pedophiles might not be admissible in court and therefore no charges are made. \\"To Catch a Predator\\" worked with the local police to prosecute online pedophiles.

It can be unethical to post \\"fuck this guy\\" to a million followers, knowing that there will likely be harassment as a result, but I don't think it should be made Illegal; the law is too easily turned the other way, protecting the powerful instead of the powerless.The incitement boundry is the largest concern in my view.

The call was 3 days after the event happened.  The police documented a bruise on her thigh.The police interviewed the man who said that they had had a consensual sexual relationship in their hotel room and that he had made sure she was okay with what was happening. The police did some additional work but at the end basically threw up their hands and said \\"not enough to file charges.\\" These cases are difficult to prove in court because any trial is inevitably going to involve the victim sitting on a witness stand in a room with 30 or more people telling the story and then being cross-examined on their motivations by a defense attorney.  There's actually some really good resources on things police and prosecutors can do to bolster those cases but it does not make them much easier on the victim. But at the same time when a victim makes a police report like that and the boys do nothing they feel hopeless and defeated.

It is fairly easy to take women's issues, and to find an equivalent for men. The reason why you struggle to do it is because it entirely co tradicts your point. Why ? Because these issues are the world we live in, and they already feel normal to you, and people are not up in arms about them.?\\nThe very ironic thing is that you feel that men's issues are not systemic and normalised because they are already implemented in the system and feel normal to you, while you are under the impression that women's issues are systemic and normalised because they already are an exception and generally combated and they feel very wrong to you.\\nIn some other comment, I defied you to name the top 5 men's issues currently. Like I said, you could ask the people around you in real life, and see how likely you are to get an answer to that.\\nThe easy example I gave you, because it seems to have been a central theme of the left campaign against trump, is abortion. People are saying \\"my body my choice! The government is taking control of women's body, forcing them into pregnancy and birth, which is damaging for the body and mind of those women, and even sometimes deadly\\". And I agree with that. But... Can you imagine a situation where the government takes control of men's body against their will to force them into a situation that is damaging to their body and mind and which is very often deadly ? I believe, in the US, men are still required to register for the draft in order to have the same rights women get for free. Do you consider that that being forced into combat against your will qualifies for that description above ?\\nYet this feels normal to most, it is not a big campaigning point for any party (even though you tell us that any party that decides to champion men's rights is going to automatically win).\\nIn fact, the male only draft has been challenged by NCFM, some judge has ruled it unconstitutional, but last I heard it was stuck in legal limbo, to be addressed by the supreme court which refuses to do so. Did you hear about any of this in any of the news channels that is making so much noise about abortion ? Which politician is recruiting and campaigning on the topic ? And how well are they doing, with it ?\\nAnd that is just one of the many points where the laws and policies actually discriminate against men, and which are absolutely being ignored by the media and politicians and pretty much everyone else.","title":"CMV: If the script was flipped and it was mens rights being fought for then Kamala wouldve won."},{"text":"Both heavy makeup users.

Its hard when consumer demand for the absolute cheapest building is top priority. Its sick that these foreigners are getting paid $12-16/hr to frame houses when my uncles were getting paid $26/hr+ in the 1980s The whole idea that we import people because Americans wont do certain jobs is a lie.

I don't think people will change until they feel like they reached the right conclusions themselves.\\nAlso, I think that most young people on the right don't really believe in what they say, but they lack the skillset to step back and evaluate. You can see this in the way they resort to deflection and whataboutism whenever confronted. The more they can focus on what they don't like about you, the less they will have to face themselves.","title":"The rise of Trump bros and why Gen Z men are shifting right"},{"text":"No not THAT speech!","title":"Trump Says Republicans MUST KILL Bipartisan Bill to Protect Press Freedom"},{"text":"First, they came for the trans people, and I did not speak out because I was not trans.

Presidents like Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Kennedy, Reagan, and Obama were consistent in their hopeful messages, and their ground games were masterful, and they offered up visions of what could be, making it easy for folks to latch onto them. All of those men were/are imperfect and did things we should rightfully look at with a critical eye, but they knew how to move the needle. On the dark flip side of that, Americans also love their grievances. Characters like Huey Long, David Duke, Joseph McCarthy, and of course Donald Trump are master manipulators on playing on your sense of grievance. We want to naturally gravitate toward blaming someone for our issues and these people offer easy scapegoats in a charismatic and compelling way, and they often leave behind lasting damage when they're finally silenced, as the only way to deprogram people from their grievances is to counter offer them an even stronger, hopeful message, that resonates in their personal world. I think the Dems were onto something when the weird thing was taking off thanks to Walz. Republicans are a weird bunch. They obsess over people's genitalia on a daily basis, they look past obvious indiscretions with their leaders, and have a strange sense of humor coated in a casual cruelty. I think if that had remained at the core of Harris's campaign, making people laugh and see Trump and his ilk as small and petty people undeserving of leadership, she might have stood a better chance, but the campaign wasn't consistent. They took the bait too often with Trump's shenanigans, letting the focus shift back to him in a way that helped him. Most Americans can identify with working at McDonalds and despite it being an obvious stunt, they liked the visual of Trump working at one and driving around in a garbage truck. It's ghoulish and cynical watching him cosplay as a regular person, but people like their vibes and visuals and he played on the \\"elitist\\" grievance. The visual Harris was putting out in the last 1/3 of her campaign was sitting side by side with Liz Cheney. With the war going on in Gaza and Lebanon and the Cheney's being infamous war hawks thanks to Iraq, this was a miscalculation, compounded by the fact that she was increasingly dropping the fun and weird angle for darker rhetoric as we got closer to Election Day. This likely confused her early fans wishing for the more optimistic Harris. She needed a David Axelrod, really, keeping things consistent. Anyway, that's my take.","title":"Dems need to grow some balls and stop letting Republicans dictate the debate and the situation"},{"text":"I'm not sure what you're getting at here.","title":"Trump Tells Republicans to Kill Reporter Shield Bill Passed Unanimously by House"},{"text":"Nikki also forgot to mention Klingon and Romulan sympathizer. ??

It's not legally possible to be sexually entrapped by a minor and the minor child cannot be held at fault.There is no state in the Union that accepts ANY legal defense for statutory rapeThere are some states with Romeo and Juliet clauses where 16 is legal if the age gap is small and the man is only like 20 or something, it varies by states with that exception. If you are not in a Romeo Juliet state or you are outside the 3-5 year age gap, and there is proof of sexual intercourse with a minor child, you are done.Even if you were chained to the floor and drugged with Viagra and raped, you would be facing an uphill battle because it is believed that a minor child is not generally capable of sexually exploiting an adult and it would be believed that you orchestrated that situation and manipulated the minor child. It's possible to prove that you were forced against your will into sexual activity with a minor child but the burden of evidence to prove that you were a victim and that you were mentally and physically unable to stop the minor child is enormous This is the only possible defense. If you had consensual sex with a minor child, it is statutory rape 100% of the time and it is an automatic conviction regardless of the context or circumstances, and there is no legal defense that is recognized by any state in the Union.\\nI","title":"House Ethics Committee rejects releasing Matt Gaetz review"},{"text":"\\"His attorney has acknowledged that Hegseth later entered into a settlement agreement with his accuser that included an undisclosed monetary payment and a confidentiality clause.\\"Being a predator must be one of Trump's prerequisites for cabinet picks ??","title":"New details from sexual assault allegations against Trumps defense secretary nominee"},{"text":"Ever watched The Simpsons, the most popular TV show of the last 35 years?","title":"The rise of Trump bros and why Gen Z men are shifting right"},{"text":"Why is it not a rule that ANY house investigation, regardless of how it ends, has to have a public report filed?","title":"House Ethics Committee doesn't agree to release highly anticipated Matt Gaetz report after investigation"},{"text":"The winning never stops!

They are changing their presentation to reflect their innate sense of self. It is not fetishistic tokenism so why do you compare it to black face? How does Queerness not constitute having a relation to sexuality? How does what gender/sex a person perceives themselves and what gender/sex they are attracted to not shape what their sexuality is? And what exactly do you think intersex is? It is a medical and biological reality and not a choice.You compare it to trans racial without understanding anything about the people for which you speak. To use your stupid disingenuous framing being trans is a lot closer to being an adopted child from a different culture or country and being raised by apathetic people and wanting to reconnect to your own culture/country because you feel incomplete in who you are and want to have the experiences you feel  have been deprived of. To experience the life you have deeply yearned for and felt was taken from you. Biological essentialism is shallow and cruel, and whether its related to race, sex, sexuality, or ability it does not capture the breath of human existence and is always used to justify immoral and inhumane acts.","title":"How Nancy Mace went from LGBTQ ally to anti-trans culture warrior"},{"text":"If that improves my drive to LAX, I consider this a win.","title":"Nearly Half of Los Angeles Residents Consider Leaving US After Trump Win"},{"text":"Egads clean up that link.

Of course SCOTUS would be very angry because he has a 'D' next to his name...but it would take forever to work it's way back up to SCOTUS.

First blush by anyone doing napkin math basically puts Trump's tariffs on an equal level as Coivd...as Covid...as...Covid, like worldwide lock down, destroy the entire world manufacturing and logistics infrastructure, and the 100%+ cost increases that came with it.  People are initially looking at the numbers and saying it's that...again.So, what good has Trump done?Well, he applied Tariffs that added +5% to +10% cost to a lot of consumer goods.Then he fumbled Covid HARD and caused another +100% (or more) cost increases.And now he's touting sweeping tariffs that are going to push another +100% costs onto consumers.So, Trump, the public's financial savior (to many hopefuls) has been and is planning to push consumer costs up to 200% PLUS of original prices back pre 2020.But, but, BUT...people love him, absolutely LOVE him, because he didn't veto the Republican (Trump had zero to do with this) tax code changes which gave Americans a WHOPPING $250 per year, decreasing per year, and how higher than 2016 income tax, of income tax reductions.  All Trump did to win ALL the adoring praise of the Republican public was hand them in total around $1000 over the span of several years.  And Trump didn't even campaign on the tax code, spearhead it, or even was any part at all of it.  He simply didn't veto the bill.  That's ALL of Trumps participation, and he road that into the 2024 White House.  Absolutely freaking AMAZING marketing.  Bravo.  BRAVO!Oh...and Republicans fiddling with the tax code also messed up a bunch of deductions, so...a lot of Americans found they paid $4000 to $6000 or MORE, per year, every year, after that tax code change, but...they saved $250 on income taxes for a net saving of -$5750.  Oh wait, that's negative.  Oops.  Many people found out they lost like $4000 to $6000 come tax season.  Woopsie.  Oh, and that has never been fixed, so that's been like burning around $5000 a year for the last 6 years, coming on 7.  Yay Republicans!  You're so great!So, now economists are estimating Trump's goals will cost Americans around $4000 a year more, every year.So, Trump totals:Average American consumerism per year: $77,280 (2023)Let's say only 1/4 of that is on goods, and other stuff towards housing, loans, food, etc.  So this is about $20,000 of spending.Now people don't HAVE more money, so they simply buy less stuff.  For example just last year, sales of a lot of products I'm familiar with has dropped minimally 40% in just a single year.So ultimately this is an issue of buying power, what can you actually afford, how much you can afford.Tariffs dropped buying power 10%.Covid dropped buying power 100%Trump's economic plans and tariffs will drop buying power 100%.In total, that's a 210% reduction in buying power.Now that $20,000 is all I'll look and and ignore 3/4 of spending.  I'll assuming housing, car loans, and other big expenses stay relatively static and things like tariffs won't burden them, so $20,000 it is.We're really looking at a buying reduction on $20,000 of 210%.  This means you lost around $10,500, yearly due to Trump's actions simply in economic spending.Add on tax code changes, and you are seeing somewhere in the range of negative $10,000 to negative $15,000 in your spending value.  This is the loss burden Trump has and is continuing to create.This is...per year...every year...of loss.This also means you're losing the investment power of this where the S&amp;P 500 has a yearly 10% gain that you could be making on each and every year of those $10,000 to $15,000.Well, in 25 years of investment, that's a million dollars you MAKE.  That's a million dollars you DON'T GET TO HAVE because Trump's past and future actions will burden you financially.  Trump will lose you one million freaking dollars in 25 years time due to his actions.","title":"Trump tariffs to push down U.S. growth a great deal going into 2026, Morgan Stanley warns"},{"text":"They were ok with them having less human rights.

The amount of evidence that the ethics committee and the DoJ has amassed here is probably enough to go to trial with basically any other defendant. We have literal receipts that can be traced between Gaetz and the minor he sex trafficked. We have eyewitness testimony to the crime itself from both the ringleader and one of the other underage prostitutes. If it were any other random person with this level of evidence against him in all likelihood DoJ would just sweat them out and say 'think about how this is going to look in front a jury' and they'd take a 15-year bid to avoid spending the rest of their life in a cell.","title":"Federal Inquiry Traced Matt Gaetzs Venmo Payments to Women"},{"text":"Hes such a fucking piece of shit.","title":"Donald Trump Gives Republicans an Order Over Press Freedom Bill"},{"text":"The fuck if I know; Im not trying to be that guy, Im not picking that guy, nor am I gonna vote for that guy.

Many casual readers of Huntington wrongly interpreted his thought and focused excessively on the word clash in the title of the book. They argue that Huntington advocated that the West clash with other civilizations to defend itself. A number of thinkers confused Huntingtons clash with Bernard Lewiss thesis that militant Islam would spark a global clash between Islam and the West.Huntington, in fact, warned emphatically against provoking the Islamic world and argued for caution and diplomacy in cleft countries such as Ukraine. He was adamantly opposed to crusading democracy promotion as a core component of U.S. foreign policy. On this subject, he wrote, The principal responsibility of Western leaders, consequently, is not to attempt to reshape other civilizations in the image of the West, which is beyond their declining power, but to preserve, protect and renew the unique qualities of Western civilization.Huntington argued that most civilizational blocs emerging in the postCCold War world would have natural leaders, what he called core states. Sinic civilization would be led by China, Orthodox civilization by Russia, and Western civilization by the United States. Since the Islamic world has no natural leader, a struggle for leadership would take place between Sunni and Shia and between the leading nations of the Middle East such as Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran.These core states are key to managing the challenges that would emerge in cleft nations such as Ukraine. Rather than sponsoring a proxy war in Ukraine and risking a bigger war, the leaders of the core states need to step back and acknowledge that both Russia and the West have legitimate claims in Ukraine and that a diplomatic solution is the only path forward. Whether that solution is a partition of Ukraine, a federation where the aspirations of both parts of the country are respected, or some other compromiseonly sincere efforts at diplomacy on the part of Russia and the United States can solve this problem.As the ISW paper illustrates, American policy toward Ukraine has been the opposite of what Huntington would have advised. It has been a crusading democracy promotion that led to a U.S.-backed coup dtat in Kiev, a refusal to recognize any legitimate Russian interests in Crimea and eastern Ukraine despite their deep historic ties, and the sponsorship of a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, the goals of which are unclear.As America is ravaged by a pandemic and its consequences, the American people are going to be far less willing to tolerate a meddling, universalistic U.S. foreign policy in parts of the world having little connection to our interests. The way forward is the Huntington model of recognizing the legitimate interests of other civilizational regions, combined with genuine U.S. diplomacy as the leading tool of American foreign policy.Dr. William S. Smith is the author of Democracy and Imperialism published by the University of Michigan Press.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

Awareness of the complex history that gives rise to conflict strengthens the hand of diplomacy.The hawkish think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently warned that Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to advance his strategic objectives in Ukraine. That ISW would focus on a nation that is largely irrelevant to American national interests and do so even in the midst of a terrible pandemic in the homeland is representative of the more general myopia of the American national security community. This myopia betrays a deeply flawed understanding of how the world order would be shaped at the end of the Cold War.Consider just a few examples of how American leaders fumbled certain specific challenges at the end of the Cold War. When the first postCCold War conflagration ignited in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. policymakers insisted that this artificial state be held together despite the intense ethnic and religious aspirations among the three major components of that fake country. The U.S. policy that emerged toward China was one of constructive engagement, naively assuming that the leader of a competing civilization with competing interests would want to Westernize. As Samuel Huntington pointed out, the Chinese believe that their economic success is largely a product of Asian culture which is superior to that of the West, which is culturally and socially decadent. In maybe the worst blunder of the postCCold War period, the United States assumed that once Iraqis had been saved from a dictatorial regime they would rally to the flag of democracy, disregard centuries of ethnic and religious tensions and quickly embrace Western rights, values and outlooks.What all these blunders have in common is the neglect of Samuel Huntingtons insight that the postCCold War world was arranging itself along ethnic, religious and civilizational lines. Nations were throwing off artificial Cold War alliances and rallying around common historical ties. We should have been able to predict that Turkey would gravitate into the Islamic world and away from NATOs interests, or that Orthodox Greece would be one of the most troublesome members of the European Union, or that Muslim Chechnya would seek independence from Orthodox Russia. As Huntington wrote, In the postCCold War world, the most important distinctions among peoples are not ideological, political, or economic. They are cultural.U.S. policy toward Russia has suffered deeply from failure to understand what most motivates the action of groups. Francis Fukuyama, who spoke for much of the foreign policy establishment, argued in 1989 that postCCold War Russia was trending toward a political system in which the people should be truly responsible for their own affairs, the higher political bodies should be answerable to the lower ones, and not vice versa, and that the rule of law should prevail over arbitrary police actions, with separation of powers and an independent judiciary. For many Western thinkers, it seemed inconceivable that Russia would choose the retrograde course of returning to its authoritarian and Orthodox roots.Since Huntingtons insights and predictions were far more prescient than Fukuyamas and those of many others, the U.S. foreign policy establishment should have heeded his advice when the crisis in Ukraine emerged. But, it did not.Huntington predicted the crisis in Ukraine. His theory that nations would return to their historical and cultural roots had a natural corollary: nations that were divided between civilizations, so-called cleft countries, were the places that would most likely generate great-power conflict. Consider that, in the former Yugoslavia, the United States, Germany, Russia and prominent Islamic nations all lined up to support different proxies in the conflict according to shared civilizational commonalities.By Huntingtons civilizational standard, Ukraine is a severely cleft country, divided internally along historical, geographic and religious lines, with western Ukraine firmly in the European corner and eastern Ukraine and Crimea firmly in the orbit of Orthodox Russia. Even though it was published years before the 2013 Ukrainian crisis, Huntingtons most famous book, The Clash of Civilizations, is rife with warnings about the dangers of the Ukrainian situation and predicts that Ukraine could split along its fault line into two separate entities, the eastern of which would merge with Russia. The issue of secession first came up with respect to Crimea.","title":"As Biden himself repeatedly complained, Ukraines goal is to draw NATO directly in the war.

Like its clear that his health is in decline, and it was never great to begin with. His drug use isnt a secret, his diet is horrible, hasnt done any actual exercise a day in his life, and hes gonna be 82 by the time his term is up. He aint got much left in him. JD seems to be liked among conservatives, especially the younger ones, and hes got the support of Heritage Foundation; but like you said, he doesnt have the broader cults support, at least at the moment. But if the party really makes an effort to market him and Trump gives him an endorsement before he croaks, he may have a chance. Don Jr. has the Trump name, hes just as crazy as his dad, but I dont think hes got the narcissism that can keep an audience focused on exclusively him; though from what Ive seen from his talking, hes not a bad speaker, and hes been present throughout the campaigns so people at least are aware of him.Ron DeSantis might have a shot depending on how Florida does over the next few years, and how Trumps relationship with DeSantis during that time works out. If they have a falling out (which is possible), then its not happening. If they get along well enough and Florida doesnt *look* like the hellhole its becoming, he may be the winning bet for a GOP 2028 ticket. But honestly, I dont think the cult will like him; hes a bit of a weasel and doesnt have the strongman energy that they like. Vivek did well in the primaries, but hes brown, so probably a nonstarter. Same thing with Nikki Haley, but shes a woman. In the absolute worst case scenario I can imagine, they go with Elon Musk. Democrats will obviously bitch about how he cant run because hes not natural born, but they will take no real action against it. He has a cult of his own, hes fucking insane, narcissistic, and while his health isnt great, hes younger than Trump, so can theoretically last longer. Plus, its clear hes cozied himself right up next to Donnies ear like an obese and equally pale Grima Wormtongue; an endorsement would be basically guaranteed. Now, if the Trump presidency shitshow goes down as expected, the broader Republican base may decide that MAGA isnt the best idea (yes, I know theyre brain dead, but they do understand something negatively affecting them personally). With Trump out of the picture, the Republican Party may decide to shift more moderate, but still take a hardline stance on something like gun control to keep as many weirdos as they can. At that point, Im not sure who theyd go for. Or who knows, maybe theyll do some foul arcane ritual and reanimate Ronald Reagans corpse for a third term. Because a race between Reagan and Obama for 2028 would not be the wildest thing in this timeline I guess.","title":"Second Trump term bingo"},{"text":"Real Christians would tell the truth and shame the devil.

My uncle has a computer science degree from the Universiry of Tennessee. He is successful. He owns a couple of nice homes in the Atlanta area. He believes public school teachers give children sex change pills. He believes public schools hustle kids off to clinics to have gender reassignment surgery before parents can stop it. He hears that shit on the radio from Clay Travis, a Fox \\"sports\\" host. I'm an educator in Tennessee. This is my 26th year. I have never been allowed to give a kid an ibuprofen. I've never known any trans kids, not one.

Yes, people identify with both groups. But the relationship between sexuality and gender is not always mutually exclusive.Using plural pronouns when referring to a singular nonbinary person, can be confusing for some to adapt.Saying they/them, used to be a discrete and safe way of communicating you were on the team if you werent out.Adults born intersex should be free to update legal documentation with the gender they adapt during puberty. (I acknowledge one may not know if theyll develop breast.)My concern with allowing those of us born with chromosomes matching our external and internal genitalia to update legal documents are:1. Our chromosomes cannot be scientifically altered to match another gender. (womanhood feels deeper than external presentation, female appearing genitalia, mental connection with said gender etc.)2. It opens the flood gates for transracial identity changes. (A Hispanic could be afro Latina. A mono racial Indian isnt likely to be white.Tanning/bleaching skin, fillers,nasal procedures and mentally feeling like another race, wouldnt make us a different race.)It seems unfair to deny Rachel from legally and publicly identifying as a black woman if thats what she feels at her core.

That would save $500 billion a year right there.\\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/abstractTaking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017). The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households. Furthermore, we estimate that ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68?000 lives and 173 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.Anyone serious about fixing the government budget should be a huge supporter of single payer healthcare.

(Arguably over-corrected even, given the later ensuing inflation- but that too was multi factorial, supply chain shortages, demand recovery, and a war involving a major oil producer and a major grain exporter all piled on).Also, I dont think I agree that the New Deal had an immediate impact. Unemployment was 3% in 1929. It peaked at 25% 3-4 years later, and then never really dropped below ~10% for a decade, well after FDRs first term. That speed of recovery is reflected across most economic metrics of the time period.","title":"Chuck Schumer Is Fighting Tooth And Nail To Get Judges Confirmed Before Trump Takes Office"},{"text":"lets all dance in the sunlight.

Let me preface this by saying that I am by no means well-versed in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The following is a very broad outline of the understanding I have gained from reading articles and viewing documentaries on the subject. I am neither Muslim nor Jewish (nor Christian for that matter), and do not have any personal interest in either side. I just find it terribly tragic that so many innocent people have suffered and died, and so many others have willingly given their lives, at the behest of those who claim to be doing right by some deity. I mean absolutely no offense to anyone of any nationality or culture and apologize in advance if anything I write here does offend anyone. Looking at the most recent conflict, Id say Israel had the moral high ground after they were attacked on October 7, 2023. Palestinians would argue that they were justified in the terrorist attack by virtue of the fact that Israel continues to support its citizens claiming land in the West Bank. Im of the opinion that killing innocent people is never justified, period. However, Israel may have gone too far in its response to the attack, having killed many Palestinian civilians and created abject misery for many others living in the Gaza Strip. Israel would argue that Hamas militants have a habit of hiding behind citizens and launching attacks from civilian areas in an attempt to get Israel to retaliate and kill citizens, then blaming Israel for unprovoked attacks against non-combatants. And so on and so forth. Arabs would argue that there should be no state of Israel and that the area now known as such was slowly stolen from Palestinians vis a vie the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Israelis would counter that the land was originally known as Israel and Judea (several thousand years ago) and that it was being returned to its rightful owner through said Declaration and its progeny. All I know is that many thousands of people have been tortured, imprisoned, displaced, terribly injured and disfigured, and slaughtered, all over a land dispute. Arabs and Jews, like Christians, all have the same god and all three groups claim that said deity is on *their* side and that their atrocities are justified because if it werent gods will, they would not have been victorious, though any claim of victory in this centuries-long bloodbath is highly suspect. Its a terrible situation and many very intelligent and well-meaning individuals have dedicated their lifes work to ending the violence to greater or lesser degrees of at-best temporary reprieves. I have no clue who is right, if anyone is, and as long as both dogmatically believe that some god is on their side, I doubt there will be anything close to a long-term cessation of hostilities.","title":"Who is in the right, Israel or Palestine?

The latest hack of testimony from the underage teen and corroborating witness who saw her have sex with Gaetz at these parties was from a lawsuit towards the underage girl brought by an affiliate of Gaetz for defamation. The testimony is sworn under oath and the defendants rebuttal to the lawsuit brought by Gaetz buddy. I would consider this a form of intimidation, but not only is there corroborating witnesses theres also financial transactions in large sums to the girl during the time of these sex parties.

If he is prepared to buy into Kennedys anti-vaxxer nonsense, why should he care about what economists think about that? He makes two big mistakes: first, he has no inkling of comparative advantage; second and worse, he does not understand that the trade balance is determined by aggregate supply and demand, not by the sum of bilateral balances. That is why his tariff war will not reduce US trade deficits. On the contrary, especially in the current context, it is more likely to lead to inflation, conflict with the Federal Reserve and a loss of trust in the dollar.Here is Nobel Prize winner in economics Paul Krugman's analysis on Trump's tariffs:[How Trumps Radical Tariff Plan Could Wreck Our Economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/trump-tariffs-economy.html) - https://archive.ph/f0mnJAs a result, tariffs would raise the cost of living more for middle- and lower-income families than the average. An estimate by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which assumes a 20 percent tariff, finds that it would reduce the real income of families in the bottom fifth of earners by 5.7 percent, of middle-income families by 4.6 percent, but of the top 1 percent by only 1.4 percent. An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics arrives at similar numbers. In other words, Trumps 2.0 tariffs would in effect be a strongly regressive tax increase, imposing a serious burden on most families.","title":"Why Trumps trade war will cause chaos"},{"text":"My bad, kind of intoxicated and didn't see your edit.","title":"Walmart and Other Companies Say Trumps Tariffs Will Obviously Raise Prices"},{"text":"Trump admin picks are DEI for unqualified white people.","title":"Trump Education Department Nominee Resigned from Education Board After Falsely Claiming She Had a Degree in Education"},{"text":"She should file charges against MTG.

I gave 5 star reviews to some (District court judges). I chose write in as equivalent to a 1 star review for other races. At least they wont win with 100% of the votes. Ill be voting in the Republican primary in 2026, that ballot will be another customer satisfaction survey.","title":"Trump will damage this country beyond repair"},{"text":"It's unlikely..... This is old news, allegedly it happened several years ago and was thoroughly investigated by police. There is no wiggle room for leniency for statutory rape in this country.... You go to prison if the evidence is there, it doesn't even matter if the girl had fake ID and tricked you and you met her in a 21+ club and you were drunk.... You still go to prison, even if the judge feels sorry for you, you still go to prison and are put on the registry as a sex offender..... Our statutory rape laws are very strict and have no room for leniency.

My rent is $2400 a month after all those little fees the Apartment Complex tags on to an already high monthly rent. This is for a one-bedroom apartment near Denver's core, close to the action and to work, making it easier to travel to work and other essential things. To not be rent burdened, I need to make an income of $42.86 per hour. Minimum wage is $18.29. That's $3073 per month. According to Zumper, the average 1 bedroom rent is $1731, so earning minimum wage doesn't even put you in the average 1 bedroom apartment in Denver. In fact, only 22% of units in Denver rent for 1500 to 751 per month. Note that this doesn't break out how many apartments were available for $1000 a month or less, but last time I saw that broke out, it was less than 10% of the available units on the market. This is before we talk about the cost of food, energy, transportation, and other essentials. Young people are hurting. There are fewer entry level jobs, and more people competing for the few jobs left. Gone are the days when an interest in basic electronics, an old beat-up pickup truck, some tools, and get-'er-done attitude could net you a well-paying job as a traffic technician replacing bulbs and repairing lights in the city. These days, you're not going to get a job replacing bulbs on lightpoles in your town, because those are all now LEDs with MTBF so long that a typical bulb will last for at least 10 years, if not more, rather than lights that would burn out after no more than 6 months. We're getting shafted by megacorps in the rental industry, in the food industry, in the energy industry, and in the automotive industry. You go to work to feed the car, pay the rent, and keep the lights on, and can't even really afford to feed yourself, let alone entertain yourself. No longer able to play the newest video games because you can't afford the console or PC, let alone the games, you have lots of time to waste on your phone, and all these shock-jocks like Joe Rogan are lining up to tell you it's not your fault. It's the fault of the Gays. It's the fault of the Muslims. Of the immigrants and Blacks. There's some kind of woke ideology coming to take everything that's dear from you, from the jobs that aren't available anymore, to the cheap housing and gasoline where you could just jump in your car one weekend and drive until you forgot your problems. And of course, take your right to a woman's body from you by filling their pretty, dumb little heads with silly notions that they are human beings that are entitled to control their bodies 'n' shit. All these shitheads are HAPPY to make these claims to you because they know Team Blue isn't in this space, talking to young men. And so your head gets filled with the BS being pushed by the shock-jocks and the tech-bros, and shit...the real-world Tony Stark is telling you the only thing between us and greatness is woke assholes telling us we should be happy paying half our paycheck into rent and the rest into keeping our old beater fueled up, keeping the lights on, and trying to put enough food on our table to not starve, while we're told we're awful people for appreciating a cute girl in a sexy outfit. As a progressive Gen-X male, none of this speaks to me, but I understand where this comes from. I've put my nose to the grindstone and built up a ridiculous amount of Student Loan debt, and I've finally got a decent job during the previous economic shitstorm in 2008. I can afford my $2400 a month of rent, and can absorb the extra costs that have cropped up these past 4 years. But I've watched my margins shrink even as my income went up. I can only imagine the stress of looking at the $3k paycheque being eaten up by $1.5k of rent and an ever increasing grocery, electric, gas, and petrol bill. For a lot of people, this was the reality. And as a progressive Gen-X male, I can put myself in their heads, and understand why they might be taken in by Trump's bullshit. Realistically, while 2017 to 2020 was a shit-clown-show of epic proportions, rent was lower and I had more funny money. Going from having funny money to taking on credit card debt just to make ends meet? Yeah, that would make me fucking bitter. My experiences during Obama's first term when I was trying to find work wouldn't compare to trying to find a job in Biden's first years of his first term, and I was pretty pissed at Obama and his hands-off, Republican-appeasing approach to the economy in 2008. I can only imagine how I'd have responded to Biden and his half-measures if I was out of work in 2021...Democrats, and sadly, lots of commentors here, seem to have this notion that Dems don't owe people a comfortable lifestyle, especially if they are white males, and to a lesser extent, non-white males. I had hoped that the recent election would educate Democrats on this issue, but from what I'm reading here and in the article, it hasn't. The bottom line is that the Dems haven't really represented everyone's best interest these last 4 years. RealPage has been allowed to run without any sort of pushback from Dems. No actions were taken against corporations for price-fixing groceries. Billionaires were allowed to grab more and more. And Dems refused to even talk about this. Limited messaging, and the appearance that our concerns about the fact that our paycheques go less far than our bills are being dismissed in favour of someone else's concerns. This leads to the 'woke' complaint. And with the only option for burning off steam being listening to podcasts by shitheads, their heads got filled with hatred. If Dems don't grasp this fact, the GQP will be able to continue hitting the Dems on this. I think the new message should be 'a rising tide must lift all boats, not just the yachts.' When people ask about specific things, link back to the general goal. \\"When we look after all workers, minority workers are part of all workers.\\" \\"When we talk about treating all people with respect, this means LGBTQ people.\\" \\"We're not abandoning the disadvantaged. The real villains here are the billionaires using their vast sums of money to divide and conquer us.\\" And then actually live up to that. I think I'm fed up with all the promises the Dems make -- Single payer healthcare, reduced college costs, stricter handling of price fixing, more housing, and so on. I think Trump is tapping in on these frustrations, and lots of young, single men are feeling like Dems don't care about them, and care more about women, minorities, and LGBTQ people. Dems need to meet this head on, or we're going to see more young people, especially young white men, go Trumpish.","title":"The rise of Trump bros and why Gen Z men are shifting right"},{"text":"First they came for the T.","title":"How Nancy Mace went from LGBTQ ally to anti-trans culture warrior"},{"text":"Your area must have ample competition among ISPs for that to be true.","title":"Trump's FCC pick, Brendan Carr, wrote Project 2025's chapter on the agency.
