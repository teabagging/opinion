This proposal is designed to incentivize peace and de-incentivize violence with clear consequences aimed at groups who choose aggression, not to punish an entire population indiscriminately. Under this model, Palestinians would have full control over their choicesconsistent nonviolence leads to land gains, while attacks, whether isolated or orchestrated, would result in well-defined repercussions. This isnt collective punishment; its establishing conditions for peace through responsibility and accountability.Suggesting that Israels government already practices this is disingenuous. The proposed policy here is transparent, with predetermined schedules and maps, making outcomes predictable and, ideally, avoidable. Its designed to avoid the ad-hoc responses that fuel cycles of resentment. Israel has a right to defend itself, and a clear framework discourages violence while creating a pathway to peaceful coexistence.

The Israeli government is pretty much already carrying out your \\"annexation for violence\\" policy and it's just as immoral in reality as in your theoretical scenario.

Terror attacks happen almost daily in the West Bank against settlers and chances they will stop with any policy is abysmal, as there will always be extremists, how do you suppose Israel should respond to one? Does every stabbing attempt result in annexation? Secondly, this doesn't solve the underlying issue of why Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank so far, demographics. If Israel wanted it would have annexed it, just like it did in the Golan Heights, it just doesn't want to. An annexation of the West Bank would result in either an addition of 2.5 - 3.5 million Palestinian citizens to Israel or in de jure apartheid, both of these Israel don't want happening. Also this doesn't treat the extremism that is rampant in Palestinian society. Even should a Palestinian state be established this way, what would prevent it from immediately becoming an entity that is extremely hostile and dangerous to Israel? Every solution has to address some form of deradicalization before a Palestinian state is established. These points mainly treat the Israeli point of view, though I could think of a number of points that would also pose a problem for Palestinians.First this doesn't treat core issues such as the extant of autonomy a future Palestinian state will have, what will happen to the settlements and the issue of East Jerusalem. Secondly what about settler violence? If settlers burn a house and Palestinians retaliate does their land get annexed? Such a scenario would give settlers a \\"free pass\\" for violence and only cause further oppression to the Palestinians. I would also say that any annexation could result in heightened anger which would lead to more terror and thus more annexation and would create a dangerous cycle.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"Douche and Turd; Episode 119.","title":"Musk on Twitter: \\"Kamala is Cruel\\" () New 3 minute video on her time as Attorney General of California exposes character aspects that some may find disquieting.

The documents suggest that a government with Hamas should meet the demands of the Middle East Quartet, otherwise President Mahmoud Abbas should declare a state of emergency, which effectively would dissolve the current unity government, or the government should collapse by other means.[citation needed] Rose quotes former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief Middle East adviser David Wurmser, accusing the Bush administration of \\"engaging in a dirty war in an effort to provide a corrupt dictatorship [led by Abbas] with victory\\". He believes that Hamas had no intention of taking Gaza until Fatah forced its hand. \\"It looks to me that what happened wasn't so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen\\"[citation needed]The wiki article does not describe the full extent of US planning for the coup, which also included weapons delivery, training, and so on.

The existing settlements are substantively different from what I am talking about. These are settlements on disputed territory in a military occupation in an ongoing conflict zone. Im talking about officially annexing territory into Israel proper, with all the same jurisdiction and rights. Im also offering an alternative path to annexation, which can be achieved by simply refraining from attacking Israeli civilians. So, even if you think my annexation proposal is the same as the existing settlements, Im offering an entirely new incentive to that dynamic.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"It's a nice idea, but I think there are two problems with it -1. Israel and Palestine's disagreements aren't only about land. In fact, some might argue that the larger disagreement is about \\"the right of return\\". Somehow the plan must incorporate this, and I don't believe the Palestinians are going to give it up anytime soon. In the end, if this framework is successful, you'd reach a situation where Palestinians have a state, but with a question most important to them unsolved - which might be a problem for this framework. I'm not entirely sure how would some of the more extreme Palestinian groups that aren't willing to give up on this right of return ever are going to react to this framework.\\n2. The world isn't going to let Israel simply annex territories and thus you get a carrot but without a stick situation. Why is that - in many countries, including some European ones, the public perception of Israel is not so good, and people are suspicious of any Israeli politician.  Moreover, the politician or decision making in these countries know that the Palestinian society isn't stable enough and could just test the framework out. They don't want Israel to grab more lands without them doing anything cause it would make them look bad, and they're afraid that this is exactly what might happen because of this framework. This is even more true for the close neighbors of Israel, Egypt and Jordan, that walk a fine line between appeasing their anti-Israeli citizens and remaining committed to the peace deals they have with Israel. So many countries aren't going to sign up to this framework to begin with. Israel can't simply annex infinite amount of lands, if other countries won't acknowledge it, it would prove to be problematic for Israel's economy, society and possibly security. Whenever it happens, Palestinians would say, that this was a lone wolf attack, and what Israel is doing is a collective punishment - which the plan kind of is - and get the support in these countries. So eventually it's not going to happen, and all sides know it. Or at the very least, it's not so much in Israel's hands even if it wanted to do it, as much as it's in the rest of the world's hands.Edit - adding another problem - There's a moral hazard where the extremist parts of Israel would try to do everything in their power to get Palestinian terror attacks and disrupt peace. Those people need to be accounted for somehow.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"If Trump loses the country will have 5 minutes to rejoice before his lapdogs start trying to prove they really won.","title":"Im Voting Harris Not Because She Deserves it But Because I Do | I deserve many of the things that Kamala Harris is proposing and we all deserve a break from Donald Trump."},{"text":"And if Israel keeps killing Palestinian civilians Palestinians will keep attacking Israel, and since Israel is stronger among the two, and as you propose to make it so they can simply annex what they wish, you are proposing a solution that entirely favors Israel while completely neglecting the desires of the Palestinians.So, answer me a question, why do Palestinians fight against Israel?","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"When she wins, she needs to get rid of Sleepy Garland and get an AG that will fully and comprehensively prosecute all those who enabled and supported Trump as they are traitors and enemies of democracy.

Hamas won.This is a bit of an oversimplification. The US sponsored Fatah (or well, a subsection of it) into trying a coup in Gaza, that then failed.https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-773669The US was now determined to remove Hamas from its role in the Palestinian Authority. To that end, Bush approved a plan to force the downfall of the unity government. In other words, a coup. The plan was devised by Rice and deputy national security adviser Elliot Abrams. It focused on the role of Mohammad Dahlan, the head of the Fatah Preventative Security Service in Gaza.Dahlan agreed to the plan on condition that his forces would be significantly strengthened with additional thousands of security personnel secretly trained and equipped with new weapons.The plot was an unofficial secret plan, and the administration could not openly request support from Congress. Instead, funding support was secured from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Training of the new forces was conducted by Egypt and Jordan.The first 500 new security personnel entered the Gaza Strip through Egypt. This event naturally gained the attention of Hamas.So too did a leak to a Jordanian newspaper of part of the draft Action Plan to Remove Hamas from the PA. In addition, comments were made by an Israeli personality on a radio program asserting that the arms from Egypt would give Abbas the ability to cope with those organizations.It did not take long for Hamas to understand what was happening. And when Dahlan left the Gaza Strip to undergo surgery on his legs, Hamas took advantage of the opportunity to preempt the Fatah plot.In June 2007, Hamas launched a surprise military attack to prevent the planned Fatah coup. Within a week of bloody fighting, all of the Fatah strongholds in Gaza were destroyed and the stores of Fatah armaments were taken. The Gaza Strip fell into the sole control of the Hamas Islamic movement which now called the territory liberated....When Hamas won and took control of Gaza Israel and Egypt began the blockade of Gaza. (why? because Hamas is actually a terrorist organization. see 4 subsequent wars and Oct 7, 2023)The blockade predated the coup.Economic consultants estimated that the closures cost the whole agricultural sector in Gaza $450,000 a day in lost revenue.[80] 25 truckloads of produce per diem through that crossing were needed to render the project viable, but only rarely were just 3 truckloads able to obtain transit at the crossing, which however functioned only sporadically, with Israel citing security concerns. It appears that on both sides corruption prevailed, such as instances of Gazans negotiating with Israeli officers at the crossing and offering bribes to get their trucks over the border.[78] By early 2006, farmers, faced with the slowness of transit, were forced to dump most of their produce at the crossing where it was eaten by goats. Ariel Sharon fell ill, a new Israeli administration eventually came to power and Wolfensohn resigned his office, after suffering from obstacles placed in his way by the U.S. administration, which was sceptical of the agreements reached on border terminals. Wolfensohn attributed this policy of hindrance to Elliott Abrams. Further complications arose from Hamas's election victory in January 2006, and the rift that emerged between Hamas and Fatah. He attributed the electoral success of Hamas to the frustration felt by Palestinians over the non-implementation of these agreements, which shattered their brief experience of normality. \\"Instead of hope, the Palestinians saw that they were put back in prison,\\" he concluded.[78] The project was shut down in April 2006 when money ran out to pay the agricultural workers.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_the_Gaza_StripBattle of Gaza was 2007, FYI.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"Yes it does","title":"Obama Tears Into Trump in North Carolina, Which Has Eluded Democrats"},{"text":"Wow, ethylene vinyl acetate is literally a plastic lol.

Now do I think that any laws stating that 5 is the maximum based on research is wrong? No. however I do think in general, despite it, we should have a general agreement on the measure rather than the lines in the sand we have today. and with something as volatile as this is, More studies should be done.","title":"Retarded liberal on X thinks 18 year olds who dates 17 year olds are pedos, calls me a pedo then has a TDS meltdown"},{"text":"peace is and never has been the goalthere no solutions for peace from either side","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"https://youtu.be/-8Rpi47yFZc?si=rgQfJdSSZFsIgTgShttps://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23859/trump-jewish-voters-israel-election-2024https://youtu.be/3mPD79Tm3Zw?si=N-aUpjJrJAB4SCyU","title":"Protesters interrupt Kamala Harris' Michigan rally: 'No more Gaza war!'"},{"text":"If Israel were to support violent elements within Palestine as a strategy for annexation, it would be disastrousThis is what they have been doing for years, you do realise that, right?","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"I dont deny that.

There are no technological barriers to building enough housing for all. We know how to build homes; weve done it before. But I fear liberals have forgotten that their desire for a more welcoming, inclusive world rests on societys ability to prove there is enough to go around. We cannot rely on altruism to redistribute resources to the most needy, to provide more for the poor, to pursue egalitarian principles. We live in a fallen world. People need more than abstract ideals; they need to feel secure.Tensions rose during the pandemic, as home-price growth shocked expensive suburbs and sleepy towns alike. Graffiti in Boise, Idaho, telling newcomers to Go back to Cali reflected the frustrated mood of longtime residents as big-pocketed Californians moved in. But scarcity doesnt just aggravate differences; it also creates them. When I report on homelessness, I hear people argue that unhoused residents are being bused in from out of state, a myth researchers have worked tirelessly to debunkone comprehensive study showed that 90 percent of homeless people in California had lost their last housing in the Golden State. Most of the remaining 10 percent had been born there or had familial or employment ties to the state.Rhetoric like Vance and Trumps tends to resonate with people who assume that theyre the ones defending against interlopersthat the outsider will always be someone else. But history reminds us that stranger has never been a fixed concept. During the Great Depression, California passed an anti-migrant law targeted at Oklahomans and other Americans fleeing the Dust Bowl, making it a crime to knowingly assist a pauper in entering the state. How confident are you that no economic or natural disaster will strike your community? No recession? No hurricanes? No wildfires? If youd like to gamble on that, lead the way. But the best hedge against future catastrophes is investing in liberalism and growth today.Still, its not enough to simply expect better of people. Liberalism has to provide real, tangible proof that it can combat scarcity. Otherwise, people will do whats natural. Theyll do what their ancestors did, and what Trump and Vance are enticing them to do: Theyll turn against outsiders. And once theyve run out of outsiders, theyll turn against one another.","title":"Blue States Gave MAGA an Opening: How housing scarcity fuels the illiberal right"},{"text":"Wow spot on actually, good movie too","title":"Thousands of years ago, some of the biggest religions on Earth demonized the dangers of inflation and Interest, why?"},{"text":"Time and money would be better spent shutting down MSG rally right now.

There is Malthusian thinkinga fierce defense of the existing resource pool, a politics that demands ever more scapegoats and leaves everyone poorer in the long run. Then there is liberalism, which demands a growing pie. It argues that we can make more: more housing, more schools, more good jobs, enough for everyone.This wasnt always possible. Scarcity used to be the depressing fact of human existence. Malthus was looking back at an era of human history during which GDP per capita was extremely low and population growth meant strain on existing resources, eventually leading to population decline. It was a horrible, depressing cycle that pitted family against family, tribe against tribe. There really wasnt enough food to feed everyone, or enough energy to warm everyone. Rising populations meant new mouths to feed; new mouths to feed meant declining living standards for all.\\nGraphBut the Industrial Revolution changed all of that. In the late 17th and early 18th century, economies such as Englands began to escape the Malthusian trap. A burst of productivity and economic growth outpaced the growth in new people. New people werent just new mouths to feed; they were positive-sum additions to society. Even as the population grew exponentially, GDP per capita continued rising, lifting people out of poverty. People learned how to make more food with fewer resources (steam engines!), built structures that could house more people with less land (density!), and created technologies that could move lots of people around quickly (horse-drawn omnibuses on rails!cable cars! automobiles!). In a world of soaring economic growth, population growth no longer implied self-sacrifice. Welcoming newcomers with open arms no longer required a messianic level of magnanimity. A politics based on tolerating others, even celebrating others, became possible.\\nThe political logic of tolerance works only once society is out of the scarcity trap. Anti-immigration hawks insist on zeroing in on increased short-term demand for housing because of immigration. They refuse to zoom out and see the whole picture: American economic growth is predicated on higher levels of immigration. According to the National Foundation for American Policy, International migrants were the sole source of growth in the U.S. working-age population in 2021 and 2022  A shrinking working-age population can easily lead to economic stagnation or even falling standards for a nation. Fewer people mean less innovation, fewer goods and services produced, and higher prices and shortages. Yet liberals have forgotten the central importance of fighting against scarcity, and the logic of Malthusian thinking has crept back in.","title":"Blue States Gave MAGA an Opening: How housing scarcity fuels the illiberal right"},{"text":"As a European (Belgian) I cannot even begin to understand how Trump can have so many supporters.

D. Vance have a story to sell you: Amid a scramble for housing in the United States, the real problem is the presence of immigrants.Americans cannot ignore the impact that the flood of 21 million illegal aliens has had on driving up housing costs, Trump argued at the Economic Club of New Yorks luncheon in September. Vance has made this argument even more ferventlyon X, in recent interviews, and in other venues. During the vice-presidential debate, Vance declared that 25 million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country, adding, Its why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal-alien populations under Kamala Harriss leadership.Key elements of this story are false. For one thing, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is likely about 11 million, less than half of Vances estimate. Furthermore, when the economist Ernie Tedeschi compared places that experienced a surge in foreign-born populations with places that saw large increases in housing prices for native-born Americans, he couldnt even find a simple correlation. But Trump and Vance correctly understand one thing: Making the American public believe that immigrants are drawing down limited resources is an effective way of bringing out illiberal sentiments that could fuel the GOP tickets victory.Alex Trembath and Vijaya Ramachandran: The Malthusians are backLets get a couple of things out of the way right now: Housing is scarce in big, liberal, productive cities such as San Francisco and Boston, which have generated high-paying jobs but refused to build enough housing to accommodate all the new workers. And if 25 million people suddenly vanished from the United States, pressure on home prices and rents would abate somewhat, all things being equal.But all things wouldnt be equal. The kinds of events that crush housing demandsuch as collapsing birth rates, a massive recession that wipes out many workers incomes, a virus that kills a tenth of the population, and, yes, the sudden expulsion of tens of millions of undocumented immigrantstend to have traumatic consequences, economic and otherwise.What makes arguments like Trump and Vances seem plausible is a widespread failure to think in terms of systems. In reality, immigrants are not just consumers of housing; theyre also consumers of various other products, stimulating demand for more jobs for all Americans. And, of course, immigrants are not only consumers but also producers who help build housing and contribute to technological innovation.Yet the fear of fighting over a fixed pool of resources runs deep in human thinking. In 1798s An Essay on the Principle of Population, the English economist Thomas Malthus warned that population increases would impoverish everyone: The food therefore which before supported seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress.The tendency to turn against outsiders in the face of critical shortages is not restricted to a basket of deplorables. Its in all of us. Most people see others as a threat to their resources, whether its immigrants coming for your housing, yuppies pushing up rents, other students taking slots at all the good schools, or just more people on the road, adding to congestion.A recent poll in Massachusettswhich in 2020 supported Joe Biden over Trump two to onerevealed that many people are convinced by Trump/Vance illiberalism. A plurality (47.2 percent) agreed with the statement Migrants are taking up affordable housing that should go to Americans first. Trumps rhetorical skills arent whats turning significant numbers of Massachusetts liberals against their own principles. They are witnessing scarcity conditions that have been perpetuated for decades by their states Democratic policy makers.The mismatch between job and housing creation across the wealthiest blue states caused prices to skyrocket, led some people to forgo good jobs because housing was too expensive, and strained entire communities, turning neighbor against neighbor. Unwittingly, liberals have seeded the conditions for illiberal politics to take root in some of the most progressive jurisdictions in the country.","title":"Blue States Gave MAGA an Opening: How housing scarcity fuels the illiberal right"},{"text":"Week starts on Sunday over here","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Trump wants to continue to support Israels assault on Gaza..But ok, our troops that arent even there are home?","title":"Protesters interrupt Kamala Harris' Michigan rally: 'No more Gaza war!'"},{"text":"No, I'm good man.

While Britains mandate over Palestine certainly influenced migration patterns, the roots of Zionism extend beyond any colonial ambition. Zionism emerged as a response to intense anti-Semitism in Europe and Russia, culminating in the Holocaust, which underlined the urgent need for a Jewish homeland. Jewish ties to the land of Israel have existed for thousands of years, with Jewish communities maintaining a continuous presence in the region even before large-scale immigration began.The assertion that Israels creation was a right of conquest dismisses that it was initially supported by the UN Partition Plan, which recommended a two-state solution to establish both Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. This wasnt an act of imperial expansion but a plan to resolve a conflict over self-determination for both Jews and Arabs. However, surrounding Arab nations rejected this compromise, leading to a war in which Israel defended itself. The 1948 War of Independence and subsequent conflicts resulted from existential threats to Israels survival, not imperial ambition.While Israel certainly has a strong Western alliance, this partnership grew out of strategic and ideological alignment, not colonial interests. The support for Israel from the U.S. is primarily based on mutual security interests, shared democratic values, and long-standing cultural and historical ties between the American and Jewish populations, rather than a desire to impose colonial control. Unlike Japans colonialism in Korea and China, Israels founding was about securing a homeland for an oppressed people, not extending a foreign powers control.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"She's not even hinting that she'll do that, so I don't know why you think she'll do that if she's elected","title":"Protesters interrupt Kamala Harris' Michigan rally: 'No more Gaza war!'"},{"text":"\\"I was just musing out loud...

Interest is bad because it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

Fear Allah, and give up outstanding interest if you are ?true? believers.\\nIf you do not, then beware of a war with Allah and His Messenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principalneither inflicting nor suffering harm.We have also been told about giving as much charity as possible, as it's a good deed that in the eyes of God doesn't go unpaid. The Arabs used the word majnun (possessed by the jinn) to characterize the insane. The Qur'an uses the same expression about those who take interest. Just as an insane person, unconstrained by ordinary reason, resorts to all kinds of immoderate acts, so does one who takes interest. He pursues his craze for money as if he were insane. He is heedless of the fact that interest cuts the very roots of human love, brotherhood and fellow-feeling, and undermines the welfare and happiness of human society, and that his enrichment is at the expense of the well-being of many other human beings. This is the state of his 'insanity' in this world: since a man will rise in the Hereafter in the same state in which he dies in the present world, he will be resurrected as a lunatic.Our Jewish cousins, on the other hand, have a different approach.

Zionism is a colonial ideology, they believe that a specific ethnic group has the exclusive right to a particular area and that it is their duty to claim, occupy and populate that land. They were supported by colonial powers that had a bias towards Jews because of a feeling of Judeo-Christian kinship. Since its foundation, Israel has displaced indigenous groups and replaced them with Israeli settlers, and they continue to do so to this day in the West Bank.This is colonialism, there is no other description which makes sense. Your point about conditional whiteness and the historic oppression of the Jews in Europe and America are not relevant to that point. The Sassoon's (a family of Baghdadi Jews) aligned themselves with the British colonial project in India and became a key pillar of the East India Company - China opium trade, and certainly we know that they were subject to antisemitic prejudice from contemporary sources. You  be a member of a group that is subject to discrimination and oppression in one or more contexts, and still be part of a colonial project. The history of the world is replete with examples of this.If you want to delve into the reason why the Israel-Palestine conflict is so explosive on the Euro-American imagination, I think you should consider the following points:* Israel is widely perceived (in my opinion, because it is) as the aggressor amongst younger generations. This is a really key shift in the perception of the conflict because now, with the era of smartphones and the diversity of news sources, young people have developed a radically different perspective than their parents which is leading to a significant inter-generational clash.\\n* The Israeli military machine is propped up by US aid, and amongst young people especially there is a huge amount of resent that they are inheriting a country which appears to be in decline with soaring house prices, soaring college prices, stagnating wages, worsening opportunities, etc, but that country is also paying for a country which they perceive as an aggressive colonial power to drop bombs and missiles.\\n* As a corollary of the former point, a lot of Americans are scared that they will be dragged into another war into the Middle East, potentially one that would be far worse than the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. American attitudes towards war has shifted substantially since 2000, for a lot of these young people, they're worried that Israel is deliberately picking a fight with Iran to force the US to commit troops in the region.\\n* There's a lot of anger at the hypocrisy of the Israeli state in both Europe and America, because they insist that they are a modern democracy while appearing to be an apartheid state and appearing to be actively carrying out genocide.\\n* I also think there's a point about how the constant escalation/de-escalation is just more engaging. October 7th and the ensuring war was a huge event which pulled in everyone's intention, then there were Israeli claims that were debunked which were huge stories, Israel attacked Iranian generals, Iran responded by targeting military sites within Israel, Israel invaded Lebanon - all of these are rapid and significant changes. Compare this with Ukraine, where interest has been fading as the conflict descents into a slog of lives for inches and you can see what I mean.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"She's the right choice for small businesses: increased start-up tax deductions up to $50,000, simplified loan access and refinancing, she's going to reform and streamline federal regulations and occupational licensing processes.

Unlike South Korea or European countries, where coalition governments are more common and smaller parties hold legislative power, the U.S. operates under a first-past-the-post system, which makes third-party success almost impossible on a national scale. Leftists who split from the Democratic Party risk creating a vote divide that could unintentionally empower conservative or right-wing candidates, a phenomenon weve seen repeatedly in American politics with third-party candidates affecting outcomes in tightly contested races.Furthermore, the tactical voting model used in places like the UK and France doesnt translate well to the U.S. The U.K. parliamentary system allows for specific districts to elect MPs, so small leftist parties can coordinate effectively. However, in the U.S., where elections are winner-take-all on a state-by-state basis in presidential races and most legislative districts, vote splitting has historically helped Republicans, not leftist causes.While raising awareness of socialist and leftist policies is essential, pushing for those ideas within the Democratic Party has already yielded progress on issues like universal healthcare, labor rights, and climate policy. Leaders like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have shown that leftist policies can gain traction within the Democratic framework, pulling the partys platform leftward. Building awareness from within a major party offers a more realistic path for change than starting a new party in a system fundamentally resistant to multi-party politics.","title":"CMV: Leftists in the US should form their own political party instead of joining the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Wouldn't bone magic be a magic?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It would certainly be something worth celebrating","title":"Can Colin Allred pull off a victory against Ted Cruz in Texas?

The vast majority are Ashkenazi and Ethiopian Jews in the US are negligible (and very small in Israel, less than 2% and also victims of sterilization campaigns)All of these are people (except &lt;2% of Israel, Ethiopians) considered white (on a us census), European, Middle Eastern, North African. They're off white at most. White as a concept wasn't really conceived in the 19th century. At least it wasn't the exact same as it is today, and also white was less important than smaller divisions of ethnicity, and religion. The idea of White as we know it is largely a post-ww2 conception. For example you can look to ethnic violence of the second KKK against Irish, Italians, Jews others, etc. Okay I'm getting further down your thread. You think anti-whiteness is deserved? Israelis are considered colonizers because they're colonizing. Full on textbook colonizing. And I'm not even talking about core Israel which post colonized in the 20th century I mean that there are currently Israeli settlers that are colonizing current Palestinian land in the West bank, and you can find plenty of references to this, mainstream sources, and maps over time.

If abortion had been legal when my mother became pregnant I wouldn't be here, instead I was adopted as were my three sisters.  We have all had children and there wouldn't be generations of people if that had happened.  Nor would the couples who adopted us be able to have children that they wanted and couldn't have themselves. The way social security is supposed to work is that the young pay into it and the money goes to the elderly. When the these people get old there are young people coming up and paying into it.  I recently read an article that there aren't enough babies being born to sustain our society.  You need a 2.7 growth rate and we are at a 1. something. There are over 85,000 babies born alive during abortions.  And there are organizations of these babies who are now adults that speak out against abortion.  I will be glad to provide you with this information and even more but I can't put all the links here,  I was once a clump of cells as were my two children.  It is the process of life, it is a stage in the life of a human being. I have read articles from nurses who have worked at abortion clinics, who have walked out because they often use ultra sound during abortions and they see the babies fight to live.  Trying to move away from the instruments.  Lastly there are organizations that take donations to give pregnant women ultra sounds before abortions because many times when the woman see's the baby she will refuse the abortion.  At three months of pregnancy there is a baby formed.  At two months \\"with developing facial features like a small nose, mouth, and ear buds, while its limbs are just tiny buds starting to form, and its major organs are beginning to develop\\"","title":"CMV: Im pro-abortion.

If you want to really listen to valid, unbiased opinions on the topic you have to look at what places without a horse in the race are saying.So here goes, I'm going to try and lay it out straight.The claims that everyone who is pro-palestine is anti-Semitic is preposterous, of course there are bad apples who are jumping on the bandwagon with horrible views, but for the most part, at least from the view we have here in Ireland, this may be a religious war but it is not under any circumstances a religious debate.\\nThis debate is about whether you find it acceptable for a nuclear level state backed by the world's largest superpower to hold an entire population of people accountable for the actions of a terrorist cell. The October 7th attack was an atrocity committed by Hamas, that is for certain, but do 15000 children deserve to die because of it? I don't think anyone can claim that answering 'no' to that question is anti-Semitic, and yet the rhetoric peddled in the US would have you believe that those two things are one in the same. This is the crazy power of propaganda, I'm not immune to it, you're not, no one is, but we need to try and analyze the brazen truth where it is available and make our decision based off that. The reality is that Israel is purposefully committing genocide in the Gaza strip, the UN and several NGO's have all confirmed that Israel IS targeting children and civilian population they ARE threatening neutral peacekeepers like the UN and they ARE attacking aid workers, none of this is acceptable no matter what religion anyone involved is.The thing is, I can't speak to what perhaps is driving the discussion over in the US, but I think it's relevance in every other country around the globe should begin to give you some insight that perhaps your bubble is too small and you're not looking at the bigger picture. I know that Israel is not perceived as a 'white' state here in Ireland and yet the topic is still relevant. And the idea of 'anti-white' politics is entirely and American fabrication, you cannot possibly say that entire movement is subconsciously about something that no one in that movement ever speaks about. The only reason anyone would ever do that is in order to discount the points of that movement without actually addressing them.I am not going to discuss with you why all the other ongoing conflicts are not being considered with the same relevancy because then we are talking more about the failures of modern media than about the israel-palestine conflict and that's just deflection. The reason the Israel Palestine conflict is relevant is because Israel is not just a Jewish state, it is a nuclear level, US-funded, cutting edge technology military state who is being led by a far-right zealot and committing a genocide on an oppressed people.The Palestinian people have had support from Ireland for a long time actually, our support for their cause outdates this current conflict because our history and theirs has some correlation. That has nothing to do with 'anti-white' or anti semitism or anything else you can try to use to shroud the reality.The tactic of trying to splinter an opposition group into smaller subsections and creating negative labels for those subsections is just a tactic used when a group no longer have a way to justify their actions and need to discount the oppositions argument without actually addressing it.The reality is you have two sides to this debate, you have the people who believe that Israel have a right to kill thousands of innocent's in order to take retribution for the actions of a terrorist group and then you have the side who cannot condone the slaughter of women and children, the bombings of hospitals and schools, the complete oppression of a small group of by people by what is essentially a military state.There is nothing to do with religion in either of those positions, there is nothing to do with race, these are not relevant to the topic, people are people and it's fairly simple it just boils down to killing people=bad. As soon as we begin as a society to realize that killing people=bad I hope that things might actually start to get better, but if we keep dancing around that fact by saying it's somehow anti semitic or anti-white, we are never going to get anywhere","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"Oh gosh, middle schoolers!

So your premise that WFH is always bad is incorrect. I think what you're getting at is that social interaction in general is good for humans. I agree. But for some of us, it's healthier to have a limited pool of trusted people rather than a large pool of unknowns. Unless you're a manager, you don't get to pick who you work with. In my private life, I have almost complete control over who I decide to spend time with. *I* pick my friends. I don't pick my family, but *I* get to decide when to venture into interactions with them. For the ones I dislike, it's basically limited to the major holidays. In my experience, true friends at work are few and far between whereas the people who drive me crazy are *so* abundant. I'd much rather limit my interaction with the crazymakers to a couple hours a week (if even) in focused virtual meetings. And when the meeting is over, I immediately go back to my peace and quiet. There's no chit chats, no gossip, no endless complaining. Sure, if I don't venture outside my bubble then I won't meet anyone new who could be a friend. That's true, but (as they say) I'd have to kiss a lot of frogs before I find my prince-bff. Is all that time and effort necessary when I'm already content? I don't think so. For younger folks, I get it that it's hard to make friends. That's true. But work is only one potential venue where friends can be found. And really, it's not even a great one because it's a gamble that you'll have much in common with your coworkers. But if you have a hobby or religious community, or place where you volunteer, the odds are much better. This just doesn't happen and people end up chronically lonely and deprived of social interaction.You do have to actually venture out in-person. It's true that it just won't happen otherwise. Social media or online gaming just doesn't cut it. But once you've found them then I find it much more rewarding to concentrate on developing those deeper relationships than have a rotating roster of superficial acquaintances at work. Seriously. I worked in person for over 15 years. Do you know how many people I met who I would genuinely call my friends? Three. Want to know how many people I met at work who I'd rather stab myself in the eyes with an ice pick than hang out with in my spare time? Dozens. And the rest (hundreds) simply aren't  memorable enough to fall into either category. One other thing I'll mention is that one lady I managed remotely during COVID made another excellent point about the virtues of WFH. She was a black Hispanic somewhat overweight woman from Puerto Rico who also had ADHD and Autism. In person work for her was riddled with daily (sometimes hourly) microagressions toward one or more of her minority statuses. Sometimes, there was overt aggression too. WFH for her made her feel like a normal human being who was there just to do a job. Both her mental health and productivity skyrocketed. She flourished in the WFH environment. I know because I did her performance evaluations. She's the one who actually got me thinking about it and I realized that I was in the same boat but with fewer minority categories. The effect it had on me was more subtle, but it was all still enough to cause unnecessary stress. So why force people to go to work to get this low quality social interaction with the added risk of microagressions or outright hostility? Just because you like it, that doesn't mean everyone does. In fact, for many of us, WFH is a blessing. Why is it wrong to let people choose what's best for themselves?","title":"CMV: WFH is ultimately toxic for society and disastrous for mental health."},{"text":"It took four weeks for my mail in ballot to be received from overseas.

The episode is called \\"The unpopular vote\\".Some of the interesting things:The electoral college was a compromise to give small states more power so they would want to join the United States. Also, slave states were afraid of losing power to non-slave states. In a popular vote system, only the number of voters matter. So if 100,000 people in Pennsylvania vote, and only 50,000 people in Georgia vote (because the other 50,000 people are slaves and can't vote), then Pennsylvania has twice the power of Georgia. The electoral college allowed Georgia to count slaves as part of their electoral power. This was done by the 3/5ths compromise because the North thought it was unfair that non-voting slaves somehow added to the political power of Georgia's vote.So, 50,000 voters in Georgia actually had the power of 80,000 voters (50,000 white people and 3/5ths of the 50,000 slaves).Definitely a fucked up system. It literally gave slaveowners more political power based on the number of people they enslaved. Also, in the original system, all states have their electoral votes proportionately. So if a state had 5 electoral votes, and 60% of the population voted for a candidate, they'd get 3 of the 5 electoral votes. But it wasn't required that states do that. But during one of the early presidential campaigns, one state wanted their presidential candidate to get ALL of their electoral votes, so the state legislature changed their local law to give all electoral votes to one candidate (because they knew that he would win the majority of votes and they wanted to increase the electoral votes for him). Other states followed suit. And then almost every state turned themselves into \\"winner take all\\" states. It's so stupid. The only reason \\"swing states\\" exist is because states changed from a \\"proportional vote\\" system to a \\"winner takes all\\" system.","title":"CMV: The US presidential election system is a joke"},{"text":"Stop funding genocideStop campaigning with war criminals Actual progressive policies Campaign on what SHE brings to the country instead of what Donald Trump would bring.This would all be a great start.

Only the Presidential election has it now, and U.S. Senators used to be appointed before they changed it to popular vote elections. So it keeps becoming a democracy more and more. Having the president as the only office that doesn't guarantee the popular vote winner the presidency while also being the only office at the Federal level that requires a direct election to begin with, isn't an argument that the U.S. isn't a democracy, it's an argument against the EC. So p!ss off with your sh!te argument and accept that the U.S. is a democracy that needs an update on the Presidential level. If you want your Federal level election, then look at cabinet members who have to be approved by a majority of U.S. Senators, so a.k.a. be elected by popular vote. Only instead of the entire country voting on every cabinet member or judge appointment, the Senate does it in the name of the people who elected them. That is still a democray, just not a direct one as the people elect others to cast votes in their name.

Compared to other types of elites, I guess coastal elites would just be more likely to be socially liberal and economically globalist.3: Ok Id argue theres a bit of truth in neoliberals being coastal elites, since like coastal elites, this subs users tend to be college educated, work in tech (or some other field like finance that has benefited from globalization), live on one of the coasts, be around upper middle class (either from parents or own income), be multicultural/support multiculturalism, supportive of internationalism, and be socially liberal on things like LGBTQ+ rights.","title":"Neoliberalism and the American 'Coastal Elite'"},{"text":"The prefer the term USSS.

Outside of that, we are consistently in the top 3 nationwide for education standards, our medical system is high tier (but is no Dartmouth, etc), our social views largely fit much more liberal than not on a rather surprisingly large number of topics that even a lot of Republicans up here can agree on (for the most part). Hell, there's one Republican in particular that keeps getting voted in as Governor term after term after term.It's because he went with the will of the people on practically everything that showed up on his desk. He quite staunchly defended the rights that all women in our state, inherently, have over their own body and went into warp fucking speed after roe fell in helping to get legislature passed asap to shield it at the state level. He saw fit to legalize weed (and to take a measured approach about opening up to legislature for recreational sales to which he also passed after legalization of the plant, prior) and he went through all the right channels to rapid-fire mail-out treasury checks during Covid's reign when Trump's administration stalled on quite a bit of it and was slow walking some crucial things. Even he (our Republican Governor) said \\"Nope, our citizens get their stimulus now\\". So, he stayed up all hours of the night for a good 3-4 weeks straight, every night signing out those checks (he signed them as \\"Micky Mouse\\" and \\"Donald Duck\\").I don't even vote Red, but the only 2 times I ever did in my entire life were the 2 terms he (our Governor - Phil Scott) sought out, after the first homerun term he had. I felt like \\"*well damn*, yaknow? he walked the walk and he did all the right things I mean, that's a crazy record right there of great things all in a row\\".If even our **Republicans** are doing what's right on so many of these issues, I mean...yeah that's pretty damn miraculous in this nations current political climate. Hell, my state *also* comes equipped with a Bernie Sanders, a Becca Balint, Ben &amp; Jerry's, no billboards (by law. our scenery is **gorgeous**) and *crazy* good weed. This isn't a perfect place by any means, it's just *holy SHIT there are SO many states that are going down the absolute instant-insanity path.* Of course, in that case, Vermont is going to look like it comes from some fantasy book.

They have put this weaponry and wealth in the service of a government that cannot see a path to the ethnostate it desires without killing just a *whole* lot of Arabs.  That's related to Judaism, I guess, but only slightly!  If we had Jews but did not have a warlike Israel slaughtering opponents unequal to the attack (40:1 casualty ratio in this latest tiff!), no problem.  In armed conflict, resources are what matters (and resources are also why people go on about white this and white that so much - if the world's wealthy were some other color, we'd be dealing with **them** oppressing us; the condition is inherent to resource inequality); white skin can't *physically* protect you, it is merely *concomitant* with material privilege.So it's sort of irrelevant how you want to split the \\"Jews are white\\" hair; fact is, *Israelis* answer thrown rocks with smartbombs.  That's material privilege!  Apples to apples, with fewer steps and less wharglebargling about identity.  I don't want to live in a world where the weak suffer what they must and the strong do as they will, or whatever.  I want to live in a world in which the just rule!  So, whiteness is orthogonal to the reasons I criticize Israel's recent policy, and that's true for leftists generally - even the occasional Israeli comrade!So then - no matter who's white or not: Smartbombs for rocks when your position is already dominant against civilians inside your borders is not a war, it's 44,000 murders standing on top of each other in a trenchcoat.Listen, if you internalize nothing else I say, take whatever knowledge you have of history and see if this squares: Very dominant parties have a relatively easy path to ending wars, typically, if they want.  When wars don't end, it's because one party isn't dominant enough or because the winners *don't see an end as being presently in their interests*.  And Israel is incredibly dominant in its region.  Do you see what's between the lines, there?

Shit polls, news networks softballing Trump, etc etc. Maybe this is RFK-pilled conspiracy brained, but I just don't trust the numbers or opinion pieces or whatever the hell else. Watching CNN talking heads asking the most asinine questions, seeing WaPo get fucked by Bezos, the press is just best written off at this point imo. I do trust Kamala's ground game. Her rally sizes, her campaign records, her public speaking, her navigation of the media, the broad coalition of support and surrogates she's gathered even in GOP districts/cities/states. I've been watching/reading testimonies of people going out to early voting and seeing huge lines, wait times, etc. I watched a woman, a lifelong Republican, talk about why she voted for Harris and said that many other Republican women will vote for her too. Compare all that to Trump ditching interviews, hardly campaigning, bombing the debate, and showing up late to rallies.

Yeah Trump has BIG PROBLEMS with that one.He has done NOTHING AT ALL to win any groups that aren't MAGA faithful to his side this election, if anything he has run a campaign that alienates EVERYONE not fully devoted to him and him alone. He offers nothing to anyone except his own minions, himself, and some of the newer money billionaire class that love the idea of a United States President they can buy.Every single action Trump has taken since he rode down that elevator has peeled off vote after vote after vote. MMW, there is no damn way he's winning this thing. I can't do the math-math, but I can do the \\"you forgot to actually appeal to diverse groups of voters\\" math, and it's coming up NOT JUST NO BUT HELL NO for his team.In fact I believe that internal information has already informed him and his people of that, which is why he's focusing all of his energy in spreading rumors of his popularity and insisting that everyone who is against him/involved in \\"stealing\\" the election from him this time will be rounded up and imprisoned.Because they know they're going to lose so they want to lay the groundwork for a civil disturbance and hope for either an entire overthrow of the United States Government by coup. or for the United States to fraction into the Divided States so that they can have the power in SOME of the territories rather than none.That might seem insane but keep in mind Trump and his sponsers have NOTHING TO LOSE, they know they're fcked if things don't work out so they're at the hey let's go for it why not stage.And neither of those things will work, the man was talking about his McDonald's day and how pleased he was that servers don't scoop scorching hot fries into the cartons WITH THEIR HANDS.That's....just, no. They are very incompetent and out of touch people, with bizarre Authoritarian fantasies, We The People are just pawns on the gameboard of Life as far as they're concerned, and they don't seem to understand that the only actual power they have is the *power that we give them.*So I am also nervous and can't wait to hear Harris declared the winner, and she WILL be, because there's no possible way that Trump pulls anything close to the numbers he would actually need for a win.Not with all the deliberate alienating of everyone and everything that doesn't worship him like a lesser God.

If leftists in solid blue or red states start to vote third-party then it shows to the Democratic Party that the once-safe bloc is becoming less and less safe, they're gonna have to do some policy changing.And there is historical precedent in the US to this working.

However, Southern right-wing racists voted for George Wallace of the American Independent Party, a staunch segregationist as a result of Nixon's moderate platform, giving him 13.5% of the national popular vote.Nixon still won that election, but it showed that the bloc of \\"Southern right-wing racists\\" wasn't safe, which led the Republican Party to intensifying the \\"Southern Strategy\\", a strategy of using dogwhistles to win over Southern racists while not alienating non-racists.","title":"CMV: Leftists in the US should form their own political party instead of joining the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Sad","title":"In 2016 I was 6 months too young to vote, in 2020 I voted Biden, in 2024 Im not making the same mistake again"},{"text":"Just going out on a limb, probably because of the terrible candidates?

However, a quick Wikipedia search showed that the two main parties hold 92.7% of National Assembly seats. Many of the other parties are conservative or centrist. There are only a handful of seats held by left-wing parties. My understanding is that aspects of Korean politics have also been going back in a more conservative direction. It's not clear to me how South Korea points the way toward leftist success. In fact, democracies around the globe have seen conservative nationalists gain ground. The trends in the US and South Korea tend to be shared by many other countries, including France and the UK.Since you mentioned France and the UK, I would argue that the success of tactical voting shows that US leftists should embrace the Democratic Party, instead of splintering off to vote for third parties that never gain seats. Instead, they should seek to support progressives in Democratic Party primaries and move the party's politics to the left, which is basically what has happened. If you look at the independent and third party candidates that have done well in the US, they're basically all centrists. Jesse Ventura in Minnesota. Ross Perot in the 90s. Angus King (more left of center) in Maine. Various independents in Alaska. A moderate independent candidate has made Nebraska a close Senate race. Meanwhile, the Green Party never wins important races. Robert F Kennedy Jr was polling far better than Jill Stein (Green Party) was before she dropped out. They tend to pull votes away from Democratic candidates, allowing Republicans to win.The big exception to all this is Bernie Sanders, who had to lose several races in Vermont, one of the most liberal parts of the country with a small population that makes retail politics possible. He is a clear example of a far-left independent winning, and even he has embraced the Democratic Party in recent years, going so far as to run as a Democrat for president twice. AOC is aligned with some Democratic Socialists, but she ran as a Democrat and won, and has become a key player in Democratic politics. She strongly endorsed Biden and she's doing an event with Tim Walz. Successful leftists in America ally with the Democratic Party.

The former first lady described the assault on abortion rights as the harbinger of dangerous limitations on healthcare for women. Some men may be tempted to vote for Trump because of their anger at the slow pace of progress, Obama said, but your rage does not exist in a vacuum. If we dont get this election right, your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women will become collateral damage to your rage, Obama said. So are you as men prepared to look into the eyes of the women and children you love and tell them you supported this assault on our safety? The rally in Kalamazoo was Obamas first appearance on the campaign trail since she spoke at the Democratic National Convention over the summer, and her remarks were searing and passionate in their support of Harris. By every measure, she has demonstrated that shes ready, the former first lady said. The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment? Obama added, Do not buy into the lies that we do not know who Kamala is or what she stands for. This is somebody who understands you, all of you. Although Obama has been a reluctant campaigner over the years, she showed no hesitation on Saturday as her speech stretched from the political to the personal. Obama said she fears for the country and struggles to understand why the presidential race remains close. I lay awake at night wondering, What in the world is going on? she said. Her voice vibrating with emotion, Obama talked about the struggle for women to understand and care for their own bodies, whether its their menstrual cycles or menopause. And she spoke about the dangers of childbirth, when a split-second decision can mean the difference between life and death for a mother and her baby. I am asking yall from the core of my being to take our lives seriously, Obama pleaded. Harris took the stage after Obama and promised the crowd that she would keep their interests in mind  unlike Trump, who she accused of only being interested in himself. There is a yearning in our country for a president who sees the people, not just looking in the mirror all the time, but sees the people, who gets you and who will fight for you, she said. After the rally, Harris went to Trak Houz Bar &amp; Grill with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, where they drank a locally brewed beer. I want to have whatever shes having, Harris said.","title":"'Take our lives seriously,' Michelle Obama pleads as she rallies for Kamala Harris in Michigan"},{"text":"Another actor that I will no longer watch.

Despite making up more than half the population, women have historically been understudied and underrepresented in health research. Since its launch in November 2023, the Initiative has made significant investments to close gaps in research on womens healthfrom menopause-related conditions to endometriosis to auto-immune conditions to cardiovascular diseaseso that we can improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, and differently.Today [October 23rd] in Las Vegas, Nevada, the First Lady will announce $110 million in awards from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to accelerate transformative research and development in womens health. President Biden established ARPA-H, a new research and development funding agency, with bipartisan Congressional support to generate high-impact biomedical and health breakthroughs. In February 2024, the First Lady launched ARPA-Hs Sprint for Womens Health, the first major deliverable of the White House Initiative on Womens Health Research. Over the last 10 months, ARPA-H received an unprecedented response to this call for solutions for womens health, with over 1,700 submissions across 45 states and D.C. as well as 34 countries.In less than a year, the White House Initiative on Womens Health Research has galvanized nearly a billion dollars in funding for womens health research, including the First Ladys recent announcement of $500 million from the U.S. Department of Defense and $200 million from the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, in his State of the Union address, President Biden called on Congress to make a bold, transformative investment of $12 billion in new funding for womens health research. President Biden also signed a first-of-its-kind Executive Order on Advancing Womens Health Research and Innovation, directing the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever taken to expand and improve research on womens health. Through the Initiative, federal agencies have committed to taking over 100 actions to prioritize investments in womens health research and integrate womens health across the federal research portfolio.*Accelerating Progress in Womens Health Research*Todays ARPA-H awardees will spur innovation and advance high-impact, novel approaches to diseases and conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, and differently. Todays awardees are working across a range of womens health issuesfrom pursuing new ways to prevent, detect, and treat cardiovascular conditions, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, neurological diseases, and pain in women to developing next-generation approaches to menopause, migraines, obstetrics, and gynecological care.One-quarter of todays awardees are pursuing launchpad projects, meaning those projects have the potential for commercialization within two years. The remaining awardees are pursuing spark projects that are in the early stage of research. ARPA-Hs support for these projects will help ensure that women and their health care providers can soon benefit from the research investments being made today.The $110 million in ARPA-H awards announced today across 23 teams fund bold and transformative womens health solutions, including:* Aspira Womens Health Inc. of Shelton, Connecticut will receive $10 million to create a first-of-its-kind definitive, non-invasive blood test to diagnose endometriosis. Endometriosis is a debilitating condition that affects about 1 in 10 women and often takes years and surgery to be diagnosed. Aspira Womens Health Inc. aims to reduce the time it takes to diagnose endometriosis from years to days while helping health care providers identify the most appropriate treatment option for each womans needs.\\n* Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts will receive $9.1 million to improve our ability to assess brain disorders in women through a novel non-invasive MRI imaging biomarker. Even though conditions such as Alzheimers disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis disproportionately affect women, there are significant gaps in our knowledge about how to prevent, detect, and treat these conditions in women. By developing a novel and non-invasive MRI technology to measure a specific brain protein, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. will advance our understanding of, and improve treatments for, brain disorders in women.\\n* Childrens Research Institute of Washington, DCthrough its research arm on familieswill receive $8.1 million to develop a novel way to assess chronic pain in women. Women experience pain differently than men which can lead health care providers to underestimate and undertreat this pain, resulting in prolonged suffering, delayed diagnosis and treatment, and a reluctance to seek medical care. Despite this need, there is currently no objective, quantitative indicator of chronic pain in women. Childrens Research Institute aims to fill this gap by studying how a womans eyes react to external stimulation, which is directly related to how she perceives pain.\\n* Gravidas Diagnostics, Inc. of Los Angeles, California will receive $3 million to create a first-of-its-kind at-home test to revolutionize our ability to detect early preeclampsia, a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. By making it easier to identify preeclampsia quickly, Gravidas Diagnostics Inc.s new low-cost fingerstick test would help women and their doctors get the information they need sooner to reduce pregnancy-related complications and improve maternal and child health.\\n* The University of Iowa will receive $10 million to revolutionize the treatment for late-stage and metastatic ovarian cancer by using personalized nanoparticles to boost a womans immune system. More than half of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed only after the cancer has metastasized, making it harder to treat and reducing survival rates. Leveraging nanotechnology, the University of Iowa will engineer personalized nanoparticles to use a womans own immune system to attack multiple cancers and help more women get the treatment they need to live longer.\\n* The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) will receive $3 million to improve our ability to treat migraines in women. Women are more likely than men to suffer from migraines, which can be extremely debilitating. UNC-Chapel Hill will study the lymphatic system to better understand why women are more susceptible to migraines than menwith the goal of treating migraines with new drugs specifically targeting the brain lymphatics and developing personalized treatments to reduce womens debilitating migraines.Full list is available at the end of the press release.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Announces $110 Million in Awards from ARPA-Hs Sprint for Womens Health to Accelerate New Discoveries and Innovation"},{"text":"You literally just explained why the US is not a functional democracy.

It's textbook rent seeking behavior, but nobody calls it that because they have all been convinced that \\"rent seeking\\" refers only to landlords. They're a problem too and we should probably get rid of them, but they aren't the biggest culprit.For anyone who just can't comprehend it, comprehend this approximation of how it goes. When you take out a line of credit, lets say $10,000 @ 10% interest for one year, most people think the bank coughs up $10,000 of its own money and then they make $1,000 on it to cover their risk. This isn't really what actually happens. Instead what is happening is a little more like you take out your $10,000 loan, they use $1,000 of their money and then the rest is created out of thin air by the Fed. This ostensibly means that the bank isn't actually making 10% on their money, they're making 100% of it AND the central bank is making an additional 2-5% on top of that by stealing an equal amount of value from every dollar in existence and selling it back to us. This is where the deficit comes from in large part, the government buying money from the fed.It's literally a pyramid scheme and the entire notion was cooked up by a bunch rich bankers on Jekyll Island when they conceived of the Fed system.

The popular winner of the state is given to the EC members of that state, who would have to vote on the national EC on behalf of the population.Each state has a certain amount of EC reps which may or may not be proportional to its population. At minimum, this is always 2.To win, a candidate needs to win a majority of EC representatives, I think more than half of 538. Even if the candidate wins a majority nationally, if they dont have more than the required number in the EC, they wont be president.Furthermore, a lot of states are firmly historically entrenched in their position as blue/red.

Some states are swing, and thats where the candidates usually focus on.To change the system requires an initiative to change from those who benefit from it the most, so its unlikely to happen.Footnote  Im not a US citizen and this was based on a chat with ChatGPT as I also wondered why the US system is so weird.","title":"CMV: Leftists in the US should form their own political party instead of joining the Democratic Party."},{"text":"I've seen that joke done like the Aristocrats, with people competing to see just how fucked up a version of the joke they could come up with.One of those jokes where the punchline isn't as important as how you get there.","title":"me: I voted 3rd party liberals:"},{"text":"Prediction: no one reads the article.","title":"Why do Americans hate their own democracy?"},{"text":"And even thought his business decisions aren't news, they reported it as such, thus endorsing Harris","title":"Have the elites turned on Kamala?"},{"text":"You can explain that Harris has been advocating for a simple solution on housing: work with the private sector to build more housing units.

However, to maximise your own utility, you should vote for the candidate most likely to win who shares similar views to your own.To carry on further however, the 'better' approach (and I use the term loosely) for leftists would be to 'do a MAGA\\" and take over the Democrat party, thus maintaining the two party split.","title":"CMV: Leftists in the US should form their own political party instead of joining the Democratic Party."},{"text":"It should be telling that all of these people arent endorsing Harris because theyre terrified of Trump retaliating if he wins.

The projects, led by small-and medium-businesses in communities with de-commissioned coal facilities, were selected by DOEs Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) to address critical energy supply chain vulnerabilities. Five of the projects will be in, or adjacent to, disadvantaged communities, and every project will include a community benefits plan developed to maximize economic, health, and environmental benefits in the coal communities that power our nation for generations. Each project further positions the United States to win the competition for the 21st century and strengthen our national security by building supply chains for existing and emerging technologies in America, built by American workers with American materials. The projects will leverage over $500 million in private sector investment into small- and medium-manufacturers and create over 1,900 good-paying, high quality jobs.  \\n...  \\nThe global market for clean energy and carbon reduction technologies is anticipated to reach a minimum of $23 trillion by 2030. Investing directly in the domestic manufacturing sectors small and medium businesses, which contribute to $1 trillion in gross revenue to the U.S. economy and provide more than five million jobs, rapidly builds capacity for clean energy production and maximizes the benefit to communities across the U.S. Swiftly increasing U.S. manufacturing output and deployment of clean energy technology is critical to meet our climate, jobs, and industrial competitiveness goals. By manufacturing clean energy technology domestically, the U.S. will strengthen national security and energy independence, revitalize industrial and energy communities, and mitigate the climate crisis. As demand grows for clean energy technology, the projects will help prepare the manufacturing industry for what lies ahead. The fourteen projects selected for negotiation of award focus on manufacturing products and materials that address multiple needs in the domestic clean energy supply chain. The selections will address five key supply chains C grid components, batteries, low-carbon materials, clean power generation, and energy efficiency products.  An example list of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release, full list is towards the end. Statement from White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi:Under President Biden and Vice President Harriss leadership, we are leading an unprecedented expansion of American energy production, a manufacturing renaissance, and the essential work of rebuilding our middle class. This is especially true in former coal communities, which are mounting a clean energy comeback by harnessing the urgent climate challenge in front of us and the clean energy solutions we invented here in America, said White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. These investments from the Biden-Harris Administration C catalyzing even more in private sector investment C will lift up these energy communities by creating good-paying union jobs, enhancing our supply chains, and ensuring that the next generation of clean energy technologies are made here in America.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $430 Million to Accelerate Domestic Clean Energy Manufacturing in Former Coal Communities"},{"text":"I'll see Maine and raise you NH.","title":"In Maine Battleground, Democrat Golden Grasps to Win Over Trump Voters"},{"text":"Its a bizarre state for sure, I mean its home to Stephen King.

It's not in the first three [[Blue Lodge] degrees.The morning star is simply a metaphor for the highest ranking angel. \\"Lucifer\\" as we understand it in English today has the connection to [the] Satan through other sources, that interpreted Isaiah and understood the parallel &amp; poetry.

This oversight was engendered by a weak-kneed sympathy for those who loved expensive things, and by the feeling that the continent was so vast and valuable, and the population so thin and enterprising, that no thief, no matter how fast he stole, could more than mildly inconvenience anyone.Noah and a few like him perceived that the continent was in fact finite, and that venal office-holders, legislators in particular, could be persuaded to toss up great hunks of it for grabs, and to toss them in such a way as to have them land where Noah and his kind were standing.Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went *bang* in the noonday sun.*E pluribus unum* is surely an ironic motto to inscribe on the currency of this Utopia gone bust, for every grotesquely rich American represents property, privileges, and pleasures that have been denied the many. An even more instructive motto, in the light of history made by the Noah Rosewaters, might be: *Grab much too much, or you'll get nothing at all*.\\\\- *God Bless You, Mr Rosewater* by Kurt Vonnegut","title":"Anyone else disappointed in Warren Buffett?"},{"text":"And you'll get a progressive president who will fight to improve the lives of average Americans","title":"Americans who believe in democracy have no choice but to vote for Harris | Observer editorial"},{"text":"How do you know she was straight?

It's been going on for decades.And look, I can concede that some men in this country have been feeling increasingly isolated, and have their own societal wide issues to contend with.HOWEVER, for years, these men have been trying desperately to scapegoat women and women's rights movements, democrats, liberal social policies and the addressing of injustices.There's, ironically of course, no responsibility in this. Because the hard truth is, what some of these men are feeling, is a result of a well-oiled, long standing patriarchal society pressuring them with and imposing certain expectations on them.So this movement emerges around what is now called, the \\"manosphere\\", where some men start gravitating towards right wing voices and personalities like Jordan Peterson, and an extreme cases, people like Andrew Tate. As a result, these movements and public figures, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, end up encouraging or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, misogyny, harassment and abuse, radicalization, what some might call \\"toxic masculinity,\\" the undermining of gender equality and discrimination towards the LGBTQ community. While there are also links between some members of this movement and acts of violence. It is not a *\\"crisis of masculinity\\"* as much as it is a crisis of insecurity.So what this all boils down to is the recognition that figures like Trump, who, conflictingly, represent the aggressive, \\"alpha male\\" archetype,  the strongman persona, the old school authority figure, while being a symbol of masculinity, naturally draw these men in.But the irony of it all, is that Trump represents what they really are, because Trump is an incredibly insecure, shallow and fragile person. He's also a serial adulterer, misogynist, sexist, sexual abuser, innate child, and a WORLD class victim.And all of these things, especially Trump's persecution complex, appeals to these men. What makes it worse, is that in the eyes of these same men, Kamala Harris represents that scapegoat. She is everything they despise. She is the symbol for their resentment and their grievances.So demagogues *like* Donald Trump, JD Vance, even Elon Musk, play into this, and it's a fairly effective strategy. They can get away with blaming women, especially liberal women, Democrats, even Harris herself, for oppressing these aggrieved men, for dismantling traditional/regressive gender roles and family structures, for transforming society for the worse, for destroying \\"the nuclear family,\\" for *forcing* women to be more independent, for taking away men's privilege to be kings of their own domain, the authoritative, household breadwinner and dictator of the home and the workplace.Sometimes it's even a matter of not having the privilege anymore to be abusive, or sexually harass coworkers, cheat on their spouses without consequence, or even having to be relegated to household chores duty, which is obviously so beneath them, but these are things they probably won't say out loud...That being said, at the end of the day, what these men don't realize, is that their blame is misdirected. Again, maybe they should start with reflecting on how we got here. Maybe they should be thinking about how literally centuries of rigid, dogmatic, inequitable social structures and gender norms caused a lot of problems to begin with. After that, they should probably start directing that reflection inward, and realize that \\"masculinity\\" isn't defined by how tan your balls are, or how much testosterone you're injecting, or how confrontational and aggressive you can be, or how insecure you are about not living up to your own expectations that have been instilled in you by a broken and imposing patriarchal system.","title":"Biden says men voting for Trump making mistake"},{"text":"Congrats bro.

People on the extreme left or extreme right are not there because most people are silent. They are there for various reasons... personal experiences, social media, growing up in certain communities, etc., but they're certainly not there due to consensus.So if you have the uncanny ability (/s) to see all sides of an argument or you have a semblance of moderation with your political views, aside from setting a good example that will probably be ignored anyway, the chances of you making people less extreme by yelling your moderation from the rooftops is pretty low.I think that it's important to research issues, and if you feel strongly a certain way, engage in healthy discourse with those who are interested in that. However, I think there is a huge lack of people in the United States saying: \\"you know what, I don't know much about this, so I'm going to ask questions and listen rather than say my very ill-informed opinion.\\"We don't need more voices right now.

Between those two is a HUGE middle ground, and personally, I think a lot of people jump to conclusions in order to sound well-informed. Massive issue!I think it's more important to stay quiet, listen, and learn, than it is to yell. We can go back to that incredibly overused but still excellent Ghandi quote about being the change you wish to see in the world.

This type of loyalty often stems from whats known as identity fusion a psychological state where followers feel that their personal identity is completely intertwined with a cause or leader. This phenomenon, seen in many cult-like movements, makes followers willing to sacrifice almost anything for the group or leader, often to the detriment of their own well-being. Historically, when movements built around a singular figure, like Hitler or, in this case, Trump, start to unravel, followers can face deep psychological distress. For some, the leaders absence results in a loss of purpose or identity, leading them to double down on their beliefs and attempt to maintain the movements ideology, even if reality is shifting around them. These individuals often become die-hard loyalists, convinced that the ideals they followed are still worth fighting for, despite evidence of the movements collapse. Others experience a more traumatic disillusionment. When they realize that everything they believed in was built on falsehoods or unachievable promises, they may experience extreme cognitive dissonance. This can manifest in severe mental health crises, as they confront the emptiness of their loyalty. For some, this disillusionment leads to despair, and, historically, even suicide, as we saw in Nazi Germany. If the movement collapses without a clear successor, many individuals could feel isolated, alienated from society, and unsure of how to reconcile their identity with a world that no longer validates their beliefs. This parallel with the MAGA movement is concerning because of how deeply it has shaped the identities of many followers. When political leaders play on fears, create enemies, and cast themselves as the only solution to an existential crisis, they build not just support but dependence. Without Trump, the MAGA movement may splinter between those who attempt to cling to the rhetoric, assuming power wherever they can, and others who face profound psychological distress, leading them to extreme actions. For these individuals, creating pathways for deprogramming and support could be crucial for helping them reintegrate into society and rebuild their identities in a healthy way.","title":"Biden says men voting for Trump making mistake"},{"text":"goes right back to the Roman Empire which was arguably destroyed by usury","title":"Thousands of years ago, some of the biggest religions on Earth demonized the dangers of inflation and Interest, why?"},{"text":"Yes.

Itll take a little digging, but there are ways to make a difference without raising your voice.

Discussions with actual candidates running, followed by posting a comparison of states values and why each candidate feels that way could show neutrality (as long as your neutral with your presentation).

In the immediate aftermath of Hitler's death they seemed to go one of two ways. You had the power-hungry arseholes who more than anything tried to keep power. These ones in some sort of narcissistic delusion thought that the occupying forces would just let them keep running the show as if they'd done nothing wrong. I reckon most of the politicians that went all in on Trump will go down this route - try to keep going while pretending they didn't have a decade-long mental break.What's more concerning were the true believers, especially those in the general populace. In the wake of Hitler's death, there was a shocking number of suicides as people who were so completely brainwashed saw their world collapsing around them. When MAGA has essentially gone the Goebbels route of building up this world of \\"evil Democrats\\" and all these other enemies with Trump being the only one who can save them all, a collapsing MAGA world without Trump presents a disturbing possibility.

Despite them arguing in court that the party can pick whoever it wants and the votes in the primaries don't matter, there is a law about whose name is on the ballot and when that submission is final.  The Dems were up against a time limit.Next, it looks really bad for Dems to shove Biden aside AND Harris.  One is not legitimately capable of executing the office of the President and is a woman of color.  It would look seriously bad to their base to ditch her or for her to lose in a super quick primary.  **They couldn't stick with Biden because doing so would have suppressed every down-ballot vote for every other dem candidate.**Their next problem is someone tried to kill Trump and his \\"fight, fight, fight\\" completely won over many Americans including major influencers like Elon AND Zuckerberg, both of who control the largest SM platforms.  So the Dems used their control over the old media to shove the assassination aside and call Biden a \\"hero\\" for stepping aside, which he didn't he was booted off the ticket because he can't be POTUS, and to manufacture consensus by acting like Harris is the greatest thing since sliced bread.Next, they received a bump from changing candidates and the convention but that always goes away for either party, and the \\"undecided independent voters\\" needed to see who Harris was, the debate didn't change anything, and her avoiding the press was hurting her.  Only the base and anti-Trump crowd were sticking with her so she needed to do interviews, which...did not work out well for her either.Then the VP debate, which usually means nothing to voters, but I think this time it did.  One, people wanted to see what Vance was like since there had been multiple assassination attempts on Trump - so this guy could end up POTUS and two, without knowing who Harris is they wanted to see who this Walz guy was.  Walz did not impress people and Vance seemed to answer the question of suitability for office.Next, Harris has a huge money advantage on Trump, but her messaging hasn't been effective.  She has only been effective in locking down the educated female vote, but Trump placed some key ads during football that showed Harris talking about trans/prisoner issues and ended up being very effective in changing opinions of black and Hispanic men.  Harris's campaign is trying to use all the same messaging of \\"Trump bad\\" which isn't effective at this point.  Everyone has decided whether they like Trump as a person or not, what matters to them is who is going to be effective with policy leading the country.  As a politician there is an axis of likeability versus competency, if you completely lack one or the other, you can make up for it by being strong with the other.  Harris is unlikable, that hasn't changed since her run in 2019 and she can't look competent because of her past statements on issues the electorate does not agree with.  She has routinely avoided answering questions about those issues making her look incompetent.  Yet she couldn't come out against them because it would make the base angry and probably not turn out.  She can't tell fervent trans rights activists she doesn't support them the same way she used to because it alienates undecided independents and if she disavows they all stay home.As you said, they were screwed.  They fucked up the policy of the border which was a death sentence to anyone still in the administration.  They tried to hide Biden's health behind old media gaslighting but the debate made it clear they fucked up not doing the 25th Amendment on him before the Dem Primary.  Change those two things and there would be a huge potential for a very different election outcome.  Right now the only way Trump doesn't win is if for some reason Trump voters stay home (right now seems unlikely, barring weather or false flag) or election fraud that would make Venezuela proud, Trump will win.","title":"Have the elites turned on Kamala?"},{"text":"Thats because the only free speech platforms are X and Truth Social.

Do you really think so little of the rest of us that we are incapable of forming sufficient social attachment without it being preceded by a two hour commute? The term you're looking for with this is *paternalism*.And, frankly, from what I understand of the literature around the subject, different studies show different results and, taken as a whole, it's a mixed bag. Work-from-home alleviates some anxieties and creates some new challenges. But there is no rule that applies to every situation. What good for the goose may be good for the gander, but when it comes to people, that which elevates you may destroy me.Josh Johnson did a bit that I saw recently. The setup was a discussion with a high-anxiety friend. Everything was going wrong for the friend and they were giving an itemized account of the things that made them miserable. The punch line was that Josh Johnson's realization that his friend was describing *his* lifeand naturally he got defensive. All the things his friend found to be intolerable we things that Josh Johnson found meaningful in his own life. That which elevates me may destroy you.Work-from-home should come down to two factors: the necessity of physical presence, and the needs of the employee as *exclusively determined by the employee.* For the former, I'm talking being a mechanic, or a plumber, not a programmer or an accountant. There is a clear an obvious difference in character between jobs that require physical presence and jobs that don't, and that difference does not primarily involve a social dimension. Team sports may have an intense social aspect, but physical proximity isn't driven by that social dimension, it's driven by the need for the basketball court.But if Kenneth from HR tells you that it works better for him to work-from-home, you have to take him at face value. And the truth is, WFH my be psychologically unhealthy for Ken. It's also possible, even likely, that Ken already knows this. yet still, even if we can observe that it is unhealthy, neither you nor I have enough insightwe must assume that Ken has made a rational choice according to his criteria. It would be wrong for us to tell Ken that he's wrong, just as it would be wrong for me to tell you that you shouldn't find working in an office preferable. That is, it is wrong for me to say that your judgement of what works best *for you* must be trusted until you give me a reason to believe that your judgement is impaired. And I'm not talking about poor work performance, I'm talking about when we meet to discuss your poor performance and you're drunk. It should be obvious, however, that in such a case I'm likely not thinking about making you work at the office, I'm deciding whether or not I should fire you. perhaps, if I consider you a friend as well, I will seek to help you, and I may *suggest* that coming into the office might be part of the solution. But this is all highly personal, and cannot be taken as any indication of a state of affairs that should be held to be universally applicable.I cannot, and would try to change your feeling that work-from-home is not appropriate for you. And, as a matter of gossip, we can debate about whether it's a good idea for Ken. But it is not our place to insist that Ken drink breakroom coffee.And we sure as hell don't have a right to claim the paternal beneficence of is *doing it for his own good*.","title":"CMV: WFH is ultimately toxic for society and disastrous for mental health."},{"text":"You are not sending your best.","title":"Kamala Harris is literally everywhere right now.

They don't get along with co-workers and just sit in their cubicle alone for 8 hours. Or worse, there is a toxic work enviroment. I don't think it's good for your mental health to be exposed to bullying, shouting, manipulative behavior for 8 hours a day. There are literally people who cry before or during work because the stress is too much.  \\nWork-Life balance is just out of wack in many places right now. The issue of not getting enough social life outside of work is because most people are overworked. Yes, if you work 50-60 hours a week from home there is not much time to go out. But make the 4 day, 32 hours work week the norm and suddenly people would have enough time for a social life outside of work.  \\nWFH doesn't mean you need to work from home. There are plenty of co-working spaces where the sameish people go to everyday to do their work. These can range from proper offices to just coffeeshops.

Personally I hang out with some of my colleagues outside work from time to time and socialize more than I had prior.   \\nI save \\\\~2 hours a day on commuting, with this free time I clean the house/do house stuff and no longer have to do any of this on the weekend freeing me up to participate in my local community in a volunteer group I enjoy on Saturdays. Below I go through some of your points with my own anecdotes   \\nHumans are inherently social creaturesWe sure are and thanks to working from home I get an extra \\\\~2 hours a day to spend chilling with my partner, thanks to not having a commute we have more time to deal with the household which means we feel alot more freedom with our weekend time to actually go hang out with friends and contribute to a local social group we enjoy.You would be seriously concerned for this child, and not just for their academic progress, **but for their mental health.**I went to a poor public school, it was one of the most violent experiences of my life, highschool caused me physical injury and did immense damage to my mental health.   \\nThis was so bad for me that I went from being a high achieving stupid in primary/grade school to substance abuse to get through my week. My first job was an extension of this people I didn't like, violent outbursts, rampant substance abuse. Neither of these environments improved me as a person. However, my life really turned around when I stepped back and realised how toxic all of this was for me, got myself cleaned up and decided to study at a university... I studied fully remote, the only thing I did on campus was exams and the freedom to live this way helped me get out of the crippling depression I was in. You'd worry that they're not learning the necessary skills to build healthy relationships, maintain friendships, resolve conflicts, and that eventually they'll go depressed with so little human interaction.I made friends studying together online that I still have to this day.   \\nCounter to this the people I went to high school with and then my first job I haven't spoken to one of them in over a decade. However, I do believe that 100% remote roles are toxic and a net negative for society. For most of our history, we lived in tight-knit, small social groups, and you would almost never be isolated by yourself for 8 hours a day or more.Prior to office work I'd describe my work social life as borderline hostile.   \\nOpen office life was pretty anti-social, you didn't want to talk to much   \\nI have helped colleagues I met while working from home move house.   \\nI dont think there's much correlation to being in an office as there is with that office environment replacing tight-knit communities, I think the reality is you need to put in work to find and cultivate those sorts of communities, a good workplace can do some of that for you but I dont think there's anything inherent in being in an office that results in a sense of community building.","title":"CMV: WFH is ultimately toxic for society and disastrous for mental health."},{"text":"I dont think she was the favorite to win?","title":"Have the elites turned on Kamala?"},{"text":"A scary amount of leftists seem to want all republicans dead.","title":"Mayor Adams refutes Kamala Harris, says Trump is not a fascist as he urges Dems to 'dial down the temperature'"},{"text":"Is that tomorrow?

By many if not most definitions of that word, he would be lacking. But it's also true that a lot of people misunderstand what integrity is. Integrity is nothing more than moral forthrightness and fortitude. But if your moral system is fucked up, having forthrightness and fortitude in being an exemplar of that moral system means you're also fucked up. But you have a lot of integrity in being fucked up.

I recently taught an elective where the students kept bringing up remote work. So I just asked if they wanted to have a discussion and they were eager, so that night I moved some stuff around and threw some slides together.The younger students are not keen on anything more than hybrid. Partially due to having been students during COVID and flat out realizing that they would not learn as much earlier in their career. The other part being that Gen Z and Gen Alpha have the idea of working with their friends and having it as a social environment.In contrast the older students find remote work more desirous simply because we are at a different point in our lives, many of us have already moved around and can't do so cheaply or easily anymore so remote brings more opportunities, and lingering generational memory of workaholic boomers so WLB and a work-life split being important (look at who has sterile desks/offices vs a bunch of stuff from their personal lives and there is a pretty solid generational split).Plus being at mid or late career on site we wouldn't learn much simply due to having an established skillset that is more about sharpening than learning, having fewer peers, etc. I know that when I went remote a major difference was being able to leave my office door at home open (when the kids weren't home) vs having to go onsite and have it closed most of the day or in meetings with the door closed.That being said I travel just enough that its not \\"real, real\\" remote, but not enough to suck.","title":"CMV: WFH is ultimately toxic for society and disastrous for mental health."},{"text":"Yes, they are hit jobs.

We might not get the satisfaction of seeing it, sadly, but we're at the inflection point. This can't be a normal presidential term, and at least some of the cleansing needs to happen publicly so we don't let it get this way again.The big thing that was said - bigger than any Epstein list - is tariffs replacing income tax.You're going to hear how crazy and world-ending irresponsible this is, because it is world-ending - for the banking cartel. We had 0% income tax until 1913, when the Fed was 'created'. We became a wealthy nation simply by charging a reasonable tariff on our exports.Well - almost true. Due to the drawn out Civil War and it's destruction, Lincoln proposed a 3% income tax to offset those expenses. And then, get this - sooo crazy, when the expenses were paid, the income tax went back to 0%. The government didn't just keep spending and requiring more. They literally stopped the tax.So aside from that exception, no income tax. Sadly, people can be corrupted. And in 1913, the Fed was voted in. Somehow, many are under the impression that the Fed is public - part of the US itself. Funny how no one in power mentions that it's privately held by wealthy globalist bankers. Even funnier - they played the same trick on the UK! They have the same thing, but there it's called... the Crown. So clever.Anyway, the Fed almost didn't happen. There weren't enough corrupt politicians to vote it into existence, but it was close. Only a few votes away. Then, not long before the vote, something happened. A few of the 'no' votes went on a special cruise. The maiden voyage of a ship called \\"the Titanic\\". They all tragically died in the wreck and the Fed was born. And with it, the federal income tax, which has steadily grown to the point of strangulation.If Trump is true to his word and he brings tariffs back, eliminating income tax altogether, it will be much more than a little policy change. It will be the boot removed from the neck of the citizens just before they would have choked out. That would signify the death of the puppet-master oppressors who hoped to cinch the knot once and for all, letting us \\"own nothing and like it\\".","title":"Trump and Rogan comment section on YouTube,  interesting observation."},{"text":"Buffet is an old white man and doesn't care about America or us in any way.

It gives my wife and I more flexibility around the holidays as we can spend more time with family while working from, wherever. At the end of the day, WFH and hybrid policies give employees control over their work schedules rather than being treated like cattle and wasting their time on unnecessary commutes.

Instead, its about upholding the fundamental right for individuals to believe and practice freely, as long as they respect others rights. This isnt about spreading particular beliefsits about creating a society where diverse views can coexist and individuals can choose their paths without fear of persecution.Unlike secular ideologies such as white supremacy, which are based on dehumanizing and oppressing others, religions are complex, multifaceted systems that vary widely among communities. For instance, Islam encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices across different countries and sects, some of which are inclusive of LGBTQ rights, while others are more conservative. Supporting Muslims right to practice their religion doesnt mean endorsing all elements of Islamic doctrine; its about defending their right to exist without discrimination, just as we do for Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, and others.Pushing back against any ideology that is harmful sounds ideal but often results in marginalizing or stigmatizing entire communities, regardless of individual beliefs. By safeguarding freedom of religion, we allow individuals within religious communities the space to critique, question, or reform elements within their own tradition. In doing so, people can work to change specific aspects they find harmful without fear of collective persecution.Religious freedom is foundational to democratic values and supports the broader principles of free speech and personal autonomy. Without it, society risks endorsing a majority rule mentality, where dominant beliefs might suppress any dissenting or minority beliefs, which could ultimately harm any ideological diversity. Instead of rejecting religious groups wholesale, we should focus on fostering an environment where all beliefs are respected as long as they adhere to a standard of mutual respect.In this context, supporting a religious groups freedom to practice isnt about spreading that religions influence. Its about ensuring that society respects the diversity of beliefs and upholds the rights of all individuals to think freely.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"These rich fuckers are the cause of most world problems","title":"Anyone else disappointed in Warren Buffett?"},{"text":"I didnt see this but my wife did and said it was so disgusting","title":"Kamala Harris is literally everywhere right now.

This is a psychological concept known as transfer failure where progressives in the west can correctly identify the wrongs of Christian/White colonialism, but cannot use basic pattern recognition to see the exact same behaviors present in the Arabization of the MENA.

But I've also now broken down the 387k mail in ballots and I estimate a deficit of 360k deficit for Trump in GA with 2.87 million votes cast. There are 7 million GA voters in the state. Lets assume a history making 80 percent participation rate in the entire election. That means 5.6 million total votes will be cast with 2.87 million already cast. That leaves just 2.73 million votes to be cast to make up a deficit of 360K. And, I believe the EARLY voter deficit will grow for Trump (at a signficantly slower rate). So Trump could be facing a 500k plus deficit on election day with like 1.5 million voters left to vote. And remember, it's not going to skew as heavily towards Trump because many of his Republican voters will have voted early just like his campaign encouraged them to (very different from 2020). So if there's 1.5 million ballots left on election day, if 30 percent are Democrats, 50 percent are Republicans (and some vote for Harris), and the rest are independent and skew slightly towards Trump....it looks like Harris would win by a minimum of 2 percent..which doesn't SOUND Like a lot but that's 112k votes.

The same way the Holocaust is seen as the most devastating and horrific genocide, when there's been other genocides far more brutal with far more causalities, the genocide that is most taught in schools, the most memorialized, October 7 has been given the same pedestal. The only thing Israel and the West who support it didn't expect is that, this time the propaganda would work against their favour because through social media, the Palestinians suffering and being genocided have finally been able to show the true colonial, genocidal face of Israel and the blatant hypocrisy of the West, mainly USA, UK and Germany.No other country does propaganda like Israel. Sudan and Syria don't have official state Twitter and Instagram accounts to constantly push their narrative into the media. Yemen doesn't have massive lobby groups within the USA to constantly push policies to fund its wars. The reason why the conflict isn't old news is because of these reasons. 1. Israel does everything within its power to stay relevant in Western media to garner support (though like I mentioned above, this has completely backfired on them) 2. No other country is getting billions from a western power to actively commit war crimes against a population that are blocked into an area the size of North London and are completely besieged and unable to get out.Furthermore, the concept of \\"whiteness\\" is a social construct that is constantly changing. Early America didn't see Polish and Irish people as white, so your point about Jews being from Levant or Middle East or whatever is irrelevant as the social concept of \\"whiteness\\" after WW2 has largely shifted to see Jews as white. Most people know that there are black and brown Jews, however, the ones that they see on a daily basis are majority \\"White\\".","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"Welcome to the light, young brother.","title":"In 2016 I was 6 months too young to vote, in 2020 I voted Biden, in 2024 Im not making the same mistake again"},{"text":"Trash article from a trash source.Vote! ??","title":"Democrat Strategist: Progressive Moment Is  Over"},{"text":"Michelles speech was incredibly transcendent in so many ways.

(Implemented to appease the local Arabs after the revolt.)**Some accounts on Jewish life in Palestine from the start of the Islamic period up to the late Ottoman period:**  (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel#Ottoman_rule_%281517%E2%80%931917%29?wprov=sfla1))  \\n*with the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691 and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 705, the Muslims established the Temple Mount as an Islamic holy site. The dome enshrined the Foundation Stone, the holiest site for Jews. Before Omar Abd al-Aziz died in 720, he banned the Jews from worshipping on the Temple Mount, a policy which remained in place for over the next 1,000 years of Islamic rule. In 717, new restrictions were imposed against non-Muslims that affected the Jews' status. As a result of the imposition of heavy taxes on agricultural land, many Jews were forced to migrate from rural areas to towns. Social and economic discrimination caused substantial Jewish emigration from Palestine.**During his visit, al-Harizi found a prosperous Jewish community living in the city. From 1219 to 1220, most of Jerusalem was destroyed on the orders of Al-Mu'azzam Isa, who wanted to remove all Crusader fortifications in the Levant, and as a result, the Jewish community, along with the majority of the rest of the population, left the city.**The era of Mamluk rule saw the Jewish population shrink substantially due to oppression and economic stagnation. The Mamluks razed Palestine's coastal cities, which had traditionally been trading centers that energized the economy, as they had also served as entry points for the Crusaders and the Mamluks wished to prevent any further Christian conquests. Mamluk misrule resulted in severe social and economic decline, and as the economy shrank, so did tax revenues, leading the Mamluks to raise taxes, with non-Muslims being taxed especially heavily. They also stringently enforced the dhimmi laws and added new oppressive and humiliating rules on top of the traditional dhimmi laws. Palestine's population decreased by two-thirds as people left the country and the Jewish and Christian communities declined especially heavily. Muslims became an increasingly larger percentage of the shrinking population. Although the Jewish population declined greatly during Mamluk rule, this period also saw repeated waves of Jewish immigration from Europe, North Africa, and Syria. These immigration waves possibly saved the collapsing Jewish community of Palestine from disappearing altogether.**In 1266 the Mamluk Sultan Baybars converted the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron into an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from entering. They previously were able to enter it for a fee. The ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in 1967. In 1286, leader of German Jewry Meir of Rothenburg, was imprisoned by Rudolf I for attempting to lead a large group of Jews hoping to settle in Palestine.**In 1470, Isaac b. Meir Latif arrived from Ancona and counted 150 Jewish families in Jerusalem. In 1473, the authorities closed down the Nachmanides Synagogue after part of it had collapsed in a heavy rainstorm. A year later, after an appealing to Sultan Qaitbay, the Jews were given permission to repair it. The Muslims of the adjoining mosque however contested the verdict and for two days, proceeded to demolish the synagogue completely. The vandals were punished, but the synagogue was only rebuilt 50 years later in 1523.**A few years later in 1488, Italian commentator and spiritual leader of Jewry, Obadiah ben Abraham arrived in Jerusalem. He found the city forsaken holding about seventy poor Jewish families. By 1495, there were 200 families. Obadiah, a dynamic and erudite leader, had begun the rejuvenation of Jerusalem's Jewish community. This, despite the fact many refugees from the Spanish and Portuguese expulsion of 1492-97 stayed away worried about the lawlessness of Mamluk rule. An anonymous letter of the time lamented: \\"In all these lands there is no judgement and no judge, especially for the Jews against Arabs.**The 17th century saw a steep decline in the Jewish population of Palestine due to the unstable security situation, natural catastrophes, and abandonment of urban areas, which turned Palestine into a remote and desolate part of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman central government became feeble and corrupt, and the Jewish community was harassed by local rulers, janissaries, guilds, Bedouins, and bandits. The Jewish community was also caught between feuding local chieftains who extorted and oppressed the Jews. The Jewish communities of the Galilee heavily depended on the changing fortunes of a banking family close to the ruling pashas in Acre. As a result, the Jewish population significantly shrank.*","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"How do you see that this is the same situation as the Regan Iran contra and the same situation as Nixon's first run for president but can't comprehend that Biden is able to stop arms from being shipped?

I also think moderates across the country but particularly in swing states lament not having a candidate from either major party that represents their values &amp; policy priorities. Moderates across the country, but especially in purple districts love to opine about how both parties are becoming more co-opted by the most extreme in their base without recognizing root causes of why they believe that has come to be: \\n- The average GOP voter has moved much further right than average Dems have moved leftwards in the last 20 years\\n- Corporations have super charged lobbying in Congress, buying out the judiciary, and facilitating the revolving door across federal agencies causing significant resentment towards the executive and professional managerial class who have been able to sustain the otherwise elusive upper and middle class quality of life\\n- The change in voter demographics between both parties has increased substantially across formal education, gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines leading to more diverse representation of Dems in particular.In sum, changes in voter base of the two major political parties reflect desires of those segments of the population who are most impacted by our political and economic status quo. Most moderates in general like the status quo (quasi-libertarian, capitalist, mind your own business norms) so theyre not as motivated to change things. This also happens to align with what the median swing state voter desires in aggregate. And so general election candidates ask their bases for money and volunteers to pander to centrist and persuadable voters who generally have the lowest turn out rates adjusted for income/socioeconomic background. These same moderates often complain most vocally over why our national politics are so divided without recognizing their role in perpetuating it (think along the lines of Manchin, Murkowski, Collins, and Sinema)Common sense things like universal background checks for firearms, legalization of cannabis, facilitating unions in workplaces, and taxing wealthy people who have above $50M are overwhelmingly popular. Yet presidential candidates who campaign on these issues are often not taken seriously because of Congressional gridlock. The latter elections puts more onus on swing districts to vote in accordance with their values rather than just voting for the other party because the current party isnt making things better. The former overemphasize the influence of swing states in national elections. Congressional inaction over the years has consistently led to outsized influence of the executive and so today, the choice of President has much more profound impacts on peoples day to day lives on average than a roughly evenly divided Congress which already favors policies that most moderates support without progress on policies that most of America wants.So those who have the most to lose are screwed by the current system and push their parties for more systemic change. But how our elections are run exacerbate the damage by benefiting those who resist change against the overarching (corporatist) status quo. Ergo parties playing the blame game and entrenching political division while executives cash in.","title":"CMV: Swing state voters and money in politics are the main roadblocks to solving partisan divide in national elections."},{"text":"Sure thing, I have no problem educating.

If not- we should prepare.-People fear him all together and sadly I hate to say it but thats what America needs.

Everything that is critical of Israel as a state has nothing to do with what their military does (the Saudis, Syrians, Iraqis, etc have done far worse).Nothing to do with their current government (which even the Israeli people have been trying to vote out).Nothing to do with their politics (they were actually founded by socialists and started socialistic).Nothing to do with their religion (Israel is a state OF Jews, and is officially, both de jure and de facto, secular, more so than the US or many European nations are).Nothing to do with foreign relations, nothing to do with them being a nuclear power (India, Pakistan, and China all have nuclear weapons, and all are far worse with human rights).Nothing to do with colonization (the region was colonized/taken over by the Romans, Babylonians, Persians, Ottomans, British, etc through time, but never specifically Arabic).The only reason people hate Israel is because their population is (only half) Jewish by ethnicity, and they hate Jews but disguise it as 'pro-human right' (go protest in China and Saudi Arabia and Russia then), anti-Zionism (literally being against the idea of a state existing, being no different than denying the Ukrainians, Kosovars, Kurds, or anyone else a nation), and anti-imperialism (they say as Russia rolls into Ukraine for the sake of 'denazification', China oppresses the ethnically distinct Tibetans and Uyghurs and threatens Taiwan and tries to take land from other nations in the South China Sea, and Iran uses outright proxies to effectively exert control over other nations).

The courts still ruled against him (again, even though he attempted to overturn the results of an election and seize power)3.

Trump didn't adhere to a rigid ideological framework (tbh fascist movements generally don't either, they tend to adapt themselves to the situation for the sole sake of seizing and maintaining power)6.
