One, samurai are not portrayed as noble knights. They get criticized plenty, to the point where Im wondering how much of the game this critic played. Everything  from their own self defeating strategies and nature to how non samurai are treated. Also the game isnt really historically accurate, at all. The studio even said this, they intentionally went for an inaccurate mythologized version of Japan. Whether thats good or bad is up to you, but personally I dont care that much about historical accuracy given the protagonist kills like a thousand mongols on his own which is impossibleAnd that comes to my real point: its a video game and by nature it wont be some high brow art. It can be a respectful look at Japan and have a nice call to Kurosawa films, but its a video game and its going to focus on gameplay first. I bought thr game with the expectation I can duel people and pretend to be a ninja, not sit through an explanation of why samurai are bad, actuallyThats a lazy excuse I know, but thats also video games for you.

PVC pipe existed during that same boom, but it was more expensive to produce and was more rigid and brittle than today's pipe. Many new plasticizers and plasticization techniques were being developed during WWII and post-war boom.

I don't know if this sentiment is truly sincere or rather they hear that I don't hate Trump and refuse to agree with me on anything after that. Elon's drawing of how far the left has shifted since 2016 is pretty accurate, IMO. You seem to be pretty understanding and willing to discuss differences of opinion, so that is refreshing. I have empathy for most people that are struggling in life (always a few exceptions) but I also feel we really need more to enforce accountability again. Look at Chicago and New York. People are committing assault and being released with little to no bail. Also, Chicago has some of the strictest gun regulations in the country and has one of the highest gun violence rates. I also know that a lot of people say they just go to neighboring states and purchase them there. This really isn't accurate as they still perform the same required background checks. It wouldn't really be financially viable for someone to legally purchase firearms and then sell them on the black market, you'd lose money and likely be caught within a few months. I don't necessarily disagree on the restriction of semi auto rifles for people under 21. In terms of immigration, I know that we'd take a significant economic hit if we start enforcing immigration laws but we have to rip the bandaid at some point if we want a legitimate immigration system. If the world knows we don't actually enforce immigration laws we will continue to see compounding rates of migrants and have to decide if/how we'd provide them with the same healthcare and financial protections guaranteed to legalized citizens. Our funding is already stretched as is. I brought up Ukraine mainly because of the amount of money we've provided for years now. I don't disagree that we we should stay out of the Israel conflict, but we should have also responded with the same sentiment right after the attack. We were more than willing to assist Ukraine without hesitation, so where is the consistency? I have no issue providing funds to foreign nations but we don't have a limit, which is the issue. Why is it up to us to fund 80% of any NATO conflict and our allies cumulatively contribute the remaining 20%? To summarize my beliefs, I strongly feel we need significant reform to our social programs to better assist those who are struggling but also realize we have to cut the finding from somewhere. We can take from the military budget to a point but still believe that having one of the most advanced militaries is not only a necessity for us, but other countries as well. Take Taiwan for example (I know that we are mainly supporting them because of their chip manufacturing). Countries use us as a safeguard, but if another NATO country wants to step up then I'd say let's slash the budget in half.

And this time shes going to win. All the women I know are very excited about this. I grew up in a home with just women. It was my mom, my two older sisters, and me. My mom always made sure we knew how important it is to vote, not just for ourselves but for the women of future generations and to honor the struggles of the women who came before and fought for our rights. When each of us voted for the first time, it was an event to be celebrated. She has pictures of each of us with our I voted stickers and I still remember how important that day felt.

They are actively stripping American women of their rights and we cannot allow it to continue. The women before us sacrificed too much for us to let all they worked for slip through our fingers.

You have to get away from the \\"democrats this, republicans that\\" mindset, that makes it seem as if they'd be separate groups which I doubt they'd be. In the end neither democrats nor republicans are ruling but rather lobbyists/corporations are. Why would they do this? For several reasons, usually to distract while also achieving some goals they have, but we don't know their exact goals, we simply can't.This week a couple of posts appeared in the sub containing some misinformation regarding the whole event, saying that company ABC invested such-and-such amounts just a few days before the event started and others pointing out that the areas those companies invested in are not within the area of the event, but rather some distance away.As an example there was a post containing several \\"what if\\" statements and a user explained: Kings Mountain/Albemarle-Lithium mine is about 70 miles southeast of Asheville, much closer to Charlotte. The mine was active from the 1930s into the 1980s, and was bought in 2015 with the intention to reopen. Those plans have been slowed/delayed due to the falling commodity prices for Lithium. According to the article above, and their own website Ambermarle was awarded $90 million in grants to reopen, not $250 million.So instead of stamping the whole post as false due to misinformation, there's still a huge incentive for these companies that invested in land nearby (the lithium reservoir they found) because that mine is going to be re-opened and when that happens, you will need workers there. A 70 mile ride is a bit more than half an hour going 130mp/h, not a bad place to put your workers in. So I would keep a close look on Albemarle Corporation, if they're going to buy properties and land where the hurricane swept, that should make it highly suspicious.BUT there are other uses too for events like that, doesn't have to be a reason within the area where an event is happening but can also be used for indirect reasons. Right now when a natural disaster is happening, it's always our fault isn't it? I mean apparently with man-made climate change it's us that caused disasters increasing in severity, it couldn't be anything else, so pushing for the \\"climate change\\" agenda is another insentive as to why someone wants such events to happen.That being said, we can only theorize about it but keep a close look on the properties and areas that were affected, check if any corporation is going to buy these lands.Btw did you ever hear about [Project Stormfury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Stormfury)?

That\\narea was much nearer for her and more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning, she\\nfelt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror and washed her\\nface in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit\\nand headed for work.When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The woman gave\\nSarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering\\nfrom a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising, because normally you\\nwould only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her\\nfeel sorry for the beautiful bird.Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic, which made\\nan unsanitary mess. The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, \\"Comma, Comma,\\"\\nwhich Sarah thought was an odd choice for a name. Comma was strong and huge, so it\\nwould take some force to trap her, but Sarah had a different idea. First she tried gently\\nstroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing a tune to her. Finally, she\\nadministered ether. Her efforts were not futile. In no time, the goose began to tire, so\\nSarah was able to hold onto Comma and give her a relaxing bath.Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth and laid her\\non her right side. Then Sarah confirmed the vets diagnosis. Almost immediately, she\\nremembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.\\nSarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensiveeither five or six times\\nthe cost of penicillin. I cant imagine paying so much, but Mrs. Harrisona millionaire\\nlawyerthought it was a fair price for a cure.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This will raise IQ for the country.The GOP will of course hate it.","title":"Biden announces 10-year deadline to remove all lead pipes nationwide"},{"text":"Im hoping he took those kits from his MAGA fans.

Like Palestinaians Russian cannot accept they don't have a right tot he land, therefore they will not really ever accept they don't have a right to take military action to take said land. ANY treaty they make will be meaningless; they only reasons they won't attack again is because they don't think they can succeed. Both will be willing to commit genocidal acts to do it because neither are inherently guided by any kind of morals like the west or even Israel; there is no humanitarianism by western standards in Islam or Russian culture. It is also a zero sum clash of civilizations.having a country like russia in a waring state is bad for everyone.And it would be even worse if you give the like of Russia of Palestinian terrorist concession because then they only try and invade more. There is no satiating militarist anti-humanitarian fundamentalists. It is like telling yourself the serial killer will be happy if you only give them one more victim.We are now forced to keep fighting forever?No, the Palestinians won't even have the ability to fight really. Trying to will just amount to suicide with extra steps. This is the only possible reality post Oct 7th. I would go so far as to say it is an inherent human duty to exterminate anything that remotely resembles Hamas or ISIS anywhere ever. Islamic terrorists are the ultimate ass end and bane of humanity.More Israelis died in the Yom kipur war and we made peace with Egypt.Israel could believe in peace with Egypt because Egypt didn't see it as their land that was taken or an existential fight for their own survival. Nor was Egypt ever remotely as powerless as the Palestinians are. And the conflict with Egypt ultimately now wasn't even half as long as the one with Palestinians that dates back to 1920s or earlier.Also, there is an argument Israel simply can never de-occupy the West Bank due to geographic reasons. The distance between the coast and the border would be too short and there would be no strategic depth and in only 20km Israel could be cut in 2. In a situation surrounded by Arabs and Muslims it simply is not feasible for Israel to ever be secure and safe when the Palestinians will never be peaceful or trustworthy anyway no matter what. We can 100% assume the more vulnerable Israel the more likely they would be to attack. Like how dumb do you ahve to be to suggest that Israel becoming weaker and more vulnerable would somehow lead to peace? Israel has won too many wars for it to ever agree to put itself in such a position for no good reason just to satisfy genocidal terrorists of the like of Hamas. I'm not even Israeli and I'm honestly offended at how insulting and evil what you are suggesting is. Losers that start wars with criminal acts like Palestinians can NEVER deserve their own state. period. Terrorists states are not allowed to exist under any circumstances. The crimes of Oct 7th can NEVER be forgotten or forgiven. That is the end of the Palestinians de facto.You want peace so that future generations will be safe and wont have to go through this shit.There is no peace that could ever gurantee peace and security for the Israelis. The old saying goes if you want peace, prepare for war. It doesn't say give terrorists concessions they don't deserve for no reason and leave yourself more vulnerable than ever and hope that somehow the 'goodwill' and 'promises' of Palestinian terrorists to stop being terrorist will somehow come to pass when it literally makes no sense whatsoever it ever would. It is like saying Chamberlin thinking if they give the Nazis the Munich agreement somehow they would be satisfied was logical. No, it was the most idiotic nonsense ever imagined.Peace is no possible with people like Hamas/ISIS under any circumstances. They don't want peace. They want Jihad. Period. Talking about 'peace' is practically a hate crime against Israelis because it is inherently disingenuous and only seeks to get more Israelis killed in the next worse version of Oct 7th.keeping this conflict going is exactly whats going to make another attack like oct 7th happen.If they try another Oct 7th then 100 times as many Palestinians will die as Israelis. Thus suits Israel better than allowing itself to be put in and indefensible position where its only hope of survival is the good will of Arabs terrorists.The 2 state solution is impossible and even suggesting is a hate crime to Israelis because it is just an attempt to genocide Israeli.As long as this conflict keeps going, palestinian resistance will find ways to arm itself.Not to any relevant degree; they will just allow the Israelis to justify the steady extermination of the Palestinians and the settlers to continue until there are none left. Palestinians lost any possible shot at their own state 100% and Israel will always be more peaceful and safer by never tolerating any kind of Palestinians state ever.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

I came away with feeling like the samurai were almost as much an occupying army as the Mongols, especially after the DLC.Jin betrays Shimura and casts aside his entire samurai identity because Shimura doesnt care about the people hes protecting *or* his soldiers. Jin becomes the ghost because he realizes that Shimura will burn every peasant and soldier on Tsushima to uphold his samurai idealism.Jin gets his lands and titles taken away from him and basically gets forced to live as an exile in his own home because he basically taught the people how to organize as a military force and fight a guerilla war, a subversion of samurai authority. This is despite the fact that he and his ragtag army of commoners, monks, and weirdo freelancers are basically the reason Khotun was defeated.The whole Yarikawa story arc is about Jin empowering a region that basically had no proper samurai left (because Shimura killed most of them and stripped the rest of title in the last war) to defend themselves and there homes against the Mongols and ultimately the samurai as well.Jin routinely lowers himself to helping peasants in ways that are fairly ridiculous for him, the pseudo-son of Tsuhimas jito, to do and never disrespects or talks down anyone except the super scummy people.

They banned it in the 80s, but enough of the shit had been produced that they were still installing it for another 5-8 years. I've seen brand new houses built in the mid-90s that had old stock asbestos popcorn installed like new. The problem is that the installers stop taking precautions and wearing protective gear because the stuff was banned. And, people will see that the house was made in 1987, one year after the ban, so they assume it's asbestos free and they scrape off the ceilings and wind up getting heavily exposed to asbestos.","title":"Biden announces 10-year deadline to remove all lead pipes nationwide"},{"text":"As I said previously, actively throwing right now.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 9, 2024 - 27 days until election day!"},{"text":"The very definition of treason.

It's a Ubisoft sandbox game with a feudal Japan skin. In the marketing, they've really overplayed how their work is \\"inspired by Akira Kurosawa\\", with a \\"Kurosawa mode\\" that makes it black and white with different camera framing.\\n \\n However, there are several red flags with this.\\n \\n Firstly, Kurosawa was much more ambivalent towards the Samurai than GoT is which has the standard orientalized representation of Samurai more common in works like the Last Samurai. The ambivalence is likely most significant in Seven Samurai, which is Kurosawa's most well known (and spoofed) work and in many later movies, the depiction of the Samurai is much more negative. I also find black and white to be a misunderstanding of Kurosawa. Seven Samurai isn't black and white for a particular artistic reason, it was a technological limitation. Kurosawa's later color films are not in any less lacking in his style.\\n \\n Now, one common line of defense was that Japanese gamers allegedly loved GoT. But that in itself is also problematic because Kurosawa himself is not as universally liked as many people think. He is certainly much more controversial in Japan than in the West and the gap is definitely the most significant with Seven Samurai.\\n \\n So, what do I get to interpret from all of this?\\n \\n Either Sucker Punch does not understand Kurosawa at all and have a flanderized and reduced his style to the typical orientalized western Samurai depiction. Or that, they do understand Kurosawa and orientalism, they made the conscious decision to go with the orientalist style.\\n \\n And the big problem is that you cannot discuss any of this because of poor media literacy. Most gamers have not watched Seven Samurai let alone any other Kurosawa film. They haven't read any Edward Said; they don't even know what orientalism means. They certainly aren't aware of any of the critique The Last Samurai received.\\n \\n And this creates a vicious cycle where the audience is so media illiterate that developers are incentivized with going with these very surface level explorations or stick a very westernized story and themes into a different skin. And the audience's media literacy remains low as they are incentivized into believing any kind of critique is an attack on video games as a whole or is SJW propaganda or whatever.\\n \\n So yeah, GoT is cosplaying as Kurosawa while being The Last Samurai. I don't really need to settle for it since there are plenty of games that don't have this problem.\\n So GoT is one of the few games I've heard about in person as a must-play experience, on top of DT discourse I've seen, where being described as an Ubisoft sandbox could only endear me more to it. But honestly after reflecting on this article and what you're saying, I'm probably just never going to play it now.I'm pretty sure the Kurosawa point tracks. It's been literally about 20 years since I've watched a Kurasawa film and could probably count the films I've seen on one hand. I'm not entirely sure if I watched Seven Samurai or am just familiar with it because of the other works it's inspired. But what I do recall quite clearly is that the one film that had any sense of idealizing Sumurai was Yojimbo, and that was a comedy. As I understand it's also a somewhat bastardized representation of Samurai as it was crossing the western genre with a Samurai story. In the other works as I recall they were depicted basically as just kind of these dudes. Not at all like the weeby stuff I see from video games today. So I'd have to agree it's pretty clear that the surface level interpretation of Kurosawa's style go hand in hand with the surface level historical engagement of that setting's history. It's something I've picked up on while playing Sekiro on the backburner, where it's in the Sengoku for a vague sense of being in middle age Japan and can just put out weeb vibes without needing anything grounded to reality. I can contrast that approach with how I played Kingdom Come: Deliverance lately which went to great length to ostensibly educate me on the history of Bohemia.I could see an out for the studio in taking a similar approach to KCD where the protagonist is Aido and has to make their way in the world after their home is invaded by the Japanese. But as the OP article pointed out, unlike KCD being made by locals, an American studio won't be deft enough to walk the tightrope of that historical context. !ping gaming","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://youtu.be/2jtU1g70ZOM?si=RNaW6KauQx2tXd6H\\nQuick you tube search","title":"Question for those of you that think the hurricane was man made."},{"text":"Netanyahu really wants ordinary Lebanese citizens to aid the IDF or become another Gaza.

Instead, America should decide if what it actually cares about for the region is human rights and democracy, in which case it has to protect everyone including Palestinians in the West Banks or its own strategic interests, in which case this should be made explicit so that locals could act accordingly and compete for who can align their goals more closely with these interests.  if we could even get back to a situation where some kind of 2 state solution could be revived...should we even want that?I agree, ethnostates in general are a bad idea and the two-state solution always a bad idea.

In some traditions this creative force, which seems to manifest in myriad ways and permeate all we perceive, is personified. In Christianity for instance it seems to me it's held that God is present in all life and matter of the universe, and that union with this primordial creator force, is the ultimate objective of spiritual practice, adherence to the golden principle, selfless action, and the abnegation of and worldly success and pleasure to one or another degree.Very similar ideas are found in Buddhism, where they're somewhat more directly explained and pointed to.In Christianity you're held to be inherently imperfect, but can be redeemed through faith.In Buddhism it's posited that everything is already perfect (or divine, if you will), just veiled by temporary afflictions and defilements, that will remain unless we employ means to remove them. In the traditional metaphor, the core of every sentient being is like a diamond, and our many afflictions are like mud covering it. You're not trying to improve the diamond, but simply to wash away that which obscures its true qualities.I'm not so sure the views are all that different, to be honest, even if they may seem at odds.In the Buddhadharma it is understood, that beings will endlessly cycle through existences, most rather unfortunate - a lot less free than a human form - unless they sort of become one with the creative force of all existence by eliminating dualistic delusion.That's similar to the idea in Christianity: If you don't use this life wisely, you may not be going to the best of futures.It seems to me that Christianity has been a little bit mangled over the years though, and with it the word \\"god,\\" and the understanding that we cannot fathom or conceptualize this universal creative force, that seems to be everywhere.I like to think someone like Jesus was someone who had dealt away with the ego and the illusion of duality, perhaps unaware that he was God's son as he did.Such a story is similar to the origin story of the Buddha, who lived about 600 years earlier. Like I think Christians generally believe that Christ set an example of selflessness and transcendence, in the same way, the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have manifested in the way he did, in order to show an example of how to reunite - or rather: rid oneself of the illusion of separateness from the ultimate nature of all that exists.His teachings came in different classes, according to my tradition, directed at different audiences. Jesus was speaking to a very specific type of people at a specific time, and perhaps he acted and spoke as he did, because this was the most effective way of communicating that which is ultimately beyond words.In my school of Buddhism, the ultimate sphere from which all life, sentience and existence ultimately arises, is called the Dharmakaya, which translates into something like \\"the truth body.\\"So no, I'm not particularly concerned with the word God, though I am a little surprised at how some people conceptualize and think of God. Any time we think God or universal creativity is separate from us, that's moving away from it, and by imagining him or it or whatever as an external force and consciousness, we're not really practicing what either tradition taught, in my view.","title":"Spirituality conspiracy"},{"text":"The mishandling of the pandemic should be highlighted more so than it is.

The point is that trying to promote the 2-state solution is a counter-productive fiction because there's no chance of it happening for various reasons, including the expansion of Israeli settlements.In 2005 Israel recalled 9000 settlers from Gaza. Do you think half a million and 9 thousand are at all comparable? The Israeli government explicitly promoted settlement expansion so that the 2 state deal would be off the table, and imo they were successful.As to what the alternative is, well Israel has already de facto achieved a one-state apartheid system of Jewish supremacy. They can either try to maintain that, formally codify it or be forced to become a secular nation.As to your \\"suggestion\\" of waiting a few more generations for a two state solution...Yeah I'm sure that will become more viable and not less, when there's even more settlers in Palestinian lands.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead. Pretending it isn't is either naive, or a disingenuous stalling tactic."},{"text":"These are all valid arguments of why everything will remain shit and there will be a constant war.Palestinians have never been able to wage war until Israel left Gaza to its own devices; that will never happen again. The previous wars were with the likes of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria. Egypt and Jordan are now more like military allies of Israel, Iraq and Syria are in no shape to fight anyone, and Iran is far away and has a rather poor military with an air force literally using US planes from 1970 in the form of F-14s. Hezbollah might be wiped out like Hamas.Gazan will be as powerless or more so than the West Bank after this. Anything they do will be knife crime level stuff that the Palestinians will suffer 20 to 1 or more casualties trying. That works perfectly fine for Israel long term. In the same way, we can almost say Oct 7th was a longterm win for Israel, because it gave them the ideal excuse to permanently occupy Gaza, wipe out Palesitnian forces, and use it as an example to prove any 2 state solution is impossible. People who can commit crimes of the nature of Oct 7th will never be peaceful. It is like claiming ISIS can be peaceful; it is ridiculous, insane, disingenuous, the stuff of either complete ignorant or the most rotten mouth liars. Their religious beliefs are totally incompatible with peace. They have the goal of the GLOBAL genocide of jews written into their charter. There will always be violent militarist islamist because that is the foundation and core identity of Islam dating back to Muhammed who was a murderous genocidal warlord.It is like suggesting Russia is ever going to be peaceful and all Ukraine needs to do is just sign a peace treaty with them and it all will be happy ever after. It is so evil and stupid as to be offensive. History is rife with such naive deals backfiring for the idiots who agree to them.What would be the WORST for Israel would be a false peace 2 state solution where Palestinians use the sovereignty to build up Hamas to be more powerful than even Hezbollah. THAT IS THE ABSLUTE WORST REALITY POSSIBLE FOR ISRAEL. NOT Palestinians threatening knife crime. NOTHING Palestinians could EVER OFFER ISRAEL would be worth the risks your suggesting. Your suggesting the Israelis surrender what would be the GREATEST CONCESSION AND VICTORY EVER to the Palestinians when they just lost a war they started via a genocidal attack.Those who perpetrate crimes like Oct 7th can never be rewarded. Such genocidal ISIS crimes against humanity can never be rewarded. Palestinians proved that day they can never be trusted with any kind of military power. Palestinians proved their true genocidal mindset and intent beyond all doubt. NOTHING you say will ever convince the Israelis otherwise nor should it.Thing is, a peace treaty will define a lot of gray ambiguous areas.No it won't. Treaties aren't worth shit compared to just outright having 100% total power over your enemy such that they can't even form an army like Israel does over the West Bank and now going forward will over Gaza. Israel doesn't care about what palesitnians do anymore because they no longer have the power to do anything relevant. Their leadership was wiped out. Their forces destroyed. Their like pocket of de facto sovereignty Gaza bifurcated forever. That was basically the pilot project for Israel de-occupying ANY Palestinian territory.They are welcome to commit suicide by trying to stab Israelis in the streets randomly; that kind of random desperate act just helps the Israelis reduce the Palestinian population more quickly to their longterm benefit.The moment the palestinian authority signs an official document with the israeli authority that state where the palestinian state starts and ends, things will drastically have to change.Nothing would change at all. Palestinians would all still want their land back. They would still want to genocide jews. Palestinians would accept and sign any deal because why wouldn't they, all they give are meaningless promises and words in exchange for land, sovereignty, and the ability to for the first time build a real army to genocide the Israelis.It takes 2 to tango, Israel cant make a 1 sided peace deal with the palestinians.But they have for most of the time since 1973. Palestinians have not been able to wage wars. Even now the West Bank, the much larger whole of the Palestinains, is incapable of waging war.And as a fully established state, the palestinians wont be able to \\"resist\\" as they have till now, attacking another state will be seen as an act of war and it would have repercussions.This comment makes no sense. Oct 7th was a genocidal crime that already gives them no right to resist. The very nature of Hamas and its character completely makes any kind of negotiations with them completely unacceptable. They are totally evil like ISIS. Anyone who suggests otherwise is a fool ignorant of what kind of religious fundamentalism mass murdering monsters Hamas and ISIS are.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

His first goal (assuming he gets the yes men he wants in place) would be to dismiss Special Counsel Jack Smith and all pending federal legal cases against him. His second goal would likely be to obtain some sort of judicial ruling which halts the administration of the state cases against him while he is President. His third goal would deploy the federal government's immense criminal investigatory and prosecutorial resources into building legal cases against his political enemies (e.g., Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney, Mark Milley, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, William Barr, Mitt Romney, etc.)For the latter goal, if the goal is simply legal harassment, he doesn't necessarily need the full cooperation of the judiciary. His DOJ may likely try to steer these cases to friendly judges who will do the DOJ's bidding lest these criminal cases get immediately tossed out. Regardless, it costs a small fortune to defend oneself against federal criminal charges and I wouldn't be surprised if less wealthy targets charged end up taking plea deals, serve suspended sentences or do community service, and Trump would be able to prove his point regardless.

I think less of you because you associate those ideas with conservativism and because you therefore identify yourself as \\"75% Republican\\" which has become a party that supports insurrection, violent ethnonationalist authoritarianism, and the gross mistreatment of marginalized people, dissidents, and blatant cravenness to other violent despots.Yes, obviously having healthy stable loving families is good. What makes a person a \\"conservative\\" is when they're unwilling to address the systemic problems that destabilize and tear apart families. Conservatives say they care about the nuclear family, but then they also don't want to help create a society that makes such families viable for more people. Expanding medicaid and other entitlement programs, streamlined immigration systems, higher minimum wage and stronger worker protections - including unions, higher taxes on the wealthiest households, etc. All of these policies are very well proven to strengthen nuclear families. But conservatives don't support them.Yes, as a liberal I also support the 2nd amendment because I think it's important that people be able to defend themselves, their communities, and the country *from violent authoritarianism*, but so-called \\"2A Advocates\\" often can't name a single amendment besides the 2nd they'd be willing to fight to defend. They don't want to be part of a *well regulated militia*, they want to be vigilantes or to just protect themselves from criminals. That's not really what the 2nd Amendment was made for - and conservatives don't care.You value border security, cool. But we have always been a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our immigrant populations. Not only that but I believe that *taking responsibility for your actions* ought to be a conservative value too, and the reason people immigrate to the US is often because US policy in their countries has devastated them. I had a family friend growing up who illegally immigrated to the US because she was trying to escape death squads in El Salvador that had been funded and trained by the US government. Doesn't this nation owe her and people like her something for killing them by the hundreds of thousands just so we could have cheap bananas and textiles?So it's not that I think less of you because of the beliefs you mentioned.

Those of us that do know which clothes are in which drawer can easily tell that you're bullshitting.   That you just made up opinions on hunches, irrelevant experiences, and other useless ideas.Some people tried to explain what is wrong with your policy beliefs.  I'm not bothering with that because you aren't able to understand those people yet.  You have no way to tell the difference between who knows which clothes are in which drawer, and who doesn't.What's worse, there are a lot of people out there trying to \\"educate\\" you because they have a vested interested in you believing falsehoods.

Public spending on housing and healthcare, contraceptive availability, community programs, healthcare regulations, better funding for federal disaster response, and cutting down on arming foreign nations (Ukraine being the notable*exception*) are all decidedly left-wing policies that the right has, for the most part, fought tooth-and-nail against. If you think Trump or any other mainstream conservative offers any hope of achieving these things, then I have no idea how you possibly could have come to this notion. Your positions here sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than MAGA.On other specifics:In terms of firearm regulation I believe the call for stronger background checks doesn't really make sense. Any time you purchase a firearm you are thoroughly audited no matter where you purchase it (legally). I believe stronger enforcement of requiring proof that the firearm is secured and only accessible by you if you live with anyone underage or individuals who are legally disqualified from owning a firearm themselves. Basically, it'd be a secondary offense if caught but should come with pretty harsh penalties if found guilty. Other limitations on magazine size or barrel length really won't have the impact people tend to think. I'm just as concerned about reducing gun violence but I also don't know what would work with addressing the root causes, ie. mental healthcare and poverty.I actually broadly agree here, but those root causes seem like they're pretty obviously and straightforwardly best addresses through yet more leftist and progressive policy. Guess who's fighting to make mental healthcare and programs to combat poverty better available? As far as direct regs are concerned, I'd support red flag laws and a ban on semi-auto firearms purchases for people under 21. I'd also be willing to look at much tighter regs on handguns  which are clearly the bigger problem than the arbitrary \\"assault rifle\\" category.To encourage nuclear families comes back to my point of getting back to a societal issue of not having a shared value system. But there could be more tax breaks, housing assistance, contraceptive availability, or community programs that encourage family events. Again, it'd be fairly difficult to directly encourage through policy alone with a societal agreement that it's best for everyone. See my prior point about these being left/liberal policies. I also don't actually see much in the way of disagreement, here. There aren't a lot of people out there who are *intentionally* forming non-nuclear families.One the government could cut back on spending is simply putting more safeguards in place to reduce overpayments and other payment oversights. This alone costs billions of dollars a year.I've never heard of anyone who opposes something like this. Again, not really a conservative policy.Another way is cutting back on our overseas funding. As much as I support Ukraine, I think it's pretty messed up that we've given enough money to provide each Ukrainian citizen over $5000 through our funding over the past few years, while at the same time we are struggling to provide families affected by the hurricane with $750 for bare essentials.It's a bit odd that you are specifically calling out Ukraine here, and not Israel. Also, again, public spending on disaster response is not a conservative proposal.And lastly, in terms of how much I think is adequate for military funding is however much it would cost to maintain a strong, modernized military that would deter foreign threats. Investing in the military is also an investment in technology R&amp;D. Necessity breeds innovation and we've had a lot of military projects that we use on a daily basis. Including the internet. There obviously room to cut waste and less foreign involvement would also help cut spending, unfortunately maintaining such an advanced military is how we avoid major conflicts. I think we avoid major conflicts primarily by having two gigantic oceans separating us from the rest of the world rather than pouring extraordinary sums of money into the hands of extremely wasteful military contractors who famously overcharge to absolutely extraordinary degrees. We could easily spend half of what we do on the military and still maintain the ability to *easily* defend ourselves. We also can and do channel money for valuable R&amp;D through other means that are significantly more efficient and effective but those are usually opposed by the right.I think the overtime tax cut Trump proposed would benefit a lot of people who are lower on the income scale.Not really opposed to something like this, though we should make up the significant budget shortfall that is likely to produce by increasing taxes on billionaires rather than cutting them as conservatives always do. Enforcing stronger border regulations by removing immigrants who have come here illegally (I do believe in exceptions for children and families) would allow for a more structured legal immigration strategy.All sides of the debate support enforcing immigration policy, but what very very few want to talk about is how utterly *reliant* we are on undocumented immigrants. Actually kick them all out, and we'd make the lives of ordinary Americans far *worse* as our agriculture sector utterly collapses (fully half of our farmers are undocumented) along with construction, healthcare and numerous service-heavy industries. What we really need to focus on is creating a legal pathway that meets the needs of both immigrants and our own labor force demands, not all this ridiculous bluster about building walls and scapegoating undocumented immigrants for all sorts of nonsense that isn't at all borne out by the statistics we see coming from the right.Trump's America First proposal is the best thing we can do for our country. We need to put the focus back on providing for our citizens. Americans are suffering and it's really sad to see. We need to provide much more affordable opportunities for housing and healthcare by putting that money back into our hands. We also need to strongly regulate healthcare costs but that's an entirely different discussion. We have to be a strong and stable country before we provide support outside of the US. Otherwise we're stuck band-aiding issues indefinitely. Again, I find it odd that you think Trump offers a way forward here when what you seem to seek here is decidedly not conservative policy and largely not anything that he would pursue in any serious way. His healthcare plan is essentially non-existent, his housing plan is absurdly inadequate (allow more housing to be built in extremely rural areas, essentially) and also something Biden is already looking into, and his idea of \\"putting more money back into our hands\\" essentially comes down to unfunded tax cuts which, as a Republicans always do, will almost certainly end up disproportionately benefitting the wealthy rather than the poor and working class.Honestly dude, I think you should give the left (like the actual left, not that represented by moderate Democrats) more of a look. Most of your actual policy aims seem to align far, *far* more closely with that end of the spectrum than anything on the right.","title":"Openly Conservative"},{"text":"The DOJ should be sending everyone involved in this little endeavor a sternly warning letter reminding them that they can be prosecuted over 18 USC 241 and they must immediately cease making these threats and must clarify the ads may stay up to any persons they made this illegal threat to.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241","title":"Florida health officials threaten television stations for airing abortion ballot campaign ad"},{"text":"Energy harvesting!","title":"Diddy is a distraction"},{"text":"What was she doing for the past 4 years??","title":"America Is So Ready for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Trump\\n-his mental health is of serious concern.

Palestinians want a state of their own and Israel doesn't want to endanger its Jewish majority by taking in millions of Arab Muslims.Jewish settlements are one of the smallest barriers to the two state solution. They're almost all concentrated around the border and in past peace talks Israel and Palestine have agreed in principle to swap that land to Israel in return for undeveloped land in Israel being given to Palestine. They never agreed on the exact percentages to be mutually swapped (Israel wanted larger percentages to have broad access areas and plenty of room for growth) but it's not ever going to be the thing that hold up the peace process.I'd also say that it would only take change in one key area for the two state solution to succeed and that's an area where we are currently seeing change.My analysis is that what the two state solution entails is well known and one of the most agreed upon things in all international politics. It's been studied for decades and the UN and other bodies have had plenty of time to make clear what a just legal solution entails. What we need is for both sides to actually agree to it.From my reading of books which have covered the peace talks (from neutral journalists who've been praised by both sides for their accuracy) I think it's fair to say that Palestinians have agreed to what's required from them for a two-state solution and even gone beyond it (e.g. being willing to sacrifice a full right of return, agreeing to land swaps when those aren't a requirement) while Israel has not. If pressure is put on Israel that could change. Pressure isn't being put on Israel as the USA is granting it diplomatic cover and has done for decades.Therefore if the USA decreased its support  and allowed sanctions against Israel, that could get a two-state solution moving as it would put pressure on the side blocking negotiations. Most importantly, things may be trending that way at the moment anyway.I wouldn't call a two-state solution imminent but I would say it is achievable and the best current solution.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

The level of projection is mind blowing and conservative forums are restarting the talking points without critically thinking. Even worse, the people in my life who support Trump are saying that Kamala is dumb and not capable of running the country, as if Trump is of sound mind. Wtf is happening? Honestly, this level of contrast has me questioning my assumptions about reality. Idk, I lay here at 3:00 posting on a topic I rarely do to get it off my chest. it's gd unsettling.","title":"The American people should know this but a lot of them are busy being brainwashed"},{"text":"Try keeping all your notes in a single notebook.

The moment Palestinian Leaders refused to try and make Ehud Olmert's peace deal work, despite how it was significantly more favourable than the Oslo Accords, showed that a negotiated peace was never going to happen because the only deal which Palestinian authorities would accept amounted to an Israeli surrender. Mainly because the West Bank has over half a million of settlers, plus another couple hundred thousand that live in East Jerusalem. The Israeli government isn't going to allow the dislocation of these settlers and turn them into refugees, and any theoretical Palestinian government will not continue to allow them to stay.The Israeli government pulled out all of the settlers in the Gaza Strip in 2005. Had Olmert's peace deal been accepted, most of the settlements would have been dismantled and land swapped for the ones which weren't.I think Israel recognizes this, which is why it appears they're culling and dislocating as many Palestinians as they can and trying to get them all to move into Egypt so that when they annex Gaza; whoever is left will be a small and manageable minority. Therefore I think advocating for a 2-state solution is a counter-productive waste of time when what we ought to be doing is acknowledging it's going to eventually be a single state, and view Israel's actions in that context - that they're basically bombing and starving their own future citizens.If this is Israel's goal, it's doing a pathetically bad job of it. How come Israel with all its resources (according to you) is trying to wipe out or expel most of the population of the Gaza strip, has, using the most wild estimates, killed less than 200,000 people. If extermination is Israel's only goal, they would have wiped out the Gaza strip by now. We'd see orders of magnitude more bombings, the blockade significantly harsher than it already is, bombing critical infrastructure regardless of it Hamas uses it as a military target, etc.And what alternative do you propose other than the two state solution?Edit: A lot of posts boil down to, \\"Yes I agree the 2 state solution is dead, but it's not Israel's fault\\". Whose fault it is isn't what I'm flexible on, I have my views on that and I don't think any of you are going to change them.If you're flexible on it, why did you place no blame on anyone other than Israel on your post? How can you claim you're willing to change your mind if your post showed you already made up your mind on whose fault it is.What I want to know is if a 2 state solution is still viable or even worth pursuing at this point, and to be convinced that it isn't some kind of cope or a cynical way of running out the clock while Israel runs wild.I'd wait several more generations - the rejection of Olmert's deal made it dead. October 7th metaphorically nuked the grave. Any hope of negotiation went out the window when Hamas launched those attacks, when Hezbollah later joined in and it will remain out of the window for (likely) the next several decades.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

On that front, via the West:Fatima Payman has chalked up a remarkable 91 per cent abstention rate in votes on legislation since becoming an independent, The West can reveal as she launches her new political party.The WA senator on Wednesday unveiled a party named Australias Voice, but as yet she has no candidates, policies or funding.Her voting record since she quit Labor in July shows that she has rarely raised her own voice in Parliament to represent her constituents.Asked about what policies her party would run, Senator Payman said people should look to her speeches since becoming an independent as an indication of what it would stand for.But she has not spoken on any legislation since quitting Labor and has voted in just five out of 57 divisions on bills.Exclusive analysis of Hansard and voting records shows she didnt vote in any divisions at all on six of the 17 Senate sitting days between quitting Labor and the end of Tuesday.Out of a total 151 votes, she has taken a position just 34 times and contrary to Labors stance about two-thirds of the time.She voted against Labors overhaul of the NDIS and in favour of a Greens bill to ban native logging, which is already banned in WA.Some of the votes she failed to take a position on include an anti-abortion motion from United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet, and an anti-trans bill proposed by One Nation and blocked by Labor and the Greens.Senator Payman blamed her lack of voting record on not having enough staff.I have been pressing on the importance of the Prime Minister providing me the full staff allocation that is granted to all other independent senators so that I can get across the legislative agenda and make informed decisions, she told The West Australian.Nonetheless, I have spoken on an array of matters that are important to Western Australians taking every opportunity to air their concerns and be their voice in the chamber.Senator Payman is entitled to five electorate staff, the same as every other senator, and hired the final two of this complement on Monday. She also draws a full backbench salary on $233,643.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has the discretion to allocate extra staff for MPs, but he has so far stonewalled Senator Paymans request.Earlier this week he said the Labor rebel should test the support for her actions by recontesting her upper house seat in the next election, three years before her term expires.Others have also suggested her position C a surprise third seat for the party in WA C should be returned to Labor, pointing out she only won the spot because of above the line ALP voters.Most of the independent crossbench senators have two additional staffers, except for former Liberals David Van and Gerard Rennick.Out of the 15 speeches Senator Payman has made, one was to explain she had quit Labor and would sit on the crossbench, another introduced her new party and 10 were two-minute statements every senator has an opportunity to give before question time each day.This included the speech full of Gen Z and Alpha slang that made international headlines.None were contributions on legislation.Nor did she speak on a motion regarding the October 7 anniversary moved by Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Tuesday evening, which attracted passionate speakers from all sides of the parliament, including firmly pro-Palestinian contributions from greens senators and Lidia Thorpe.Senator Payman split from Labor in July over differences in approach to recognising Palestinian statehood.\\nHowever, when asked whether Australias Voice candidates would have to hold the same position as her on the Middle East conflict, Senator Payman said it would come down to recruiting people with a value alignment.But the independent WA senator is yet to recruit candidates or articulate policies beyond saying she wants a fairer and more inclusive Australia.The ideological spectrum of whether you sit on the left or right, this is not what were talking about here, she said.This is a party for Australians. Were going to ensure that everyones represented, whether its the mums and dads who are trying to make ends meet, or the young students out there, or whether its the grandparents who want to have dignity and respect.Its not going to be an easy task. I appreciate that, but we need to capture everyones concerns and make sure that theyve got a voice here in Canberra.She said the Greens had commendable passion but many people think sometimes the Greens go way too far and it was better to approach issues with pragmatism and a level of engagement with whats possible and what can be achieved C but that she didnt believe Labor was going far enough.That positions her in a niche segment of Australian politicsShe intends that anyone elected under the Australias Voice banner would have a conscience vote, hosing down suggestions she would be dictating the direction of the party.Earlier in the week, Senator Payman said the new party intended to run Senate candidates across the country and contest marginal seats in the lower house.But on Wednesday she would not say whether she had a target for how many candidates she would like to recruit or how many seats she wanted to run in.Nor has she had conversations with any donors about funding the new party, or with any other crossbenchers about potentially joining forces.Senator Payman said she had held broad consultations with Indigenous people but it was unclear whether that included asking about using the Australias Voice name in the wake of last years referendum defeat of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament.Weve consulted with elders from that community who actually feel like the current government is not representing them and they are being treated as electoral poison, she said.!ping AUS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"ty for replying with a few of the reasons ??","title":"I voted Harris Walz!

As communities across the Southeast C including in Florida C continue their road to recovery and rebuilding after Hurricane Helene, the Biden-Harris Administration is mobilizing additional resources and personnel to prepare for the impacts of this new major storm.The Federal government is preparing to support affected communities wherever and whenever needed. Preparedness efforts are underway in conjunction with state and local partners. Together we stand ready to respond to any potential impacts on communities.FEMA has sufficient funding to both support the response to Hurricane Milton and continue to support the response to Hurricane HeleneC including funding to support first responders and provide immediate assistance to disaster survivors.Today [October 7th], President Biden quickly approved the Governor of Floridas request for an emergency declaration. Under an emergency declaration, FEMA provides direct Federal support to states for life-saving activities and other emergency protective measures, such as evacuation, sheltering, and search and rescue.President Biden was first briefed yesterday on Hurricane Miltons potential impacts to the Florida Gulf Coast and the work FEMA is doing to preposition life-saving resources in advance of the storm. He is also receiving another briefing today from Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall.The Administration has been in touch with officials from the State of Florida, as well as more than 15 local officials in cities and counties along the likely path of impact, to ensure needs are met in advance of the storm. FEMA has been coordinating closely with Tampa Mayor Jane Castors team ahead of FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswells visit to Tampa today. The Administration has also reached out to state officials in South Carolina and Georgia and will continue outreach efforts based on Hurricane Miltons latest trajectory.Florida residents are urged to stay alert, listen to local officials, and make additional preparations as needed.Pre-landfall actions taken thus far include:*Pre-Positioning Resources and Personnel*The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is flying Hurricane Hunters into the current storm to gather data to models and help hone prediction of the storms track and timing.FEMA has pre-staged personnel and resources in Florida and the region, including six FEMA Incident Management Assistance Teams, five FEMA Urban Search &amp; Rescue teams, three U.S. Coast Guard Swift Water Rescue teams, four HealthCare System Assessment Teams, two U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) temporary power teams, USACE debris experts, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and wastewater experts, 300 ambulances and 30 High Water Vehicles with ladders from the Department of Defense.Additionally, FEMA has two incident staging bases with commodities including food and water. Right now, FEMA currently has 20 million meals and 40 million liters of water in the pipeline to deploy as needed used to address ongoing Helene and Milton response efforts with capacity to expand as needed.Currently, a total of nearly 900 staff are already supporting recovery efforts based out of the Joint Field Office in Tallahassee and operating across the designated counties for hurricanes Helene, Debby and Idalia. This includes over 440 supporting Hurricane Helene recovery, over 300 supporting Hurricane Debby recovery, and over 100 supporting Hurricane Idalia recovery.*Expediting Debris Removal in Florida*Debris remaining from the impacts of Hurricane Helene poses additional threats to lives and livelihoods if another storm occurs. FEMA is supporting the State of Florida to expedite the removal of debris from Hurricane Helene in the Tampa region in advance of Hurricane Miltons landfall.FEMA is providing all flexibility available for reimbursement for debris removal activities, to help the State take whatever action is required to speed debris removal before Miltons landfall. To that end, FEMA is supporting Florida in surging additional resources to the Tampa area to get as much debris picked up as possible. State-run debris management sites are open 24 hours a day, and contracted trucks can deliver debris to those sites around the clock.   \\nThe Governor of Florida has additionally activated 4,000 State active-duty National Guard, many of whom will help with debris removal.*Pre-Landfall Preparations Supplement Ongoing Helene Response*The Administration continues to mobilize a whole-of-government response to the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Yesterday, President Biden ordered another 500 active-duty troops with advanced technological assets to move into Western North Carolina and assist with the response and recovery efforts. With a total of 1,500 troops now supplementing a robust on-the-ground effort C including more than 6,100 National Guards and more than 7,000 Federal personnel C the Administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding.The Administration has already helped thousands of Hurricane Helene survivors jumpstart their recoveries with more than $210 million in Federal assistance C and there is more to come. Over the last several days, the Administration has contacted nearly 450 state, city, and county officials in impacted States to ensure they have the support and resources they need. To date, FEMA has shipped over 15.6 million meals, more than 13.9 million liters of water, more than 505,000 tarps to the region, and installed 157 generators at critical facilities such as hospitals and water treatment plants.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administrations Pre-Landfall Preparations for Hurricane Milton"},{"text":"55 BURGERS 55 FRIES 55 TACOS 55 PIES 55 COKES 100 TATER TOTS 100 PIZZA 100 TENDERS 100 MEATBALLS 100 COFFEES 55 WINGS 55 SHAKES 55 PANCAKES 55 PASTAS 55 PASTAS AND 155 TATERS","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"But also I mostly just think George Washington is given a lot of unearned leeway for being the first.

Black September was caused by King Hussein's actions. He quite literally started the war by besieging and shelling Palestinian refugee camps. It was only after this that *Fatah's* leadership called for him to be ousted as a tyrant. And they weren't exactly wrong, considering he'd killed up to 15,000 Palestinians in 10 days.The Jordanian PM, Wasif Tal, was the engineer of this policy of indiscriminate warfare. He's the one who came up with the plans to butcher thousands of civilians. It is entirely predictable that the Palestinians wouldn't have been very enthused with him. The war was so brutal that thousands of East Bank Jordanians defected.recorded themselves licking his blood while screaming praise AllahRecord themselves with what? You think they brought a go-pro with them in 1971?Also I highly doubt they screamed \\"Praise Allah\\" considering the killers were PFLP members who'd spent the last 2 years vandalising mosques.when they went to Kuwait and rose to power but decided to overthrow the government.Again, a blatant lie. There was a Palestinian bourgeois class in Kuwait, but they were businessmen or civil servants. There was no call for overthrowing the Emir.It's true Yasser Arafat made the delusional choice of supporting Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, but he was the only PLO leader to do so. Every other member of the executive committee was against it. The only reason Arafat persisted in his miscalculated support was because the PLO's second-in-command, Abu Iyad, was assassinated by Saddam in 1991.As a result of one man's unrepresentative voice, Kuwait decided to expell 300,000 Palestinian civilians from its country.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

There's even less appetite over in Israel for a secular state than a two state solution, so it's not about polling or anything. it's just about what's possible, and I don't see evicting all those settlers as a possibility.

It's admittedly nothing on Silicon Valley, but for it's size, it's very significant. A bigger problem is that all of our successful start-ups eventually get bought by Americans (ARM, DeepMind, etc.), so the wealth is developed overseas. Changing the investment environment in the UK/EU would be a better move than trying to change start-up culture. On cultural evolution and immigration, the USA has a much easier problem. Immigrants coming to the SA tend to be better educated and richer - these types of immigrants are so much easier to incorporate into your country and much more productive when you're there. You talk about immigrants doing the jobs natives won't do. This is because immigration drives down wages for working class natives.

Rae had the uneviable task of having to mitigate the impact of the recession while reducing the deficit.To accomplish this, Rae instituted the Social Contract. The most notable feature of this was a measure that allowed for up to 12 days of unpaid leave for civil servants, with the idea being that civil servants may get less pay, but the gov would avoid having to lay anyone off. This was ultimately successful, and the gov saved $1.95 billion.But did the unions like this? Of course not. Instead of being greatful that they still had jobs, unions in Ontario were sour about the leave being unpaid and  turned away from the gov that was friendly to them. Instead, they threw their support behind Mike Harris and the right wing Progressive Conservative party. Harris was running on a Common Sense Reolution platform, promising aggressive measures to combat the deficit and opposing the Social Contract. Harris would go on to win a majority in 1995, and would promptly undo Rae's labour-feiendly changes to the Labour Relations Act, crush the teachers union during the 1997 strike,  and implement austerity measures that are still felt to this day.

The PLO has accepted the concept of a two state solution for decades - just coming to the table shows that they are willing to come to terms with Israel's continuing existence . Christ, even Hamas changed their charter in 2017 to acknowledge 1967 Palestinian borders... You can't tell the difference between internal politicking and diplomatic action? If even Hamas publicly says that 1967 borders are valid, connect the freaking dots.It's also honestly crazy to say that Palestinians are the ones most unmoving on this considering the PLO has openly asked for more negotiations for 10 years while Israel has flatly denied any overtures towards establishing a Palestinian state. How can Israel claim they aren't standing in the way of peace when they won't even come to the table?You say Palestinians should accept a 95% land deal...that's not even on the table! Maybe you mean they \\"should have accepted it\\"? Okay, well they didn't. Now Israel isn't even offering terms for a state, and has expanded settlements outward, so any deal going forward (if any such deal gets offered at all) will certainly be even less than they put on the table before. Think that will get accepted? Should it even be accepted?European colonizers coming to a land and forcing its indigenous people into smaller and smaller portions of land until they accept a humiliating surrender and live on a tiny fraction of what they used to? The situation is ABSOLUTELY comparable to American colonization and what happened to the Native Americans. If you can't see the parallels, that's on you.(Save your breath about how Arabs are more hateful and unwilling to compromise because of \\"their culture\\" or whatever. You think there weren't natives who held some pretty hateful views about white settlers the same way some Palestinians do about Jews? Whole families got scalped for crying out loud).Now: you wanted to go into WHY the two state deal never worked and put the onus on Palestinians, and I obliged you by getting into that discussion. The original opinion I wanted to engage with however, is whether or not the two state solution is non-viable to the point where entertaining it is a distraction. The only thing you've really had to say in regards to the topic at hand boils down to: \\"well we could try and do it again, but with a worse deal for the Palestinians that they are even less likely to accept\\"... do you think someone who has no faith in a two-state solution should be convinced by that? You're frustrated with me, but golly that's a pretty bad central argument isn't it?There's nothing you've said that's come remotely close to changing my mind in that regard.

No deal they can make that would gurantee the abolition or prevent the rise of another Hamas/ISIS like entity. All the history has proven to the Israelis the Palestinians deep down will never give up their desire for complete re-conquest, so the Israelis will simply never give them the ability to form anything like Hamas again.Secondly, palestinians offer peace in the middle east. Palestinians took on the role as gatekeepers of peace between Israel and the other arav countries.Actually, I don't think they do. Countries like Iran or Turkey will take up an anti-israel stance and use the Palestinians as a cause to try to rally Muslim opinion to their side and pursue their own imperial ambitions. This further adds incentive for the Israelis to just make the Palestinians irrelevant and never give them any kind of state but rather set them up for longterm demographic decline because so long as they exist to any threatening degree some other Muslim power might use them for populist propaganda for their own designs alla Iran.Also, Israel already started making treaties with some other Arab nations like the Saudis and Morrocco further weakening the arguments.Palestinians can't offer anything. No Palestinians body could actually fulfill the promise of peace because in reality most Palestinains will never give up the narrative of 'nakbah' which means giving up the inherent ambition for the 'right of return' is impossible. They will never think their lands wasn't stolen and not want it back. There will always be a huge underlying historic, territorial, religious, and ethnic grievance. There will always be acts of violence as a result on the part of the Palestinians.We know this for a fact since the Palestinians were ALREADY OFFERED a 2 state solution and yasser arafat rejected it, according to Palestinians themselves, PRIMARY because it did not fulfill the ambition of the 'right of return', ie being given back their lands in Israel proper, which is the same thing as wanting a one state genocidal solution where Israel doesn't exist.The Palestinains themselves admit that was the primary reason that deal was rejected. It would have given them a FULL sovereign state in Gaza and like 98.5% of the of the West Bank. They didn't give up that ambition suddenly in the last 3 decades as it would go against their inherent narrative of the Nakbah. NOTHING any Palestinian body could say would ever convince the Israelis it would mean permanent longterm peace and there is AS A FACT no reason to believe they would ever accept real peace. There would always be Hamas/ISIS fundamentalists among them and it would just mean a more capable version of Hamas sooner or later down the road as an all but gurantee. Iran would push for that for its own regional ambitions so there wouldn't be only internal factors among the Palestinians but external ones pushing for that reality too.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to operate on that assumption. I'm going to start there and I'll just be polite and say that your recounting of the events is...flawed. I'll discuss some of your philosophical positions later. He shot him a third even as he was trying to flee, his back turned towards the home.This is not an accurate portrayal of the events. James Rayl was shot three times in quick succession. He did in fact turn his back toward the door as he was shot the third time, but the shots were over by the time he started to flee. This is also not uncommon in self defense shootings. People instinctively turn away from gunfire. the home was not successfully broken intoThis is false. James Rayl had in fact breached the door frame just before he was shot. There are pictures of the broken frame online, taken by investigators. Also, many states--Ohio being one of them--stipulate in their laws that *attempting* to break and enter into a home is enough to justify the use of lethal force.and even if it was still doesn't make it okay to murder someoneIt wasn't murder. It was a lawful use of lethal force to prevent a breaking and entering.the ex boyfriend was a teen and mentally distressed, possibly disabled or autisticThis is irrelevant, both legally and morally. I've also seen ZERO evidence that James Rayl was disabled or autistic. The dad had the audacity to act like a victim in front of the police....AND HE WAS FUCKIN LET GO!!!!He was the victim. He was the victim of James Rayl's breaking and entering and assault. Why wouldn't he be let go?  My opinion plain and simple. If you have the heart to shoot someone you are a fucking psychopath that deserves to be sentenced to life. Unless you are in war or you are a police officer, you CANNOT shoot someone. Perhaps you could explain to us why it is morally acceptable for a soldier or police officer to take a life, while it is morally *un*acceptable for a private citizen to do the same? I'm not following your logic here. In fact, in another post you said that if the burglar doesn't immediately flee, you side with the homeowner. So which is it? Is killing in self defense lawful or not? Your posts come across as emotional rantings that contradict themselves. Why not shoot a salt gun or pepper gun at the home invader?They are less effective than a firearm. WHAT GIVES PPL THE FUCKIN RIGHT TO KILL!!!!Our status as human beings. You see, the idea that we--as human beings--have a natural and innate right to self defense is literally centuries old. It has been handed down to us through every legal system ever created, and is in fact enshrined in our very founding of these United States. Our Castle Doctrine--which traces its progeny to English Common Law--gives us the right to presume that anyone who unlawfully enters our home (or workplace or cars, in some states) is there to do us death or great bodily harm and respond accordingly. I fail to see how that is ethically objectionable.Furthermore, your posts suggest that your outrage here is coming from a place of being anti-gun so allow me to ask this; if Mitch Duckro had stabbed James Rayl as he broke into his house, or struck him with a blunt object, and killed him, would his actions be any more or less justified in your eyes?","title":"CMV: Shooting trespassers is not justified if the intention is to steal or just enter, and upon being seen attempt to flee"},{"text":" Canada and the UK are WEF pilot projects.The left wing populists have become right wing conspiracy theoristsHorseshoe theory vindicated again","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"[Yeah but with lesser cars plus zero homeless camps and loitering gang members, so way better.](https://nitter.poast.org/Obnoxiouss01/status/1843838119612952670)Hmm okay that's some concerning language","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Between the weather hazards and this guy, I'm always worried for my coworkers who had to move here for work.

If anything, I dont think the Nazis actually needed it in the way they thought. Though I will point out in my work that _Gleicschaltung_ is a little oversold versus what it really was.Yes, many organizations were literally broken up or folded into Nazi organizations, most notably in my opinion the trade unions and the _Stahlhelm_, and to a lesser extent (ironically) the military in its new oath. Coordination at these levels more frequently looked like calling it the National Socialist Beach Volleyball Association than it actually _being_ such an association in practice.People also oversell the strength of things like the boycott of the Jewish stores in April 1933 (largely a quiet failure). Or the efficacy of the Gestapo and of the block leaders. It all varied wildly by geography and there were just too few officials to have much of an impact on anything. In fact, they started implementing stricter controls and processes because they were getting tired of responding to their equivalent of someone posting on Nextdoor, and consequently them wasting their time on petty squabbles with no basis in reality.All of this is to largely agree with you anyway. There wont be that kind of coordination here. They wont need to. And I dont think the Nazis actually needed to either. They were overzealous in ways that often hurt rather than helped their cause. The Night of the Long Knives in particular was due to the political fallout caused by SA men who just wouldnt calm the fuck down.The thrust of my concern is the combination of the intended use of the Insurrection Act; the specific things that have been threatened with regards to the use of the military (including jailing political opponents, Marxists, communists, socialists, fascists and more); the sheer number of people they intend to round up and place in camps; the inability for any branch of government to resist abuse of the Act; 9-11% of _citizens_ who cant prove their own citizenship easily by finding documents in under a day; and much more.It all leads to a picture where, in year one, 10-50x more people are arrested and sent to a camp than in 1933. In fact, year one alone would mean more people in camps than the aggregate number up until about late 1941 into 1942 (Id have to check again on this one for exactness). Nazi level coordination of society need not happen in such an environment. The sheer terror that will be felt by normal people would be overwhelming.The Nazis specifically published warnings and stories of protective custody and released people to send a message, while also trying to be careful not to agitate the foreign press too much. You wouldnt need that in 2025, certainly not with those numbers. A number of high-profile arrestsor, in my opinion worsea number of mid-level arrests of political opponents would be more than enough to send the message. Again, these are explicit promises repeated, knowing that it could hurt their elector chances, because they need to be able to back up their mandate. We told you what would happen. It was all over the news. You voted for us.Anyway, its going to be a shit show no matter how far down this rabbit hole they go, or even whether they make it into office again.

After Reagan's administration, unions and laborers held less political power and leverage, and the amount of strikes fell dramatically. Strikes were one of the few tools that workers had left to bargain for better working conditions, wages, etc.Since Reagan, these issues have only worsened. Republicans like Reagan have appointed their rich, self serving and agenda driven cronies into positions of power within agencies like The Labor Relations Board to take power away from workers and hamstring the labor movement. And useful idiots like Trump will assist the GOP in landing its final blow against the working class.The labor movement is a shell of its former self thanks, in large part, to Republicans. Trump literally just had the audacity to complain about giving overtime pay to a crowd of union workers.Trump and Republicans can say whatever they want on the campaign trail to appeal to \\"the working class,\\" but instead of following through on their campaign promises, they have consistently carried out an agenda against unions, laborers, workers and human rights.And here's the rub. Clinton gets blamed for NAFTA all the time by Republicans. It's one of their misleading talking points. But NAFTA was an inevitability. It was actually George HW Bush who pursued the free trade and NAFTA agenda, while it was a widely agreed upon policy among experts back then.This forced Clinton to articulate his position on a free trade agreement. During the presidential campaign, Bush  argued for a NAFTA with no limitations or restrictions, Clinton argued in favor of an agreement with terms that still protected American jobs and labor, American investments and environmental regulations. Clinton tried to find a middle ground between the stances of Bush and Ross PerotNAFTA received overwhelming support from Republicans in Congress, and it was Democrats who came out in force and spoke out passionately against the treaty. Nearly all Republicans voted in favor, half of Democrats voted against. The agreement passed narrowly in the house.Since then, many Democrats who voted in favor of it, like even Joe Biden himself, have switched their stance on these policies and their impact on the working class. Instead, coming out in favor of rebuilding and safeguarding organized labor. FFS, Joe Biden is the first president to join the picket line!And don't get me started on how Trump's disastrous tariff policies play into all of this.But first, let me remind you that:- Trump inherited a growing economy. All he had to do was ride those coattails, but as soon as a real crisis emergedthe covid pandemiche mismanaged it at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden.- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee an economic recovery. - Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% - Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \\"pay for itself,\\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge. This only worsened inflationary issues. All of these things did.- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.Now, to elaborate more on that last part: Nearly every economist has determined that Trump's previous tariff policies did more harm than good and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans. And now he wants to impose more extreme, sweeping tariffs that will amount to what Harris called a \\"national sales tax.\\"We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.The cost of Trump's sweeping tariffs will be passed down to the consumer, they will stifle innovation and even make domestic industries less efficient. They will likely even result in job loss.Ironically, his tariffs will also hurt rural communities more than they will Americans living in cities.Small businesses will face challenges of their own as well as they do not have the same power as larger businesses or industries to do something about these policies. In general, it is believed that Trumps tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs. In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administrations tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy. A CNBC study discovered that Trumps tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.And this next part is important, because whenever Trump gets the opportunity, he criticizes Biden for \\"the trade deficit,\\" when in reality:The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trumps tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.The trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.As the trade war continued: tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and peoples livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly alliesAnd as far as the labor movement goes, if Trump is elected, he will negligently destroy what's left of it, spear heeding a Republican agenda that has been chipping away at organized labor ever since Reagan stepped into office.Trump's rich donors will benefit most at the expense of everyone else of course. I mean, you could describe most Republican policies as benefitting the few at the expense of the many.But, \\"Republicans are better for the working class!\\" Go figure...","title":"Teamsters president says Democrats have 'fed us over' for decades: 'We're standing up'"},{"text":"Howard's always been a germaphobe.

Your home is the most private place you can exist and supposed to be a place of safety and respite. Someone deciding to forcibly enter your home has thrown all safety out the window and opened up the door, literally, to whatever happens next. The homeowner could have a heart attack and die. Someone could jump from a window. If you werent home then no, you cant go find them and kill them, but were clearly talking about people breaking in while people are present. And this happens incredibly rarely without bad intentions. If they see you and immediately run before anyone pulls a trigger, yes, dont shoot them. But Im not putting the onus on the homeowner who was just living their life before someone forcibly entered their house to decide whether or not theyre going to get robbed, killed, or raped in a split second. If they believe it may be the latter two and shoot, they didnt create the situation and Im not holding that against them. I would much rather live in that world than the one where people can just impose their will on you if they feel like it without defending yourself and you have to just hope theyre punished later. Not everyone lives in a city with a short police response time either. Are they supposed to yell out and see if the person charges them or flees before doing something? Have you used guns before?

A powerful military saves us from spending countless lives in a large scale conflict. There is also a lot of research and innovation that comes from military funding, necessity breeds innovation. We have quite a few military projects that were adapted to the civilian market that we use everyday, including the internet. I believe that a bigger government isn't necessarily an issue either, it would just need to come with a lot of stipulations that enforced transparency so it continues to benefit the people as intended. That is my biggest issue with our government today, and both parties are just as guilty of its corruption. I simply just want more transparency if it calls for expansion, and if that's not possible then I'd rather have less.","title":"Openly Conservative"},{"text":"Stored top secret docs at Mar-A-Lago.

In terms of firearm regulation I believe the call for stronger background checks doesn't really make sense. Any time you purchase a firearm you are thoroughly audited no matter where you purchase it (legally). I believe stronger enforcement of requiring proof that the firearm is secured and only accessible by you if you live with anyone underage or individuals who are legally disqualified from owning a firearm themselves. Basically, it'd be a secondary offense if caught but should come with pretty harsh penalties if found guilty. Other limitations on magazine size or barrel length really won't have the impact people tend to think. I'm just as concerned about reducing gun violence but I also don't know what would work with addressing the root causes, ie. mental healthcare and poverty. To encourage nuclear families comes back to my point of getting back to a societal issue of not having a shared value system. But there could be more tax breaks, housing assistance, contraceptive availability, or community programs that encourage family events. Again, it'd be fairly difficult to directly encourage through policy alone with a societal agreement that it's best for everyone. One the government could cut back on spending is simply putting more safeguards in place to reduce overpayments and other payment oversights. This alone costs billions of dollars a year. Another way is cutting back on our overseas funding. As much as I support Ukraine, I think it's pretty messed up that we've given enough money to provide each Ukrainian citizen over $5000 through our funding over the past few years, while at the same time we are struggling to provide families affected by the hurricane with $750 for bare essentials. We also need to address the issue of social security. I don't have a fix for this but the younger generations are paying into a program they will likely never benefit from.And lastly, in terms of how much I think is adequate for military funding is however much it would cost to maintain a strong, modernized military that would deter foreign threats. Investing in the military is also an investment in technology R&amp;D. Necessity breeds innovation and we've had a lot of military projects that we use on a daily basis. Including the internet. There obviously room to cut waste and less foreign involvement would also help cut spending, unfortunately maintaining such an advanced military is how we avoid major conflicts. Those are policies I'd want to see but if you're wanting specific policies that are being proposed, I think the overtime tax cut Trump proposed would benefit a lot of people who are lower on the income scale. Enforcing stronger border regulations by removing immigrants who have come here illegally (I do believe in exceptions for children and families) would allow for a more structured legal immigration strategy. And I'm also not saying we send people back to their country who are seeking asylum, but work with other friendly countries to increase their immigration just as we will need to. Trump's America First proposal is the best thing we can do for our country. We need to put the focus back on providing for our citizens. Americans are suffering and it's really sad to see. We need to provide much more affordable opportunities for housing and healthcare by putting that money back into our hands. We also need to strongly regulate healthcare costs but that's an entirely different discussion. We have to be a strong and stable country before we provide support outside of the US. Otherwise we're stuck band-aiding issues indefinitely. I really do have the best interest of the less fortunate in mind, but I also accept that there will always be difficult decisions to make. I honestly hope you can appreciate my perspective and welcome feedback.","title":"Openly Conservative"},{"text":"Also the pushback on the lies has been good and cohesive, all the way from law enforcement to local politicians to social media","title":"Hurricane Milton may be October surprise in presidential battle"},{"text":"Just a reminder, Florida is the leading state for lead pipes.

Period. Settlements or not, doesnt matter. This is the key aspect that needs to change on the Palestinian side for a two state solution to be possible. This also can happen, its not an impossibility. There are Palestinian peace activists trying to make these changes. Settlements were always an issue, and theyve only become more of an issue. Like, just taking your argument at face value and running with it: lets say settlements werent an issue before, it was only other things...How does that make them not an issue now? Itd be an issue on top of other issues.Im not sure how to be more clear; if every single Jew is considered a settler, there is no difference within Palestinian politics differentiating between settlers and every Jew. Lets say Israeli settlements magically disappear tomorrow. This conflict is no closer or further away from peace and a two state solution because Palestinian politics view the entirety of the land theirs. And your position is that well if all of Israeli and Palestinian politics gets turned on their head, then the 2 state solution can be revived!...in some form. Thats not exactly persuasive as to the point that its a dead deal, and we need to reckon with that and move forward. Israel has stated absolutely no desire to annex Palestine in a way that is akin to Puerto Rico, and even if they did thats not 2 states, thats one state and its territory.Israels entire politics has been turned on its head within the past 20 years, I dont see why it cannot happen again.You asked what I think could be a potential solution, and I gave you one. Not that this was Israels position. We already know what Israels position is. It was offered by Olmert most recently. Thats a Likud prime minister, btw. He is no leftist. Look at what Likud is now. So yes, politics can change quickly. Without any doubt. Real politics doesnt rely on oh maybe everyone will change their minds soon, we look at whats probable, whats happening and how whats happening is likely to change whats possible. And at its heart, your argument is that the Palestinians will get whipped bad enough where theyll accept a deal akin to the ones Native American tribes took from the US government.Where did I say that Palestinians will get whipped bad enough to accept becoming Native Americans? Youre not arguing in good faith here at all with how much you are altering my words and setting up strawmen. And no, this situation isnt at all comparable to the US and native Americans. And maybe they will. But that deal in that situation is not a 2 state deal and it certainly wouldnt be a 2 state deal that honors 67 borders. That in particular is long gone... you dont even dispute that. You keep saying they should have taken deals where they give up 10 or 20% of their land beyond 67 borders.Something we can agree on; 67 borders are a thing of the past. Yes, they should take a deal that gives them 95%+ of the West Bank with land swaps. That is an amazingly good deal given the circumstances. That isnt want Palestinian politicians want though. They want all of Israel which is why Israels offers were rejected and returned with terrorism every time. What opinion do you really want changed here if I may ask? You seem very set in your ways here and unmoving.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

The problem is that you're waiting on the police to arrive. Even in cities, your **best** bet is waiting several minutes for them to get there, which is plenty of time for your attacker to harm you and your family.When you use force to protect yourself, your goal and mindset shouldn't be \\"I need to kill this person,\\" but rather \\"I need to **stop** this person.\\" There's a reason [Byron David Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Haile_Kifer_and_Nicholas_Brady) got a first-degree murder conviction, which I *strongly* agree with. This guy took the opportunity to straight up execute his home invaders after they had been reasonably stopped.Unfortunately, as other commenters have pointed out, you can't just know ahead of time:  \\n1. How many burglars are attempting to break in  \\n2. How far the home invaders are willing to go to get what they wantA burglar can't really be successful if the victims don't believe they're in immediate danger. If you see an intruder in your house, do you run? That's great if you're by yourself, but what if you have a family? Even if you do escape, can you be certain there aren't lookouts outside that will hurt or kill you to stop you from getting to the police? So do you instead just hang out with the burglar while they take your stuff? You're likely to get beaten and tied up, or even killed, to stop you from calling for help the moment they leave so they can buy themselves more time to escape.That brings me back to **stopping** the intruder. Salt guns and pepper guns *could* work, and if that's what you use and you *do* stop the intruder(s), fuckin' kudos to you. If you can stop the intruder without killing them, then it's probably the best outcome for everyone. But even *real* guns have had trouble stopping people at times, and the onus for ensuring the most ideal outcome can't be on the *victim* in a crime. So if in the process of stopping the intruder, you do end up taking their lives, then you shouldn't be punished for that.","title":"CMV: Shooting trespassers is not justified if the intention is to steal or just enter, and upon being seen attempt to flee"},{"text":"This might be a radical idea, but I'm a staunch believer in no taxation without representation. 16 yr olds who work jobs don't pay much in taxes, but they still pay some, and they should have a say in what those taxes are used for.This is awesome too!","title":"Democrats push to lower voting age to 16 for school board races ?

But again, this backs up my point that I think that Trumpism and Nazism are not necessarily comparable in some ways. I think Italian fascism and how that was implemented is a much stronger parallel to Trumpism generally. Because when I think about the most optimal authoritarian state that Trump and his supporters can muster, it will likely appear like Mussolini's Italy without the military jingoism (though that jingoism is likely to manifest itself more in glorification of the military rather than outright conquest of more territory). Trump and the GOP do not likely seek to dominate society totally in the way that the Nazis did. When the Nazis took power and instituted *Gleichschaltung*, they really took over every single institution and club throughout the country. You could not create your own chess club; you had to join the official Nazi one. Further, they dissolved all political opposition and even the Lander. Trump may seek to dominate state governments dominated by the political opposition and he may be able to jail/prosecute certain members of the political opposition, but he will likely not be able to end all political opposition without the force of arms or perhaps triggering state secession or even a civil war. The Democrats will be defanged and will remain a powerless political opposition, only to operate as a release valve for millions more people that Trump cannot outright control or jail.Hence why I think Viktor Orban's Hungary is a model that Trump and his future administration, if he wins, will be the model to follow. Federal government resources will be taken away from people perceived to be hostile to Trump's administration (such as no more federal grants or FEMA money for states controlled by Democrats) and redistributed to more \\"loyal\\" citizens/states.","title":"Opinion: Why the Supreme Courts immunity ruling is untenable in a democracy"},{"text":"Lets not forget god using tornados and hurricanes , wildfires  and such events to kill the sinners (dems,lgbtq, etc) yet they always seem to devastate and occur in majority red areas \\n \\nBut also dems control the weather.","title":"Kamala Harris 'is in control of this hurricane' using 'weather weapons': Alex Jones"},{"text":"Non-delegation says what?","title":"Opinion: Why the Supreme Courts immunity ruling is untenable in a democracy"},{"text":"That's not the one I think of when I think of the Liberal screaming.

There was no history of blacks murdering whites randomly for no reason other than the fact that they were white.

But also, the conditions are just incomparable. Slavery is an abhorrent and dehumanizing practice, whereas occupation is not. Despite the occupation in the West Bank, Palestinians there live very freely and in significantly more luxury than people in neighboring countries (Jordan, for example). And there's a legitimate reason for the occupation, which is that before it, there was the Second Intifada with suicide bombings. Also, maybe you should read up on the 1920s and 1930s Arab riots which resulted in massacres of Jews in Mandatory Palestine. It's not like all of a sudden Israel decided to \\"deny the Palestinians their peoplehood\\". Israeli decisions were well thought-out; occupation led to a lasting peace with Egypt, and also with Jordan. Israel was so close to attaining a solution with Palestine as well with the 1993 Oslo Accords, but then the Second Intifada began and tanked all those hopes.Also, let's be clear. Palestinian citizens of Israel have completely equal rights to Jewish citizens of Israel. It's those who don't have citizenship, those who aspire to live in a country called Palestine, that do not have the same rights as Israeli people. I wonder why!

The other problem is handling a violent intruder as an untrained person without training or gear for it, and likely half asleep with a single defensive weapon hastily pulled from a bedside hiding place. Non-lethal options are legally problematic, and this should absolutely be rectified, which should include a clause justifying non-lethal force in defense of property, as the current way things work justify self defense but not property defense, so you must put yourself at risk to defend property, which then is done with lethal force because non-lethal options endanger you legally. The general solution for this is a law to allow violence in defense of property, including a clause which says if the 'victim' of this self defense is found guilty of any crime against said person, it would automatically be counted as self defense and the burden of proof is on the thief to prove wrongful self defense.","title":"CMV: Shooting trespassers is not justified if the intention is to steal or just enter, and upon being seen attempt to flee"},{"text":"I live on the edge of his gerrymandered district.

But lots of work even since Evans prime has been done on the minutiae of the SA and the other paramilitaries. When you start to look at how they actually behaved, what their fights were about, it becomes clear that it was not as politically motivated as youd think at first blush.Most violence was neighborhood violence. The Roter Frontk?mpferbund and the SA both functioned more akin to todays gangs or cartels than to our modern militias. Even Horst Wessel, the martyr of the Nazi movement, was likely killed over a rent dispute. Petty crime was common. Most of the early camps were established in the basements of SA pubs. And violence predominantly occurred in urban areas. The statistical question here is basically a problem of classification. Weimar pales in comparison to the street violence of the United States.The vast majority of the paramilitary violence that occurred happened between the years 1919 and 1923. When you remove that period, the violence isnt much more substantial than far-right violence in the United States today, so you dont even need the classification question to be addressed.Moreover, we will never have militias in the style of Weimar. That era was one of mass movements. That era is over. Were in the era of lone wolves. Though, ultimately, none of this really matters much anyway because the biggest threat comes from the top.Which brings me back to my first point. The Nazis had to get an awful lot of things right to take power and the players around them had to make a lot of just the right mistakes. Even with their large terrorizing force, they never cracked 40% in a truly free and fair election. But America can have a politician telegraph in exactly the same way Hitler telegraphed what he was going to do, and it can be a coin toss who wins. Paramilitaries and militias are more a sideshow curiosity then.I do appreciate the pushback on the point, to be clear.

Obama already tried that for 8 years, and hes as intelligent and charismatic as any politician youll see. It doesnt work. Globalism had its consequences.

That's not exactly persuasive as to the point that it's a dead deal, and we need to reckon with that and move forward.

I am not going to stop and ask the person who just broke into my house what their intentions are before I shoot them. They chose to break in, now they have to deal with the consequences.a) the home was not successfully broken into, and even if it was still doesn't make it okay to murder someoneYou have no idea what is going through that person's mind. For all you know they have a gun and are just waiting for you to open the door so they can kill you. If anyone goes as far as trying to violently break into your house then you can assume that they are a deadly threat.b) the ex boyfriend was a teen and mentally distressed, possibly disabled or autisticHaving a mental disability or autism doesn't excuse this type of behavior. Mentally ill people and autistic people can for the most part still understand that breaking and entering is wrong. If you don't understand that breaking and entering is wrong, then you aren't functioning at a high enough level to live a normal life in our society.c) The dad had the audacity to act like a victim in front of the policeBecause he WAS a victim. A strange man is trying to break down his door to get access to his daughter and you're pretending that he is somehow in the wrong for protecting his family?Unless you are in war or you are a police officer, you CANNOT shoot someone.Why do soldiers and police shoot people? Because their lives and the lives of those around them are in danger, and shooting the people trying to attack them is the only way they can save their life and the lives of those they care about. The same logic applies to people trying to defend their home and their family from assailants.Why not shoot a salt gun or pepper gun at the home invader? WHAT GIVES PPL THE FUCKIN RIGHT TO KILL!!!!Have you ever seen how effective a salt gun is at stopping somebody? Spoiler alert: they aren't. If somebody is trying to kill me or my family, I will kill them first. I will never apologize for that. I have a right to defend myself from people trying to take my life, and that includes responding with deadly force.Have you ever seen a video of someone on PCP in a blind rage? Those people can take multiple tazers, pepper spray, and broken bones and STILL keep attacking. Sometimes, a bullet is the only way to end an encounter.I think trespassing is no justification for murder and anyone who disagrees is probably a psychopath who enjoys the idea of their murder being justified.Trespassing isn't a justification for murder. If someone trespasses on my property then they leave, I'm not justified in finding them, hunting them down, and killing them. I am justified in defending myself when there is an unknown, possibly armed assailant breaking into my occupied home. There is a major difference between the two.Waiting to see what their intentions are is not an option, as if they intend to do harm then that moment of hesitation gives them all the time they need. When they chose to break in that was them accepting the risk that their life may come to an end. Whatever happens after that point is 100% on the assailant, not on the homeowner.","title":"CMV: Shooting trespassers is not justified if the intention is to steal or just enter, and upon being seen attempt to flee"},{"text":"The US has more than 30 MILLION uninsured citizens who have absolutely NO access to medical care.

A permanent ... anything, including a two state solution, is beyond the current horizon. But the conflict has been going on for at least 75 years, there is plenty of time for something to eventually fundamentally change. The degree of increased Palestinian autonomy and self government will remain relevant. The theoretical path to permanent peace is in a two state solution. It lies stemming from iterative successful steps of peace and corresponding prosperity. Not fantasies of accelerationism.It may seem unlikely and difficult to find a path to a two state solution. The smaller scattered settlements speckling the West Bank will have to eventually be vacated, and some kind of land swap in exchange for the border regions where the lion's share of Israelis live. But these obstacles will always be less than those to a single, stable state. One of Israel's literal neighbors is a failed state; the reality of sovereignty is not always the same as the legal specifications of the Westphalian inspired UN system.The question of exact areas of control is not one that will go away either. Currently the West Bank is split into multiple zones with different levels of Palestinian control. The borders from 1967 are not somehow set in stone. Jordan only gave up it's claim to the West Bank in 1988, it could reclaim it. There are many options besides either a state with 1967 borders or one with those same borders but the dividing line removed. There are so many options if peace is prioritized, it's not time for \\"we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas ... except this  extreme one\\". Starting by demanding either a fully fledged sovereign state along largely arbitrary borders from generations ago or unconditional surrender from Israel do not lead anywhere different than the status quo. War only benefits the winner, and Palestine has lost this war decades ago.Realistically Palestine will never attain as much as they could before decades of continued failure and decreasing leverage. The longer Palestine waits to negotiate a deal, the less land they will get. Leverage and real politik aren't *everything* in international relations, but it's still a basic principle. That doesn't mean they shouldn't negotiate simply out of the sunk cost fallacy. The alternative is the status quo, which can't last forever because at current rates in 200 years Israel will have eaten the West Bank. That's plenty of time for a future generation to stop doubling down.Drawing a line in the sand that can't be reached isn't an attempt at negotiation, it is a justification for unending war. The status quo is the alternative for a long time, but it eventually will stabilize in some way. A two state solution is at least a possibility when the timeline could easily be another 75 years.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Plenty of immoral shit is legal and plenty of moral shit is illegal.I will still argue that they are morally wrong.Which is fine. You can feel however you want about something. What you don't have a right to do is use violence to prevent other people from doing actions that don't violate anyone's rights.Violating someone's rights is not the only thing which is immoral or illegal.I didn't say that it was. It's the only instance where you have a right to prevent it.  \\nWomen can choose to have sex with whoever they want, however they want and they have the freedom of choice to do so. But if they accept payment in some form, then it becomes a business transaction and the government gets involved.  \\nBecause the government **does** something doesn't make it moral for them to do so. Do you think you as an individual have a right to force two parties to pay you for a business transaction that they voluntarily entered into or otherwise dictate how they do business if their transaction isn't infringing on any of your rights? I'm guessing the answer is no. If you as an individual don't have a right to do something, you can't give someone else the power to do something on your behalf.  \\nFor example we have minimum wage laws and laws to protects employees from being underpaid for their services by the employer.  \\nAgain, the state **doing** something doesn't mean they have a right to do so, just the power to commit violence in order to enact it.  \\nMany people who are homeless or who do not have jobs would gladly work for 1$ per hour because it is better than what they currently have. But that is not allowed because the government wants that if an employers hires someone they give them a certain minimum standard so they can get the bare necessities.  \\nSo instead of the homeless person getting some form of compensation, they get nothing. Clearly that's better! The minimum wage does nothing to protect people and only serves to price people out of the workforce.  \\nThere are many situations which involve exchange of goods between 2 people who consented to the exchange where the government gets involved to ensure things like no indirect harm to third party, both parties know the full details, etc.  \\nFraud, which a party withholding information about the transaction from the other party would be, means it's not a consensual transaction. The state isn't necessary to enforce this, it's just the main entity that does so currently.  \\nNo amount of financial payment compensates a women for the services she provides.  \\nValue is subjective, and since you aren't involved in the transaction at all, you're valuation doesn't matter.  \\nYou could pay a women a billion dollars for a night and I would still argue that regardless of whether she accepts, it is not a valid compensation.  \\nAgain, unless you're one of the parties involved in the transaction, this is irrelevant.

Im challenging that point. Again, Israel is never going to agree to displacing hundreds of thousands (or even just thousands, its not 2005 anymore, theyre not giving an inch) of its own people at this point to meet a deal with Palestine, and Palestinians wont agree to a deal where they give up even more of their land. They feel theyve already given too much, they felt that decades ago, and have only lost more since.Again, read my words, settlements were never the issue. Palestinian politics believes the entire land is occupied. They dont see settlers any more problematic than Israelis living in Tel Aviv. Back to what I was originally saying, if you gave any agency to Palestinians you would realize that they hold blame for the failure of rejecting a state and require a change of political ideologies. What kind of good-faith negotiation goes Ok well only take 10 percent of your land, and withdraw from the rest... oh dont like that? Ok how bout we take 30%? Like why do you think its okay for Israel to expand beyond the borders of their own proposed deals? Even if you support Israel taking 10%, should they not restrict themselves to that 10% and not expand further?What kind of good faith negotiation is planning a massive terrorist attack while in peace talks? Yeah, Israel has moved further right with more aggressive policies today. At least they did negotiate originally in good faith in an attempt to have peace. And no, they were going to give back virtually all of the West Bank. There would be a negligible difference with the land swaps in the Olmert deal that would be virtually unnoticeable to the vast majority of the population. But whatever, this is all sidetracking. It sounds like you agree the 2 state deal is dead, you just solely blame Palestinians. Okay, so what do you think should happen? Because lets take your assertion at face value, that Palestinians are at fault and will never agree to a 2 state deal, and so Israel has the right to keep expanding to the point where they can control all of Palestine if they so choose...okay. So what now? What should happen to the Palestinians within Israels new territory that theyve grabbed in your view? Judging from the way youve been talking so far I cant imagine you support giving them full citizenship within Israel... so what, expulsion? 2nd class citizenship where theyre allowed to stay but not vote and have restrictions on birth rates or something?Did I blame solely the Palestinians? I mentioned in my first comment here that Israeli politics would require electing in more centerist coalitions who want to work towards peace, but that is also predicated on Palestinians altering their politics completely. As I said, you are thinking shortsighted. Its obviously going to take a new approach - hopefully the UAE or Saudi Arabia eventually help Palestine form a legitimate political structure not founded on the destruction of Israel. If not that, I think Israel should take the Puerto Rico approach to Palestine, annex it, make Palestinians citizens without voting rights in Israel proper for certain aspects as Puerto Ricans cannot vote in the US, with a path to becoming a full state if they show their politics can behave without seeking Israels destruction. Anything that works towards a peaceful resolution is better than what there is now. The fact remains though, settlements __are not the issue__ for a population that views the entire land as occupied.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Heres my research notes on [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqFPBXsusL6ZmDikRhOFbj7waXrfxQCuxvdlnIirLhs/edit) for a project called [How Nazis Win](https://hownaziswin.com). 244 footnotes worth to peruse just in those notes.One of the worst aspects is what it does to our military. From the amici brief of national security experts, including generals and admirals: Presidential immunity for official capacity crimes would create an untenable dilemma for every member of the military chain of command ordered to execute an order, particularly if officers disagree as to its legality under criminal law. Because any order issued by a president carries with it a presumption of legality and exerts a powerful gravitational force on its recipients, the risk of such disparate interpretations of the duty to obey, even if the order appears on its face to violate federal criminal law, would be exacerbated if the President were unrestrained in the orders he could issue and could therefore violate the law with impunity.^1It also could make Trump likely to dangle pardons: Absolute or qualified immunity of a president could also be mixed with improper use of the pardon power to enable a corrupt president to use the military to accomplish otherwise unlawful objectives.^2This is precisely what happened with the Nazis, who pardoned the SA and others for torture: On the other hand, those in power had means to circumvent inconvenient rulings by placing people who were treated too leniently in camps and pardoning loyal party members who were convicted for ill doings as part of their terrorizing of the population.^3And Trump has already signaled his willing to use this power to nefarious ends. He pardoned General Michael Flynn: The same day Kissinger and Albright were purged, Trump rewarded the one general he considered most loyal by pardoning Mike Flynn. Bill Barrs effort to reverse Flynns guilty plea had gotten tied up in appeals so Trump, out of patience and in a mood to do what he wanted, decided to effectively override the courts.^4Heres what Flynn did with his pardon: On Dec 7, week after pardon, Flynn endorsed ad urging Trump to declare martial law, temporarily suspend the Constitution, have military conduct a re-vote. Milleys fears becoming reality.^5Hitler used the power to let people get away with murder: In May 1933, prosecutors in Munich started investigations into killings of inmates in Dachau. These investigations were met with resistance and countermeasures by the SS, and the confrontations between the legal institutions and the SS were soon brought to the highest political level. Nevertheless, SS guards in several camps were found guilty of mistreatment of prisoners and given prison sentences. In 1935, Hitler confirmed that the camps could operate outside of the law, pardoning the SS men. This brought an end to legal proceedings in regular courts against operations in the camps.^6As happened there can happen here. Trump wants to use the Insurrection Act. This is what he meant by being a dictator on day one.^7 What does that mean? Absolute or qualified immunity could intertwine with the misuse of the pardon power, allowing a corrupt president to employ the military for unlawful aims.^8And Trump has explicitly offered pardons to act illegally: On Air Force One, Trump pressured officials to close the border entirely, offering pardons for potential legal repercussions. Just send them back, we shouldnt let them in, he instructed. Kevin McAleenan, the director of Customs and Border Protection, explained that by law they could not do that. If you get in trouble for it, Ill pardon you, Trump told him. Thought he was not seriously advising him to break the law.^9Hes spared a SEAL who murdered a captive and attempted to murder civilians: In 2019, he had intervened to spare a Navy SEAL accused of murdering a captive ISIS fighter and attempted murder of civilians in Iraq, undermining military justice and the chain of command.^10The reason the immunity decision really matters is because the Nazis had to manipulate the system to get the kind of power a future President Trump has already been given. They bargained for control of specific ministries. They passed the Enabling Act. They used their two million man private militia to strongarm local governments. Trump needs no such work to be done. The Supreme Court put the cherry on top of a sundae made of the Insurrection Act. There are an array of horrors that could result from Donald Trumps unrestricted use of the Insurrection Act, Blumenthal said in an interview. A malignantly motivated president could use it in a vast variety of dictatorial ways unless at some point the military itself resisted what they deemed to be an unlawful order. But that places a very heavy burden on the military.\\nThe best case scenario would effectively have to be a military coup, or total denial all the way down the chain to follow orders.^11The only two people with statutory authority to deploy the military are the Secretary of Defense and the President. The President can fire and replace all of the combatant commanders, including USNORTHCOM, responsible for the continental United States.Hes been granted effective immunity. Our own retired military leadership had warned the court what that would mean. And invoking the Insurrection Act under 10 USC  254 would mean no legal checks. Neither Congress nor the judiciary has the ability to stop it. There is no time limit on its use.And he could easily deploy _militias_ if he wanted under 254. Not to mention deputize federal officers, which he has done and then refused to hand them back over to their jurisdiction. He has the ability to completely centralize any real power in the United States under his authority on day one.This is a very bad scenario were looking at if he wins.1.

I've always interpreted it as self-sabotage, the nocebo effect, a psychological resistance to success and development, because who am I to be anything but poor little peasant me? But if I try to analyze some of these situations, external actors (close to me, in the form of institutions, or through technology) have often been involved. From abject betrayal by close ones, gaslighting, to getting pummeled by the tax man, having bosses become unusually unreasonable, being defrauded, robbed, assaulted, and similar events, it seems they always hit at just the right (wrong) time, sending me off track and back into the bushes, so to speak. In many cases more subtle mechanisms, like dreams/nightmares, increased tinnitus, suddenly arisen aches and pains and other health problems, invasive thoughts, inexplicable shifts in my modality of cognition and emotional/mental landscape, have also manifested at these sort of existential fork-in-the-road points in life.I don't know. Maybe I'm insane... It's just, I'm not. My default idea is that it's all me, and not anything coming from the outside. But when I look at the circumstances of these events throughout life, even if I'm quite resistant to such a partial abdication of responsibility, it does seem that, no, in fact something from the outside either directly messes my shit up, or my state inexplicably shifts in a way, that causes me to lose steam and crash into the nearest proverbial ditch.It's rather an odd and demotivating experience.

Ok how bout we take 30%?\\" Like why do you think it's okay for Israel to expand beyond the borders of their own proposed deals? Even if you support Israel taking 10%, should they not restrict themselves to that 10% and not expand further?But whatever, this is all sidetracking. It sounds like you agree the 2 state deal is dead, you just solely blame Palestinians. Okay, so what do you think should happen? Because let's take your assertion at face value, that Palestinians are at fault and will never agree to a 2 state deal, and so Israel has the right to keep expanding to the point where they can control all of Palestine if they so choose...okay. So what now? What should happen to the Palestinians within Israel's new territory that they've grabbed in your view? Judging from the way you've been talking so far I can't imagine you support giving them full citizenship within Israel... so what, expulsion? 2nd class citizenship where they're allowed to stay but not vote and have restrictions on birth rates or something?","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

No matter how cleverly articulated, the result is the same: The president and his agents are free to break the laws that apply to every other person in the nation. This newly minted imperial power is difficult to reconcile with an explicit presidential responsibility in Article II of the Constitution to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. The courts paradoxical holding is that the person we choose every four years to faithfully enforce our laws does not have to follow them. Why? Because if he must comply with our laws, it might render him fearful and cautious in office to the detriment of the responsibilities of the executive branch. The court cited no evidence or examples to support this concern. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson observed in dissent, this unsupported, counterintuitive holding allows a president to do whatever he wants as long as he uses his official powers to do so. The court has uprooted the principle that it is the law that is supreme, not our officeholders. There is a conspicuous flaw in the courts constitutional analysis. Although the Constitution provides impeachment as a method to remove a person from office for criminal behavior, the framers of the Constitution did not consider the remedy of removal alone to be sufficient. It provides that a person removed from office by impeachment shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law. The Trump majority evades the plain meaning of this text by noting that the clause does not indicate whether a former president may, consistent with the separation of powers, be prosecuted for his official conduct in particular. The courts reasoning is unconvincing. Alexander Hamilton participated in drafting the Constitution. In 1788 and before ratification, he and James Madison wrote a series of essays in the Federalist, articles designed to explain the workings of the new government and to quell critics fears about its various provisions. One major objection was that the president of the new nation would resemble the king of Great Britain in his unfettered powers. Not so, wrote Hamilton. Unlike a hereditary monarch, the president would serve a term of only four years, after which he would have to stand for reelection or rejection. More to the point, he elaborated on the generic judgment impeachment clause as it would apply to the president himself.\\nHamilton wrote: The President of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, removed from office, and would afterward be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. The person of the King of Great Britain [by comparison] is sacred and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which he can be subject without involving the crisis of a national revolution. We learned from Watergate that Nixons coverup was as serious as the crimes he was attempting to conceal. Now, the court has given the president the constitutional tools to accomplish the equivalent of a successful coverup in plain sight: a safe harbor against justice. The courts decision will embolden the president because he will no longer have anything to fear from the law. The courts holding that the president has unreviewable and absolute discretion over prosecutorial decisions means that if Donald Trump is reelected president, he can and most likely will dismiss all federal charges against himself. One seriously doubts that such a corrupt and egotistical act is what the framers had in mind when they called for an energetic independent Executive.\\nWill the public on whose support our institutions depend accept one set of rules for the president and his agents but another for themselves  a constitutional double standard?\\nAs the dissenting justices acknowledged, it is one thing  and entirely appropriate  to protect a president from criminal prosecution for the good-faith exercise of his or her legitimate power, even when the president is mistaken. The same considerations do not apply, however, when the evidence shows that the president intentionally violated clearly established criminal law, not in good faith, not to serve the nation, but to benefit himself. As the dissenters in the case explain, it is neither necessary, wise nor appropriate to resort to the extreme of removing the president from the reach of the justice system when a less drastic prophylactic would do. It is sufficient to give former presidents the protection of an adequate defense to criminal charges, a defense that honors the special and important responsibilities of the office. Without getting into details, such defense would include an as applied constitutional challenge to the application of a statute to the activity at issue, a defense of public authority to do what is in question, and having acted on authoritative advice of counsel. In conjunction with the robust procedural safeguards that every suspect and defendant enjoys, these defenses would accomplish the majority justices objectives. The final safeguards, of course, would be the criminal laws burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury trial by the former presidents peers.\\nIt would seem to come down to this consideration: Either we trust our justice system to resolve challenging cases and controversies appropriately, or we do not. Nowhere in the Constitution or the Federalist is there any provision, suggestion, or hint that the president can with impunity commit crimes against the state or lawlessly abuse citizens without recourse. But that is what the Supreme Court has left us: a kingdom within our republic.","title":"Opinion: Why the Supreme Courts immunity ruling is untenable in a democracy"},{"text":"I didn't say I hated taxes.

And that response runs directly contrary to how he handled Vader.As mentioned, it's not necessarily a problem that Luke, once the embodiment of hope, became cynical.  The problem is that the explanation of the situation for why he became cynical is itself more consistent with him *already* being cynical. If he won't kill his father he barely knows, who has done incredibly evil things, in the heat of a duel to the death why would we believe that he would murder his nephew, that he presumably knew very well (and maybe even loves) in his sleep when Kylo has yet to do anything wrong? The explanation requires an explanation.The problem was that TFA started with Luke doing something out of character, abandoning his friends in a crisis, so Johnson started out written into a corner.And yeah, Luke could be corrupted or become jaded. That's fine. There just needs to be a reasonable explanation behind it given how large a departure it was from his existing character. We didn't get that. Him not being perfect at the start of the OT is irrelevant. The whole point of their character arcs were them moving past that and developing into the people they needed to be to do their later heroic acts.

Obama back Clinton and put her in a position of power. Who cares if they are against him now. They loved him before he ran and will love him when hes done. When he was president he didnt change things and a lot of policies put in place by him are in effect now. Also he started the largest transfer of wealth in American history. He takes pride in the vaccine and started his on media platform. Something no president has ever done. Why should I look at any of this stuff and think hes going to be any different from what we had before?","title":"Why are all conspiracy seemingly only committed by the left/democrat?

The OT stands on in its own merits because if you havent seen the prequels, you will view Darth Vaders character entirely through his relationship with Luke. You will care about Darth Vader being saved not because he was once Anakin Skywalker, but because he is Lukes dad. The Original Trilogy wasnt written as a sequel to the Prequels, so they work perfectly by themselves. The Prequels reframe the OT by adding context to Vaders character so that the viewer cares about Vader independently of his relationship to Luke. The same cant be said about the Sequels because they are written as sequels. They are not written to be stand alone movies that you can watch without seeing the OT. Vader and Luke have that familial connection which gives their dynamic in ESB and ROTJ its weight regardless of the prequels. But Luke and Rey dont share any connection. The only way their dynamic has any weight is because of the OT. Without the OT, Luke is just some grumpy old guy who Rey has no reason to care about. In TLJ, Rey is trying to save the hero of the OT, whereas in ROTJ, Luke is trying to save his dad, who also happens to be the hero of the prequels.The reason older fans didnt mind Anakins history not being explained fully is simply because at that point, his purpose in the story had always been as a villain. That isnt the same as already having watched the OT, seeing Luke as a hero, and then finding out he raised his sword against his sleeping nepher which resulted in everything falling apart offscreen. If you watch the Sequels independently of the OT, they dont work because the context of the OT is required to understand them. If you watch them with the OT, they are unsatisfying ends to the characters of the OT.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Not Ohio, but I drive south from Raleigh to Jacksonville, NC and a few years ago it was Trump flags and signs the whole way.

They dont treat Palestinians as Israeli citizens because they arent Israeli citizens. Does the US give Mexican nationals all the benefits of US citizenship? Of course not. And Israeli Arabs have every right that Israeli Jews have. Sure theres discrimination which is lamentable, but hardly unique in the world.If you think Israel can just annex the Palestinian Territories without any (economic) repercussion I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. The vast\\nmajority of the US wouldnt support it. And this brings me to my next point and also your most condescending, arrogant argument. Its not at all like South Africa. White South Africans didnt have a history of 2000 years of having to rely on others only to be subject to horrible persecution, oppression, pogroms, murders, etc etc which essentially required them to have their own state for their very survival. You dont get to abuse Jews for 2000 years and then whine when Jews say hey we control our own destiny now. Thats the exact same cognitive dissonance that white racist americans have when black people take pride in themselves and they call it black supremacy. Youve obviously never once empathized with Jews or why the state of Israel actually needs to exist as a Jewish state. Jews have put their faith in others time and time again and it ALWAYS ends up the same with people turning on us, murdering us, and justifying it after the fact with whatever lie they need to make up to make themselves alright with it. Israel doesnt annex the Palestinian Territories because they know that for Israel to exist in a way that is not demographically untenable or in a way that would not result in a minority of Jews ruling over a majority of Arabs, is for two states. And thats precisely why the Arabs have never and will never agree to a two state solution.Israel is less of an ethnostate than any Arab state, or France, or Japan, or whatever. 20% of the population is Muslim Arab. Hard to exist as an ethnostate when you have minority populations that make up probably a third of your overall population. And you obviously dont have a problem with other ethnostates, because if you did, then Israel being an ethnostate wouldnt matter or register with you. Yet its littered throughout your post. If Israel shouldnt exist because its an ethnostate, then why should ANY Arab state exist?","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Same way Trumpers dont care about his.Also you say after he clearly lost when I would bet my life that either party would have,and should have, had questions when an election went down like that. One guy was leading in every swing state when voting stopped and the results were drawn out for days while votes still trickled in. I dont care if I was running for president and had won I would expect the opposing party to be very interested in how that went down and how for the first time in my life it took a days 9 times to call a winner. If we could spend 3 years looking into a collusion that doesnt exist I would think any reasonable person would want some clarity on what happened in 2020.FWIW I did not vote for Trump in 2020.","title":"CMV: I am a legal Immigrant to the US, can't fathom voting for Trump for undermining democracy and hence the American dream.

You also mentioned Jewish majority in Israel without acknowledging that there is a significant portion of the Israeli population who are Arab and who are citizens of Israel.What you mean is Palestinian Arabs in particular, not Arabs in general because there are Arabs in Israel, and if birthrates are anything to go by, they will surpass the Jewish population at some point in the future. Israel is only able to maintain Jewish population growth through immigration which they call Aliyah, but their birthrate is much lower than the Israeli Arab birthrate.In a hypothetical scenario where Arabs do become a majority in Israel, do you really think that they will just give the land back to their fellow Palestinian brothers? Of course not. Not even Arab Israelis want to concede land, nor do they want the Palestinians on their land.So, while I sort of agree with your premise, your argument is way off. This is not about Jewish supremacy, etc... it is about the many and varied peoples in Israel, which includes Israeli Arabs, not wanting to give up the country that they call home.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Can you say with a straight face that Israel would ever abandon half a million people and let them be turned into refugees?20% of Israel proper are Muslims with full Israeli citizenship and not second class citizens....And? My point is about what will happen when Israel formally annexes Palestinian territory. Their government officials have made it clear they want to keep the status quo of pretending Palestine is independent from Israel because if they were to admit Palestinians into their population as full citizens it would destroy the \\"Jewish character\\" of Israel. The only way to keep that character if they formally annex Gaza and the West bank would be to formally embrace apartheid. Do you disagree? Could Israel maintain its \\"Jewish character\\" if they were outnumbered by non-jews who could vote?You need to start labeling every Arab nation a Muslim supremacist apartheid stateWho says I don't?And as to your points about \\"what war is\\", no. That's what war \\"was\\". In the 20th century we made wars for the purpose of grabbing land illegal, hence why Israeli settlements are against international law.Edit: A lot of your post is premised on the idea that Israel would be happy to go back to 67 borders (or 95% of '67 borders as you put it) but that's contradicted by officials like Bibi Netanyahu who present maps at the UN where Palestine doesn't exist.

There are in Palestine about 1,200,000 Arabs and 600,000 Jews. For the Jews the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish State. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine. The discussions of the last month have quite clearly shown that there is no prospect of resolving this conflict by any settlement negotiated between the parties. But if the conflict has to be resolved by arbitrary decision, that is not a decision which His Majestys Government are empowered as Mandatory to take.Now, if the British are saying back in 1947 that this conflict is irreconcilable because one group wants sovereignty and the other group wants the first group to not have sovereignty, why is anyone under the impression that this conflict has anything to do with settlements? There were no settlements in 1947 there was no occupation in 1947. No security wall, no right wing government Israel didnt even officially exist yet. And yet still the conflict was irreconcilable even then. Israel removed every settlement from Gaza in 2005 and that did not bring the sides any closer to peace. Removing settlements from the West Bank wont result in any peace either.The central tenant and core of this conflict is as Bevin said nearly 80 years ago. For the Arabs, including Palestinians, but also the wider Arab world, ensuring that the Jews have NO sovereignty in any border is and has always been the issue.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

This is not a universal view, and even if you consider it immoral to pay for sex, the only morality you have a right to force on people is preventing immoral acts that violate someone's rights, which consenting to have sex for money isn't.I judge people based on my morality. I would prefer for laws to reflect my morality. But I know that is not true. I accept them regardless because that is the law. But regardless of whether the government deems prostitution, murder, rape,etc as legal,. I will still argue that they are morally wrong. Violating someone's rights is not the only thing which is immoral or illegal. Women can choose to have sex with whoever they want, however they want and they have the freedom of choice to do so. But if they accept payment in some form, then it becomes a business transaction and the government gets involved. For example we have minimum wage laws and laws to protects employees from being underpaid for their services by the employer. Many people who are homeless or who do not have jobs would gladly work for 1$ per hour because it is better than what they currently have. But that is not allowed because the government wants that if an employers hires someone they give them a certain minimum standard so they can get the bare necessities. There are many situations which involve exchange of goods between 2 people who consented to the exchange where the government gets involved to ensure things like no indirect harm to third party, both parties know the full details, etc. No amount of financial payment compensates a women for the services she provides. You could pay a women a billion dollars for a night and I would still argue that regardless of whether she accepts, it is not a valid compensation.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"strip's border is easier to control i imagine, i don't see how that'd happen unless something crazy happened.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Look at the maps that Bibi has presented in the UN, where Israel's borders extend through Gaza, they've made it clear they want the land. Every time they call it \\"Judea and Samaria\\" that's a re-affirmation of their long-term goals.And as far as \\"could anybody force them to be a secular democracy with full Palestinian participation\\" yes, the US could. Their entire state relies on US support. Is it likely that the US will force them to do that through economic coercion anytime soon? No, that's why I think it much more likely they'll set up a formal apartheid government over Palestine than one with full participation. But either case is infinitely more likely in my view than a 2 state solution.Lastly I would say Israel IS ethnically cleansing Gaza, and no one is stopping them. Saying Israel has prevented people from going to Egypt is simply not true, they've put pressure on Egypt to open their borders which Egypt doesn't want to do because they suspect Israel will not allow refugees to ever come back to Gaza. This isn't based on nothing, this is exactly what happened to the people in Gaza in the first place - they themselves are refugees and their descendants who were forced out of the lands Israel colonized.","title":"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead.

Yet, change can happen quickly with the right momentum. When one party is dragging the whole country farther right, we struggle to gain that momentum unless a critical mass happens &amp; enough people snap out of the fascist fog. I believe we need to reform politics, voting rights, the electoral college, etc so that we can have a more equitable and fair system but there are few options for change unless we unite or at least come to the table with some real solutions and authentic discourse. Neither can be accomplished with half of the country working against itself and another large segment who are completely apathetic. I agree with you that its not an ideal situation to be in. In fact, I see it as dangerous to democracy if we continue on this path so we need to position ourselves for a better outcome. Short of bloodshed (that no one should want), or a massive collapse of government (equally terrible), what other options do we have? We must work within the system and unify as Americans. We have the opportunity in this election to rally the apathetic voters and show them how powerful their votes actually are. Center and right leaning Rs are showing that theyre willing to work with us for democracys sake so let us show the extremists what a minority faction they truly are and all get out to vote. Unifying under VP Harris doesnt mean we all have to agree, it just means we see each other as deserving a seat at the table. Whereas, the other party (especially in my state) are actively trying to give our power away to the highest bidder. My sons first time voter registration was never entered into the system as my state was busy scrubbing the roles and suing to keep college students from being able to vote. He was able to catch it in time, thankfully. It infuriates me that anyone from any party needs to work this hard to vote. I personally, will do anything in my power to vote for a better future for my kids and their friends.

People don't realize that red states often don't have Dems on the ballot for many offices. Just an FYI for anyone wondering: The reasons for this are more complicated than no one being willing to run. I believe any red state can become AT LEAST a reddish purple. It's also no one willing to run and lose a ton of money (via lost work or whatever) because it's very hard to raise money and national and state Democrats don't assist in these kinds of races. It might be that there aren't experienced or trained campaign staffers and organizers in that area, and state Democratic party unwilling or unable to recruit good candidates and train them and their potential staff. These tend to be poorer areas where raising money is harder, and it's harder to pay campaign staff who might really need to be paid. Stacey Abrams and Beto (and many helping them) have been able to flip or bring their states closer to flipping by spending a lot of time in underserved populations, creating a culture of voters, and a pool of experienced political staffers and organizers. They've done this by repeatedly running and helping others run, and losing.","title":"I voted Harris Walz!

She was with other protesters protesting some Israeli settlers illegally stealing Palestinian homes and lands. The IDF had a group of troops there to protect the settlers and help them continue the theft. After a while the IDF shot a tear gas canister into the protesters and they dispersed. After everyone had run away the IDF fired one shot that ricocheted off a dumpster or other piece of metal, striking a Palestinian in the leg, then fired a second shot that hit Ms. Eygi in the back of the head, killing her.Operatives immediately flooded the zone with the narrative that she was actively attacking the soldiers, but it quickly came out that the activists had already dispersed. They shifted the story to say that she was throwing stones at the soldiers, but pretty soon more facts came out that showed that stones are not a threat to soldiers wearing body armor and riot gear. Immediately the new narrative was that she was throwing bricks, but that was quickly abandoned because it soon came out that she was .2km away from the soldiers, far out side the range that any human can throw stones or bricks. Instead, the new narrative that was injected was that she was using a sling to throw stones at the soldiers, a fairly unbelievable claim given that slings require a great deal of skill to use for both distance and accuracy. By that time the firehose of falsehoods had accomplished its goal, which was to flood the zone with so much misinformation that actual facts were buried. Facts like the fact she was facing away from the soldiers when she was shot in the back of the head, and was standing peaceably away from everyone. It was a straight up murder, just like Shireen was murdered.","title":"Family demands US-led probe after UW grad killed by Israeli forces in West Bank"},{"text":"Harris/ Walz is the most pro worker, pro union, pro environment, and pro human rights ticket of this century.Yep.

It is determining the ideology of a vote based on the vote split. It know that some justices typically group together in one camp and others group in another camp. So it's seeing how aligned justices are with their given camp. But the problem is that the cases that even get onto the Supreme Court docket at all are the ones chosen by the justices, which means that with the current court makeup they will be biased in favor of the cases that conservatives want to rule on. In a more liberal court, an extreme case like *Dobbs* never would have even gone onto the docket. Sometimes these extreme cases have a conservative dissenting judge, which lowers their Martin-Quinn score.
