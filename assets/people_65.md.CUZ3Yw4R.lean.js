That's just the way it is.For anyone that doesn't like Harris, consider this: Trump made hundreds of judicial appointments (some wholly unqualified), including three to the Supreme Court. The next president is likely to get at least two appointments to SCOTUS.Getting Trump reelected will badly hurt the progressive agenda. In fact, Trump poses a threat to the existence of Democracy itself.  Harris may not be the first choice of progressives, but she is light years better than Trump. The way forward is not by choosing a great leader. The way forward is by maintaining a system with strong institutions that can preserve our democracy even despite a bad leader like Trump. Trump plans to deliberately dismantle those institutions. Harris may not be liberal enough for some, but she will not tear down the institutions supporting democracy. The progressive resistance to Harris is based on a badly mistaken way of looking at politics and government. It boils down to Harris not passing the purity test. This is a revolutionary mentality that has never worked and never will. What works is an evolutionary mentality. We can move the country to the left incrementally. But it has to start with beating Trump. After Harris, we elect an even more progressive candidate. With each administration comes new career professionals, new laws, new judicial appointments, new cabinet appointments, etc.  Over time things evolve in a progressive direction.  All of this may fail if those on the left that are hopelessly ideological cannot see the truth of this and refuse to help stop Trump. Ironically, they'll blame this on Harris and the Democrats, but it's their own shortsightedness.  Getting Trump reelected will set the progressive agenda back decades and anyone that can't see that is a damned fool.I always vote progressive in the primaries. However, I refuse to throw my vote away on a third party candidate in the general election when, like it or not, this is a two-horse race. If Clinton had won in 2016, there would now be a 6-3 liberal majority on the US Supreme Court instead of the nightmare 6-3 far right majority we currently have. Women in this country became second class citizens because Clinton was not elected. We cannot afford to be obsessed with progressive purity or fantasize that ANY candidate we elect will be a saint. Hundreds of millions of real people got fucked over because the lesser evil lost in 2016. Let's not find out what additional injustices will be perpetrated under a second Trump term.Of course, I wish our system wasn't this broken. Obviously, I wish we had different choices. But do you seriously think Trump getting elected in 2016 and ensuring decades of a far right SCOTUS helped progressive causes? If you cannot see a difference between Trump and Harris, you're a hopeless ideologue and I wager you have the **privilege** of not being affected by the adverse consequences of your own purity-obsessed \\"progressivism\\" (that is, assuming you're even sincere). You people do know that progressivism means *advancing* liberal causes, right? Progresivism certainly doesn't mean moving us closer and closer to fascism.Harris is not perfect, but there is no symmetry between her and Trump. Voting for Stein or any other third party candidate serves no purpose better than it serves fascism. It is obvious that either Trump or Harris will win. It's also obvious that choosing Harris will better serve progressivism.

F you, Liz Cheney. You and your Dick.I would accept Tulsi Gabbard if she ends up running for President in 2028. If Kamala wins this year, Tulsi can beat Kamala straight up in 2028. Heck, I think if Tulsi ran against Trump still as a Democrat this year, she couldve won. Shes a far better speaker than either candidates and Tulsi doesnt come off fake and seems genuinely sincere for Americans quality of life.I read an article questioning Tulsis military background and how she hides what she did. How she was only on the medical staff team. She was ranked as lieutenant colonel with the Army Reserves, so she did something right while she was with the Armed Forces. I expect if she, Musk, or Kennedy do run in 2028, the MSM will slander them because they allied with Trump.Tulsi isnt some Janny-come-lately. While she was still a Democrat, she supported Trump when he was still President and has been critical of Biden/Harris since their inauguration. Now Im not sure if Tulsi or RFK Jr. believe there was a stolen election in 2020. But its great theyre on our side. Dems chose the wrong horse. Picked a donkey in a horse race. Kamala is a fucking idiot, and if she wins, this country is dead. Were being run by liberal women idiots for another 4 years like Kathleen Kennedy destroying Star Wars.Mark my words: Tulsi Gabbard WILL DEFEAT Kamala Harris in 2028 if Kamala wins tomorrow. Tulsi and Elon Musk (closest to a real life Tony Stark) will take back our country in 2028 if Trump does lose this years election.

Betting odds are purely a sign of where the money is coming in. Trump being a BETTING favorite currently just means more money has been placed on Trump than on Harris. Bookmakers are incentivized to adjust odds so that an even amount of money comes in on each outcome - that way the house always wins. If the overwhelming amount of bets/money is on one outcome, the house can get fucked without an equal amount of money having been placed on the opposite outcome to, in practice, cancel out payments to winning bettors. Just this basic knowledge of how betting lines are contrived should be enough for people not to put any serious consideration of them being indicators for future outcomes, but then you also have to consider that the population of people betting on a presidential race are self-selecting and in no way a representative sample of the voting population writ large, let alone likely voters in specific swing states who ultimately decide the final results of the election. Polling has been close for a month, and while the lack of statistical outlier polls raises some red flags for me as a data nerd, there really isnt much reason to believe this election isnt going to come down to ~200k votes in a couple of swing states like the last several elections. The only anomaly that I think possibly hasnt been accounted for in polling is the impact the Dobbs decision is going to have on voter turnout among cohorts that arent high propensity voters and/or possible affiliation shifts because of Dobbs like we see in the Selzer data from Iowa. This was widely missed or ignored in the 2022 midterm polling where it had a massive effect on the outcome being very different from polling. I am assuming that pollsters have corrected for this effect, but its entirely possible they havent, and that is the only way I see this election not having a very narrow margin of victory for the winner a la 16/20.","title":"The media claiming that Harris and Trump are neck, and neck in the polls is a Pay-op to prepare/allow the steal."},{"text":"![gif](giphy|pPhyAv5t9V8djyRFJH|downsized)","title":"I'm at work, but here are some lowlights of Trump's deteriorating mind on fully display in Pennsylvania!"},{"text":"Since early voting here is ONE location, it's the shenanigans and waiting for hoursDay of 15 min","title":"Harris has 4-point lead over Trump in final PBS News/NPR/Marist election poll"},{"text":"\\"And then everybody clapped\\"","title":"This race is close but I'm predicting Donald Trump wins the Electoral College -- and possibly the popular vote"},{"text":"*If it's what you say I love it, especially early in November!*","title":"Kamala Harris leads Michigan in 3-point swing with Republican pollster"},{"text":"Is this the political/economic/etc way of doing a if I dont get my way no one can have it?

They really believe it is just the media and democrats attacking him.  He didn't actually say those things, he didn't actually assault those women, he didn't actually commit those crimes.  Some people have heard the things he said, but don't believe he'd actually do it.   They believe he just rants a lot about the same things people care about.Meanwhile, they're paying an extra spicey amount for groceries and services.

There are plenty of people still voting Republican. In fact there are plenty of anti-MAGA Republicans voting against Trump while still voting for anti-MAGA Republican candidates down ballot. Not everyone votes based on their feelings; policy and standards of conduct do factor into those decisions.Its also naive to think any right afforded by the government are inalienable or guaranteed; as unfortunate as it is. It doesnt matter if youre in a republican or democrat state; the government owns you. They can deny you your rights without recourse and are very rarely held accountable for doing so themselves. And its the job of District Attorneys and Attorney Generals (like Kamala) to prosecute citizens and defend the state from liability. Its nice when they afford rights on paper, but theyre the first to deny citizens or strip them of their rights in practice.To that end, its important to be bi-partisan in expectations of conduct from our elected officials. In the same way republicans killed the border bill to campaign on, it can argued democrats took no action on codifying Abortion rights despite their warnings just to have an issue to campaign on. Theres nothing wrong with taking issue with both of these circumstances. Crying over whataboutism is a cop out; theres nothing wrong with having high standards for both sides of the aisle.","title":"Kathy Hochul says New Yorkers who vote Republican are anti-woman and anti-American"},{"text":"Regulators, where they exist, will turn a blind eye to black market imports.","title":"Trump promises tariffs of 25% to 75% on Mexican goods unless illegal immigration stops"},{"text":"There will always be battleground areas.

Amid the Lavender Scare of the 1950s and 60s, the Mattachine Society, once at the vanguard of the fight for gay rights, sought quiet assimilation, distancing itself from nonconforming members to avoid further scrutiny. In the aftermath of Stonewall, many distanced themselves from trans activists and radicals, fearing theyd hinder mainstream acceptance. During the AIDS crisis, grassroots organizers struggled for support as privileged voices pushed for quieter, less confrontational advocacy. When marriage equality took center stage, it further sidelined urgent issues affecting marginalized queer people. Today, trans-exclusionary gays echo this history, continuing a pattern that fractures the community and leaves its most vulnerable members behind, all in the name of respectability politics.","title":"JD Vance mocked for saying he thinks Trump will win 'the normal gay guy vote'"},{"text":"This will fire up the avocado toast crowd","title":"Trump promises tariffs of 25% to 75% on Mexican goods unless illegal immigration stops"},{"text":"Still the greatest country regardless of vote outcome.

High energy costs mean that goods cost more to produce and transport, which directly translates to increased prices for consumers. Producing more oil domestically will reduce the cost of energy. I think they've also been thinking about nuclear energy, which ties into 4.\\n4. Would be accomplished by reducing regulations and allowing oil companies to drill for oil in US territory.?\\n5.

Most of those supposedly sane people as well as almost all the donors will back a dictator over even the most moderate compromise with social democracy any day of the week.The underlying problem is that the socioeconomic policies the right peddles do not work, and at some point even most of their followers become aware of this, usually when the consequences hit them personally. But because their worldview doesn't allow for the existence of social progress, they lack the ideological tools to formulate a systemic critique, so they go for scapegoats. At this point, most of those supposedly moderate right wing politicians decide that democracy is negotiable, but their socioeconomic policies are not, and they either make common cause with the far right or become it. Invariably, they are then thrown aside by the lunatics they think they can control, which never works.There are always exceptions, but those are almost always too few to form a viable party, particularly in a two party system. In this they are the same as the followers who are turned off from the nascent authoritarian movement: they turn against it when it impacts them personally, which for the politicians means at the point where they realize they no longer have a place within the party political apparatus any more because they're not seen as \\"one of us\\" by the radicalized base.","title":"I Think Were in Trouble: Is There a Future for MAGA After Trump?"},{"text":"I love that video, it is putting Trump's blatant &amp; unnecessary lies on full display.      \\nThe sad thing is that his supporters there who could see with their own eyes that there were indeed lots of empty seats and people leaving early would just parrot his lie if you asked them about it, rather than report what they actually experienced. \\"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.

Hes a man of conviction, and hell choose to be damned before doing something unconstitutional. And his advisors probably wont want him to end his presidency on a bad note. Because, lets face it, if he DID declare them traitors and enemies of the state, if he did use his powers of official actions to remove and arrest the Supreme Court justices, it would start a civil war. The MAGA crowd would screech till their throats were bleeding that they were right and that democrats are tyrants, and they would rally together, grab their guns and begin chaos. Its bad optics, its worse outcomes. Now, Kamala, I trust that she wouldnt hesitate. Shes a badass, and historically a prosecutor. These people dont concern her, shes not afraid of them. She, I believe, I pray, would dole out justice swiftly and decisively, without any bullshit. Call them traitors to their face and sentence them accordingly.

She has NO idea WTF he is doing so she simply waves back and goes on her way, then she googles what it means when she gets to work and is like, oh, wow, he was saying \\"f-u\\" to me.She kept this from me for a few months then right before Halloween tells me as we are carving pumpkins on the steps of our place.

We often get a lot of feedback that were being too nitpicky on these kinds of claims that dont fall neatly into True or False. But politics, policy, misinformation and the claims we fact-check usually aren't black and white.I think as fact-checkers, its our job to split hairs a little. But we also work hard to make sure that were applying our ratings in a consistent way across a variety of claims.?When PolitiFact editors [decide a rating](https://youtu.be/wGjM3tkGgI8) on a fact-check, [they ask a lot of questions](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings), like How have we rated similar claims in the past? and Is there another way to read this statement? (To be clear, this isnt just the editors asking this in their heads; theyre asking these questions out loud in a meeting with the reporter.) The goal of these questions is to kind of pull apart the claim, consider it from every angle and ensure our fact-check captures the nuance of it.At the end of the day, our ratings are a judgment call. But its a judgment call made using a tried and true process to help our readers place political rhetoric on a spectrum of truthfulness.

It's the very reason they are voting for him. They care about democracy about as much as he does. As Psychologist Elizabeth Mika put in in a 2018 essay on \\"Tyranny as a Triumph of Narcissism\\":\\"The narcissistic collusion between the tyrant and his supporters is also driven by their need for revenge, for the tyrant is always chosen to perform this psychically restorative function: to avenge the humiliations  narcissistic wounds  of his followers and punish those who inflicted them.The tyrant and his followers typically choose as vessels of their negative projections and aggression members of the society who are not just different but weaker than themselves. The tyrant fuels that aggression in order to solidify his power but also to deflect it from himself, shield his own narcissism, and repair his own narcissistic injuries dating to his childhood days. The figure of the narcissistic parental abuser / tyrant is protected through the scapegoating and the return to authoritarian, order-and-obedience based mode of social functioning promised by the tyrant, as he himself assumes the mantle of father-protector and directs his own and his supporters aggression onto the Others who have nothing to do with their real and perceived wounds.https://medium.com/@Elamika/tyranny-as-a-triumph-of-narcissism-76b6fec76d0d","title":"Trumps Closing Message to Voters Just Got Even More Dark: Donald Trump is revealing how little he cares for democracyand how his second term will be all about retribution."},{"text":"Which is why we should not vote for him","title":"Trump warns voters that his second term would get nasty at times"},{"text":"You too","title":"The media claiming that Harris and Trump are neck, and neck in the polls is a Pay-op to prepare/allow the steal."},{"text":"Imagine him trying to fight like Deadpool?","title":"Trump talks about reporters being shot and says he shouldn't have left White House after 2020 loss"},{"text":"i mean, your vote is effectively meaningless voting 3rd party.

It doesn't negate the collective punishment or the knowing killing of civilians.Actually it does. For a very good reason. If hiding among civillians effectively prevents any strike. It encourages you to hide among civillians. Which is obviously a terrible thing. It was well understood you can't expect a millitary to be effectively neutralised by 'loophole war crimes'. Therefore it was made clear, if you hide among civillians, you are responsible for any deaths. Now, obviously this is combined with some element of proportionality. Which was designed for the purpose that a couple of low rank soldiers walking down a busy street does not give you the right to carpet bomb the whole thing. This is whats known as being grossly disproportionate.In fact Israel has been mindful of this. For example they've refrained from striking a lot of rocket sites or hospitals (which have lost their protection due to being used as millitary bases). A single rocket is capable of killing 10s of Israelis. Meaning its almost never going to be grossly disporportionate even if it killed 100+ civillians for a single rocket. However to protect gazans we've not seen so many strikes, or at least we've seen roof knocking/telephoning (which isn't really an obligation as it risks the rockets being fired off). So I can't see how you can possibly blame Israel. They've arguably acted beyond any country in history in this response. I do not see any other country being attacked and acting beyond their obligations under international law. They've ensured gazans in unoccupied areas receive aid/food - even though this is not obligated.","title":"Not sold on Harris over Gaza yet anti-Trump, some Pa. activists are asking blue-state voters to cast protest ballots on their behalf"},{"text":"I saw Marijuana Abortion open for Concrete Blonde at Visage in 1993.","title":"Florida will vote on marijuana, abortion in an election that will test GOP's dominance"},{"text":"Chew him up and spit him out ladies ?","title":"Final polls reveal Trump faces huge gender gap as women flock to Harris"},{"text":"My 90 year old mother wants to do a hit on him.

There is little to fear here.The article you linked provides ample meat for those who must get their fix on fear.

The antidote here is to reflect upon the success ratio of Team Trump in the courts as it pertains to this sort of nonsense of the Big Lie.  Although folk can point out some of the recent actions from SCOTUS as benefitting Trump, his overall track record with SCOTUS is abysmal.  Furthermore, despite dozens of lawsuits stemming from the 2020 election, Team Trump won almost a clean zero from all of that.","title":"New poll spells hope for Harris as she leads Trump in four key swing states"},{"text":"What I love *most* about this is that 4pts is **outside** of the commonly-applied margin of error.**FTW.**","title":"Harris has 4-point lead over Trump in final PBS News/NPR/Marist election poll"},{"text":"And all the people responsible for it will probably end up having shows on MSNBC where they talk non-stop about how appalled they always were by it despite the fact that they never lifted a finger to stop it.","title":"The GOP Scapegoating of Haitian Immigrants is Despicable"},{"text":"Succinct, concise, and simple, yet underutilized.

When it comes to a major rally, weve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so were listening for anything new or newsworthy.For live fact-checking a debate, its a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (Not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the Trump-Harris debate was 100+ pages long.) One group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/11/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-harris-trump/) out quickly.?And then theres big breaking news events, like the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Trump assassination attempt in July or Hurricane Helene or Election Day, where we cant really prepare. Breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation.?In these cases, were often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities. But during breaking news, were more concerned about getting it right than getting it first.?","title":"Were part of the PolitiFact team fact-checking the 2024 Election - Ask Us Anything!"},{"text":"So what did you tell your womens group he actually meant by that then?","title":"When Trump says hes going to protect women, we know he means control"},{"text":"Where is south african skipper to provide the black people to pretend they care about Trump just to be left stranded?","title":"Its a ghost town at Trumps Election Eve rally"},{"text":"The sole people that would make it an issue of republicans vs democrats are chronically online conspiracy theorists and the sole that Will fall for it are Gen Z and some adults with the understanding of poltics of a toddler.

The Reaper drone for example didn't enter service until 2007 and wasn't fully operational until 2009.  Drones during the Bush years were primarily surveillance, although the Predator could be armed with Hellfire missiles (hence there were some strikes).  During the Obama years, with the introduction of the Reaper, there was a shift towards using drones as opposed to large scale troop deployments to go after targets.None of the above should be taken as \\"drones strikes are good\\" or \\"bad\\", but rather just to put some context around the comparison.  Regardless of what one thinks about them, clearly Bush initiated the situation that led to their use, there was some level of transparency and reporting with Obama, and Trump clearly showed how pro-killing brown people he was... or rather hid that fact from many people.","title":"Trumps Anti-War Charade Deserves a Challenge"},{"text":"You are completely underestimating how many people despise the orange man","title":"The media claiming that Harris and Trump are neck, and neck in the polls is a Pay-op to prepare/allow the steal."},{"text":"testimony.?","title":"If there was evidence that Trump was on Epstein's list, why wouldn't Democrats disclose it to gain an advantage in the upcoming election?"},{"text":"Okay help me out.

(The other poster who pointed out that the bell-curve extends beyond the edges of the MoE is also correct.)However, one key thing to remember is that MoE only measures random sampling error, and assumes that the sample drawn reflects a perfectly random sample (like drawing marbles out of a bag). MoE was a really useful measurement back in the days when survey response rates were over 50%, because a poll behaved a lot like a random sample. Now, it's much less useful because response rates are so low and likely non-representative. Pollsters have attempted to correct for low response rates by ensuring that their their samples demographically fit what they think turnout will be (using quotas to make sure their survey fits the electorate, and/or adjusting the weights of different demographics after). However, this process can be prone to error because it relies on pollsters making assumptions about turnout. MoE does not at all address errors from assumptions made about turnout, or non-representative samples.","title":"Harris has 4-point lead over Trump in final PBS News/NPR/Marist election poll"},{"text":"As a registered GOP voter who will be voting for Harris/Walz, I approve this message.","title":"I'm at work, but here are some lowlights of Trump's deteriorating mind on fully display in Pennsylvania!"},{"text":"Market makers want to make the most money from all sides, so they adjust the betting line.\\n  \\nGiven there is one day to go and most polling points to a toss up, there is little grist to take advantage of on either side.\\n  \\nSo the odds, quite predictably given the circumstances, should narrow in order to tempt those who haven't yet lept in to put some money down to do so.","title":"Polymarket: Trump 56% Harris 43%"},{"text":"Of course he's worn out and low energy.

([These are also strategies that non-journalists can use in their search)](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/curriculum/). Well research a claim, the person/account who made it and see what pops up.?1. Who is behind the information?\\n2. What is the evidence?\\n3. What do other sources say??Very often, a simple search of a claim (Ex. [What did Trump do with the Affordable Care Act](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+did+Trump+do+with+the+Affordable+Care+Act&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=What+did+Trump+do+with+the+Affordable+Care+Act&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzMyOWowajGoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)) will pop up many news articles (or even fact-checks) that will give you the information you need. Very often, that information can point us fact-checkers toward the right sources and data to start writing a fact-check.?Something that an average person likely wouldnt do is then contact often 5+ experts from across the political spectrum to talk either over the phone or email and answer some specific questions about the information. Thats what we do at PolitiFact. That diversity of sources is key to getting a measured view of the issue.PolitiFact uses on-the-record interviews and publishes a list of sources with every fact-check. When possible, the list includes links to sources that are freely available, although some sources rely on paid subscriptions (Lexis Nexis, some subscriber-only news subscriptions). The goal is to help readers judge for themselves whether they agree with the ruling.?As far as the review, PolitiFact reporters submit their fact-check for a first read by a main editor, then it is second-read by another editor and a copy editor.

This is more of a constitutional issue.The reason we can apply certain rules like equal time and previously, the fairness doctrine, to broadcast stations is because they are using public airwaves. That is the key distinction that allows the government to regulate speech. Because you need a license to use these frequencies and there are limits to how many can be given out just due the nature of over the air channels and bandwidth.Because of the public nature and limitation to access, they have been able to convince the courts that this type of speech regulation is allowable under the first amendment. But when those conditions are not present it becomes incredibly difficult for any sort of regulations on political speech to be constitutional.Newspapers, newsletters and pamphlets have no such restrictions because they do not use public resources to be printed. We have no rules saying that newspapers must give each candidate equal access. You do not need a federal license to print a paper and anyone can go and do it.And basically the same is true for cable TV and the internet. There are low barriers to entry, no federal licensing requirements, and almost unlimited number of channels and viewpoints.Look I don't like how Fox News and Newsmax distort the truth, outright lie, and use propaganda techniques on us. But I also do not know how we fight that within the confines of the first amendment.

Peanut had lived with Mark Longo and his wife, Daniela, for the past seven years; Fred had lived there for about five months. Rescuing Peanut from near-death and bonding with him had inspired the couple to start a nonprofit animal sanctuary  PNut Freedom Farm  and Fred had been left at their doorstep.But then, on Oct. 30, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) raided their home, and after a five-hour search, the two animals were confiscated. According to a statement given to WENY, a local TV station, by the DEC and the county health department, Peanut had bitten one of the investigators, and both animals had to be euthanized in order to test for rabies.In a more reasonable timeline, the animals caretakers and fans would mourn them, and perhaps it would spark internet discourse on the ethics of keeping wild animals indoors, effectively as pets. (All the other animals in their care live outside.) But like a 2024 Murphys law, if something ends up trending, it must become political.So when Longo posted about his anger with the DEC for using tax dollars to raid his nonprofit sanctuary, it got picked up by local Republican politicians blaming Gov. Kathy Hochul. Then Elon Musk, the world richests man, got involved, meming the squirrel to oblivion while his minions began cranking out AI sludge of former President Donald Trump and Peanut standing triumphantly, together. Trumps campaign posted on TikTok: Vote Trump for Peanut. His account wrote that Peanut was needlessly murdered by Democrat bureaucrats in New York, adding: We will avenge you on Tuesday at the ballot box.By Sunday, the squirrel was on the cover of the New York Post.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/peanut-the-squirrel-trump-maga-backlash-1235152260/](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/peanut-the-squirrel-trump-maga-backlash-1235152260/)","title":"Heres Why Trumps Campaign Is Posting About a Dead Squirrel"},{"text":"you make an excellent point there ??","title":"Transcript: Trumpworld Rattled as Polls Show Undecideds Move to Harris"},{"text":"In an ideal world, Trump will lose and MAGA will form a third party (the Patriot Party, as Trump once threatened the RNC with) and take all the crazies (anti-vaxxers, insurrectionists, election deniers) with them and let sane people like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger take the reigns for the Republican Party.","title":"I Think Were in Trouble: Is There a Future for MAGA After Trump?"},{"text":"Thanks for the information!","title":"Trump Is Going to Win The 2024 Election"},{"text":"That statistic is misleading.","title":"Almost as if the GOPs entire post-Dobbs approach has been a Little Bighorn-level strategic misfire"},{"text":"I am a white woman and I am voting for Harris.","title":"Final polls reveal Trump faces huge gender gap as women flock to Harris"},{"text":"I trust she'll win the popular vote easily.I do not trust Trump's loyalists' willingness to fuck shit up at the local/state level to fuck with the Electoral College.","title":"US presidential election updates: Poll shows Harris ahead in early voting as Trump jokes about reporters being shot"},{"text":"I wish those behind the camera wouldve made a stand, said his calls for violence are disgusting and worrisome and that they need to stop filming, pack up and leave.For how much he hates the fake media, he loves having cameras on him.

Better to fail because you didn't try than to fail because you aren't good enough.And finally, they *are* putting in the effort. But into fighting the results, not winning votes.
