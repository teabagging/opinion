The vengeful prankster in me has had a devilish thought though.Suppose, just for the sake of argument, that Trumplestiltskin is taking a page out of Putin's book.Did he call all the gangsters, outcasts and neocons in to make them the offer that they could go legit, become heroes and make lots of money so long as they danced to his tune, or be steamrolled by the new regime?What would redeem his reputation, make him practically untouchable politically, (or legally) allow him to leave an indelible mark on D.C. and fuck the people who've been fucking him, all while simultaneously securing a great legacy as President that you know he desperately craves?Why, all he has to do is actually start cleaning house and it just so happens that most of his enemies are also the people's. All he has to do, is start going after them for what they dared not go after him for. They telegraphed their greatest weakness in all the lawfare they waged against him.It's the churn that allows it. The situation is fluid and in those times, nearly all things become possible. Interests begin to shift, overlap and align strangely. Even unrecognizeably.Would that be anything like what I would predict or expect to happen by even the most remote stretch of the imagination, if he were just a politician of the current kind? Fuck no.But it is exactly the kind of thing I would expect from a New York real estate tycoon who's used to dealing with organized crime in some fashion or other just to be able to operate, who also has a fine, cold hatred of the people that have been abusing power with such impunity to fuck him over.I mean, making Tulsi the Intelligence Director, while she's on the terrorist watchlist for speaking out against war? RFK getting put in charge of overseeing the agencies and companies in bed with and working with each other hand in hand to smear, defame and dehumanize him during the pandemic? A border czar that is a complete *asshole*, while making very well-argued stands on principle and taking no shit from anyone?Trumplestiltskin appears to be basically assembling a team of the established order's greatest, most resilient and competent foes, then loosing them to rage among their formerly invincible enemies who have sneered at and denigrated them.In this framing, it is easier to see. Remember. He's meant to be the people's avatar of wrath, assembling a team of anti-heroes. He's putting them there to kick ass and chew bubblegum, but picked only people who don't like bubblegum, because that would be too sweet.If he starts actually going after corruption, he could even quite easily free himself of the grip of the AIPAC \\"handlers\\" who did a great deal to put him there. Including members of his administration he has been forced to accept as a result. A man like that chafes under someone else's bootheel, after all. Wouldn't be the first time he's fucked over people who thought they could control him with money, which is something he's never really valued or respected, except as an expedient means to his desired ends, whatever they are at the time.Lastly, he has nothing whatsoever to lose and absolutely everything to gain by doing what he wants, which is clearly payback. But most especially payback people cheer for. Those in power tried to kill him, or at least get him killed and nobody seriously believes otherwise, even if they are often too afraid to say so in the climate we've endured.He cannot run for office again and he has zero incentive to keep the existing order of aristocracy intact. In fact, he cannot afford leave such potent enemies at his back as he exits the post.He indeed has every incentive to fundamentally restructure or raze the basis of his enemy's power, wherever he finds it and as fast as he can do it.He's smart in the right ways necessary to instinctively sense the opportunity and necessity, at least. I think that's really what has the bourgeois Neolibs terrified, scrambling and flailing.Whether he seizes the opportunity with any competence and effectiveness or not, remains to be seen.","title":"Trump picks Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general alls I can say is that were in for a hell of a ride the next four years."},{"text":"Time to rape America instead.","title":"Matt Gaetz just resigned from Congress, ending a probe into sexual misconduct and drug use"},{"text":"If Im doing my math correctly, Tran would need to win the remaining votes (assuming theres around 24k out) by just a point and a half.If the remaining drops are even a fraction as good as they have been, he wins.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 13, 2024"},{"text":"I'm out of the loop, too busy studying for tests, what position has Gaetz been considered for?","title":"Now Matt Gaetz?!"},{"text":"[Thats the neat thing](https://youtu.be/se17_0zbZds)","title":"Republicans have control of all 3 branches of government and the Supreme Court."},{"text":"Sounds like the perfect candidate for attorney general","title":"Matt Gaetz resigning from Congress \\"immediately,\\" Johnson says"},{"text":"I think you're a bit confused, they say that of the Muslims, not illegals.","title":"Thousands of undocumented immigrants live in CT.

Forget all the campaign rhetoric and kayfabe conflict. This is what's real. This is what deserves your attention.They do not hate each other. They do not see one another as an existential threat to the nation. They are not enemies. They're barely even opponents. When the show is over they hug and kiss like boxers after weeks of phony trash talk made solely to sell pay-per-views.One may say his opponent is the next Hitler, coming to end democracy and take everyone's votes and destroy the country. The other may say his opponent is a communist dictator, come to do the same. But when the play is over the performers hold hands and bow, and then they go out and have a drink together.They each pretend to be fighting against each other in defense of you and your interests, when in reality they're on the same side, fighting against you, in defense of the interests of oligarchy and empire.You can see it right there. They're not hiding it anymore. They don't have to. It was all a show, and they're openly admitting it. A friendly match, like two rich ladies playing tennis at the Hamptons. They can show it openly because they know most of you won't pay attention to what you are seeing, or if you do you'll forget all about it and get swept up in the heat of the next election cycle. There's so much messaging reinforcing the illusory partisan divide that these tacit little admissions tend to go completely overlooked.Don't get me wrong, the depravity of Trump himself is not illusory. Real people are going to suffer and die under his administration, just as real people suffered and died under Biden's. But they themselves know they have nothing to fear. They and the powers they serve will go completely untouched by the imperial murder machine. They will die of old age surrounded by wealth and luxury, completely free from any consequences for their actions.It was all a sham. Always is. The elections are fake and the game is rigged. The empire will march on completely uninterrupted and entirely unchanged, served by one fraudulent president after the next until its eventual collapse.Stop buying into the performance. Stop screaming for your favorite political pro wrestler and notice that the blows aren't connecting and the whole match is just a show.If you want to fight the power, focus your opposition where the real power is. The war machine. Imperial power structures. Intelligence agencies. Plutocracy. Capitalism. Fully unplug your emotional energy from the illusion of electoral politics and dedicate your attention instead to the concrete movements of weapons, resources, and wealth.As long as they can keep us clapping along with the puppet show, we're never going to pay attention to the forces pulling the strings. We're never going to bring enough awareness to the real problems to find actual solutions and carry them out. We're never going to be able to bring real opposition to real power.And that's the whole idea. That's why this silly puppet show keeps coming back every four years.Stop clapping along and start looking around the theater.

In the Navy a ships competency in [damage control](https://youtu.be/d5v6hlRyeHE?si=xevyfcnFR7gmfGue&amp;t=148) can be more in vital then their ability to load a cannon. Basically it does not matter if you have the biggest, fastest, most armored, most accurate, and rapid firing ship. If your crew lacks competency in damage control you you are floating in a glass cannon. This is why the US really had it easy taking Japan in WW2 in naval engagements because of how easy it was for US sailors to participate in damage control reactions to attack. Something Japan failed at miserably in comparison due to their command structure and in ability to grasp complex machinery [intuitively](https://youtu.be/iC6LN3U5ELk?si=L829uGbFpAKBDgWK&amp;t=375).I bring this comparison up because a military commanded by the incompetent (Like Hitler when he through out all his military advisors) will fail even if they have the top technological advancements out their.Dictatorships are okay with incompetent peopleNot at this scale in a country that already has this much communication and freedom.

In May, the House passed the Equality Act, voting to guarantee critical non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people among other crucial rights.- **Appointed anti-LGBTQ judges: Trump has appointed anti-LGBTQ judges with alarming anti-LGBTQ records to appointments at every level of the judicial system, including anti-equality Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and federal nominees Kacsmaryk, Mateer, Bounds, Vitter. Menashi and others.**- Supported employment discrimination against LGBTQ people: The Trump administration submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting discrimination against LGBTQ people.- Rolled back Obama-era non-discrimination protections: Trumps Department of Justice upended previous DOJ interpretations of the Civil Rights Act that protect transgender and non-binary workers from employment discrimination and ceased enforcing non-discrimination protections as well as taking a hostile stance to LGBTQ workers in court.- Issued rule to license discrimination: Trumps Department of Labor issued a regulation designed to allow federal contractors to claim a religious exemption to fire LGBTQ workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.- Undermine Section 1557 Rule: HHS published a proposed major change to the administrative rule interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to remove explicit protections for LGBTQ people in healthcare programs and activities by excluding LGBTQ people from protections from discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender identity.- Created a Religious Discrimination Division: HHS created a new office whose sole purpose would be to defend physicians and other medical professionals who decide to refuse care, including to LGBTQ patients.- Suggested it is acceptable for schools to discriminate against LGBTQ students while accepting tax-payer funds: Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has refused to rule out federal funding for schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students and has declined to state she would otherwise intervene should discrimination occur.- Allowed emergency shelters to deny access to transgender and gender nonconforming people: Despite the fact that LGBTQ people are significantly more likely to experience homelessness in their lives, HUD Secretary Ben Carson has proposed a rule to permit emergency shelters to deny access or otherwise discriminate against transgender and gender nonconforming people who are homeless. HUD also canceled a scheduled survey on LGBTQ homelessness.- Allowed foster care programs to discriminate while accepting tax-payer funds: Trump-Pence White House has proposed a federal regulation that would strip away nondiscrimination requirements and permit all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant recipients, notably adoption and foster care agencies, to discriminate against LGBTQ people, and in many circumstances religious minorities and women, and still receive federal funding.- Eliminated information on LGBTQ rights, mentions, and representation on government websites: Within hours of Trumps swearing-in, pages on LGBTQ rights and recognition were removed from government websites, including the White House.He obviously doesn't care about the LGBT community being discriminated, sure.

You can find it in Pew research about the wealth gap under his administration, despite American productivity being at record high levels for any point in human history.I argued that, it's not that we can be more efficient, but that pay per worker's efficiency output has decreased relative to inflation and the costs of living under current trends, starting with Reagan's Trickle Down and continuing to today. That it's CEO and board compensation, and stock buybacks, and historic levels of lending (new dollars generated through interest,) that keep the working class families poor.What do we think?","title":"Voters elected Hitler because they liked his fascist promise.

Where to start.Start here:- Opposition to the Equality Act: Despite support from almost every segment of the U.S. population and a majority of Republicans, President Trump opposed the Equality Act. In May, the House passed the Equality Act, voting to guarantee critical non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people among other crucial rights.- Appointed anti-LGBTQ judges: Trump has appointed anti-LGBTQ judges with alarming anti-LGBTQ records to appointments at every level of the judicial system, including anti-equality Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and federal nominees Kacsmaryk, Mateer, Bounds, Vitter. Menashi and others.- Supported employment discrimination against LGBTQ people: The Trump administration submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting discrimination against LGBTQ people.- Rolled back Obama-era non-discrimination protections: Trumps Department of Justice upended previous DOJ interpretations of the Civil Rights Act that protect transgender and non-binary workers from employment discrimination and ceased enforcing non-discrimination protections as well as taking a hostile stance to LGBTQ workers in court.- Issued rule to license discrimination: Trumps Department of Labor issued a regulation designed to allow federal contractors to claim a religious exemption to fire LGBTQ workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.- Undermine Section 1557 Rule: HHS published a proposed major change to the administrative rule interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to remove explicit protections for LGBTQ people in healthcare programs and activities by excluding LGBTQ people from protections from discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender identity.- Created a Religious Discrimination Division: HHS created a new office whose sole purpose would be to defend physicians and other medical professionals who decide to refuse care, including to LGBTQ patients.- Suggested it is acceptable for schools to discriminate against LGBTQ students while accepting tax-payer funds: Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has refused to rule out federal funding for schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students and has declined to state she would otherwise intervene should discrimination occur.- Allowed emergency shelters to deny access to transgender and gender nonconforming people: Despite the fact that LGBTQ people are significantly more likely to experience homelessness in their lives, HUD Secretary Ben Carson has proposed a rule to permit emergency shelters to deny access or otherwise discriminate against transgender and gender nonconforming people who are homeless. HUD also canceled a scheduled survey on LGBTQ homelessness.- Allowed foster care programs to discriminate while accepting tax-payer funds: Trump-Pence White House has proposed a federal regulation that would strip away nondiscrimination requirements and permit all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant recipients, notably adoption and foster care agencies, to discriminate against LGBTQ people, and in many circumstances religious minorities and women, and still receive federal funding.- Eliminated information on LGBTQ rights, mentions, and representation on government websites: Within hours of Trumps swearing-in, pages on LGBTQ rights and recognition were removed from government websites, including the White House.Go address all of those. Trump has continually pushed and/or enabled discrimination against the LGBT community while opposing laws to enshrine anti-discrimination protections for them.since Trans people are more likely to have mental health issues.If mental health is the issue, why not just target that then? Go figure on why trans people have been singled out.Thirdly, the Equality Act was filled with a lot of far-left positionsAh yes, the far-left position of granting the LGBT community the same anti-discrimination protections as other protected classes.Trump opposes that, and you wonder why people think Trump is homophobic?

Supreme Court justices lean conservative, but they are not loyal to Trump and are relatively moderate in comparison to many MAGAs. And Trump does not CONTROL congress. They are their own entity. As we saw in 2018, many moderate Republicans are willing to stand up against Trump when he goes too far... I think we will see more this time around now that Trump is a lame duck and everyone is sick of him.  Once Americans, and more importantly american businesses, begin to suffer, Congress will turn on him.Officers can band together and throw out or work around appointed positions if they see them as unfit, which they certainly would be if Trump scrubs the generals and appoints loyalists.Finally, there is not a GOP supermajority, so the constitution will not be changed without Democrat support - the president cannot violate the constitution. \\nIn other words, there are too many people with too much to lose to allow Trump to take things as far as you suggest. While the drama and BS will be beyond what we have ever experienced, and America will come out of this bruised and broken, I am not sold on the idea that MAGAs will take things  so far that there will be a military takeover and full dictatorship.","title":"CMV: The US military is about to become trump's personal plaything"},{"text":" My phone is blowing up with Senate Republican aides aghast at Trumps nomination of GaetzHonestly i think i have more respect for the MAGA chuds who just want to own libs and are proud of it.

First, lets observe that there was no mention of Gay Marriage in that screed. NONE.1. Opposing the equality act.  So, the Democrats had full control over government from 2021-2022.  They must have passed that law then right?  If not, why not?2.  Appointing anti gay judges. The only example they could find was Barrett voting against the group that wanted to force a Christian to do work that ran counter to her beliefs.  3.  Overturning Roe v. Wade.  Not entirely sure how it is a \\"queer issue\\" despite that article claiming it is.  In fact, I would say that abortion is one of the LEAST queer issues there is.  4.  The Bostock case was 6-3 in favor of the plantiff, and the dissent was not around the rights of gay people, but whether the legislature covered them.  Alito's dissent recognized the popularity of the decision, but he dissented because it was legislating from the bench. Which he has consistently been against.  Kavanaugh dissented on separation of powers grounds, while saying the platiffs can take pride in their arguments and the result. 5.  Says that queer people would be disproportionately impacted by repeal of the ACA.  (which isn't going anywhere),  And said that trump is against \\"gender affirming care\\" for trans kids.  GOOD.  We don't let kids get tattoos.  Not sure why we should let them cut off their dicks and breasts and sterilize themselves.6. Trans kids were bullied at distrubingly high rates in 2023? Well we should be glad that president is gone!7. Not letting trans women shelter with biological women?  Again...good.  Bio-women should be safe in homeless and battered women sheltered from trans women.  I have pity for them, but this is EXACTLY the sort of issue that caused people to actualy vote for Trump.8.  Enact Deploy or Get out? Again...good!  people who are non deployable should not be in the Military.  When I was in, non-deployable soldiers were a burden on the unit.9.  Why the hell should US Embassies be flying Pride flags?  And they are trying to co-op the Palestinian cause as a queer one, lamenting that Trump told Biden he \\"should let Israel finish the job\\"?  And blaming trump for how Chechnya (a Muslim controlled area) treats gays?  Are you kidding me?  10.  Totally agree there was definitely a campaign run at the expense of trans people this year.  But perhaps there wouldn't be if a highly visible segment of them didn't insist on doing drag shows for kids and putting gay-erotic literature in junior high and elementary school libraries, while a loud contingent of mainstream liberals applauded them.  Again, another reason why people voted for Trump.","title":"LGBTQ+ couples are racing to get married before Donald Trump takes office"},{"text":"Ive been a litigation attorney for 26 years, including handling numerous capital-level criminal cases as a prosecutor and defense attorney, and dozens of jury trials in civil matters including, among other things, police civil rights litigation, employment disputes, various general business disputes, and some personal injury defense.

Trump top down exercises an installment of the command structure down to a division (a major general that commands 10-15k) That's about. That's about 500 just in that position alone. So in reality you are looking at a need to at least change out 1,000 people to be your unquestionable lacky and probably another few thousand others below the generals to solidify it.Even that 1,000 is going to be virtually impossible to find religious trump zealots who are also competent in military capabilities because anyone with that type of competence knows that a US violating it's own rights to install a dictatorship/pho democracy/opposition removal is almost immediately going to loose NATO support. Even in the case Russia takes advantage and takes over Europe Russia will never support the US less they burn even more ties with China which a US in civil war is not really enticing to Russia if the person they would support would still be against their current biggest Ally.So in the end if Trump went down this route to Democrats biggest fear the US would cease to exists as 50 states under one banner and instead Trump would be lucky if he controlled red states as even in republican states I would wager the power houses of Utah, Texas, and possibly Florida would likely consider succeeding along with democrat states to form their own country or coalitions.","title":"CMV: The US military is about to become trump's personal plaything"},{"text":"Voters did not elect Hitler.

Most people don't care either way, but to them it's \\"unfair\\" they are following the rules and other women aren't. They want those women to be forced to do it and to be punished.

She has blamed NATO and the U.S. for Russias invasion of Ukraine (again, to the celebration of both Russian and Chinese state media), has repeated Russian propaganda claims that the U.S. has set up secret bioweapons labs in that country, and has argued that the U.S. not Russia is wholly responsible for Putins nuclear brinkmanship.On Syria, Gabbard has gone far beyond Trumps skepticism for continued U.S. military presence in the country. Regurgitating propaganda from Syrian President Bashar al Assads regime, she has blamed Trump for Syrias challenges and expressed sympathy for Assads leadership.

That'll give you the tools you'll need to look into the bills discussed and how anti-BDS stances are both pro-israel and firmly unamerican.Tulsi Gabbard's Israel StanceBased on the search results, here is a summary of Tulsi Gabbards views on Israel and Zionism:    Support for Israel: Gabbard has expressed her commitment to maintaining a strong alliance with Israel and has co-sponsored bills reaffirming the US commitment to Israel. She has also stated that a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come from both sides negotiating a two-state solution.\\n    Criticism of Israeli settlement activity: Gabbard has expressed concerns about Israeli settlement activity and its impact on the prospects for peace. However, her criticism is limited to specific aspects of settlement activity, rather than a broader condemnation of Israeli policies.\\n    Opposition to BDS: Gabbard has co-sponsored a bill condemning the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, which has been criticized by some as anti-Palestinian and pro-Israeli.\\n    Pro-Israel lobby connections: Gabbard has received funding from pro-Israel groups and has spoken at a conference for Christians United for Israel, a far-right organization that opposes Palestinian statehood and supports Israeli settlements.\\n    Mixed signals: Gabbards statements on Israel and Palestine have been criticized for being inconsistent and lacking nuance. While she has expressed support for a two-state solution, she has also used language that some see as pro-Israeli, such as describing Israel as a democratic Jewish state.ConclusionTulsi Gabbards stance on Israel and Zionism is complex and open to interpretation. While she has expressed support for a two-state solution and criticized specific aspects of Israeli settlement activity, her overall record suggests a strong alignment with pro-Israeli and Zionist positions. Her connections to pro-Israel lobby groups and her opposition to the BDS movement further reinforce this assessment. However, it is essential to note that Gabbards views on Israel and Palestine are subject to interpretation and may be influenced by various factors, including her political ambitions and her desire to appeal to different constituencies.","title":"Trump has decided to appoint Gabbard as DNI."},{"text":"When in the history of the GOP have they done the right thing","title":"Republicans \\"stunned and disgusted\\" as Trump taps Matt Gaetz for AG"},{"text":"I don't know if he *represented* Florida.

As unfortunate as that might be. SCOTUS fakiusly sidestepped the question in *Trump v Anderson* likely for the same reason that he hadnt been formally charged or found guilty. \\nNow when it comes to [this article](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/birthright-citizenship-fundamental-misunderstanding-the-14th-amendment) Many of the criticisms they make are refuted by the language of the amendment and the legislative history. \\nWith one Josh Blackman refuting the Critics erroneously believe that anyone present in the United States has subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the United States, which would extend citizenship to the children of tourists, diplomats, and illegal aliens alike.But that is not what that qualifying phrase means. Its original meaning refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that individual.\\nPart of the argument. In [his article](https://www.cato.org/commentary/birthright-citizenship-constitutional-mandate) Blackman does as Judge Ho did and cites Senator John Conness during the debate of the 14th amendment. Is the child of a Gypsy born in Pennsylvania a citizen? he asked. Is it proposed that the people of California are to remain quiescent while they are overrun by a flood of immigration of the Mongol race? Sen. John Conness of California answered that the children of Chinese and Gypsy aliens shall be citizens and he was entirely ready to accept the provision proposed in this constitutional amendment.\\nAnd this has been backed up by Wong Kim Ark which I quoted in my post. \\nAs to the invaders angle there is no way that theyd be able to make that stick. The framers have never endorsed that point of view. Lets cite [James Madison](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed43.asp)A protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it. The latitude of the expression here used seems to secure each State, not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors. You would have to prove that they are enemy combatants rather than just illegal immigrants. And that would likely take a lot more than just saying it. \\n*I got that Madison quote from this [CATO institute piece](https://www.cato.org/commentary/illegal-immigration-isnt-invasion)And some of the most conservative groups like [American Enterprise](https://www.aei.org/economics/illegal-immigrants-arent-the-same-as-home-invaders/) and [Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/immigration-is-not-invasion) wholly refute the arguement. And even the people who say [that it is an invasion](https://irli.org/yes-illegal-immigration-is-an-invasion/) concede that the definition of the word was understood at the founding to be attacks by military forces.

Honestly, if some lunatic sent me a letter like this, I would only feel more vindicated in voting for Trump. Instead of bothering to write this TLDR letter, the person who wrote it could have just sent her family the \\"Dear Subhuman Filth\\" copy pasta: Dear Sub-Human Filth, I'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Democrat in 2024. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family. We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible. I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms. The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you. You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you. It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do. All of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am. So please vote Democrat. Help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.","title":"Trump voter gets cut off by sister with one of the most eloquent letters Ive ever read [+3.9k]"},{"text":"Shouldn't be a problem for this admin to hold senate in recess.","title":"An effing nightmare: Senior commanders react to Trumps new cabinet picks"},{"text":"Oh not just the average American!

Beyond that, there are non-combat military roles that conscripts can fulfill, like janitorial work or service work like cooking or serving food. I agree that its not fun to have a year or two or three of your life taken to be trained by your nations military, but (as other commenters have raised) some countries face existential threats that can really only be combated by military action.

Trump already backed Herbster in the primary but went all-in after the women told their story, dramatically escalating his support for Herbster.This points to why misogynists and abusers seek each other out, beyond just having shared interests. They prop each other up in the gross belief that it's really cool to be a man who hurts women. In defending each other, they create a politically powerful solidarity. Untold numbers of men who have gone MAGA have done so mainly because they hate women. They love the validation of having leadership who agrees with their pro-violence-against-women stance.

They shoved a terrible candidate down our throats without a single primary, then turned around and arrogantly demanded that we vote for her, or else.You don't seem to understand this, but Democrats are NOT entitled to our votes!  So if you're unhappy that we didn't vote for your candidate and you're unhappy that her opponent won as a result, then you need to be asking yourselves what you could've done differently to earn our votes instead of whining and berating us for not giving your candidate a blank check to continue funding genocide with our tax dollars.Genocide is a deal-breaker.  Figure it out. No one will ever be the most perfect candidateStop right there.  Democrats have long been using that talking point and it simply doesn't hold up.  Why?  Because you're falsely portraying this as a battle over perfectionism.  It is not.Let me explain this for you in simple terms:  Opposing genocide is not \\"perfectionism\\".  It's a very basic, non-negotiable requirement that the Democrats are unwilling to meet.  So they failed to earn our votes.  So they lost.  That is just one of countless examples.The Democrats are not \\"less evil\\".  They're just evil, same as the Republicans.  They both support genocide.  They both support neoliberalism and neoconservatism.  They both have demonstrated nothing but contempt for our democracy. Liberals seem to have much to high of standardsI'm a progressive, NOT a liberal.  The term \\"liberal\\" has been redefined in the last few decades.  When most people use the term now, they are referring to neoliberal democrats.  Neoliberalism, despite the name, shares a lot more in common with conservatism than it does with progressivism.That said, if you think that demanding a candidate who opposes genocide is having standards that are too high, then maybe the problem is that people like you have been unwilling to raise the bar and start demanding more of our politicians.**Seriously, you failed to earn our votes.  You don't agree?  Fine, but you're not the one who gets to decide that.  We are.  And we have.  Either respect our decision and learn from it or GTFO.** and then he we are with having the imperfect candidate blame.Kamala Harris wasn't \\"imperfect\\".  She was downright awful.

A procedure or test we'd get in the US in a few days you have to wait 6 months or a year for here. I've had a heart arrhythmia for 3 or 4 years that would have been fixed in the US a long time ago-after a comedy of errors (which wasn't actually funny) it still hasn't been fixed. On top of that, the doctors and medical staff are apathetic (like everybody else here) and don't really care about the patients or the practice of medicine. They always say that they don't have the money for anything, but the government gives money to people for doing nothing. Instead of making money off of patients as in a capitalist system, the hospital loses money every time they take care of someone, so the motivation is to do as little as possible. I don't understand how under the ACA your co-payments. deductibles and premiums can be so expensive. Can you get subsides to pay for your premiums under the ACA, if your income is low?
