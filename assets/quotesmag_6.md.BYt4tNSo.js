But it could just as well be titled No Regrets. In her newly published book, the former German chancellor goes back over her 16 years in power and argues that, all things considered, she got it right.\\nIt will be interesting to see if Barack Obama is similarly defensive when he publishes the next volume of his memoirs. For the international legacy of the Obama-Merkel years is looking increasingly questionable with the passage of time.\\nFrom 2008 to 2016, Merkel and Obama were the two most powerful politicians in the western world. They got on well  which is not surprising, since they were similar characters. They were both outsiders: the first female chancellor of Germany and the first Black president of the US. They were both raised well away from the metropole, in east Germany and Hawaii respectively.\\nBoth Merkel and Obama are self-assured, highly educated, intellectual and cautious by temperament. These are qualities that endeared them to cautious, educated liberals. (I plead guilty.) But, in retrospect, their careful rationalism made them ill-equipped to deal with ruthless strongman leaders like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.\\nBoth Merkel and Obama still have a huge fan base, many of whom look back nostalgically to their era as a period of stability and sane government. So it was, in many ways.\\nBut it is increasingly clear that decisions taken by the two leaders  or often the decisions not taken by them  had a damaging, if delayed, impact on global stability. We are now witnessing major wars in Europe and the Middle East and sharply rising tensions in east Asia. Some of todays problems date to mistakes made in a crucial period from 2012 to 2016.\\nMerkel did not like or trust Putin. But she did appease him. The mistakes made by the former chancellor  particularly after Russias illegal annexation of Crimea and attack on the Donbas in 2014  were picked apart in many reviews of her book. Her eagerness to avoid a wider European war sucked Merkel into the futile Minsk process of talks among Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Her unwillingness to confront Putin also reflected her countrys economic interests  in particular, German industrys thirst for cheap Russian gas.\\nRather than pushing back against the mistakes made by the German chancellor, Obama compounded them. In his second term, he made three critical foreign policy blunders. Collectively, they sent out a message of weakness that contributed to the mess we are in today.\\nObamas first mistake was the failure to enforce his own red line over Syrias use of chemical weapons. Promising to take military action and then retreating in the face of congressional opposition  and his own personal misgivings  looked weak. The decision could be easily rationalised. But it still resonated around the world.\\nThe Trump camp would add Obamas decision to sign a deal limiting Irans nuclear weapons programme to their indictment of his policies in the Middle East. But that is a much less clear-cut mistake than the decision not to enforce the chemical weapons red line.\\nThe reason the Syrian decision mattered so much was that it formed part of a pattern. The second mistake made by Obama was a failure to react to Chinas construction of military bases on the artificial islands that it had created in the South China Sea. In 2015, President Xi explicitly promised not to militarise the South China Sea in a statement made at the White House. In fact, it was already happening. Obamas passive response made it look like an authoritarian leader had once again kicked sand in his face  and got away with it.\\nThe third error was the failure to rearm Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. There are people in Berlin and Washington who claim that it was Merkel who led the way on this policy. If that is true, it was a mistake for Obama to listen.\\nBut it also seems likely that the natural caution of Merkel and Obama reinforced each other. There were certainly people in Obamas circle who were quietly dismayed by his timid reaction to the Crimean annexation. One later complained to me about Americas unwillingness to take actions that Putin might deem provocative, lamenting: We were afraid of our own shadows. President Joe Biden also came to the conclusion that Obamas reaction to the 2014 attack on Ukraine was too weak. Biden is quoted as saying: We fucked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.\\nObama and Merkel could doubtless respond that their critics are blessed with perfect hindsight. Some of them, including Biden, went along with many of their decisions at the time. All government involves difficult trade-offs, and it is much easier to preserve a broadly satisfactory status quo than to demand sacrifices to ward off a threat that may never materialise.\\nMerkel has a PhD in quantum chemistry. Obama was a law professor. Their training told them to weigh the evidence and to avoid rash decisions. Unfortunately, international politics is less like a law school seminar or a laboratory than a playground in a tough area. Playground bullies tend to get nastier and more aggressive, until somebody finally stands up to them.","title":"The tainted legacy of the Merkel-Obama years: A failure to respond to Russian, Chinese and Syrian aggression helped to create the unstable world of today"},{"text":"I work at a large bulge-bracket bank.

First off-- Tulsi is a LtCol in the Army Reserve.  She's commanded military police units both domestically and in Iraq.  She also served on the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Homeland Security committees.  I'm pretty confident she's received PLENTY of intel briefings. She doesn't \\"support\\" Assad or Putin.  That's a bald-faced lie that keeps getting repeated about her.  She opposed the neocon idea that just because someone is a \\"bad guy\\" that the US should intervene to get that \\"bad guy\\" out of power.  We made that mistake in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya.  Each time it resulted in a failed state that was far more dangerous than when the \\"bad guy\\" was in charge.  We damn near made the same mistake again in Syria until people like Tulsi spoke up and pointed out that maybe it's not such a good idea. The same holds true for Putin.  She doesn't \\"support\\" Putin, nor does she \\"repeat Kremlin talking points\\".  She realizes that its in our best interest to not start a war with Russia.And speaking of that war with Russia-- do you really think a war between NATO and Russia would stay conventional?  You're right that Russia would likely lose a conventional war against NATO.  Losing that war would pose an existential threat to Russia, and therefore allow for the use of nuclear weapons per their doctrine.  It's unlikely that a nuclear war would stay limited, so it would likely lead to a global nuclear war that would kill \\\\~5b people or more, and result in the destruction of pretty much every country in the northern hemisphere.And as far as Ukraine goes..... Russia is bleeding the US and EU dry for pennies on the dollar.  Russia has been throwing Soviet-era junk equipment and non-Russian lives into that grinder just to keep the west pumping billions of dollars into it.  Russia isn't going to lose that war, they're just going to keep it going for as long as the west is stupid enough to keep pumping cash they don't have into it.Ukraine is a horribly corrupt shithole that has served as little more than a money laundering operation for the rich and powerful in the US and EU.  Why do you think the Hunter Biden pardon went all the way back to 2014?  It was to cover his actions in Ukraine.  Once the money dries up Ukraine would almost certainly resort to extortion with the info they have on Hunter Biden and others.  Pardoning Hunter gets the Biden family out from under that, at least from a legal standpoint.You really need to take another look at who has swallowed all the propaganda, because it sure sounds like it's you.","title":"Boyswe got em.

A conservative Supreme Court did when it agreed with Trump that a president can basically use them however they want, including to benefit themselves.The highest court in the land said this was fair game when Donald Trump asked for it after he was caught red handed.

I guess the?consolation about it for me is this exposes the Democrats as being crooked, self-dealing,?and sanctimonious liars. There's no argument they can make.They've been running for years now on?how no one is above the law. Joe Biden tweeted that out, too. No one's above the law except?for my son and me, maybe, because I'm implicated in his crimes.No one's above the law. We shouldn't??be doling out patronage. We shouldn't be nepotistic.Joe Biden is all of these things.?This was a final shiv to the Democrat party. Had Kamala won, probably Kamala would have?pardoned Hunter.There would have been a lot of pressure for Kamala to pardon Hunter.?If the Democrat party had not totally stabbed Joe Biden in the back and overthrown him,maybe Joe would have taken some lesser action, maybe not given a full pardon,but just commuted his sentence or something like that. In this case,?he says, no, forget about it.If you're going to send me down, I'm going to bring down the?(1:00)?whole Democrat party with me. Forget you guys. This will help Republicans, at least in themidterms.People's memories aren't all that long, so maybe it doesn't help them in 2028.?It will help them in the midterms. But then there's one more question, practically speaking.If you are President Trump, if you are the DOJ coming in under President Trump, the question isthis. Can Joe Biden offer this kind of pardon to his son? This isn't just a pardon for the crimesthat Hunter was convicted of. This is a pardon spanning a decade for any federal crime thatHunter Biden might have committed.Does the President have that authority? It's happenedone time. Well, not this kind of pardon has not happened ever. But one time, you did have apardoning someone for a crime that he might have committed but wasn't indicted for.There have actually been a few times, but one that was really notable, and that was Jerry Fordpardoning Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon was about to be impeached. He resigns the presidency,and Jerry Ford gives him a pardon.It was controversial at the time because RichardNixon never accepted guilt for the crime of duct taping a door the wrong way or whatever nonsensethe deep state used to run him out of office. One of the most popular elected presidents ever.?I?digress.We've had it at moments of particular national crisis. We've had it in ways that Jimmy?Carter pardoning the draft dodgers from Vietnam. Okay, there weren't a ton of prosecutions that?were even really getting geared up for there.Can he do this? I don't know. It seems constitutionally?at least. So if the Trump DOJ does want to go after Biden, not just Hunter, he's the streetlevel guy.You want to go after the actual Biden family, the people who were ostensibly sellingstate secrets, who were benefiting, who were getting that 10% to 50% off the top. If thereis appetite there to prosecute, I think you probably still could. I think Joe Biden is clearly?overstepping his authority here.But this brings us back to the political reality as I spill mydrink all over my studio. I'm just so fired up about this. This brings us back to the politicalreality, which is, this was going to happen.There was no appetite to prosecute Hunter,even if, even if Joe Biden had not done this. There's really no appetite to go after Joe Biden.Trump is saying, let's let bygones be bygones.Let's move on. Let's let the dead pass andbury the dead. Joe Biden probably voted for Donald Trump at this point.So I just don't think it was going to happen anyway. It's unsatisfying to people who view politics primarilyas an ideal, idealist project with all sorts of purity, but that's not how it works.Yeah. Duh.

Just because someone is an outsider doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be a good leader. She is a turncoat who registered as a Republican weeks before the election. She was not picked for her merit, she is a loyalist. Add that to her historically favorable language towards the Assad regime and parroting of Kremlin talking points and I do not trust her as far as I can throw her with our nation's secrets. Elise Stefanik would have made more sense to me. Russia couldn't even sustain the war in Ukraine without pulling North Korea into the fight, let alone sustain any conventional confrontation with NATO. Ukraine isn't even allowed to use modern NATO weapons and they're still killing thousands of Russian zombies per day. Putin only wins when the West believes his lies and threats. The Ruble is verging on collapse and the Russian Central Bank has raised interest rates above 22%. Putin knows he would get stomped by NATO, that's why he hasn't used nukes yet despite setting all kinds of \\"red lines\\". Using nukes would be the end of his regime and he is not interested in losing power. The correct response to a dictator is violence of action, not slow-walking aid to their opponent. Not appeasing them with the concessions and territory they want. Violence and steadfastness is the only language dictators understand, otherwise they will think they can get away with anything. If you want examples of how appeasement doesn't work just look at how Neville Chamberlain's failure to reign in Hitler before WW2 made war more likely. Ukraine is fighting this war so NATO doesn't have to. It is wise to ensure their victory.","title":"Boyswe got em.

In any case, all my points still stand.I won't deny that assisted suicide probably does create some perverse incentives, but I'd encourage you to really think about what the alternative (the status quo) really is.1. It creates its own perverse incentives. Namely, medical providers can keep getting paid so long as they keep the person alive, regardless of their quality of life. This creates a nightmare scenario for someone living with high levels of chronic pain that can't be managed by medication.2. *Really* think about how awful some ways to die can be. In my mind, probably the worst way to die would be being tortured to death. A very close second would be living in excruciating pain for months on end with no escape. It's basically being tortured to death but by your own body. If the worst-case scenario for assisted suicide is that occasionally a person in pain who might still be helped is inadvertently coerced into dying, I think that's a reasonable cost to also alleviate the very real and unfortunately common scenario of folks dying the second worst possible death I can imagine.I will admit to a bias here; I saw that nightmare scenario happen with my father. His cancer ate away at his spine and collapsed a number of his vertebra, causing him to experience white-hot pain any time he did anything other than lay perfectly still. He couldn't even adjust to get his ass on a bedpan without crying. Over 8 months, his condition progressed to the point that he was in basically absurd pain round-the-clock, even with massive amounts of morphine. He was getting so much pain medication that he was barely lucid and the only thing he was really aware of was the pain. In a brief moment of semi-lucidity, he begged me to *let* him die, but he was already on palliative care and that's basically what we were doing. Ultimately, the doctor just bumped up his morphine dosage to the point where it just kept him passed out. That was still effectively assisted suicide, but it just took four days of dehydration and malnutrition from sleeping constantly before his body finally gave up.That scenario and worse plays out every year for thousands of Americans. If we have the means to alleviate that, it seems insane to dither about the possibility of perverse incentives with respect to edge cases.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"It isnt a coincidence but isnt unexpected either.

The majority reasoned that one was excused from testifying only if there could be legal detriment ?owing from his act of testifying. If a statute of limitations had run or if a pardon had been issued with regard to a particular offense, a witness could not claim the privilege and refuse to testify, no matter how much other detriment, such as loss of reputation, would attach to his admissions. Therefore, because the statute acted as a pardon or amnesty and relieved the witness of all legal detriment, he must testify. The four dissenters contended essentially that the privilege protected against being compelled to incriminate oneself regardless of any subsequent prosecutorial effort, id. at 610, and that a witness was protected against infamy and disparagement as much as prosecution. Id. at 628.\\"* Since there is no legal detriment, the 5th amendment is not applicable to Hunter during the period of time Joe outlined as there can be no further legal action against him for any crime during that period.  For crimes outside the pardon parameters, he still retains his right to invoke the 5th amendment. Unless of course, statute of limitations occurs, then the 5th is gone again.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both members of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter dated Nov. 26 to President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that urged them to issue a policy directive that would ensure that U.S. troops can be used only when local or state authorities ask for federal help or are unable or unwilling to protect the public. We write to urge you to issue a policy directive that prohibits the mobilization of active duty military or federalizing National Guard personnel to be deployed against their fellow Americans unless specifically authorized, they wrote.

Even if you agree with it, its a waste of air.Warren and Blumenthal, whose offices said the letter speaks for itself, apparently hope that publicly highlighting the issue might deter Trump.Im sorry, how many drugs do you need to be taking to think that whatsoever? Trump *ran on this issue*. He is already shedding light on it with himself and Tom Homan saying they will use the military to carry out deportation support. How is their public highlighting somehow magically going to change any discourse?I mean, beyond that, their proposed policy directive is self-defeating. The Trump admin could simply state this is not being used against Americans; it is being used against unlawfully present people. Then beyond that, unless specifically authorized means nothing as **Trump would be fucking authorizing it**.

It's the same problem problem for mental illness treatment in general: if the individual isn't actively harming themselves or others, it's difficult to obligate them to get treated, and stigma dissuades voluntary enrollment for the more thorough programs.Politically, MAID seems like an anodyne policy change for those who are older and may have cancer or other disease but don't want to subject themselves or loved ones to the sight of their decline with palliative care. For individuals like my ex, however, it is a \\"damned if you do...\\" situation. I think many believe mental health and addiction are issues, but they don't like most of the solutions.

When Biden said he wouldnt pardon Hunter I was shocked and thought it was another mistake of being right when the other side isnt playing by the rules. As President Biden said in his statement, the punishment doesnt fit the crime. The reason for the punishment was because President Trump wanted quid pro quo from Ukraine in the form of crimes committed by Biden while he was also making the case that the Executive Branch has complete immunity from prosecution. According to MAGA and Democrat appointees Executive Branch is immune from prosecution for crimes committed and found guilty of before being president, even if the crime isnt committed in any official capacity or act, or of the crime was committed after the presidency. Republicans are also okay with pardons for crimes like treason by generals, war crimes such as killing kids, ignoring crimes against minors, and appointing felons pardoned to be ambassadors to France.

Most people would say yes, regardless of how depressed I was in the moment. These laws add safeguards to make sure the person is making a deliberate choice intentionally, but are those safeguards enough?Yes it would be murder in my opinion. But:First, we should make a difference between killing someone else and killing yourself. This law is about killing yourself. So the question should be, is it morally wrong to let someone kill themselves because the felt depressed.  \\nSecond, we should make a difference between knee-jerk reactions to a bad phase and a deliberate and persistent will to not continue living.  \\nThere is also the inter-temporal aspect of it. Should I let someone sell himself into permanent slavery? Liberals usually say no. Selling oneself into slavery is less restrictive of one's liberty than ending one's life, why do we permit one but not the other?I do not see a problem with someone selling themselves into slavery. The problem would in my opinion be when they change their mind and want to leave it. The question would then be whether we should enforce the contract and my opinion would be no, similarly like i would also not want to enforce a assisted suicide that someone has applied for but changed their mind.Liberalism isn't a utopian ideology with the end of maximizing freedom. It's a rough framework for letting people free people flourish in the societies they build for themselves. It has useful and consistent answers in a lot of places, but it can't guide government policy in all cases.I completely agree that there are some paradoxes in liberalism and you cannot answer every question with this framework, but I really think this is not the case here. The choice to continue ones own life or not falls perfectly into the realm of liberalism.

Lower inflation also hasn't done a single thing to relieve the burden of rising costs to American consumers. This was a standard talking point of the Harris campaign and one of the huge reasons people said she was out of touch. Biden turned off that faucet when it got nuts on the Mexico border. He begged for a reform package that would better defend the border, the Republicans in the House put one together, then Trump told them to kill it so he could run a campaign based on there being a border crisis. The Democrats didn't say there was no border crisis, they actively addressed it within the limits of what power they had.The bipartisan immigration bill included a $60m aid package for Ukraine. This was never more than an opportunity for House Democrats to say 'look we are the ones who want to solve the problem (we created) but the other side doesn't want to.'

That language mirrors the language in Fords pardon of Nixon, which did not merely cover the Watergate scandal but extended to all offenses against the United States that Nixon has committed or may have committed between Jan. 20, 1969, and Aug. 9, 1974  the exact span of Nixons presidency.Apart from the Nixon pardon, this is setting up a new and bad precedent for future pardons.

For instance, a majority of Americans actually do support abortion being legal in at least some capacity. Wanting a full, no exceptions ban on abortion is actually the rare position because in isolation most Americans comprehend that medical issues happen, rape happens, and they (correctly) feel that forcing a child to give birth is gross even if they don't question their assumptions and biases about the other people they perceive as sluts who don't \\"deserve\\" abortions. But, once you make it a culture war issue? Suddenly women who lived through a pre-Roe America are voting against the interests of their children and grandchildren because abortion is on the naughty, \\"opposite\\" side of their cultural identity and they have to *defend that cultural identity* from uh... The other Americans who also live here and don't really impact their daily life in any way other than making them notice differences.Another great example is healthcare for transgender children and adults has existed for a very long time. Growing up literally no one had \\"the trans agenda\\" on their mind to protect me from even though my entire life transition care has existed. No one felt they needed to have an opinion on it even if their opinion of trans people was negative.

The mainstream media reports when Trump says things, or his underlings or nominees say things. I've never seen a mainstream media source say the things you just mentioned. This sounds exactly like what somebody trapped in a right-wing echo chamber would think without any evidence backing the claim. Are you conflating \\"mainstream media\\" and \\"r/politics commenter\\"?Inflation is down but still very high and prices for goods and services have not droppedInflation is at 2.6%, below average. How is that \\"very high\\"? And what precedent do we have for across-the-board price decreases, outside of a recession or depression?[jumble of words about immigrants]Biden turned off that faucet when it got nuts on the Mexico border. He begged for a reform package that would better defend the border, the Republicans in the House put one together, then Trump told them to kill it so he could run a campaign based on there being a border crisis. The Democrats didn't say there was no border crisis, they actively addressed it within the limits of what power they had.Democrats, collectively, chose to tell us the economy was fineYes, they did this. And it was stupid, because even though the U.S. is doing great compared with the rest of the developed world and the Biden administration deserves significant credit for continuing/expanding consumer relief efforts started by Trump, you can't use \\"it could be worse\\" as a campaign slogan. Most people can only see as far as their next paycheck and don't give a shit about broader context that our economy is doing extremely well given the pandemic is still punishing economies around the globe. That we're kicking ass relatively is not good enough for the voters, they want egg prices down whether that's possible or not. That's the reality of the electorate, and the Dems dropped the ball by being bad at messaging and not hammering the corporations making record profits while prices rose.people don't give a shit about your pronounsI tend to agree and think this was a bridge too far for most people, pushing the notion that people need to change the way they interact at such a basic level as to stop \\"misgendering\\" strangers who look like they're men or women because we basically only have visual and audio cues to decide whether we say \\"sir or \\"ma'am\\" and nobody wants to feel like they're being called an asshole when they were just trying to be polite. All that said, the GOP has been losing its mind over gender issues for years when they are talking about edge cases that are less likely than being struck by lightning.the response from Democrats is 'you were tricked by lies' which shows they are still out of touch.Everything you said about the Dems failings could be true and it would still also be true that people got tricked by lies.

They continue to attack Hunter Biden as a means to harm the reputation of Joe Biden.  They spent years investigating and Donald Trump was even impeached over his efforts to influence Ukraine to act for his political benefit in the matter.  To be clear... none of these investigations were done in the spirit of justice.  They were all done for political purposes and the accusations date back to an event that (IIRC) happened about a decade ago.After years of investigating, the only thing they can pin on Hunter is apparently some tax evasion and the illegal purchase of a firearm.  After years of the right crying wolf, this is what they got.  No link to Joe.  So, I just don't see how and why I should be upset that this pardon happened.  It makes sense that it goes back 10 years since that is the basis of many of the accusations (which have been investigated and found lacking) against Hunter.  I will admit that I don't think this pardon should have happened.  I'm neither happy nor upset about it.

Even the IRS understands sending us to jail lessens their chances of getting their taxes, because it's much harder (if not impossible for us poors) to make money in jail.Tax evasion is one of those crimes where as long as the person pays back _all_ of what's owed plus interest, jail time is a bit much.Now if someone is intentionally refusing to pay their taxes and constantly avoiding doing so, then yeah, straight to jail.","title":"They can be lawless but Dems gotta be flawless"},{"text":"Even though Hunter cant be legally touched I think its still worth investigating Hunter's crimes to see if there are any others involved (10% to the big guy), and know which crimes Hunter is being pardonned for exactly (reputation damage to dems).","title":"President Biden set to issue a pardon of his son Hunter Biden"},{"text":"To start with point two, the charges against Trump have been dropping like flies because there's little hope they can get them to stick so they're giving up.

Liberalism defends individuals rights to life, liberty, and property. In this case, the right to life is in conflict with the right to liberty. There isn't a clear resolution within the framework of liberalism. Free people will have to struggle with this kind of question.There are lots of other questions that fall into this category like who is an individual deserving of protection. Many early liberal states used to say white men, now we say men and women of any ethnic background. We don't grant full rights to animals. We struggle with how to classify humans in utero. We then struggle with how to classify children. How much autonomy should children have from their parents? What do parents owe their children? We also struggle with what to do when asserting these rights and dealing with infractions. How much privacy should people have from law enforcement? How severe should punishments be for those who break the liberal peace? How accurate do our courts need to be?These issues have no definitive answers within the scope of liberalism. They are the edges and building blocks of a liberal society. Free people will always have to argue about these subjects with culture-specific notions of cost, benefit, truth, beauty, and goodness. Different philosophical outlooks will have different answers. We must be comfortable with the discomfort here and pragmatically do the best we can.

Biden professed a willingness to abide by the results of the justice system as a matter of principle, Chait writes. In breaking his promise, and issuing a sweeping pardon of his son for any crimes he may have committed over an 11-year period, Biden has revealed his pledge to have been merely instrumental.In a defiant statement issued yesterday, Biden decried Hunters prosecution as selective and unfair. But President Bidens complaint about the higher standard applied to his son reflects the perspective of myopic privilege, Chait continues. Crimes by family members of powerful public officials are far more damaging to public confidence than similar crimes by anonymous people. Holding them to account through strict enforcement of the law is good and correct. What the president fails to note in his self-pitying statement is that Hunter Biden for years engaged in legal but wildly inappropriate behavior by running a business based on selling the perception of access to his father.It would be tempting, but unfair, to draw a simple equation between Joe Bidens situational ethics and that of his successor. A willingness to evade the rule of law is the foundation of Donald Trumps entire career in business and politics, not a nepotistic exception, Chait writes.

It is always possible to marginally lengthen life somehow, but we have finite resources. We cannot possibly allocate all our resources to prolong lives. This means that we have to create a standard of how much we are willing to spend to keep someone alive. This puts a value on human life and is thus considered amoral by many, but it is inevitable from an economic perspective. I am not aware of a single country where cost-effectiveness measures are not taken into account when allocating healthcare resources.This leaves us with the position that we cannot provide limitless care to someone, which might hinder their ability to \\"fight to the end.\\" This cannot be affected in any way by this law or any other law around assisted suicide. Now lets look at the effects of voluntary assisted suicide in this setting. For this topic, only the cases where not enough resources can be allocated are relevant, so we have basically two possible situations:1. Not enough care can be allocated to a person, and they think they would have better utility if they died under those circumstances.\\n2. Not enough care can be allocated to a person, and they think they would not have better utility if they died under those circumstances.The second case is the trivial one where the person would decide against assisted suicide anyway. The first case is where it gets a bit more tricky. Considering that we cannot change the resource allocation, the person will be better off with assisted suicide. Banning it for them would also be a very strange moral position, since it essentially says: \\"You are suffering because we do not want to help you, but you are not allowed to improve your utility by killing yourself, because this would make us feel guilty?\\"I do think that it is better to look at this law in isolation. More choice allows them to choose the better available option. If we think it's cruel to let someone kill themselves under our healthcare constraints, it is at least as cruel to let them die under natural circumstances under the same constraints. In this case, we should decide on those constraints independently from the assisted suicide question.","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":" during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024The obvious question is: What was going on in 2014 that was *not* going on in 2013?","title":"Biden pardons son Hunter"},{"text":"Well said.","title":"You possess neither honor nor integrity, and your children know it."},{"text":"Whaterr..do they think hell do?

They are not the party of unity, tolerance, and the protectors of our republic. As a matter of fact they are the party of division, and worst of all, CONTROL.

So not only are they working against their own messaging, it makes it *painfully* clear just how far right the Dems have gone. A lot of us voted for Obama because we tried to reject the Orwellian vision Dick Cheney tried to implement...and now the Dems are telling us we should vote for their candidate because Dick Cheney approves of her?People have short memories in politics...but the horror of Dick Cheney was not like an intellectual thing. Many peoples' bodies were physically damaged and destroyed as a direct result of this man. Most millennials know at least one person who was hurt in the utterly fruitless War on Terror.And while people might grow forgetful as the parade of horrors accumulates over the years, you never forget your first contact with pure evil...and for millennials, that was Dick Cheney.Even if you want to boil it down to \\"the economy\\", no millennials associate Dick Cheney with good economic times. Our closest economic association with him is his role in the 2008 collapse that welcomed us into adulthood by immediately chopping us off at the knees and forcing us to make our way in a poisoned, toxic economy that never truly recovered, even to this day. We all watched Dick Cheney take everything we hoped to achieve and light it on fire to conquer the Middle East in the name of making himself and his friends richer and making everyone else poorer.Seriously. Bragging about having Dick Cheney's approval is no different than bragging about having David Duke, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein on your side as far as a lot of millennials are concerned. And even Republicans hate Dick Cheney at this point, so it is 100% a net negative.Totally insane that the Dems didn't realize this.","title":"Democrats still dont agree on the seriousness of their political problem after election defeat"},{"text":"Or maybe, it will be just a one of many things that a hospital offers that never really becomes a significant part of healthcare revenue","title":"A New Liberal Paradigm: The Right To Die"},{"text":"A liar?

I don't want to die fighting a losing battle against death. I don't want the option to spend millions for treatments that will probably shorten my life and decrease its quality. I don't need or want physician assisted suicide, but I do want access to hospice care and the ability of my family to not prolong my life if a machine is keeping me alive. I want to maximize my quality of life at end of life, not die fighting.\\nBut here's the thing, the positive right to die fighting is very very expensive relative to the cheap hospice care I want at the end of my life. I am fine with other people buying expensive insurance that will afford them the right to die fighting, but I do not want to help them pay for it.\\nThis isn't an anti-resistibution thing. I would rather give a poor person $50 a month as a UBI with the option to buy expensive end of life insurance than just force them into a system that incentivizes expensive, low-benefit end of life treatments. I think almost everyone would be better off with the $50 a month, especially the poor.

Biden claimed out of prinicple he wouldn't ultilize the pardon power like this - then once there was no political consequence possible, he went back on it.But in context, Trump has constantly threatened the Biden family, so this grants a bit more leeway IMO. This is a legal use of the pardon power.  We may not like the pardon power and how broad reaching it is but the founders did it this way on purpose. They believed the remedy would be political.  The constitution leaves a window of time where political consequences don't exist and incentivizes pardons like this - but the founders believed that \\"only men of this highest character\\" would obtain the office of the President.  So they thought the pardon power wouldn't be abused. Hell, with the recent immunity ruling, Trump could literally sell pardons on his way out of office and it can not be investigated. The pardon power is a core function of the President which makes him immunue from criminal charges. But I will never make the mistake of openly condemning this pardon in front of a Trump supporter.  Even if you disagree with this pardon, don't disavow it in front of Conservatives. Conservatives want Democrats to operate with standards and be open to criticism for failing them but then operate with impunity on their side in regards to those standards and won't take any criticism at all.It makes for an asymmetrical environment where Democrats are constantly apologizing and making concessions to Conservatives while they refuse to do the same - and it only benefits them.Listen to criticisms coming from the otherside now.  They are critical of Joe Biden lying, they are calling this pardon corrupt, saying it proves the Bidens are corrupt. If any Trump Supporter wants a concession on this pardon, they first have to acknowledge that Trump lies more than Biden and they don't care.  They have to acknowledge that Jared Kushner being appointed as a senior advisor in 2020 was against the anti-nepotism statue (which means Trump broke the law doing this, unlike Joe's pardon here which is legal), and that Trump engaged in pardons that were worse than this pardon in full context (again, I don't claim these were not legal, they were legal pardons).But of course, this is not how it works.  As a Democrat, you are expected to condemn everything and never get a conession in return. Trump is already suggesting this opens the door to him pardoning J6'ers.  Problem is, Trump would do it anyway. This pardon doesn't make a difference at all to what Trump would do.  You think any TS would have been against any Trump pardon but now will be okay with it because of Biden's pardon?  Of course not.I could condemn this pardon now, they will weaponize that concession and then ignore what Trump has and will continue to do - even if it is clearly against the law, is just as bad, is worse, etc. So what is the point and why give them that good faith concession when it will never be reciprocated and worse, used against Democrats?","title":"Geraldo Rivera Slaps Trump Supporters With A Reality Check After Bidens Pardon: Its not like he appointed him Ambassador to France"},{"text":"\\"There are times to overturn precedent.

Some other things Biden could do to be preemptive but could backfire is to call up like 50,000 national guard members to help on both Mexican and Canada boundaries to help homeland security on the mission to slow illegals.Those 50,000 would be tasked so they technically can't really be moved with out replacements if Biden sets up the original order to be for like a set period like 6 years with each unit doing rotations of  7.months to ensure overlap and to not over deploy all.","title":"Democratic senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the U.S. military domestically"},{"text":"Im sure you would, but how does whether or not previous presidents lived up to that standard matter to whether Biden did in relation to this?

Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, the president-elects son-in-law. Trump pardoned the elder Kushner in December 2020.

Experts said it was rare to prosecute cases like the one brought against him.He was also due to be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty in September  to avoid another public trial  to not paying his taxes on time.Joe Biden in his announcement asserted that his son had been selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted, arguing that no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.The decision attracted backlash from Republicans and some Democrats.Some of Trumps Republican allies in Congress cast Biden as corrupt, hypocritical and seeking to dodge accountability.Trumps spokesperson, Steven Cheung, claimed in a statement, The failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system.","title":"Geraldo Rivera Slaps Trump Supporters With A Reality Check After Bidens Pardon: Its not like he appointed him Ambassador to France"},{"text":"Parts of America may remain free, other parts will not.?","title":"Can a Democracy Reverse a Slide Toward Authoritarianism?"},{"text":"What about his laptop?

If a statute of limitations had run or if a pardon had been issued with regard to a particular offense, a witness could not claim the privilege and refuse to testify, no matter how much other detriment, such as loss of reputation, would attach to his admissions. Therefore, because the statute acted as a pardon or amnesty and relieved the witness of all legal detriment, he must testify. The four dissenters contended essentially that the privilege protected against being compelled to incriminate oneself regardless of any subsequent prosecutorial effort, id. at 610, and that a witness was protected against infamy and disparagement as much as prosecution.

Nevermind, this marked a stark reversal from Bidens repeated position that, unlike Trump, he would respect the courts and the rule of law, vowing never to pardon Hunter, despite his love for him.For example, in June,?[Biden told reporters after a jury convicted](https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-hunter-biden-18efb958a5365eebda5bb3da411c4326)?Hunter on three charges related to falsifying a federal form to obtain a gun, I said Id abide by the jurys decision, and I will do that.Later, in September, Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded guilty to?[nine federal tax charges](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-guilty-verdict-tax-evasion-trial/)?in Los Angeles. These stemmed from a period when he struggled with addiction to crack and alcohol, spent recklessly, and fathered a child with an assistant. He initially refused to acknowledge the childs paternity.The pardon was carefully worded to protect Hunter from additional charges he might face under a Trump administration, particularly those involving foreign governments.No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunters cases can reach any other conclusion than that Hunter was singled out solely because he is my son C and that is wrong, Biden wrote in a statement explaining his decision. There has been an effort to break Hunter, who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, theyve tried to break me C and theres no reason to believe it will stop here.The announcement came roughly 50 days before Biden leaves office and as he prepared to board a flight to Africa.Biden is not the first sitting president to pardon a family member. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, for drug charges. Jimmy Carter pardoned his brother, Billy Carter, for failing to register as a foreign agent. Benjamin Harrison pardoned his son, Ulysses S. Grant pardoned his brother-in-law, and Andrew Johnson pardoned his son-in-law.And lets not forget Trumps pardon of Charles Kushner, his son-in-laws father, whom he nominated to be the next Ambassador to France.Biden had repeatedly promised to be different, distancing himself from the nepotism and disregard for the rule of law seen during the Trump administration.Of course, much has changed since those promises. Biden was effectively sidelined by his party and denied a chance at re-election (though technically, he framed the decision as his own). Meanwhile, Trump, who vowed to prosecute political enemies, is set to return to power.Though Biden initially sought to demonstrate his administrations commitment to higher standards, his latest move only further emboldens a next Trump administration, which will no doubt repeatedly point to this pardon, further weakening the norms of American politics.","title":"Bidens pardon of his son is not only him at his Trumpiest but also emboldens Trumps next term"},{"text":"Should we go over Trumps controversial pardons of friends?

Legal Eagle did a pretty thorough video on what the Supreme Court ruling means and how it can be used.I see people talk about the ruling all the time on reddit, and everyone seems to use the wording \\"official acts\\". Even users correcting other users focus on that wording According to the Legal Eagle video, the key term however, is core duties. Anything that relates to the President's core duties is automatically legal, anything that's considered an official act is presumed legal but can be challenged later. While there's a lot of leeway for what might constitute a core presidential duty, the one thing that is absolutely not up for debate is commanding the military. Anything Trump would command the military to do is now legal. Now, would the Supreme Court likely regret their ruling if this leads to the military firing into crowds of protesters on American soil? Most likely. Will they do anything about it? It's too late by then, it's done. Can they even change their ruling after the fact without someone bringing up a legal challenge through a court case?

Trump is a FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and, at the time, was a presidential candidate. He was being brought up on the falsification of business records as he attempted to bury an affair. It was plastered all over the media because Trump found himself in the historically unique position of not only having criminal charges brought against him but also being found guilty of multiple charges. This man held the highest office in the country and is about to have it again.Hunter Biden is...nobody. Save for being Joe Biden's son, he's literally not politically relevant. He doesn't hold a position in the Cabinet, he's not an ambassador, he's not an advisor, he doesn't serve on any boards or committees. He's not some innocent man, but there was a years-long investigation regarding a laptop that went bloody nowhere. When we finally get a conviction, it was for unlawful possession and lying on a form. Since Hunter Biden has no prior convictions, he most likely would have served far less prison time (if any at all) and this was honestly something that could have, and should have, been handled swiftly without all of the media back and forth (unlawful possession is not a unique crime; it's incredibly common).

The organizing principle in Trumps chaotic campaigns, the animating passion among his supporters, has been a reactionary turn against dizzying change, specifically the economic and cultural transformations of the past half century: the globalization of trade and migration, the transition from an industrial to an information economy, the growing inequality between metropolis and hinterland, the end of the traditional family, the rise of previously disenfranchised groups, the browning of the American people. Trumps basic appeal is a vow to take power away from the elites and invaders who have imposed these changes and return the country to its rightful ownersthe real Americans. His victory demonstrated the appeals breadth in blue and red states alike, among all ages, ethnicities, and races....The triumph of the Trump Reaction should put an end to two progressive illusions that have considerably strengthened it. One is the notion that identity is political destiny. For a long time, the Democratic Party regarded demographic change in America, the coming minority majority, as a consoling promise during interim Republican victories: As the country turned less white, it would inevitably turn more blue. In the past decade this notion was absorbed into an ideological framework that became the pervasive worldview of progressivesa metaphysics of group identity in which a generalized people of color (adjusted during the social-justice revolution of 2020 to BIPOC) were assumed to share a common experience of oppression that would determine their collective political behavior, driving them far to the left on issues such as immigration, policing, and transgender rights....Adjacent to the demographic illusion is a majoritarian one. By this theory, the Democratic Party is kept out of power by a white Republican minority that thwarts the popular will through voter suppression, gerrymandering, judicial legislating, the filibuster, the composition of the Senate, and the Electoral College. By this thinking, the ultimate obstacle to the American promise is the Constitution itself. The United States needs to become less republican and more democratic, with electoral reforms and perhaps a second constitutional convention to give more power to the people. This analysis contains some undeniable truthsthe publics voice is thwarted by structural barriers, partisan machinations, and enormous quantities of plutocratic cash. As long as Republican presidents continued to lose the popular vote, the majoritarian argument was tempting, even if its advocates ignored the likelihood that a new constitution would turn out to be less democratic than the old one....In some ways, the Biden administration and the Harris campaign tried to reorient the Democratic Party back toward the working class, which was once its backbone. Biden pursued policies and passed legislation to create jobs that dont require a college degree in communities that have been left behind. Harris studiously avoided campaigning on her identity as a Black and South Asian woman, appealing instead to a vague sense of patriotism and hope. But Bidens industrial policy didnt produce results fast enough to offset the damage of inflationno one I talked with in Maricopa County, Arizona, or Washington County, Pennsylvania, this year seemed to have heard of the Inflation Reduction Act. Harris remained something of a cipher because of Bidens stubborn refusal to step aside until it was too late for her or anyone else to make their case to Democratic voters. The partys economic policies turned populist, but its structureunlike the Republican Partys mass cult of personalityappeared to be a glittering shell of power brokers and celebrities around a hollow core. Rebuilding will be the work of years, and realignment could take decades....Journalists will have a special challenge in the era of the Trump Reaction. Were living in a world where facts instantly perish upon contact with human minds. Local news is disappearing, and a much-depleted national press can barely compete with the media platforms of billionaires who control users algorithmically, with an endless stream of conspiracy theories and deepfakes. The internet, which promised to give everyone information and a voice, has consolidated in just a few hands the power to destroy the very notion of objective truth. Legacy journalism is dead, Musk crowed on his own X in the week before the election. Instead of chasing phantoms on social media, journalists would make better use of our dwindling resources, and perhaps regain some of the publics trust, by doing what weve done in every age: expose the lies and graft of oligarchs and plutocrats, and tell the stories of people who cant speak for themselves.These are some points to consider going forwards.

He apparently married this same woman as well and she wasn't cooperative with police. Then when he got out of jail the women he was accused of taking across state lines for debauchery they both fled the country together.https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jack-johnson-pardoned-violation-mann-act-1913/story?id=55412992So it sounds like a lot of racism was at play here.And for your other point I don't think you're wrong, but I probably bet there are more powerfully aimed laws, if there isn't there will be, that target this issue directly.

The election rigging stuff is a doozy not because it did or didnt happen but more because its even a conversation, now the deep MAGA movement or far far Left have a red button labeled stolen election they can press any time they dont like the result.

He was one of the first celebrity artists and seriously took advantage of that where he even signed a bunch of blank papers and had his friends produce the art. Or he'd just make tons purely for profit. Hes literally the most faked artist ever because of this signing thousands of blank canvases. So even authentic dali's are not as valued as they should be because there's so many, while always this intense doubt its real even by experts. Its hard to say somethings fake when the signature is real.? ?\\"Dal ensured a steady flow of prints by signing his name on thousands of blank sheets of paper before he knew what would be printed on them.

So even if a contemporary article said they're authentic doesn't mean they are worth $1000s.?Then in the late 70s, dali got sick and stopped signing these blank sheets, but his demand and celebrity was at its height, so the world was absolutely flooded with complete fakes as well.\\nHere's an article on this...?\\nhttps://thehustle.co/why-salvador-dali-is-the-most-faked-artist-in-the-world\\nI just bring this up because my own father bought like 20 Dali sketches in the mid 2000s on a cruise auction and have \\"authentic\\" signatures, yet had a tough time selling them for even a few hundred each. Infact, he made just as much if not more on peter max prints. There's just so many, along with so many fakes with real signatures, where many are worth no more than like a thomas kincaid print. And when Chapman shot lennon Dali was at the height of pumping out these high demand but low value sketches to benefit off of his celebrity.\\nChapman's sketchy as fuck, the government absolutely had an axe to grind against lennon, having just lost their case to deport him for his activism, and art is used so much in corruption the whole higher level market likely revolves around it. I'm just saying, just because he had \\"original\\" dali's doesn't mean he was carrying around some insanely expensive art that was payment for the assasination.?\\nFor such a crazy pseudo intellectual dweeb psycho, carrying cather in the rye, it doesn't suprise me he was also carrying equally pretentious, surreal art, that would appeal to a psychotic/schizoid person. Chapman's the exact type of person dali was trying to profit off of by producing all his fraud prints and mass for profit sketches.?\\nSo with all that said, it's only sketchy if those sketches were legitmate desired pieces. But for every 1 of those, there were 100s of \\"fake\\" dali mass produced art. Even if an article reports he had Dali's doesn't mean they're expensive. And they were so commona, where if any pretentious young adult carried art on them, it was most likely Dali.

I think its worth remembering that there used to be a thing called conventional wisdom where elite opinion makers in mass media converged on an agreed-upon reality (Chomsky would call this manufacturing consent) that filtered out to the masses and then became history. Conventional wisdom relied on constraints that no longer exist: newspaper routes, leases on radio bandwidth, etc.We live in a world where there limits that helped elites form public opinion have been removed. The radio show has been replaced by the podcast. There is practically no editorial control over podcasts; look at how Rogan immediately started the Covid conspiracy within weeks of signing a deal with Spotify. There are also a million podcasts. I personally know two entomologists promoting their own podcasts about arthropods. And a podcast is a relatively high barrier of entry compared to the forums where QAnon and Stop The Steal took root.Maybe in 2004 there was a conventional wisdom (although I dont remember the discourse at all about Kerrys spending) but now there are hyper-niche subreddits and forums for every boutique political community imaginable. So it should be no surprise that some people are saying Harris lost because Democrats need their own Joe Rogan, other people are saying Democrats need Bernies populist economic message, theres more than a little bit of laying it all at the feet of Gaza protest votes in Dearborn, and so on. Everything you experience politics through the algorithmically pushed content that keeps you engaged confirms your priors. Just look at how many op Ed pieces have trickled up from these forums to actually make the legacy news media such as NYT declaring the election was all about X or Y. Thats just a fraction of whats going on, but the rot is so deep its apparent at the surface now.So it is my contention that in a year where there were BlueAnon Democrats declaring that Biden had a good debate and should remain the candidate, that there would also be a community that insisted her having any remaining account balance showed she didnt try hard enough to win. Because the post-debate response by like a very large and outspoken portion of Democrats in the current space where there arent elites controlling the discussion was totally unhinged from the actual performance Biden put together for the debate. I dont know if there is a degree of difference between conventional wisdom and common sense, but we have to create a structured way of talking about how our sense of a shared reality is breaking down.","title":"Dems fear Harris continued fundraising erodes trust"},{"text":"And when Trump pardons J6 people on day one there will be crickets.","title":"Biden's pardon of his son Hunter rattles the political world"},{"text":"True, but the two people in the House who died these past two years were 65 and 74.

Firstly, I think it's true that Hunter was unfairly singled out and that his case was political football for the GOP.

I could easily imagine that they would interfere and make things worse for Hunter simply out of spite, or because the orange man demanded it.Lastly, I'm just glad that Joe is being a good father to his son. I know the president has struggled with this, he believes in the rule of law and his son clearly committed a crime. Just because Trump is willing to pardon his co-conspirators, that doesn't make it right for Biden to do the same. He holds himself to a higher standard, so this is a very difficult decision for him. I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to make this choice, but I'm glad his love for his son won out in the end. That family has been through enough tragedy, and Biden is a very old man.

In comparison, FGM is almost always a form of male control, and has basically no support amongst women\\nTell me you have never looked into FGM and MGM without telling me you have never looked into those issues.\\nLike I said, the reasons to forbid one are the same as to forbid the other. The history and the social.context are even the same : both have been introduced as ways to control sexuality, both have then become cultural standards, both are seen as victimless by many, particularly the people who practice it, both are enforced by the people who have suffered from it. Both have people claiming various absurd health benefit of the practice.\\nAnd all of it is pretty irrelevant to why it should be forbidden anyway.\\nI don't think any women are saying that MGM must be legal, whilst simultaneously arguing FGM must be illegal.\\nExcept for all the people (men and women) who actively campaign against FGM while not saying a word or making excuses for not fighting MGM.\\nBy the way, there is not a country that practices FGM that doesn't practice MGM.

Those are two different categories,? and OP is not talking about women.\\nThere's a big difference between the idea that women in power would, for example, permit male genital mutilation whilst banning female genital mutilation, and the idea that women in power would encourage male genital mutilation.\\nOnce again, not women, feminists. And no. I'm sorry, but I see no difference between taking a gender neutral issue, specifically gendering it and fighting against one half while dismissing the other, and actively campaigning for harm.\\nIf tomorrow I started a campaign targeted at helping male victims of car accidents, I would be a raging sexist. If I started a campaign to help white victims of police shootings, I would be a raging racist.\\nBasically, what it does is show that you understand that one kind of thing is harmful, and at the same time it demonstrate that you don't give a fuck if that harm happens upon the \\"right kind of people\\".\\nThat is bigotry and hate of the highest order.\\nSimilarly, when it comes to defining rape (the definition usually used in pnetrative act, but I think the distinction you're talking about is the definition that would necessitate the involvement of a penis, hence making it a male-only crime)\\nThe distinction is who is not consenting.\\nTwo people have sex. One of the person involved didn't consent/was forced. That is how people generally understand the term rape. The rapist is the person who forced/violated the consent of the other. The victim is the person who didn't consent/ was forced.\\nThe feminist definition used by the CDC after the direction of people like Mary Koss, rape only happen when the rapist penetrates the victim. Since most penetration of someone else are done by a man, by definition, rape becomes 90+% male committed. Under that definition, a woman who give GHB to a man, then rides him all night long in spite of his protests did not commit rape, despite pretty much everyone agreeing such a case is a case of rape, and thinking, when using the 90+% of rapes done by men that it includes such cases, which they imagine are what constitutes the 10-%, when in reality, that number is the women who did that and either pegged or used a finger to penetrate their victims.\\nNot exactly the most commonplace thing, and skewing the data quite a bit in a very deceptive way.\\nthere's definitely an argument to say that women are trying to make the crime of sexually assaulting a man a lesser crime\\nFeminists, not women. And you are missing the core of the point I am making. It doesn't matter that most people would not want to consider women assaulting a man a lesser crime. It doesn't even matter that most feminists would disagree with such an idea. Because when it comes time to act on those beliefs, they are already acting on data based into that worldview. They don't believe women assaulting men should be considered a lesser crime. But they already believe that rape is committed at 90+% by men. The only difference is that this belief that women assaulting men is an equal crime can be used by them for plausible deniability. Of course no, they aren't sexist. They just have the exact same impact on the world as sexist would, despite not being sexist, because their worldview is informed by people they trusted and shouldn't have, and who are sexists. That is precisely my whole point. You can't base yourself on what \\"most people calling themselves feminist believe their values are\\" to judge the impact of feminism, because those values get irrelevant when they then proceed to inform their action based on faulty data constructed not in accordance to those values.\\nbut this is a very edge case and a long way away from \\"kill all men\\" which is the rhetoric OP is referring to.\\nAnd like I said, it is only edge if it had no influence, but as already demonstrated, the influence is disproportionate if the edge cases are in the appropriate position of influence.\\nYou take the \\"kill all men\\" example. Sure, very few might recognise themselves into it. But how popular, exactly, is the feminist slogan \\"the future is female\\"? Do you know of its origins ? I would bet most feminists who have an item with that slogan have no clue. And just think it a benign piece of \\"female empowerment\\" (and that already tells you a lot about the state of misandry, to exclude a half of the population from the future).Well, it comes from Sally Miller Gearhart, in a document where she stated \\"the future is female, and to make it so, the male population must be reduced to 10%\\".\\nHow nice. Do you start to see the point I am making about the relevance of influence over a movement even in spite of the popularity of a position ? I wouldn't even ask you if you were starting to see a pattern.\\nReally, the question when it comes to Male Genital Mutilation is why are men not pushing for this to be made illegal?\\nAnd what make you think they aren't ? Like I said, look for who is getting in the way. And most of the time, it is feminist groups that are at the forefront.\\nDo you know how people who fight against MGM are called ? MRAs. Men's rights activists.\\nThe intactivists are people fighting for government to enforce respect over men's right to bodily autonomy and self determination. It is literally an issue regarding the rights of men being violated, and so people doing activism to stop this violation of men's rights to bodily autonomy, by the nature of how words work, are what we call men's rights activists, or MRAs.\\nUnlike feminist, which is a specific subset of WRA linked to a specific ideology and view of the world, there is no way around calling people who work at protecting the rights of men anything other than MRAs.\\nTell me, what positive things have you heard about MRAs from feminists ?","title":"Cmv: feminism is a hate group for men"},{"text":"Can't WAIT for another round of deficit exploding tax breaks for the wealthy.More golfing trips on the taxpayers dime.Long winded rambling nonsensical speeches about super scary \\"woke\\" mobs.Nuking hurricanes.Injecting bleach.Whining.Crying.Pissing and moaning.gonna be a great four years of utter stupidity","title":"Trump BROKE the democratic party.

We know that he said he was thinking about pardoning Snowden at the end of his last term, but he didn't do it. That was already a shift in his thinking, because he had told Fox &amp; Friends he thought Snowden was guilty of treason before he was President. Putting Tulsi in charge of intelligence seems like another pro-Snowden move, assuming he knows she had called for the pardon of both of these guys years ago. Elon did a [poll ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1599224347121500160)on X two years ago asking if they should be pardoned, and 80% voted yes. So the issue has been on Elon's mind as well.One of Joe Rogan's interviews with Snowden is his third most-viewed video on YouTube, right after Trump's. But that topic didn't come up in their interview. If Trump is in tune with the \\"Rogan crowd\\" at all, and gives them any credit for his win, then he should realize that crowd wants to see Snowden pardoned, or given some kind of deal. I think Snowden has only asked that he be allowed to use a defense that the government was denying him, related to being a whistleblower. A plea deal would be somewhere in between that and a pardon. It's definitely more likely something positive happens for Snowden in this term than the last, I think. It would also really annoy John Bolton, so that may be another plus for Trump.","title":"Donald Trump hints at mass pardons for Jan. 6 defendants after Biden pardons son Hunter"},{"text":"And put in a position to commit blatant corruption.","title":"MAGA Goes Into Full Meltdown Mode Over Joe Bidens Pardon of His Son Hunter"},{"text":"And thats without being threatened by a revenge tour by the other side.
