This is obviously not true. The Republicans have changed quite a lot in recent years and they would have no trouble adjusting to a new political situation in the future. I think point 2 is wrong because of this.You also just assert point 1 without any real evidence. (I know that people on the internet love to say tacky bullshit like \\"our right-wing is ACkshuALLY left of the Democrats.\\" But that's certainly not true in Canada, and is not even true anywhere in Europe either.) The only policy that is meaningfully left-wing in Canada is their healthcare system. It is administered at the provincial level with some federal funding and regulation. Because the Republicans tend to be happy with federalism, a very easy way for them to get conservative Canadians on their side is to substantially reduce federal involvement in healthcare. The new states could easily keep their healthcare systems mostly as they are. In fact, I think this is the biggest adjustment we would see in Republican politics. They would strive to push as many things down to the states as possible. eg. Abortion is currently a state level issue, and with Canadians joining American politics, that would definitely stay that way. So Abortion is a non-issue too.An issue you didn't mention is immigration. Canada is experiencing much worse immigration-related issues than America is. So in the last few years Canadians have become more anti-immigration than Americans. Immigration is the number one issue that is about to lead the Conservatives to their biggest parliamentary majority in Canadian history. Republicans would win way more Canadian votes that you are expecting.","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"Yeah cuz FDR didn't win 4 elections in a rowYou run on doing shit that will actually improve the lives of the working class, they will vote for you.","title":"Progressives Say \\"Billionaires' Row\\" at Inauguration Ceremony Shows True Winners of Trump Agenda | \\"Trump's White House is government by the billionaires, for the billionaires,\\" said the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus."},{"text":"\\"I've taken the liberty of hiding a number of eggs around the office.

Sometimes you need to be able to differentiate between who is actually paying attention and who are oblivious and just wants to throw out things they have seen in memes on their Facebook feed. You cant have civil conversations with those people (and that goes for Republicans just as much as it does for Democrats). As for the pardons, I think it should be on a case by case basis. But heres the thing, when Biden started handing out all of those preemptive just in case presidential pardons all willy-nilly, he gave Trump political cover to do pretty much the same kind of pardon whoever you want. I dont agree with everything he has said and done. Are some over the top and egregious? Absolutely. Are there times they are taken out of context or just snippets used to steer a narrative? Absolutely (prime example just a couple replies up from one of those spouting meme taglines). There were countless times during his first term I would think Jesus Christ will somebody take his phone so he quits using Twitter. He did a lot of good his first term but was overshadowed by dumbass tweets he would make. I think Biden did some good too and it got overshadowed by the weird random shit he would do. I had no problem with him giving Hunter a pardon for the crimes he had been convicted of. The problem I have is it was for any and all known crimes and any and all crimes that have yet to be uncovered he committed over an 11 year period. Even the pardon Ford gave Nixon wasnt this broad, and that was during wartime.A little off topic, its scary (and shameful) how we have allowed ourselves to become so divided as a country. I honestly dont know how we can come back together. I dont think we can as long as there is only a two party system. If we can ever get 20% of the center left and center right to come together as a true Independent party then we would have a fighting chance. There are way more center/moderate on both sides than there are far left and far right they just happen to be the loudest. Only way we can start is being able to talk to each other without all the hate and vitriol. Respecting the others opinions when they dont align with your own.

That's 4 million people you have to deport before you get to the first farm hand/dishwasher/housekeeper. A million people per year. ICE employs around 20,000 people. About 5,000 of those people are agents. So you have 5k agents trying to each round up 16 illegals per month, just to get to 3.8M bad guys in 4 years. Thats 4 people per week for EVERY LAST AGENT they have. And I'm being generous with these numbers. You can't deport 20M people in 4 years, so you go get the worst of the worst and you leave the other folks alone. I'm trying real hard to have a good faith argument without coming off as a dick. But if I think the politician says stuff he won't/cant do, and you think he's honest about everything he says, then I'm not sure who is more naive.","title":"Trumps first wave of executive orders will target birthright citizenship, DEI and international trade"},{"text":"Including the world's 3 richest assholes.","title":"It's now official, Trump is a weather wimp."},{"text":"Is that how you throw things?","title":"Elon Musk draws outrage over 'odd-looking salute' at Trump inauguration celebration, what do yall think of this?"},{"text":"Volunteer for Democrats, in person or online!https://mobilize.ushttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxO8g7q9VO3ZMAABcrvR7PMyX4Yl6dgIYhD3eRTKk1M/edit?usp=sharing Join your local democratic party!  https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/wiki/parties","title":"Looking at the smaller crowd in the Rotunda for Trumps inauguration, its telling that billionaires like Musk and Bezos are front and center in the crowd.

People who are new to Reddit, will only see upvoted comments that align with the leftist narrative, so they learn quickly that you will lose karma if you disagree, and the quickest way to earn a bunch is to bash anyone on the right.So I guess at the end of the day the answer to \\"why are there so many liberals on Reddit\\", is \\"nobody else is welcome here.\\" Why would anybody *other* than liberals bother to be here?The sad part is that the bubble they have created has a truly warped people into believing that these social media views are held by the vast majority of the country. There are so many users on Reddit that were truly blown away by the results of the election, because they didn't believe us when we told them hey were in a liberal media bubble.

The UNFCCC has many flaws which are often highlighted, but the Paris Agreement has really helped set standards which help countries (and the actors within them) through the energy transition.This could have some short term benefit for the US, but I think this is bad for the country in the long term. China has basically cemented itself as the key trading partner for renewable and alternative energy (the EU obviously remains the most progressive major economy but doesnt have the resources or manufacturing of China). More broadly, the US climate commitments comes across as unreliable to key partners. I dont think climate policy was great even under Biden, but IMO this does damage that will still last if the Dems win the next election. The US will obviously still play a key role in climate tech/innovation and well probably see states like California engage more directly with other countries, but its hard to see why anyone would bet on ambitious climate policy at the federal level.For someone whos so vocally against China, it feels like Trump is giving allies as many reasons as possible to work with China over the US.","title":"Trump signs order to pull U.S. out of Paris Agreement"},{"text":"Fascist?

In the context of a *social* situation, we really can't insist on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, because in social situations, either side can equally end up being unjustly victimized/punished. Imagine a friend group/company/whatever has 2 members, A and B. A says B raped them. What are the possibilities? 1. B did rape A.\\n2. B did not rape A. Let's look at case 1: If you believe A, B will be justly punished if you ostracize them. If you don't believe A, they are unjustly punished and constructively ostracized, because it's traumatic and unreasonable for them to have to stay in the group with their rapist. Now let's look at case 2: If you believe A, B will be unjustly punished if you ostracize them, but even if you *don't*, they will be traumatized by having to remain in the group with their false accuser. If you don't believe A, they are justly punished if you ostracize them. This is why \\"unreasonable doubt\\" can almost never be the standard for a social context here: No matter what you do, someone is punished in a social context for almost any serious enough accusation. All you can do is try to pick the one you think is more likely to be guilty.TL;DR: In social contexts, you really have no *just* alternative but to use the *civil court* standards, and decide who you think is *more likely* to be the guilty party, and act accordingly, because you're choosing between 2 victims, not judging someone criminally liable with the full power of the state to punish them beyond their affiliation with the group.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Good","title":"JUST IN: ?

Although this has almost entirely to do with his first term being pre-COVID, to many voters Trump will make it harder to the working class just wasnt true in his first term. 2. As youve said in other comments, the Democratic Party is no different in being run primarily by money/special interests. Most people who voted Trump arent under the delusion that hes the little guy, but he at least positions himself as the big guy willing to call out the other big guys. Honestly I agree that posts or discussions on social media wont do much. If the Dems want to have any success in future presidential elections, they need to break into the influencer/podcast world. Thats what won Trump the election. Thats what got low-info voters turned out in droves never before seen.","title":"CMV: All of the political moral outrage posts are worthless"},{"text":"Which is why people still get mad that slavery may technically be defined as legal under the 13th Amendment...","title":"Trump to sign sweeping executive actions on immigration, launch fight to end birthright citizenship | CNN Politics"},{"text":"Evil.?","title":"Trump Administration Canceling Flights for Nearly 1,660 Afghan Refugees, Say U.S Official, Advocate"},{"text":"There is none, but it will give him the power to suspend environmental regulations","title":"Trump to declare national energy emergency to boost fossil fuels, power projects"},{"text":"Why do you think they're defunding education and monitoring so closely what's being taught/excluding actual history from the curriculum?","title":"Elon Musk draws outrage over 'odd-looking salute' at Trump inauguration celebration"},{"text":"[and here is an example of actual Nazis doing this salute for those who dont believe he was doing one](https://www.gettyimages.de/detail/video/people-do-the-heil-hitler-salute-as-neo-nazi-nachrichtenfilmmaterial/1656162915)","title":"Elon Musk Celebrates Trump Supporters For Saving The Future Of Civilization"},{"text":"One down, many to go.","title":"Marco Rubio confirmed by Senate to be next secretary of state, becomes first Trump cabinet pick to be approved"},{"text":"Trump and the republicans are heartless and eager to abandon those who helped them in the past but cannot help them today.

Ive seen it myself with my own family members who didnt even vote for Trump, but were pressed on views that were aligned with his. It was clearly motivated by things like being around certain people and living a certain lifestyle. These people could get forced into schooling for several years against their will with everything they say and do watched and controlled, North Korea style propaganda, torture by CIA methods, and more and they would still never change their minds. They respond to group things which were influenced by the right wing gas-lighting of covid-19 precautions. This was utilized not just for that, but also various other policy positions as well. Easier and unquestionable to them as they made themselves the cool person authority to these people. With their experiences,it will never change even if they are proven wrong in front of their eyes. Fox news and others can simply either shift blame and/or reframe everything that is happening as varieties like untrue and a good thing. Said cool person authority cant be done by anyone else due to their experiences along with motivations and biases driven by reasons that either drove them to vote ad they did or were already voting as such to start with.Democrats should have caught on to right wingers trying this appeal as far back as 2015 to young generation Z online. Many people including various left wing YouTubers, warned them about this along with never addressing the claims and the lack of well grounded political education to sway people away from consuming and/or believing any of the mess Bannon, Trump, DeSantis, RFK Jr, and other throw rapidly. Democrats and others made these people off as cringy and old out of style religious stiffs who never could have that type of appeal. All while these people made these appeals quietly, conspiracy theorists also went in on it and gained more traction than they ever have, and they had quite a noticeable influence in the mid-2010s around Trumps election. Not many of these people, but was just enough along with an audience spread out enough with democrat apathy to allow Trump to win. This continues with some opposition until covid-19. Covid-19 causes chaos and makes Trump less popular while making people more somewhat conscious of what is happening and educated. But then, precautions were decided to be optional after Biden takes office and with this, the gas-lighting started. Wearing a mask and vaccinating was made to be seen as crazy and/or uncool, unnecessary, and/or fringe. People would listen to the other things these cool people who were right would say and take it at their word. Having enough education to understand some things, but not enough to understand the whole picture of what is going on. Making old regular appeals much more difficult to pull off and energy expensing. Something that already was such with Trumps campaign tactics from 2016 and 2020. Resulting in an election of mental exhaustion, hesitancy, confusion, apathy like 2016, mis-information, and mis-understanding of what they are even voting for. Resulting in various urban areas getting that right wing shift. Especially California where the propaganda was blasted the most with the state being used for mis-information while being mis-represented to both California residents and those who love outside California. Also mis-representing states like Texas and Florida as places of perfect paradise utopia that have no flaws and cant be criticized. Resulting in the biggest shift to the right. This attention is also noticeable with its concentration and with who it swayed as various rural areas saw a shift to the left with rural northeastern California being the only area that moved left in California.For what to do now, I dont think there is anything to do other than to leave what used to be the United States. If one wanted to change the land, the land would need to be conquered through war, have states leave the union, and/or taken. The world saw it with the January 6 coup with many doing it just for even being asked to wear a mask. After this with what they will deem as a perfect Christian utopia with a perfect leader who is to never be questioned, they would fight way harder to maintain it. Those types of people cant be reasoned with. They can only be defeated and forced to give concessions. Areas of the constitution and various legal previsions to the founding of various countries all over the world were specifically designed to keep people like Trump and these people away from power and keep them under control so they dont harm anyone. The United States or what it really is, the Confederate Emirate of Trumpistan, is the land where Trump and people like him can do whatever they want without any consequences. Trump proved it himself by defying the fourteenth amendment that automatically disqualifies him from being president. The harm to people who implemented covid-19 policies that were never reciprocated in punishment. Including actual killings. Anti-abortion killings to at least one doctor. Attempting to ban drag. Attempting to ban no fault divorce. The courts dismissing his prosecution for sex offending with false justifications. It is all about the land being theirs alone and for no one else. They complain about being disliked over political disagreements when they dislike and harm for far less reasons. Not counting the fact that political positions are valid to dislike people. Especially socially when said political positions are harming and even killing people. Frankly, this also goes to how many conservatives treat homeless, undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, and for men, treat their families. They see it as all theirs to rule and decide on. Ironically more authoritarian than the left which they claim to be authoritarian and anti-freedom. Said people are also going to see themselves as the saviors of the union if land is being taken and/or having states leave the union. Said outcome also leading to war except a far worse war than the original civil war that devastated the South region and killed hundreds of thousands. Especially as the confederates would have the federal government this time with some of the most sophisticated military technology in human history. Specifically in Arizona, Montana, Nevada, and others which all went to Trump and would side with the Confederates. In winning said war without as much bloodshed and guarantee of victory, California, Canada, and Colorado and/or others would need to pull a Blitzkrieg to seize the weapons and defeat forces before the federal government would have time to act. For value of said posts, organization and communication. If one seeks mass migration outside the US, separate from the union, and/or to conquer the US in a war, social media is very effective. It is how some governments outside the US got changed and it even influenced this very election. Albeit for right wingers, one would need to go to places like X and facebook, reddit and other places are still good for education and organization. Definitely worth their usage for these changes.

The bill also authorizes states to sue the federal government for decisions or alleged failures related to immigration enforcement.Under this bill, DHS must detain an individual who (1) is unlawfully present in the United States or did not possess the necessary documents when applying for admission; and (2) has been charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admits to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.The bill also authorizes state governments to sue for injunctive relief over certain immigration-related decisions or alleged failures by the federal government if the decision or failure caused the state or its residents harm, including financial harm of more than $100. Specifically, the state government may sue the federal government over a* decision to release a non-U.S. national from custody;\\n* failure to fulfill requirements relating to inspecting individuals seeking admission into the United States, including requirements related to asylum interviews;\\n* failure to fulfill a requirement to stop issuing visas to nationals of a country that unreasonably denies or delays acceptance of nationals of that country;\\n* violation of limitations on immigration parole, such as the requirement that parole be granted only on a case-by-case basis; or\\n* failure to detain an individual who has been ordered removed from the United States.[https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/5)This bill requires the DHS to detain anybody in the united states who is either arrested, charged, convicted, or admits to committing misdemeanors such as shoplifting.By this logic, ANYBODY in the united states who is arrested for the misdemeanors mentioned above who does not have their documents for immigration present are detained by the DHS, regardless of whether or not they are guilty of it.It also allows states to sue the federal government for, among other things, releasing these people from custody under seemingly any circumstance since the wording doesn't imply any further, and that any \\"limitations on immigration parole\\" can be grounds for suing the federal government.","title":"Senate passes Laken Riley Act in first move after Trump inauguration"},{"text":"Trump say political violence is ok.

And not being \\"citizens\\" within the meaning of the Constitution, they are not entitled to sue in that character in a court of the United States, and the Circuit Court has not jurisdiction in such a suit.6) The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race, treat them as persons whom it was morally lawful to deal in as articles of property and to hold as slaves.7) Since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, no state can by any subsequent law make a foreigner or any other description of persons citizens of the United States, nor entitle them to the rights and privileges secured to citizens by that instrument.8) A State, by its laws passed since the adoption of the Constitution, may put a foreigner or any other description of persons upon a footing with its own citizens, as to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by them within its dominion, and by its laws. But that will not make him a citizen of the United States, nor entitle him to sue in its courts, nor to any of the privileges and immunities of a citizen in another State.This was literally why Dred Scott mattered so much. It effectively held that black people **could not** be citizens of the United States and could only be granted rights similar to citizens by the states. This was very quickly realized by free people of colour to effectively mean that not only could they not use the constitution for protection, it could in theory allow a state to enslave every black person residing there on a whim.","title":"Trump to sign sweeping executive actions on immigration, launch fight to end birthright citizenship | CNN Politics"},{"text":"Walks like a duck talks like a duck","title":"Did Elon Musk Seriously Just Do a Nazi Salute at Trumps Inauguration?"},{"text":"Remember how Biden was criticized for not getting everyone out at last minute after Trump set up the failure?

While these current and future developments address nearly every one of their ill-informed, contrarian arguments, paid for by oil companies and attacking the so-called \\"radical leftist,\\" green energy agenda.But the questions remains, why has this issue become so politicized? First and foremost due to the efforts of big oil, along with the politicians they've lobbied and recruited, to fund climate skepticism research and campaign against the science behind climate change, as well as the scien*tists* responsible for its research. And as a result, a right wing contrarian movement in the U.S. has made climate denialism part of their platform.Back in the '80s, Exxon's internal team of scientists had found that big oil's burning of fossil fuels was contributing to the \\"greenhouse gas effect\\" and a \\"warming planet.\\"However, Exxon was making public statements that directly contradicted their own research.Big oil began really latching on to the narrative that the science was \\"inconclusive,\\" while spreading doubts about climate change as any kind of threat what so ever.Oil companies were worried that if news got out, it would lead to radical changes that would impact their bottom line. Can't have that.Exxon eventually merged with Mobile, and together with other oil companies, as well as the infamous Koch industries, they began a campaign of deception, trying to shape public opinion, influence policy, and undermine climate change science. Some of these companies were even sued. One of the lawsuits claims that: \\"previously unknown internal documents confirm that the defendant well understood the devastating effects that their products would cause to the climate\\".In the late '80s, a bunch of fossil fuel companies got together in order to form a coalition that would begin to aggressively lobby politicians and even the media. Who do you think they turned to most? Yep, that's right, Republicans.In the early '90s, there was even an effort led by energy companies to characterize global warming as *theory,* not fact.They funded advertisement campaigns to sow doubt among the general public, and often used cherry picked data to make ridiculous claims like, \\"well, if the globe is getting warmer, then how come it's been colder in ______.\\" And it's arguments like these that so called \\"climate deniers\\" rely on even today.These kinds of rhetorical questions were designed to generate uncertainty and confound public opinion.This group also targeted and identified susceptible audiences for their messaging. Including, but not limited to: \\"older, lesser educated males from larger households who are not typically information seekers\\".It became an effective campaign at promoting climate skepticism. Oil companies even began funding climate skeptic/denying researchers.Millions of dollars were donated to dozens of institutions that either denied or downplayed the risks of climate change.Most of these organizations have been identified as right wing think tanks and advocacy groups fighting against regulations.These entities became the perfect allies for the big oil companies, as they could use their power, connections and political favor to push back against any policies or actions taken to address climate change.In 2008, ExxonMobil admitted to funding these groups and efforts, but then vowed to stop backing them financially.However, this didn't prevent climate change from becoming a politically divisive and ideological issue.This is partly why I find it so unnerving when conservatives claim that there's some clandestine, deep state effort to push a \\"green\\" or \\"renewable\\" energy agenda on the general public. They're literally getting their cues and arguments from a decades long partnership between big oil companies and politicians promoting deceptive messaging and funding climate skepticism research that pushes back hard against the idea that climate change is \\"man made\\" to some degree.In the end, this effort basically instilled climate denialism into the conservative consciousness. To the point where if you are *not* vehemently against green energy initiatives, and if you are *not* denying the science behind climate change, then you're not a *true* conservative/Republican.In some cases, it's become such an ideological issue that you may also risk being labeled a \\"socialist.\\"On top of all of this, Republicans have been pushing an anti-intellectualist message, while encouraging their base to be more distrustful of the scientific community.Which has led to another problem where these contrarians will \\"trust\\" so called \\"experts\\" of their own, only if those experts provide them with arguments and information that validates their beliefs of course. And more often than not, these \\"experts\\" they turn to, are either discredited, or not actual experts to begin with, while they frequently base their arguments off of their own feelings and beliefs, instead of the relevant research and science on the matter.Over time, climate change has become a charged issue, no pun intended, and the goal posts have continued to move. At first, climate denialism amounted to well, just outright denial. But as the Science behind climate change became more and more accepted, climate deniers have had to resort to different tactics.And that's where a lot of talking points today come in. Many fossil fuel defenders simply jump to conclusions first, then try to fill the gaps by whatever means possible later. Slowly but surely adopting nearsighted criticisms of renewable energy efforts.But as I stated earlier, most of these criticisms don't take future advancements into account. They often cherry pick, or rely on misleading information, or take things out of context to target costs, manufacturing, technological shortcomings, lack of infrastructure, issues with power storage, and above all else, the ridiculous talking point that this shift is actually *more* harmful to the environment.And why is it ridiculous? Because we all know that these people couldn't care less about the environment in the first place.Additionally, companies belonging to or adjacent to the energy industry, have begun outlining proposals and adjusting models to adapt to this shift in the American energy landscape. Which means, for all the whining, there has been a concerted effort to take on more renewable energy projects. Meaning that, any pushback against this effort will not take into account the costs and resources that have already been spent.What's really hypocritical, is how these skeptics are the same people who supposedly support innovation and new jobs at all costs. And when it comes to the level of innovation we can expect from the fossil fuel industry, versus what we can expect from industries involved in advancing our reliance on more renewable sources of energy, there is a massive disparity between the two. So, do they really care about innovation and the environment, or is this purely ideological in nature? I'm going to go with the latter.","title":"Trump to declare national energy emergency to boost fossil fuels, power projects"},{"text":"The celebration for when this fuck finally dies will be bigger than that night when Bin Laden was killed.The whole world is going to take to the streets to celebrate this asshole's miserable death.May he die alone and scared.","title":"Trump moves from American carnage to a horrible betrayal in second inaugural"},{"text":"Reminder that this \\"paper\\" is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and that anything it prints is oligarch-approved.?","title":"Trumps inaugural address defied its own theme"},{"text":"Including people who fought the Taliban as allies of the US.

That misses one important aspect, total electricity [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/electricity-prod-source-stacked?facet=entity&amp;country=CHN\\\\~USA](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/electricity-prod-source-stacked?facet=entity&amp;country=CHN~USA)So while China's total electricity production doubled they managed to maintain the same percentage improvements to renewables as US. What do you think happens when China reaches their electricity peak and solar starts replacing fossil fuels rather than growing along them. The only field where US has had the advantage is nuclear but US didn't start building a single nuclear reactor from 1978 to 2013 and finish a single one from 1996 to 2016, which is why China has narrowed this gap.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\\\\_power\\\\_in\\\\_the\\\\_United\\\\_States#Nuclear\\\\_power\\\\_plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_the_United_States#Nuclear_power_plants)There is a way to change other countries and it's very simple, trade. If US made new cheaper and more efficient solar panels than China everyone would be falling over themselves to buy them and thus lowering the need for fossil fuels. I still remember when this was the messaging. Old co2 emissions were justified because they allowed the development of solar panels and other renewables which could then be sold cheaply to Africa etc so they could skip the fossil industrialization, but the only country doing that nowadays is China.Natural gas was originally marketed as the bridge energy from coal to renewables, but it seems to increasingly just be the end goal. Justifying investment into gas becomes harder and harder as renewables keep getting more competitive.","title":"Trump says will declare 'national energy emergency'"},{"text":"Lemme check (tries light switch).

Republicans have successfully run on a \\"populist\\" platform, but what we've been seeing in these months leading up to Trump's inauguration alone, is how little this MAGA coalition represents \\"the people. In fact, this movement more closely resembles a modern, so called \\"gilded age\\" of the \\"robber barons\\" with corrupt ties to politicians.For one, Trump's next administration is already estimated to be the richest in US history. Trump is filling his cabinet with ultra-wealthy loyalists, conservative tech and finance  \\"bros,\\" and corporate cronies backed by those special interests, lobbyists and dark money organizations, conservative \\"think tanks\\" and advocacy groups and even the Koch Network, among other nefarious entities connected to each other through this web of right wing plutocrats.These are people and organizations that have been using their wealth, immense power and influence to affect policy, to facilitate Trump's rise to power, to elevate MAGA extremists, and in some cases, to pave their own entryway into politics.In exchange for positions of power within Trump's new administration, these MAGA benefactors contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's campaign, while organizing election influence efforts of their own and laying the groundwork for enacting a far right agenda that serves the needs of the few at the expense of many.Some of these people have the audacity to call themselves \\"outsiders,\\" but they are only outsiders in the sense that they've been infecting and inserting themselves into our politics from the \\"outside\\" for so many years.For all of their complaining and accusations against Democrats for being in \\"cahoots\\" with big tech and the media, Trump supporters are silent while he meets behind closed doors with billionaires, tech and news media moguls, social media owners, and the operators of some of the most massive corporations in the world.Trump is now working closely with some of these rich, soon to be oligarchs, to make sure they are in lockstep with his next administration.I mean, just take Elon Musk for instance.Trump has single handedly propped up Elon Musk to become one of the world's most high-profile political agitators. Trump has even offered Musk a director spot within a completely made up government agency that Musk himself campaigned for on his own platform. And all he had to do in exchange for it, was toss Trump a couple hundred mil, and transform Twitter into a hotbed of MAGA propaganda and misinformation.Billionaires and other money-spinners like Musk, Bezos, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg, and even some executives at the top of multi national corporations, have all been flocking to Trump in private to bend the knee.With the backing of this network of pro-Trump bankrollers, billionaires, special interest groups and political organizations, the Republican party will have the best chance they've had in decades to consolidate power and set up a system of one party rule that openly mocks the constitution and the separation of powers. Republicans will direct their efforts towards reshaping the government into an instrument of single party power with a unitary Trump executive, which they will then use to enact their agendas by virtue of his majesty.Many of Trump's former and new allies will be taking advantage of their positions, and exploiting Trump along the way to implement a far right, authoritarian agenda that focuses as much power as possible in the hands of the executive, while restructuring the government in a way that best serves *their* party, *their* ideology and their own self-interests.They will take actions to erode the independence of most government agencies, especially regulatory agencies, putting the administrative state under their direct control. They will strip civil servants of their protections, and either cleanse these agencies of all non-partisan staff who will not pledge their allegiance to Trump and the MAGA movement, or they may take steps to eliminate these agencies altogether.Republicans will also do their damnedest to follow through on the increasing number of unconstitutional threats they've made against their political adversaries, their naysayers in the media, judges, journalists and congressmen, anyone who has ever tried to hold Trump accountable, anyone who participated in \\"stealing\\" the 2020 election from Trump, hell, anyone who has ever hurt Trump's precious feelings for that matter.There's also no doubt that Republicans will attempt to challenge all kinds of legal precedents and legislative accomplishments that have gone a long way in protecting civil rights, expanding voting access, and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of marginalized groups of people.What's more, there will be a concerted effort that attempts to establish a Christian nationalist code and rule of law for this country. If anything, this will be one of their most dedicated efforts as a growing faction of religious extremists in government have been planning and preparing for this eventuality.And what might be worse, is the fact that tens of millions of Americans voted for this because our electorate is an irrational force incapable of making politically informed decisions, and more concerned about who's to blame for their immediate circumstances. And this is thanks in no small part to how the \\"news cycle\\" and social media platforms have become breeding grounds for fearmongering propaganda, culture war fights, foreign disinformation campaigns and increasing amounts of misinformation, all while Republicans continue to take advantage of this by sowing distrust in all other forms of media that don't toe the Trump line.To anyone paying attention, Republicans have made it clear that their messaging is far different from their intentions. This isn't populism, it's authoritarianism, it's anti-democratic, it's madness. And it all stems from the fundamental notion that only *they* are entitled to the god-given rights and freedoms afforded to them and protected by the constitution, only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities, only *they* are entitled to ownership and control.","title":"Progressives Say \\"Billionaires' Row\\" at Inauguration Ceremony Shows True Winners of Trump Agenda | \\"Trump's White House is government by the billionaires, for the billionaires,\\" said the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus."},{"text":"Those two were white passing.

Everything about the plans seems very callous, and if Im being honest, as if the plan is being made up on the fly.At the end of the day, if people are deported because theyre here illegally, thats the law, thats how it has to be, and biblically speaking, were to follow those laws.

Historically, one region (the Laurentian Corridor, Windsor through Quebec City) dominated all of Canadian politics, with about 80% of the votes in the House when the country was founded. It still has a bit over 50% of the votes, but the alliances finally shifted when the West grew enough in population.Canada's Conservatives represent an alliance of Western Canada and rural Ontario (along with an area around Quebec City), while the Liberals are concentrated in urban Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. The 905 belt around Toronto is the largest swing region, with the Vancouver area and Atlantic Provinces being the other main ones (rural Quebec is the Bloc).Canada is more left wing largely as a result of the Laurentian Corridor benefiting from a large centralized government, which has allowed it to use its voting power to profit off other provinces and control the country. The West has been the largest right wing area, as decentralized power has been the best way to counter the centralizing forces in Laurentian Canada. Rural Ontario joined the alliance largely because it also feels disenfranchised from a centralized government that primarily benefits the largest city centers.So, in a version of Canada that joins the US, does Ontario or Quebec still benefit from centralized power? Quebec certainly wouldn't, as being a French region in an overwhelmingly English country, it would be a small minority, and thus would prefer decentralized power. Realistically, there's no way Quebec would agree to join the US period, but theoretically, if it did, it would be joining as a state of its own, to protect its French culture.For Ontario, it would no longer have the economic and demographic heft it did in Canada, so it wouldn't benefit nearly as much from centralized power. Ontario is the biggest beneficiary of this. Unlike the US, Ottawa is not its own territory, so all public servants in Ottawa pay their taxes in Ontario, while Toronto is the center of Canadian finance, and would lose that position as part of the US, where NY is much larger.Ontario probably also wouldn't join the US for those reasons, and would demand statehood on the off-chance that it did.The West favours decentralization because it has spent 150+ years being dominated by Central Canada. But, in the US, it would probably be more of a swing state, and have the ability to make decisions to go either right or left, depending on what is being offered. Alberta is probably the most likely to actually consider joining the US, as its deal as a state would be so much better than it is in Canada (Alberta contributes more net taxes, minus expenditures, to Ottawa by a factor of 3+ than any other province, and more than twice what any state contributes to Washington by percentage of GDP), and would probably be a swing state.The whole picture has more parts, but I will run out of space if I discuss them all.The point is that Canada joining the US would likely result in each of the main parties adapting to a new voting base who would shift the power dynamic, and Canadian provinces adapting to a shifting power dynamic that makes centralized vs decentralized power more or less favourable to them than it has historically been.","title":"CMV: Canada becoming a US State would be disastrous for Republicans."},{"text":"Religion doesnt actually matter to these people, has everyone got up to speed yet?

The biggest issue with this idea is that a lot of men don't actually care about the issues you mentioned.* Secondary education? A lot of men nowadays think that college is overpriced woke garbage and that real men should rather learn a trade.* Circumcision? Well, when a bunch of Republican states banned gender affirming care for minors, they specifically included exemptions so parents could still circumcise their kids without consent. A lot of queer people showed up during these sessions and gave really passionate speeches against nearly every aspect of these laws. If lots of men supposedly care so much about involuntary circumcision (and yes, they absolutely should), where were they and why didn't they speak up?* Male rape? A lot of men would rather not be reminded that this is a thing at all and will openly mock you for bringing it up.* The Draft? Yes, plenty of people complain that it's unfair against men, but even more people regularly complain that it's unfair that women in the military have lower entry requirements, or that they aren't suited for combat and shouldn't be in the military at all. You kind of can't have it both ways at once.Let's be real, outside of a ratively small bubble of reddit MRAs, most men, and especially the kind of disenfranchised men who feel left alone by politics, don't really give a fuck about the topics you mentioned. You can't build a large populist base among men on these topics.In fact, the biggest political group that actually agrees with and cares about most of these things and would consistently vote in favor of issues like ending circumcision or better recognizing male rape, are probably those exact same woke feminists who supposedly already dominate politics. In fact, if you polled on the one hand feminists and on the other hand men who feel misrepresented by politics, I suspect that feminists would agree with what you said significantly more often than men.","title":"CMV: Both Political Parties should start campaigning under men's issues in order to make the male vote more of a competition."},{"text":"1.

The only way to completely reverse that would be to reinstate gender discrimination, which would itself be wrong.

We also need to end our obsession with \\"elite\\" colleges and universities, and rely more on our robust community college system.So you are saying that men struggle in education more because there are more women in it? As a former public defender myself, I can say that rape and violence against men is no longer treated less seriously. It is true that it often gets underreported, as those men don't want to admit that they were victims of violence or rape. But, that's a cultural issue, and not really something for government to deal with. From a legal standpoint, it has been thoroughly addressed.But your viewpoint is limited. There are cases that come out nearly everyday of a female teacher assaulting a make student and getting a slap on the wrist. Just because your society is different, doesn't mean its like that everywhere else. Babies have never had bodily autonomy. We get all sorts of medical interventions as babies that we don't consent to. I agree that circumcision isn't ideal, but I also don't think that it's nearly as big a deal as it's portrayed in some circles. As for your figure of 100 babies dying each year from it, to put it in perspective, powered lawnmowers are responsible for 950 deaths per year, but nobody is all that concerned about it.

There are sentencing minimums in place. Your issue seems to be more that those sorts of crimes against men are not prosecuted in the same way as against women. You're also having to take into account domestic violence there, which is statistically a higher chance to happen to women than men, though that gap is not what I'd have initially thought.So you agree with me then that violence against men should just be prosecuted in a different way then women. Yeah I believe the difference is 10%. Being that 60% of cases are against women and 40% of men. I feel like this statistic for men may be higher though just cause of the stigma about men coming out about their poblems. \\"May have great affects\\" isn't really a reason to bring it up in an election setting. Politicians discuss things that poll well. Men's issues don't seem to be high on the list when it comes to polling data. And also they'd have to come up with some sort of actual solution to those issues that the government is allowed to take action on or would be influential in. Your view is that men's issues would improve the performance of a party by bringing them to the forefront but then you say it might not, you don't know. So there's really no view to change because we can argue your examples but your defense to that is really just \\"well I think it would be a good idea\\"You made a good argument here. !deltaCould you think of a way to rally the people then for these issues cause I feel that we both can agree that they are issues that should be solved, but how would they gain support in being recognized.","title":"CMV: Both Political Parties should start campaigning under men's issues in order to make the male vote more of a competition."},{"text":"Wonder where he thinks Panama will get the $2 billion to fix it?

The education gap is essentially the result of women getting access to post-secondary education where they didn't have it before; there are more candidates for fewer seats. The only way to completely reverse that would be to reinstate gender discrimination, which would itself be wrong. The better answer is to expand college and reform it so that it is much more widely accessible. We also need to end our obsession with \\"elite\\" colleges and universities, and rely more on our robust community college system. 2. As a former public defender myself, I can say that rape and violence against men is no longer treated less seriously. It is true that it often gets underreported, as those men don't want to admit that they were victims of violence or rape. But, that's a cultural issue, and not really something for government to deal with. From a legal standpoint, it has been thoroughly addressed.3. Babies have never had bodily autonomy. We get all sorts of medical interventions as babies that we don't consent to. I agree that circumcision isn't ideal, but I also don't think that it's nearly as big a deal as it's portrayed in some circles. As for your figure of 100 babies dying each year from it, to put it in perspective, powered lawnmowers are responsible for 950 deaths per year, but nobody is all that concerned about it. That's a ridiculously small number.4. It remains to be seen whether the draft would be constitutional if called into service again. I don't think that the gender gap would be. Regardless, I sincerely doubt that we will ever have a draft in the United States again, because war doesn't need untrained boots on the ground to the degree that it used to.Now, having addressed all of these, the real problem is that these issues are being championed *specifically for the purpose* of driving discontent and pushing men towards conservatives. These concerns don't really need to be addressed in a gendered way. But, even if they were, and even if a Democrat wanted to champion them, the so-called mens' rights activists would simply move on to the next thing that they don't think that they can get a Democrat to sign onto. To my mind, men's rights are not the goal, they are merely the means to an end. Because the goal is to push men towards Republicans, no level of campaigning or dedication on these issues will matter.","title":"CMV: Both Political Parties should start campaigning under men's issues in order to make the male vote more of a competition."},{"text":"You have addressed my personal argument but what about the second half?

K-12 learning is primarily again, a state issue, and parenting has a major role over that. Perhaps teaching methods can be improved but I don't see how that can be a discussion in a federal election setting. There are sentencing minimums in place. Your issue seems to be more that those sorts of crimes against men are not prosecuted in the same way as against women. You're also having to take into account domestic violence there, which is statistically a higher chance to happen to women than men, though that gap is not what I'd have initially thought. Again, the age when circumcision happens for children in religions where it's a practice is a long standing religious practice. Yes, I don't personally agree with it but I don't think the stats support an overwhelming problem where the government needs to step in. Also that kind of thing is definitely going to go to the Supreme Court if implemented, and with the current group of Justices, I don't see them intervening on the side of banning that practice or limiting it in some way.\\"May have great affects\\" isn't really a reason to bring it up in an election setting.

In fact I'd even say sexual assaults followed by gaslighting are more common than false accusations (*though that is just speculation on my part*). I do understand that often just the accusation is enough to condemn someone in the court of public opinion, but that is a separate problem.

There might be a legitimate way to handle that, my thoughts are that compassion should be the name of the game, but that discussion I leave to more qualified people.(*For the record, it turned out that my accuser was not the woman, when she found out I'd been accused of raping her she quickly shut it down.

Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan, whose vast fortunes allowed them to dominate industries and wield immense political influence. This era earned the moniker \\"Gilded Age\\" due to the stark contrast between extreme wealth and widespread poverty. - Political Corruption: Business tycoons often bribed politicians and controlled government policies to favor their interests. For example, monopolistic practices were enabled by lax regulation and corrupt officials. - Public Backlash: The growing wealth gap led to the rise of labor unions and movements advocating for workers' rights, as well as calls for government reforms to curb corporate power.Here's what happened next... Progressive Era (1890sC1920s) - Antitrust Legislation: Efforts to challenge plutocratic influence gained traction, leading to landmark legislation like the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), which aimed to break up monopolies and restore competition. - Income Tax Introduction: The 16th Amendment (1913) authorized the federal income tax, targeting the wealthiest Americans to reduce economic inequality. - Reform Movements: Progressive reformers sought to diminish the power of wealthy elites through initiatives like direct election of senators (17th Amendment) and regulations on campaign contributions.","title":"The Gilded Age of Trump Begins Now"},{"text":"I have nothing to say to those who want me dead.

In the end, though, it's down to local policing and also a societal belief that assault against men isn't as big of a deal. You'd have to change that perception first.I'm not a master of the justice system in the USA. But why can't their be sentencing minimums for specific crimes put into place? Men not having bodily autonomy - circumcision is a religious practice in many cases, and the government is separate (in theory at least) from legislating against religious procedures. Plus there's no guarantee it's going to sway men one way or the other; what about all the Jewish men who have had that done or have fathered children who they have had circumcised?I don't think it should be outright banned, I think it should be limited to a specific age where the child can consent on it.
