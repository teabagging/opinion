The Biden administration has been relatively weak on both fronts, but weak is better than full throttle the wrong way.A vote for Trump could mean the end of Palestine, and likely would mean the end of Ukraine (unless the EU steps up significantly).

It only cares how much power a country can wield and how that affects relations with other countries. Its been the de-facto way geopolitics has operated since WWI.\\n \\n \\n \\n Imperialism as an idea has not ever been fought against within Congress nor has any point in history has the US claimed to be not imperialist. They definitely accuse other countries of imperialism. Ok, projection is understandable tactic in international relations.\\n \\n \\n \\n During the 13 Colonies era, the American Revolution was about British citizens being fed up with paying taxes to a government that could not and would not support them and adequately reward them for their British conquest of the US East coast. The 13 Colonies people could not give a fuck about the UKs conquest of other countries. Early Americans could not give a fuck about killing entire Native American tribes. They could not give a fuck about the horrors of enslaving people.\\n \\n \\n \\n So please, spare me the holier than thou argument that Americans are historically anti-imperialist. Sit down.\\n \\n \\n \\n This isnt a question about morals pal, this is question of whether you rather be under the indirect control of another country or would you rather be free of hegemony from another country.\\n \\n \\n \\n From a state level, you want to be the imperialist.

Heres why Im not abandoning Kamala Harris."},{"text":"The 2nd amendment was recognized as only pertaining to a well regulated militia for over 200 years.False.We have court cases going all the way back to 1822 with Bliss vs Commonwealth reaffirming our individual right to keep and bear arms.Here's an excerpt from that decision.If, therefore, the act in question imposes any restraint on the right, immaterial what appellation may be given to the act, whether it be an act regulating the manner of bearing arms or any other, the consequence, in reference to the constitution, is precisely the same, and its collision with that instrument equally obvious.And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.Nunn v. Georgia (1846)The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!Explicitly when such a right had to be created by an activist Supreme Court is the exact opposite of true.This is blatantly false. Arms in common use have always been protected.After holding that the Second Amendment protected an\\nindividual right to armed self-defense, we also relied on the\\nhistorical understanding of the Amendment to demark the\\nlimits on the exercise of that right. We noted that, [l]ike\\nmost rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is\\nnot unlimited. Id., at 626. From Blackstone through the\\n19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any\\nweapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for\\nwhatever purpose.

For example, we found it fairly\\nsupported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons that **the Second\\nAmendment protects the possession and use of weapons\\nthat are in common use at the time.** Id., at 627 (first\\n**citing 4 W.

I even connected my Braille dislay so I could read the script without having a robotic voice yapping in my ear while I talked to the potential voter. The problem was the calls themselves. The vast majority were no answers/voicemails, with a few wrong numbers sprinkled in. This is probably pretty common for phone bankers, but it was a tad disappointing. Another issue I had was the lack of warning I got before a call was connected. Would be nice if we got a dial tone or some other phone noise to indicate whether a line was picked up. I had to scramble to get back to the script. Unfortunately I had to leave before I was able to get any affirmative calls, but I'd say it was still a mostly positive experience. Think text-banking might suit me better though.

There is quite a few books on the topic.\\nAccelerationism breaks into many sub camps just like all political ideology does, but there are two main factions at the moment.\\nI agree that gates and musk are good examples of these, however I can't be more clear in my opinion neither of them represent the movement in any official capacity. I don't think it's worth the time to go into the history or the actaul front men in my random comment but I can summarize the two main factions on a super simplified eli5 using those two guys?\\nGates:\\nFundamental belief, the average human is dumb and is not capable to make intelligent decisions on their own future. A democracy must be present but given ample opportunity to overrule the uneducated masses or to dictate and control what options they are aloud to discuss or consider. This way a democracy can exist but with in the bumper, guard rails of a menu,? a class of superior minds have created as pre decided options the proletariat can debate on . A massive reduction in population must occur to ensure this overclass can keep the masses content and in the safety net of their design . Breeding must be regulated by the government to ensure as gates father said a continually directed path to the replication of positive genetics and the elimination of negative genetics and heritable traits. Gates father, a famous eugenicist supported the sterilization of any person who showed propensity to commit crime, had a blood line bearing hereditary disease, or a history of mental insanity. This was the founding mission of gates and Sanger when the formed planned parenthood.?\\nAll together it is an ideology that believes with strict control of the populations size and privelage a body of superior minds can micro manage utopia in a sustainable manner utilizing advanced technology to control infrastructure, group psychology , and public policy while providing a? quantity of engagement in activity to keep the general population entertained and content.\\nMusk:\\nThis camp strongly believes in the fortitude of human ingenuity in crisis. Although also fundamentally believing the masses are not intelligent enough to know how or think up how to guide their own future, this camp differs in having a strong belief that no one single body can ever successfully make decisions for all . They're approach centers around the idea that the individual who may not be capable of formulating the needed thought is very capable and by right of existance entitled to be part of the process. Rather than guiding public discourse through a series of guardrails this camp takes a slightly more chaotic approach. Viewing utopia not as a construct that can be built, but as a process in it self with no end target but continuing adaptation to the circumstance of the time.?\\nThis creates one of the largest fundamental differences with in the common belief shared by both of the existance of a superior class. With the previously mentioned camp appointing it's superior class based upon a criteria not disclosed. This camp believes superior thought can come and go like the wind. The same individual that has an amazing revolutionary thought today can have a stupid thought tomorrow therefore no one can achieve superior status without \\"defending the belt\\" per se. Another example of this group is the belief that the greatest invention or most ground breaking philosophy is more often never heard. Because the greatest achievement comes from necessity not from time. At the core there may have been many einsteins or newton's that just never got the motivation to utilize they're potential. By creating a docile mass they believe over time any constructed utopia will stagnate as contentedness does not breed innovation. True innovation is the product of dreams, desires, competition, and out right necessity.\\nRather than limiting mass exposure to options, they believe public exposure to new ideas should be promoted at all cost. Even if the result can create times of political and civil unrest. The logic is that any method that was truly superior in content rather than just in title can and would be embarrassed by the masses of the data from which the opinion derives is readily available. Example the average person might not be able to think up how to build a building or devise. If given the opportunity to have the schematics or blueprints presented and described with the different options publicly discussed the proletariat will choose the better of the available. Even if the end choice has draw backs those will be drawbacks that have been accepted.\\nThis group does not believe in a population control or eugenic policy. Instead they believe that man will over come and adapt through innovation. They strongly belief history proves them correct. Everything from fire, to agriculture, to governance of law was the result of a time of necessity where crisis promoted innovation. This is reflected in the ideas they have of building massive arcologies in less habitable environments like northern Canada. They believe that the overpopulation issue will solve itself by creating the conditions where the new pioneer will rise from the masses and develop the means to colonize other planets. While group (A) believes the end goal is well contained sustainable safety enclosure group (B) believes the expansion of mankind past any constraint is the answer. Their solution to eventual population crisis is the next frontier.\\nToo long didn't read:\\nThe gates camp believes a physical utopia can be created and sustained permanently in a manageable box of the nature human nature can be controlled. An end goal can be achieved through the appointment of a superior class of thinkers that guide humanity down a path based on their logical decisions to the eventual realization of complete structural perfection.?\\nMAN AS A WHOLE WILL ACHIEVE HAPPINESS AND TRUE COMPLETION IF ALL WORRY, STRUGGLE, AND CHALLENGE IS ELIMINATED. AND A SYSTEM IS PRODUCED TO AVOID IT RESURFACING. CHAOS CAN BE CONTIANED SO ORDER MAY REIGN?\\nThe musk camp believes utopia is not a physical reality, but rather a temporary state of being in-between the next great revelation in the human journey that is driven by the curiosity inherent with in human nature. No end goal exists outside of the constant rise and fall of those fighting for superior status, this the end goal is to create a society that see no end but only new horizons\\nMAN CAN NEVER ACHIEVE TRUE HAPPINESS OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTENCE OF WORRY, STRUGGLE, AND CHALLENGE, FOR THIS IS WHERE MAN IS STRONGEST, AND TRUE COMPLETION IS A STATE OF MIND ACHIEVED ONLY BY THOSE WHO HAVE CONQUERED THE CHALLENGE OF THEIR DAY. NO SYSTEM CAN EXIST THAT LIMITS THE EMERGENCE OF CHAOS.

If he had a specific plan for whats being added and what is being cut, then all his supporters would no longer be able to assume he has the same exact values as them and same priorities as them for healthcare, the moment a plan is released there are people who oppose it or think it should be changed in this way or that way or take something out or put a new coverage or exception in the more detailed the more messy and difficult campaigning on a topic becomes.If you are running against Trump, then you will never convince his base and his base dont even care about how he plans on doing something at all. Anyone who cares about detailed policy proposals and implementation plans is already most likely voting for Harris or they wont be convinced by her just releasing more detailed implementation plans. If they could be convinced by that then they would already be voting for her because she has much more feasible and explainable policies so far than Donald Trump who mostly rambles about issues that get lots of headlines in right wing media but doesnt elaborate on how he would do anything. Trump sometimes just says he is holding the information on implementation close to his chest and not telling people because he doesnt want anyone copying him lol. That makes no sense and is almost treasonous when you think about what that would actually mean as a prospective voter. Voting for someone who has solutions to big problems affecting you right now, but prefers to keep them a secret from the Biden administration because they are scared of losing credit for the idea or the policy. Thats not a patriot, thats a self serving person who would do that and hurt the country for 4 years when they could have solved the issues very quickly by their own estimation/rhetoric.I think all this points to the most strategic thing for Kamala to do being keep hammering Trump and doing rallies because she is competing with a rally heavy opponent who is already in a very weak position when you consider evaluating each campaign on policy and planning. Trumps team for his first term literally had Jared Kushner asking in their briefing/orientation from the Obama administration how many of the cabinet and other positions would be remaining on Trumps administration from the previous administration someone had to explain to him that those positions would all need to be filled as per usual by the new administration. That isnt indicative of a campaign that had a lot of planning and detail on their policies in the last election they won!","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"Hi Gonzo, I respectfully disagree. Policy is important! People care about what a candidate supports. A true campaign needs public rallies, one-on-one meetings like small town hall gatherings, mainstream and digital media, and on and on. Harris problem, I suspect, is that shes not likable. Sort of like Hillary. While both women are smart, their intelligence doesnt translate to warmth. Harris belief system is left of left. That makes people nervous. Four years ago she said she was not in favor of fracking. Supported the green new deal. Loved open borders. And thought everyone should be woke. \\nIf she comprehensively flip-flopping. Id love it if a reporter in Penn. would ask if she still is against fracking. Four years ago she said that Joe Biden would not halt fracking but she never said if she would. As for the green new deal, please note that 400,000 pounds of earth needs to be moved to acquire the rare earth minerals to make one battery for an electric car. \\nAnd its disturbing to know that she was the last person in the room when Biden approved the botched Afghan withdrawal. Thirteen military members lost their lives. Thirteen. And 85 billion in ordnance (military equipment) was left behind. Let me say this again: $85 billion left in the hands of the Taliban. I wonder how many humans especially girls and women were subsequently maimed or killed that abandoned weaponry.

Both are excellent examples of US Presidents who fixed our country after the GOP severely screwed it up.Obama fixed it after the GOP policies allowed the housing crisis to melt the economy. During Obama's administration, he asked the GOP to work on a plan to fix the border. The GOP refused multiple times, telling Obama to fix it himself. He did! That's why we have DACA. Biden revived an economy that was plague-stricken by GOP inaction early in the pandemic. The claim it will just go away killed 500,000 more people than necessary simply because GOP failures in leadership went against social distancing and masks. Dumpster Don admitted his failures to a reporter and has tapes of Dump's admissions. The GOP will kill people to gain political power. Again, the GOP failed to secure the US borders after Dump told Congress to vote against the border bill. Obama and Biden are heroes in the history of US presidents, and both are in the top 10 out of 47. Dump ranks fourth from the bottom or 43 out of 47. The GOP and their Christian Fundamentalist marriage is incompatible with democracy and the separation of church and state. It will end voting for non-Christians, allow discrimination against non-Christians, eliminate women's rights, and end equality for all. If allowed to continue, The GOP will destroy the US and create a Christofascist nation based on the bible. This will bring forth a National Christian Taliban to enforce biblical laws. In their world, ending the social safety net means people must accept help from religious organizations for charity.  We tried this before enacting social security. Marginalized people, including poor, disabled, and retired people who rely on social security, will end up on the streets starving to death or in prison performing slave labor, which will take jobs away from the public workforce. Every GOP Presidency ends with a severe recession, shocks to the economy, a shrinking middle class, and fewer rights for all. Not to mention, the GOP lies about which party is responsible for the national debt and deficits. And their laughable lies about the GOP being better for the economy. Democratic policies result in all of the people in the US doing better instead of the GOP policies that favor the rich. Take the GOP tax cuts; where are those tax cuts going? Into foreign investment, into real estate LLCs, buying up residential properties, and driving up rents. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year voting for the GOP is voting against their self-interests.","title":"Who was better? Obama or Biden?

Some examples of MSNBC asking hard questions are [This interview with Pete Buttigieg after a Maryland bridge collapsed](https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/buttigieg-on-bridge-collapse-biden-directed-admin-to-get-every-resource-possible-to-maryland-207807045827) a few years ago and [This recent interview with Pete Buttigieg on Harris's policy flip-flopping.](https://youtu.be/ZEjg8ZOTFQA?si=WuRRb_7OFAAeCsM7). Another recent example of this is NYT opinion columnist [Ezra Klein's interview With Alejandro Mayorkas on the Biden administration's immigration record](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-real-border-czar-defends-the-biden-harris-record/id1548604447?i=1000669414889). These are not hostile interviews, but they aren't the kind of fawning fluffy nonsense you get when Fox News or OAN interviews a republican. Even though the reward is potentially high the risk is very high, especially given the deficit of policy from Kamala Harris in this campaign.BTC and Pod Save America would be significantly less risky but there are basically no swing voters who watch/listen to those shows. At the same time an interview with friendly left wing media has non-zero risk. They are likely to ask a question or two about Gaza, immigration, or other issues that are important to, but divisive within, the Democratic coalition. Here the risk is small but the reward is negligible.Even people like Lex Friedman and Theo Von would end up being nice to her I'm sure (Theo Von said he'd like to see Bernie and Trump on the same ticket ?).I think there is a good chance Lex Freedman would be actively hostile. Theo Von, Hot Ones, or The Breakfast Club might be a good middleground. Theo Von is dumb, Hot Ones does relatively soft interviews, and The Breakfast club is ideologically aligned but reaches some marginal voters. These might be reasonable if her goal were to increase her popular vote margin, however America is a deeply flawed democracy in which most people's vote for president does not matter. Of your suggestions. I think this is the best but these kinds of interviews would be small risk, small reward. There are three things that I think have a similar or potentially better ratio of risk to reward than rallies. I would call these high-risk medium reward.First is local media interviews. Local press is generally less aggressive than the national press so the risk is lower and the campaign can be strategic about who they allow to interview Kamala to maximize reward by targeting swing districts. Here's the thing, Kamala just did [an interview with ABC Philadelphia](https://6abc.com/post/look-brian-taffs-exclusive-action-news-interview-vice-president-democratic-nominee-kamala-harris/15300044/) which went well. Second is national Town Halls. Here the reward is similar to the kind of long-form national interview you're asking for because it will be covered by the national press. The risk is lower because she won't be interacting directly with experienced journalists and there is somewhat limited opportunity for follow-up. It would be easier to dodge questions. To my knowledge she is not pursuing anything like this. Third is debates. Kamala Harris kicked Donald Trump's ass at their first debate and there is some evidence that the debate had a small but meaningful impact on voters. Her campaign seems to be doing everything they can to goad Trump into another debate.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"I think that ship has sailed for better or worse anyways.

Maybe thats the level of your education and youre way older than I should give you credit for in your post. Hey look! I can throw insults back too! ??Heres some definitions for you:Realpolitik\\npolitical realism or practical politics, especially policy based on power rather than on ideals.Source: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/realpolitikImperialism\\nthe policy, practice, or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areasSource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imperialismRealpolitik does not care if youre a democratic republic or dictatorship. It only cares how much power a country can wield and how that affects relations with other countries. Its been the de-facto way geopolitics has operated since WWI. Imperialism as an idea has not ever been fought against within Congress nor has any point in history has the US claimed to be not imperialist. They definitely accuse other countries of imperialism. Ok, projection is understandable tactic in international relations. During the 13 Colonies era, the American Revolution was about British citizens being fed up with paying taxes to a government that could not and would not support them and adequately reward them for their British conquest of the US East coast. The 13 Colonies people could not give a fuck about the UKs conquest of other countries. Early Americans could not give a fuck about killing entire Native American tribes. They could not give a fuck about the horrors of enslaving people. So please, spare me the holier than thou argument that Americans are historically anti-imperialist. Sit down. This isnt a question about morals pal, this is question of whether you rather be under the indirect control of another country or would you rather be free of hegemony from another country.From a state level, you want to be the imperialist. Its kill or be killed and its been ingrained in the institutional memory of the State Dept. after several attempts to be the good guy in international relations and they backfired. You say it doesnt benefit the anyone but billionaires. Hmmlets try an experiment: How about you get your ass kidnapped by a terrorist group in a little visit to Afghanistan because you were pretending to be an aid worker but really you were evangelizing your cult to the locals. You knew you could not do that and the punishment can be death. Oops. So now youre in a cell, maybe sexually assaulted or worse and youre praying that your captor will have a change of heart or be inspired by a divine message from your cults god. Fat fucking chance. But guess what? The State Dept hears about it. Youre an American in need of help. The State Dept activates the DoD for your sorry ass. Then several months later you see all the lights shut off one night. Curious huh? Then you hear the loud pop of flash bangs and suppressed carbine rifle fire and  moments later a scary dude in NVGs and dark camouflage uniform picks the jail lock.  Six other dudes like him seem to appear from seemingly nowhere rush your ass along with other prisoners out of the complex to what appears as blacked out helicopter. You faint on the helio because you aint great with heights and wake up in a hospital on a ship surrounded by American Navy Corps men and women telling you that youre going home. You see a Dutch guy who was a prisoner with you also being told hes going home. Not one UN Security Council member makes a peep about this. Theres no calls for punishment for violating Afghan airspace without notice and with military equipment and soldiers. Even Russia and China are silent. The Dutch government is grateful. This is power. This is what it means to be an American abroad in a bad situation. This is what it means to be an ally of an American abroad too. Your passport gets you these extraordinary privileges. I would not abuse them and Id definitely respect them. This is what imperialism gets you. This isnt some billionaire-only travel perk. Can we do better as a nation in our addiction to war? Absolutely. Yet my point on why imperialism matters and why its better that its us than them is pretty clear.","title":"What Happened?"},{"text":"Aka The Weinstein Way.","title":"Nobody: an US senator: the left wants him dead "},{"text":"Trump/Vance/RFK Jr./brain worm","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Name-Checks 28 Taylor Swift Songs in Statement Following  Trumps Anti-Taylor Tirade"},{"text":"oh yes...and the right is so thrilled obama biden and harris are living","title":"Nobody: an US senator: the left wants him dead "},{"text":"This is one of the best come backs ever@!!!@!@!!!   ??","title":"Democrats have the relevant celebrities!"},{"text":"unions don't matter!!1!people should not vote in the election, nor any union election, it's all BS!!!1!it doesn't matter that the Green party is overwhelmingly older white folks, no problem there!Please give up your power!!!!!What you do doesn't matter, all that matters are your private beliefs! that's how justice works, people say what they think and we win, no need to organize or build grassroots power./s","title":"It's silly and unrealistic to fight to change the system instead of voting for Democrats.

Its been described as American Idol meets the Olympics  and, well, American Idol on acid. But now, the glittering competition that draws millions and millions of viewers each year  and gave us stars like Celine Dion, who won for Switzerland in 1988  is being drawn into culture war politics via a distinctive feature of Switzerlands system of direct democracy. Millions of taxpayer dollars are at stake, which will have a drastic impact on the size and scope of next years competition. Switzerland won the rights to host next years contest when the Swiss singer Nemo became the first nonbinary winner of the contest in 2024  the small European countrys first victory since Dion came out on top nearly three decades ago. Late last month, Eurovision organizers announced they had selected the city of Basel as the official host city. But a small conservative Christian political party called the Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland has vowed to launch a referendum campaign against Basels decision to allocate 37.5 million Swiss francs (about $44 million) in city funding toward hosting the song contest. The party denounced Eurovision as rife with antisemitism, blasphemy and Satanism, pointing to performers like Irelands Bambie Thug, a self-described witch and ouija popstar whose performance featured a pentagram. For such a woke party, we Swiss are now supposed to pay a hefty bill? the EDU asked in a video posted to social media. Those criticisms of wokeness sound a lot like complaints US conservatives made about the 2024 Olympics in France. Donald Trump attacked the opening ceremonies for featuring drag performers: Im very open-minded, but I thought what they did was a disgrace, he told Fox News. And his running mate, JD Vance, falsely accused an Algerian boxer of being a transgender woman, attempting to tie her to Vice President Kamala Harris: This is where Kamala Harriss ideas about gender lead: to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match. But unlike the US, Switzerlands direct democracy  the most developed of its kind in the world  offers citizens a much more sophisticated tool to take their culture war grievances directly to ballot boxes. Up to four times a year, citizens in the Alpine country of 8.9 million show up to the polls to weigh in on a range of policy questions at the federal, regional and local level. The system allows citizens, parties and interest groups to propose their own policies (via initiative) or to challenge laws passed by the government (via referendum). That means a big chunk of the funding for Eurovision 2025 could be rescinded in a direct vote by Swiss voters, depending on how they feel come election day in November. This year, as Switzerland marks 150 years since it first introduced the referendum as a political tool on the federal level, its power as a vehicle for making policy and sparking national discussion are on full display  all because of a singing contest. Of course we take it seriously and it brings planning uncertainty, said Edi Estermann, a spokesperson for the Swiss public broadcaster SRG SSR, which is producing the Eurovision show. In the worst case, if such a vote were to go against the citys financial contribution, the [Eurovision Song Contest] would have to be greatly reduced. Still, Estermann acknowledged it comes with the territory in Switzerland: We live in a direct democracy, so the instrument of the referendum is part of it. In recent years, Swiss voters have considered everything from regulations on cow horns to a ban on burqas; they have voted three times on whether to scrap the countrys coronavirus restrictions and vaccination requirements (all three referendums failed) and on the countrys ambitious renewable energy targets (which voters upheld). Both the left and the right have notched victories via direct democracy: A famous initiative in 2009, spearheaded by the right-wing Swiss Peoples Party, banned the construction of minarets across the country. Earlier this year, meanwhile, progressive activists won a major fight when voters approved their proposal to give citizens a 13th month of pension payments each year. In many cases, initiatives and referendums fail  only around 10 percent of initiatives and 40 percent of referendums ultimately pass  but the quarterly votes provide what experts in Zurich and Bern say is an important pressure valve for political frustrations that countries like the US mostly lack. Even if you dont do it, you know you could theoretically, said Sean Mueller, a professor at the University of Lausanne who studies Swiss direct democracy. This alleviates a lot of the disaffection other people in other countries experience toward politics. Especially on the local level, the threshold for triggering a referendum is relatively low: Opponents of the Eurovision funding would need to gather just 2,000 valid signatures within the 42-day window for the referendum to go forward. That would give them time to get the Eurovision referendum on the ballot in November  and according to Samuel Kullmann, the leader of the referendum campaign, thats early enough to thwart the use of the funds altogether. Kullmann said his partys opposition to Eurovision funding isnt just because its too woke: They have financial and security concerns as well. Why should a city like Basel, for example, suggest spending 37 million Swiss francs on Eurovision when the same city government has pledged only 12.9 million francs for next years womens Euro soccer tournament? He also pointed to protests in the Swedish city of Malm? during this springs song contest, which came as a result of Israels participation in the song contest, as proof that hosting Eurovision can pose a security threat. But some of it, he acknowledged  like the pentagram and witchcraft imagery Irelands Bambie Thug used  feels personally offensive to the partys Christian members. We just felt its an egregious double standard that everything Christian has absolutely no place at all, but then we look at the performance of Bambie Thug and its overtly occult to a very, very high degree, he said. These double standards made us angry. The EDU is a small party with relatively few members nationally, but its plans for a referendum have gotten a boost via the countrys biggest party, the right-wing SVP, whose leaders have also been critical of Eurovision funding. The money would be better donated to those seriously affected by the storms than wasted on this embarrassing rainbow event, SVP leader Marcel Dettling said this summer after severe weather caused major damage in the country. The partys youth wing in the areas surrounding Basel has said it plans to back the referendum effort. Even if they succeed at getting the issue on Novembers ballot, its far from certain whether a majority of voters in the relatively progressive city of Basel would support it. But even in that case, organizers say it has already served at least part of its purpose: forcing a national conversation about the merits of Eurovision and the downsides of being the country hosting the popular song contest. The goal of an initiative or a referendum is often also to bring an issue to political attention, to bring it onto the political agenda, even if maybe only a few people in parliament would approve it, Kullmann said. But you are able to launch a nationwide discussion on an issue that maybe was previously ignored by politics.!ping EUROPE","title":"Switzerland's unusual form of democracy takes aim at Eurovision"},{"text":"When did I say this particular post was real?

Tim could be cleaning gutters while talking about Kamala's plan to help first-time home buyers. Since she and Tim are both gun owners, they could go to a gun range and talk about firearms safety policies and ways to reduce gun violence (of which there are many).They'd be more like the rally format where it's just them talking and not answering a 3rd party's questions, but they'd be focused on 1-2 topics an people could tune in to either the political topic or video task they found most interesting.

We really overstate the importance of uncommitted voters.Since there's a decent chance this race comes down to Pennsylvania, let's take the population of Pennsylvania:**Population of the Keystone State: 12.97 Million**But not all of those voters are registered.  **PA Registered Voters in 2020: 9,090,962**And not all of those turned out**PA turnout in 2020: 6,835,903**That means that Pennsylvania's turnout of registered voters was pretty good in 2020 -- about 76%.  Conversely, that means that 24% of registered voters did not cast a ballot in Pennsylvania.  That's 1 in 4 voters.  Assuming a fairly straight-line partisan split, that means that 12.5% of the registered voters in Pennsylvania both didn't vote and would would likely have voted Democratic if they'd cast a ballot.Compare that 12.5% to the 7% of Pennsylvania voters today who say they're \\"undecided.\\" Now, Harris is not going to win all of that 7%.  Even if she goes door to door and lays out her plans in perfect detail to each of them personally, some percentage of  those voters are going to say \\"ah, now that I understand what you want to do I will NOT be voting for you.\\"So let's split that 7% down the middle and assume Harris can, at most, win over 3% of the electorate. Winning that 3% means making really strong arguments, getting those arguments in front of those people, and connecting with the issues they care about.  On the other hand, you've got 12.5% of voters who are statistically likely to vote for Harris but just don't cast a ballot for whatever reason.Sure, some of those might be disaffected by the lack of substance in the arguments being put forth but they also might be busy, might not know how to cast an absentee ballot, etc.  And that's the final peace of the puzzle.  Identifying sympathetic voters and doing a Get-Out-The-Vote campaign for them is a solved problem.  It just takes a ton of money and enthusiastic supporters to drive people around.  You get both of those by hyping people up: rallies turn supporters into donors and volunteers.  That's why Harris is prioritizing those.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":" And Trump is your answer?I never said I had or thought there was an answer.\\nI dont think Stein would hold up to much scrutiny in a witch hunt like that.She would have no problem being scrutinized.

Our military, its equipment and its readiness to fight modern wars has been on the decline since the Gulf War - that's the assessment of retired military commanders and current military analysts. And we haven't fought a peer-to-peer war since WWII.-So our constant saber-rattling is dangerous and the promises we've made to allies are empty in the face of the real state of our military. When's the last time that the various branches of the military have met recruitment goals?-And now you have pinheads in Washington talking about war with Iran. According to Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, it's unlikely the Pentagon is on board with that unless they've changed mightily since this was war-planned in the 1980s after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Wilkerson was part of that war planning and has this to say:-And we did not want to go to war in Iran. Then it was a country of about 80 million, it's now about 90 million; it's a country of incredible mountains and desert terrain combined; and a country of enormous strategic depth and homogeneity in its population. -We would regret it as much as we regretted Iraq and Afghanistan times ten. And we would spend somewhere around $10-11 trillion on it. And we would have to go to conscription because it would take at least half a million men and women to even have a possibility.-We do not have the navy we should have. We should have done a lot of concentrating on naval assets starting 10 or 15 years ago. We didn't. We spent tons of money on F-35s and other things that cost a fortune for the American taxpayer. -When Trump said he'd get to 350 ships or whatever that figure was, we were sitting at about 272. We couldn't even man those ships, we'd have to go to full-out mobilization-type conscription to man them. -We're in trouble. I'm a soldier but I think our Navy is the most important arm of our armed forces because it protects our commerce, it keeps the seas open. The founders didn't write in the Constitution \\"to raise and support armies\\", they wrote \\"to provide for a navy\\"; there's a reason why they wrote that.

A morning radio show hosted by someone with local credibility that plays in a garage where 10 working-class people listen every morning, or in the car while a suburban mom takes her kids to school, that can make people give her a second look. I wish it were different, but the reality in the US is that only a thin slice of people in about six states matters. Local appearances help there.

Id bet shell do a something like a town hall, maybe on a major network, and then continue her local radio/TV appearances.

The Democrats could put up a reborn Reagan and Trump wouldn't lose a single extra vote.Would deep interviews make it more likely for the third party people to vote for her?  Seems unlikely.

So if there's no infection and no spike protein in the brain, how could a case of covid cause brain damage?It can't.But, for people who got the mRNA vaccines, it's a different story. How so?If some mRNA leaks out past the injection site, the lipid nanoparticles with the mRNA get carried throughout the body via the circulatory system. They then vaccinate whatever cells which then begin to output spike protein. Those cells (expressing a viral antigen) then get attacked by the Cell Mediated Immune Response (CMIR) which causes inflammation and cell death.So in plain English, if someone get vaxxed and some of the mRNA reaches their brain... the CMIR will cause inflammation and cell death in the brain.This is the exact same mechanism that was causing all the myocarditis in all those athletes up until people stopped getting the mRNA shots.For the people who were coerced into accepting the shots, I feel sorrow for you.But for all those pro-mRNA cheerleaders who strutted around reddit beating down on anyone who was worried about the Vaxx... now you fucking reap what you sowed.","title":"Biden said covid would give everyone Alzheimers and dementia back in 2021, and now data is coming out on MSM saying its true"},{"text":"CNN just updated and it looks like it was directed at Trump, and there's someone in custody.

The vast majority of people are voting either Democrat or Republican and don't really care about who the candidate is.  So, long-form interviews aren't a particularly good way to (a) drive up active participation among loyal followers, and (b) target the truly important swing voters that matter. Let's break those down:The key to Kamala winning is really two things: (1) getting more people to vote for her, and, (2) getting the right more people to vote for her. In the USA, the presidential election is not won by the popular vote. It is won by the electoral college. This election, the difference between winning and losing will be a few thousand votes. Those votes will happen in very specific states, and in very specific counties in those specific states. She doesn't need to get 1,000,000 more people to vote for her from random places across the country. She needs to get 2% more turnout in Gwinnett County, GA and Kent County, MI, and Washoe County, NV, and Erie County, PA, and Dane County, WI, and Maricopa County, AZ. If she gets the needed 2% in those counties, she will win the election. A long-form national debate is not the way to target the specific 8,000 votes she needs in Maricopa County. The way to get those votes is to hold a rally in Maricopa County to energize the local democratic apparatus so that they work a bit harder at turning out the vote efforts, and door knocking in that specific county. Harris can LOSE almost 5 million votes from the state of California, and another 2 million from New York, and if in doing so she gains 50,000 votes spread evenly in the counties above, the race wouldn't even be close.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"This isn't confirmed.

The problem you run into is the US government is constantly doing a bunch of stuff few people want it to do that no incumbent is really able to stop, but admitting that validates the stuff Trump says about there being a \\"deep state\\" which has what is basically a mind of its own. An incumbent doing interviews means they have to either defend the actions of the deep state or admit that the deep state is basically something that is outside the hands of the public elected authority. The deep state would prefer Kamala lose the election than have to have someone who isn't dismissible like Trump get grilled on the more controversial aspects of what they do, as they are basically able to deal with Trump for another four years like they did the last, but they wouldn't be able to deal with now both sides of the aisle believing the deep state is actually an entity with a mind of its own. Kamala's job, given that she got the Cheney endorsement, is to basically advocate for a non-confrontational relationship by ignoring both it and its crimes. Optimally if one wanted to win the election one would be both \\"not Trump\\" and criticize the deep state as this is a position which would make the most people happy, but if one did that they would never been directly nominated to the candidate position without winning a single primary. Her job is to maintain continuity. Trump's job, which is to say why he is allowed to exist, is to be dumb and crazy enough that his pointing about of all the core flaws with the American government is dismissible to basically present the implicit argument that it is either \\"business as usual\\" or \\"trump shenanigans\\". They'd prefer to have the Cheney-ite wing of the Republican party that supports the deep state even more than the Democrats do back, but the too dumb to function wing of the Republican Party is the next best thing and the preferable option to serve as the alternative for when people get sick of Cheney-ite policies.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"How old is he?

To persuade me of that I would like to hear data/arguments as to why rallies make a big difference or why there's too much risk in going for a mass media strategy.Strategically you could argue that the most important thing for her is to become more well known and in people's minds when they go to the voting booth. The advantage of a rally is that you can focus your efforts to specific areas, as opposed to interviews which, while having broader range, are less impactful due to the electoral college.So if you're someone in North Carolina or Pennsylvania for example, her doing rallies there has impact by word of mouth and local headlines which correlate with more votes. Since swing states are won by the margins, even this small bump can be more impactful for the election than gaining traction nationwide in states like California or Texas which have a large portion of the national population but are ultimately predetermined outcomes.Basically, swaying 1 million voters nationally is less important than swaying 100k or less in a swing state.Edit: Another factor is that interviews are less safe. They can be higher reward, but they also give your opposition more to run with. Her opponent isn't really running on policy, so the more details she gives about her own the easier it is to shift the narrative around criticizing her, which they haven't been able to do effectively thus far.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris should be doing less rallies and more long form interviews now to increase her chances of winning"},{"text":"Remember when Taylor Swift announced it and all the conservative subreddits were saying things like Look at the libs taking victory laps.

On one hand, it's a bit unfortunate for Trudeau, housing is not a \\"federal responsibility\\".

What I stated are facts. Moreover it is not a secret that the Chinese government recruits based on their affiliation, including racial, ethnic and ideological. Saying that all of the beneficiaries of the rescission of the affirmative action are going to is blatantly racist, but saying that there arent any is ignorance. Thus the republicans have given an opportunity to China to enforce their own style affirmative action, less transparent, ideologically tailored, racially charged etc and it would be silly for them to simply refuse to take this so kindly offered opportunity to meddle in the most intimate civil processes in the US, the one in charge of the makeup of the elite. China has openly declared their intentions . Republicans have nothing to say to their defence. They broke the academic competition checks and balances to the benefit of China, rich given their plea to limit government intervention in the civil society.And China rushed to further even more, with a kind of strings attached debt relief their interest. And you know that young Americans have not a particularly high opinion about patriotism, very many sharing openly hostile attitudes towards their country and glorifying China among other totalitarian countries. So theres nothing unusual about me saying that many of the affirmative action rescission beneficiaries will inevitably be enticed to take the financial burden relief coming from China. And maybe thats why theres so many in the first place. You know that rule of offer and demand competition rigged by selective government subsidy refrain that China is bashed at every corner, but not without reason. On the backdrop of republican defunding of public schools, the Chinese governments allocation of funds for their foreign agents looks awful.You think that the surge in popularity of an European tradition by the Chinese, like the Olympics, was a natural event without the governments agressive incentives?

The reason that the leaders of old testaments, the Jewish religion/faith didn't accept The Messiah/Savior in the temporal flesh, is because they were not expecting him as a temporal flesh human. They were expecting him to arrive as Melchezidec (The Annointed One in his spiritual form) Because!!!He broke bread with Moses and The Prophets and they heard their description of him, from them, and didn't pay enough attention to what The Word said.Just like the religious Christians of today, most have no clue that their Jesus ?? ran the entire old testaments as well, generally reffered to in the English textbook as, \\"The Angel/Messenger of The LORD \\" ( not just any angel/messenger ??)Or, \\"The Word of The LORD \\" came unto, Anyways, if all you want to talk about is solicited beliefs, i lol have no interest whatsoever.

He changed his own name and later declared himself an apostle. I am not aware of any passage that says God or Yeshua changed his name. Side note about the time noon: this is an important time of day in solar worshipping religions and secret societies (i.e. Freemasons), and doesn't have much meaning in the Hebrew/Jewish religion, or even really in Christianity, so having a vision of a higher being at around noon is one of many minor clues. Another is Paul's response, clearly he is unaware that the appropriate response to a call from heaven is either, \\"here i am\\", or, \\"Speak, for your servant heareth.\\" (1Samuel chapter 3); but he's still a sinner at this point, so we can forgive him for not being as well read as Stephen (whose speech before the Sanhedrin is beautiful and shows his righteousness and devotion to reading Torah).Acts is an interesting book, and it seems odd that there were no other authentic sources for what happened following the death of Yeshua, it's a shame, really. There is a book called \\"The Ascents of James\\" which tells a story from a different perspective, but that one didn't get canonized at any point that i know of, so it isn't well regarded.Don't you find it the least bit strange that James (Yacoub), the brother of Jesus (Yeshua) told Paul what the basic rules were for non-Jewish (gentile) believers, and Paul couldn't even keep with a simple 4 rules?","title":"Division is huge in America and in many 1st world countries, but not so much in developing or 3rd world countries."},{"text":"Russia because you really want to stash your billions in a country largely cut off from global banking and where the local autocrat can simply take your money without explanation.","title":"Breakdown of Presidential candidate Kamala Harris Tax Plan and what she has done as VP."},{"text":"Whistleblower, might want to protect his name.Dead whistleblower, pretty sure there's no reason to keep protecting his name.","title":"Holy Sh!t !!

So these facts together are not so much something that should make us say \\"oh maybe she wins Iowa\\" but rather \\"Iowa is likely only a 4 point lead for Trump, which suggests the swing voters in the Rust Belt are also likely breaking for Harris\\".","title":"Kamala Harris Within Striking Distance of Donald Trump in IowaNew Poll"},{"text":"Please proceed, Governor.","title":"Donald Trump declares 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' after pop star endorses rival Kamala Harris"},{"text":"It's legal in Missouri too.","title":"Trump's Iowa lead shrinks significantly as Kamala Harris replaces Biden, Iowa Poll shows"},{"text":"Trump: Taylor Swift endorsed me!Swift: No I didnt, weirdo.

It's rather disappointing that you don't believe in an Apostle of The Annointed One, Paul is a huge \\"part\\" of the latter rain/truth. Not sure what information has caused this with you, but The Word explains it like this (summary)When Paul was still Saul, he was an outward/religious Jew, 2nd in command of the Jewish religion/belief, he was a respected person of the community and lived high off the hog (luxuries)But he was the one that carried about the orders to murder the Isrealites for practicing our Father Love's 1st Commandment of \\"love one another\\" BY, Practicing the universal and eternal self governance of Christianity,  because they refused to follow the communities Government, he even gave  the nod to have St.Stephen stoned to death after Stephen had just witnessed a complete biography of the Isrealites from their beginning to their present time ( 17 years old ??)But, this was all before he was healed of his blindness on the road to Damascus, to slaughter more of our Father Love's children. After our Father Love's Annointed One healed him of his blindness and renamed him Paul, he became an Inward Jew, one who labors for one's keep and witnesses eternal life.And in Paul's case, every spare moment, because of what he was guilty of, mass murdering our Father Love's children. Though Paul once asked to be healed of a chronic infirmity, he was told No! and that our Father Love's Grace was sufficient for him. Paul endured extreme persecutions, but never complained about any of them, because of what he was guilty of. He is one of the main points of The Word, stay a religious/outward Jew (preaching bull$hit for $$$'s and respect/admiration ; Or heal yourself and become an Inward Jew, one who labors for one's keep and witnesses eternal life And of course worships our Father Love in and through (not by) our Father Love's Annointed One.

If you're spending so much time and effort trying to hide your tax obligation, you can deal with the consequences.  For about 90% of Americans, the IRS already knows what you owe without you even filling the return, and if you did miss something you'll just get a letter in the mail saying how much you still owe.  The audits come in when you have a complex filing with clear signs of hiding stuff.","title":"Breakdown of Presidential candidate Kamala Harris Tax Plan and what she has done as VP."},{"text":"Stop using words like \\"neoliberal.\\"","title":"Harris reduces her capital gains tax rate by more than 10% compared to Biden's proposal, marking a noticeable shift to the center."},{"text":"You know what else Bernie did?He told us to think for ourselves and we should ignore him if he told us who to vote for.

Canadian identity is difficult to put into words, so people who've failed to develop an intuitive sense of what it is might be tempted to try and \\"create\\" a Canadian identity in the mold of European nationalism. Unfortunately, they don't understand Canada well enough to grasp why that can't work in Canada. It's something that is knowingly vague and amorphous by necessity. Canadian identity has to incorporate Indigenous nations (emphasis on the plural), Quebec considering itself a distinct nation, other French speaking groups who do not consider themselves Quebecois, English speaking Canada, Newfoundland which did not join until 1949, and of course, a huge proportion of the population being immigrants.But honestly, the inherent diversity of Canada is hardly a unique challenge to creating a Canadian nationalism. No, the other major factor is the overwhelming cultural influence and similarity to the United States, and critically, how that influence doesn't evenly affect Canada. English speaking Canada basically exists in the same media and internet bubble as the US, while French speaking Canada is off in a separate bubble.So if you're a Canadian nationalist a really important thing you'd want to do is cultivate distinctly Canadian media. You might fund a national broadcaster and have Canadian content requirements for radio and TV stations so that Canadians don't only consume US media. This approach has some dubious results, but if you really believe in Canadian nationalism it's worth the try.People might latch onto a handful of symbols like poutine and hockey. They might put a lot of emphasis on Canada being broadly more politically \\"progressive\\" than the US, or drone on about Canadians being \\"polite\\" (I always cringe).Ultimately though, a functional Canadian nationalism just has to be okay with not being obviously distinctive. Nor can it demand to be an exclusive national identity. Most Canadians intuitively understand this and are fine with it.  \\"As Canadian as possible under the circumstances\\" is a famous aphorism for a reason. Canadian nationalists are content letting Canada be Canada.Canadians are just the people building their lives here. It's chill. We just make being born here the basis of Canadian citizenship, rather than the emphasis being on your parents being Canadian. And of course, once you've lived here a few years you can get citizenship. There is a darker side to this, where Canadians might regards Canadian citizens living abroad as not being \\"real\\" Canadians (this comes up when the government talks about evacuating Canadians from Gaza/Lebanaon).On the other hand the Canadian far right wants to defund the CBC. They got mad at Trudeau's calling Canada the first postnational state. They want to end birthright (jus soli) citizenship in favour of reserving citizenship for \\"our people\\". I've yet to be given a useful definition of \\"our people\\" by someone against jus soli (maybe if they didn't clock me as a lib they'd just say white people).tl;dr: Put \\"As Canadian as possible under the circumstances\\" in the passport.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I mean, that's better than him still saying it's true, isn't it?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"#New General election poll - New Mexico ??

This was the case for me. I was definitely voting for her because Trump has to be stopped and she seemed very acceptable. But the debate got me to I think she would be a good President and would be supporting her even in a world where Trump never existed.\\n4) Trump support comes from a cult. He will never ever lose that support. But he will struggle to find it outside the cult. Harris approval will increase as people become more familiar with her. And she will get a lot of votes from people who say they dont approve, because they disapprove of Trump even more. \\n5) Young people will not turn out.

My OH perception is that a not insignificant amount of people in the suburbs of the 3 Cs may flip from R to D with Mahoning (Youngstowns county) maybe being 50/50. I also think Dems add voters in the counties around Franklin (Columbus). It was reported at the end of 2023 that there was a Bank of America survey that showed Columbus having the highest growth rate in the 3rd and 4th quarters of any major US city.  The city has added ~40-50,000 people in the past couple of years. Cincinnati is also growing (albeit more slowly) and moving to the left. The Cleveland area is adding population in the counties around Cuyahoga (particularly Lorain) as of 2023 and Cleveland proper has stopped losing population. This is combined with most rural areas in the state losing population. On top of this, last year, we passed our reproductive rights amendment and legalized recreational marijuana which engaged a lot of voters. Yes, these are unusual hot issues that will not appear on this ballot, but a lot of people were more directly exposed to the fuckery of our state GOP. Our GOP reps introduced an amendment that would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments from 50+1 to 60+1. They did this to try to make sure our reproductive rights amendment would not pass. They failed and we passed both reproductive rights and recreational weed. These factors combined would make it hard for me to believe that OH moves right in this election. We just saw a special election for OH 6 this year (very low turnout so big grain of salt) that swung ~21 points to the left from 2022. My perception based on polling/ all of the above is that OH has some potential to start moving closer to center this election.

Prior to that we had the equal rights movements and abortion rights movements. But arguably at the same time, society has moved in a less progressive direction on economics and government spending.  When was the last time you saw one of the many open monopolies dissolved by government?  AT&amp;T was broken up in the 80s, but Ticketmaster, Microsoft, Google, Meta, etc have barely gotten slaps on the wrist and no less monopolies than AT&amp;T was.  Social assistance programs are often ghosts of what they used to be, and I think everyone recognizes Medicaid only provides a pittance now.  Tax rates on the top brackets used to be as high as 90%+, but mainstream progressives won't even suggest bumping as high as 50% in many countries.   Those are all areas where progressives have stepped back from previous policies.I'm not necessarily advocating for those policies, mind you, just noting that the more-progressive motion on social issues has been balanced by progressive groups moving in a more conservative direction on economic and government policy issues. On the right, **the Republican party shrugged off trying to literally overthrow democracy to put a now-openly fascist leader back into power.**  They're still trying to put that same leader back in power, as he spouts racist false claims that immigrants eat pets.  This is after decades of embracing more and more extreme views and conspiracy theories.  We're seeing elected members of congress spout far-right conspiracies and barely coded (or uncoded) xenophobia.Politics isn't as simple as political compass memes (which is a deeply flawed tool to begin with).

Part of what has happened here is somewhat unique to Iowa. Because the state has been traditionally first in the nation, Iowa used to have a more robust localized media organization. It meant that candidates (Democrat or Republican) could organize and run strong grass roots campaigns. The electorate was much less influenced by the Hannity, Limbaugh ecosystem than their other midwestern counterparts. However over the course of the last 10-15 years local newspapers had dwindled and national right wing media has taken hold. The rural margins that used to look more like 55/45 Republican are now more like 75/25 Republican. At least thats my understanding.

Most tolerate it because they *did* feel better economically under him, and say so constantly in polls, and they can at least hang onto that. Kamala has done a very, very  poor job of separating herself from the current admin. Shes done a very poor job of communicating to average voters that theyll stop hurting financially under her admin. Shes done a very poor job of explaining her policy position changes and not looking like just an opportunist willing to say anything and avoid any hard questions to just win an election. Shes done a poor job anytime shes off teleprompter, with Trump able to lose himself the debate. Honestly, her *only* saving grace amongst people who arent just going to vote Dem no matter what has been the abortion issue. Its very clear to me that Shapiro, Whitmer, Walz himself, or Buttigieg would have been way, way better candidates and would be drowning Trump right now. Hell, call me crazy, but I think even crazier choices like AOC, Sanders, or Abrams would be doing better. But the DNC went with the choice of least resistance, and while I do fundamentally get the why of it and think *any* choice would have been better than Biden, the party made the worst choice of those available.

The way clinical trials work is the Pharmaceutical companies pick and pay for the 3rd party company to conducts the trials. The allegation is that because Pharmaceutical companies are able to choose who conducts these million dollar contracts, theres an incentive from the 3rd party company to provide favorable results in order to acquire future contracts. \\n     \\n In the early 2000s, court documents released through litigation over controversial drugs - such as Vioxx and the hormone replacement therapy Prempro - showed pharmaceutical companies frequently hiring medical communication agencies to ghostwrite articles and place them in influential medical journals under the \\"authorship\\" of well-known academics paid thousands of pounds for their endorsement. Rather than relying solely on clinical data, we should take in consideration the history of the companies themselves and whether or not they have a history of unethical behavior. \\n      \\nDid you know in 2009 Pfizer plead guilty to misbranding a drug with intent to defraud or mislead, bribing doctors and suppressing adverse trial results. Pfizer was required to pay a settlement of $2.3 Billion to the Department of Justice, the 2nd largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the Department of Justice. Pfizer has paid over $10 billion in settlements for offenses like unapproved promotion of medical products, equipment safety and environmental violation, false claim and foreign corrupt practices. Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA Commissioner and is currently a board member for Pfizer. In the past 40 years, 9 of the 10 FDA Commissioners have worked for pharmaceutical companies after leaving the FDA. Reuter is the company responsible for the fact checking on Twitter and Facebook. Jim Smith is the Chairman of Reuters Foundation and also a board member for Pfizer. The only FDA approved treatment for covid is Remdesiver. Pfizer has an agreement with Gilead, the owners of Remdesiver to manufacture the drug. Pfizer makes large contributions to mainstream media outlets like CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC.
