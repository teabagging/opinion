Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You dont want to act, or even talk, alone; you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble. Why not?Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, everyone is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist.\\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.","title":"First Buddy Elon Musk accuses Trump impeachment witness of treason and calls for appropriate penalty"},{"text":"Melania! ??","title":"Trump aides devotional letters reportedly leak to NYT, sparking Truth Social tirade"},{"text":"Obama got off easy, there's still a bunch of people who celebrate JCPOA to this day.

Its essentially why government bureaucracy is as massive as it is.Just as an example for the rule of law: In a functioning liberal (the actual meaning of liberal) government, which the US is, each citizen has the same rights and must adhere to the same rules. But each citizen is also protected from government breaking rules or being in favor of someone or someones interests on arbitrary reasons. So each citizen can sue each citizen and any entity. Now, how should judges and lawyers determine that any law was broken? Thats only possible by documentation of any step in any given process. If you call the police on a citizen, police officer have to file a lengthy report. If a corporation sells you something, there is a receipt and a papertrail behind the product - and if it fails you have rights you can enforce.Talking about several steps behind a process: Some things, like granting permissions for construction, take so long, so each party affected by the construction might be able to sue at each step of the process to reduce damage and maximize actual access to using the law.No system works in the idealized type of course, but thats the gist of it. And government doesnt need to be efficient in a corporate sense. Its objective is simply not align with that of corporations.

Farm machinery is incredibly expensive and can be cost-prohibitive to invest in, especially during a time when lenders are wary of investing, due to pessimistic crop outlooks. [We are actually in that phase right now with declining net farm income and high interest rates. ](https://equipmentfinancenews.com/news/agriculture/farm-capital-investment-index-hits-all-time-low/). And then there's topography and crop attributes. Simply put, not all crops or farmland are suitable for machinery. Microgreens and most berries are too delicate to be harvested by machine. Low-lying areas are better suited for machinery but they are prone to flooding and are not the ideal sites for popular crops like citrus. As for labor, we have legal temporary ag visas.H2A visas come with housing and wage requirements, a reasonable standard but one that some farmers contend is onerous given the prevailing market wage conditions. These visas are also seasonal which may not work for year-round farm operations. Trump (even though deeply antilabor) is pushing policies labor has been begging for for 50 years. Do you have sources for this?!! By far, the biggest labor issue for decades  has been immigration.

Christ, the disappointment I feel seeing how utterly stupid and gullible most of them are, especially the guys. This generation is irredeemable. Is it our fault as a society that they became the intolerant, gullible, self righteous little narcissists they are? Fuck yes. We let Big Tech (and all the \\"Silicon Valley libertarians\\" who turned out to be crypto-fascists) run wild and brainwash them with algorithms and influencers. We didn't ban TikTok despite it's ties to a government that actively seeks our downfall. We let them down big time. But that doesn't excuse them, no it merely explains them. They still chose what they chose. They still chose to become followers and forsake individuality and free thinking. They chose to embrace extremist politics on both the left and the right.. They're the first generation of Americans to be largely hostile to democracy because they weren't getting their way every time. Either way they'll go down in history as the generation who killed the Republic. That will be their legacy. They certainly won't be the ones who'll have to fight to restore it, they're just like the boomers they hate so much, but worse in every way and utterly incapable of handling criticism. It's time to retire  g55 the cop-out that is saying everyone has complained about young people throughout history. There are huge, measurable differences in the culture of each generation. Cultural decadence and a degeneration of values have been slowly creeping in since the '60s as our culture became  as always more and more coarse over the decades. Corporate America all too happily encouraged us to embrace our most base instincts and desires. We became a low trust society as a result,  increasingly alienated from each other. No one should be shocked that this really happened. Shadowy forces with deep pockets and dark agendas have been fueling this shit for decades, ever since Reagan and his cronies ditched the Fairness Doctrine that allowed pieces of shit like Rush Limbaugh to begin creating an entire industry dedicated to exploiting and worsening the divisions in our society and sow the seeds of hyperpartisanship. The far right has a lot of very rich and powerful people you've never heard of who are just as dangerous and malevolent as Elon  Musk or Peter Thiel. They're just quieter about it. The left can't keep up with the propaganda machine.Between two groups of people who want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds, I can see no remedy but force. Oliver Wendell Holmes said (roughly) that regarding the last time the US found itself on the brink of self destruction because of the greed and malice of the rich and powerful, the Civil War. Just like then,  we face a situation where millions have been convinced to support a cause that is both evil and wrong by exploiting their darkest impulses, their ignorance and  desire to dominate their fellow men and women.I fear we have reached  that same precipe again. The level of fundamental changes needed to reform our system to actually reflect the will of the people are so sweeping and insurmountably difficult that it will only be possible through the use of force. Trump is both a symptom and a cause of our broken system and he will only seek to further destroy it in service of his goals and those who have leverage on him. His tariff obsession could put us into a full on depression. Its utterly uncanny how his ideas seem tailor made to break this country utterly. But don't look to Gen Z for help, they were never going to save the world like so many fools believed. They've been completely compromised from within and without, the first post war generation to reverse the Flynn effect. Nope, buckle up. It's gonna be a long and bumpy ride folks.

So perhaps we can expect more research funding for better weight loss drugs, in addition to other relevant public health measures. Bhattacharya also has researched the NIH itself (with Packalen), and here is one bit from that paper: NIHs propensity to fund projects that build on the most recent advances has declined over the last several decades. Thus, in this regard NIH funding has become more conservative despite initiatives to increase funding for innovative projects. I would expect it is a priority of his to switch more NIH funding into riskier bets, and that is all to the good.? More broadly, his appointment can be seen as a slap in the face of the Fauci smug, satisfied, do what I tell you approach.? That will delight many, myself included, but still the question remains of how to turn that into concrete advances in public health policy.? Putting aside the possibility of another major pandemic coming around, that is not so easy to do. My main worry is simply that NIH staff will not trust their new director.? The problem is not so much GBD, which can be compartmentalized as a political stance, but rather the earlier claims that many more people had Covid early than we had thought, and that expected fatalities were going to be quite low, with a maximum of 40,000.? We all make mistakes, the question is how those mistakes get processed.? If you interrogate Perplexity it will report Bhattacharya has not publicly acknowledged or confessed to these mistakes in his early predictions.? You dont have to agree with Perplexity (though contrary cites are welcome!), rather it suffices to say that reflects a common perception of the scientific community.? He also seemed to be pushing those low fatality estimates for longer than might have been considered appropriate.? And that is indeed a problem for his tenure at the NIH. The danger is simply that NIH staff will double down on risk aversion, and they may not so readily support any attempt to make the grants themselves riskier, or rooted in the greater discretion of program directors, ala DARPA and the like.? They will fear that their director will not sufficiently follow the evidence, or admit when mistakes are being made and reverse course.? Even if you fully agree with GBD and the like, I hope you are able to see this as a relevant problem.? Every institutional revolution requires supportive troops on the inside, even if they are only a minority.

The heir to the throne represented conservative, feudal Austria. Franz Ferdinand kept up an emphatically aristocratic lifestyle, as expressed in his love of hunting. A typically Habsburg passion, in him the thrill of the chase took on an almost pathological character: Franz Ferdinand was the most trigger-happy of the Habsburgs, as attested by his meticulously kept hunting ledgers which record a total of 274,511 kills. The walls of his palaces were decorated with dense displays of hunting trophies.\\nHis favourite country estate at Konopi?t in Bohemia became a symbol of his pro-Slav political plans. Although very popular in Bohemia, the archduke had little support at the Viennese Court, being seen as ambitious, difficult, irascible and lacking in diplomacy.\\nThe archdukes conservative attitudes also manifested themselves in his taste in art: Franz Ferdinand was a pronounced opponent of the early Viennese Modern movement, today regarded as the trademark of the Viennese art scene around 1900. Franz Ferdinand successfully blocked projects designed by Otto Wagner, for example the new War Ministry on Stubenring, where today an ornate neo-Baroque edifice by Ludwig Baumann, an architect much favoured by the archduke, faces Wagners iconic Post Office Savings Bank. In the field of art Franz Ferdinand was the figure who wielded the most influence in the dynasty, since Franz Joseph scrupulously avoided taking a position. The elderly emperor eventually delegated the completion of the Neue Burg wing of the Hofburg to his successor, which resulted in a number of changes to the designs. This mammoth project was to remain uncompleted.\\nFranz Ferdinand was also an enthusiastic collector of art, buying large quantities of antiques. However, he possessed little expertise and was often taken in by forgeries. He spent large sums of money on historicizing restorations of his private residences, furnishing them with a plethora of objets dart. As heir to the Italian Habsburg-d'Este line, Franz Ferdinand was also the owner of the valuable Este art collection which was among the most important in Europe. Like many aristocrats of his time, the archdukes tastes were firmly rooted in the late Historicist aesthetic, while progressive groups within the middle classes favoured modern artistic currents.\\nFranz Ferdinands official residence in Vienna was the Upper Belvedere Palace, which he had extensively restored and furnished in the neo-Baroque style. His promotion of this style was a deliberate expression of his extremely conservative political views. It also corresponded to his love of the Baroque, an era that in the historiography of the time was regarded as Austrias heroic age and which the archduke saw as the classic Austrian Habsburg style.\\nThe Belvedere also became a byword for the archdukes shadow government, as it was here that he gathered political stalwarts around him in preparation for assuming the reins of power when the elderly emperor died, in opposition to the established forces at Court, referred to in the political scene of the time as Sch?nbrunn.?\\nMartin Mutschlechner\\"\\nThis is from the Sch?nbrunn group.?\\nHis dealings with the serbs and slovens were a political maneuver to basically take power away from the the Hungarians, whom he hated.?","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Nobody wants to see the sequel to 'A horse is loose in the hospital'.","title":"I didn't think Trump would do the unhinged things he said he'd do.

Most people do consider themselves to be. After all, we know what our beliefs are and we know that we came to those beliefs through rational thoughts and decision making. Let's just go with the assumption that the average person is legitimately reasonable and capable of thinking rationally. Republicans think they are reasonable too. If you ask the average Republican \\"Do you think poor people should have reliable access to healthcare?\\" They would probably reply that they do. It's just the mechanism for providing that access that Democrats and Republicans tend to disagree on. The average Republican truly believes that healthcare wouldn't be so expensive, and thus inaccessible, if the healthcare industry was deregulated and hospitals were allowed to compete with each other like other businesses. They aren't thinking \\"I want poor people to die, so I'm gonna make healthcare more expensive, MUAHAHA!\\", they are acknowledging the problem and thinking of solutions.Similarly with immigration, the vast majority of Republicans acknowledge that immigration is a good thing for our economy, when it's legal. If it's illegal, they'd say it could be helpful, it could also be hurting us. To a Republican, our country is safer and better off if we simply know who's coming in, and turning away all the ne'er-do-wells. Again, most Republicans would admit that we are in need of immigration reform to make it easier, cheaper, and faster to legally immigrate, but that we still need strong borders to keep illegal drugs, human traffickers, gang members, etc, out.So to summarize, it's not that Republicans are evil, it's that you need to understand that they are simply seeking alternate solutions to the same problems Democrats are","title":"CMV: It would benefit Republcians to just... stop being evil."},{"text":"Veterans , active service members,are you guys just going to take this bullshit ?","title":"Trump picks John Phelan, a businessman with no military experience, to be secretary of the Navy"},{"text":"Well he is The President","title":"Trump ally Elon Musk calls to delete US consumer protection bureau"},{"text":"I tried to limit my examples to policy which has been shown to be demonstrably functional in some way or another.

And going off raw FF incidents isn't a fair metric whatsoever when no other fixed wing plane is used for CAS as much as the A10. It's like saying the Honda Civic is dangerous because it's involved in the most car accidents, without adjusting per capita. You'd need to divide your FF / CAS engagements to get a number of any value. And regardless of the spread of the gun, it's still far narrower than a 2000lb JDAM, which the A10 can loiter around with anyways. The most common goal of the gun is more for suppression when doing CAS anyways. No enemy is peaking when it's firing, and no enemy is moving for a good 20 seconds after. This gives more time to move across large areas than any SAW could provide. TLDR: the expectations placed on the plane through decades of portrayal as a tank killing laser beam have set people's expectations far too high, and in the wrong direction. It's far closer in usage to a helicopter that can go further and faster with more ordinance, than it is any plane you'll compare it to.","title":"The drone rangers: Trump world declares war on fighter pilots"},{"text":"I don't think Trump understands that Mexico doesn't have as much control over the \\"flow of migrants\\" as he thinks it does.

Friedman and other real NLs actually hate subsidies unless they are absolutely necessary, because they are economically distortionary.Public schools are not an inferior product if they are well funded and ran by good administrators. They become inferior when they get underfunded and are ran by administrators who would rather please a vocal minority of parents rather than do what is best for the entire school.Last, and more importantly, an educated populace is important. American society is currently failing because of its current anti-intellectual binge that it's hooked on right now, and alot of that has to do with the fact that people want to wage a war on public education to basically turn everyone into a bunch of rubes. Conservatives being against teaching macroeconomics (which is no longer a required course in high school in Texas) is a pretty good example of this. Everyone benefits from a more educated populace.I'm also not against means tested vouchers if your child has a learning disability or if you are a person that does not come from a wealthy background.

The events of WWI were indeed a tangled web of alliances and conflicts, but the argument that no one was good or bad overlooks some critical nuances about Germanys role and intentions.Germany's actions before and during WWI show it wasn't merely defending an ally (Austria-Hungary) but also pursuing expansionist aims. The infamous Schlieffen Plan exemplifies thisit was a preemptive strategy to invade neutral Belgium to quickly defeat France, which brought Britain into the war. This wasn't just about alliance obligations but about Germany asserting dominance in Europe.Additionally, Germanys leadership, particularly Kaiser Wilhelm II, embraced a militaristic and imperialist worldview, which contributed to the wars escalation. The war aims discussed within German political circles often revolved around territorial acquisitions in both Western and Eastern Europe. Even as the war dragged on and hope of victory faded, Germany pushed for aggressive terms rather than negotiated peace, reflecting ambitions beyond mere defense.Yes, atrocities like the Herero genocide were not unique to Germany, as other European colonial powers committed similar acts. However, this doesnt absolve Germany of responsibilityit just highlights a broader issue of European imperialism. Moreover, during WWI itself, the German military committed documented war crimes, such as the atrocities in Belgium, including massacres and destruction of cultural sites, which fueled the image of Germany as a belligerent aggressor.The web of alliances undoubtedly played a role in turning a localized conflict into a global war, but this doesnt absolve individual nations of accountability. Germany gave Austria-Hungary a blank check of unconditional support, knowing it could provoke a wider conflict. While Russia and France also acted to support their allies, Germanys strategic decisions escalated the conflict significantly.Your point that no nation was entirely good or evil in WWI is crucialwars of this scale involve shared responsibilities and tragedies. However, dismissing Germanys specific contributions to the wars escalation and conduct overlooks key historical realities. A balanced view acknowledges that Germany played a central role in turning a diplomatic crisis into a global catastrophe.Rather than focusing on absolving Germany or demonizing it, understanding its motivations, mistakes, and ambitions within the broader context is key to appreciating the complexity of WWI. This approach doesnt excuse anyone but gives a fuller picture of how such a devastating conflict unfolded.

Russia was a bit debatable. They desired to retake Constantinople as some kind of orthodox city state, and they arguably might have taken galicia from the austrians (which, frankly, was not unreasonable [considering how the austrians treated galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_Austrian_Galicia)). But overall, the Russians still abided by the ideals of keeping the balance of power in tact.  Germany was the odd one out. They hated the idea of a balance of power, viewing themselves as naturally 'dominant' and that they should be the rulers of Europe as a continental superpower. They were the only real power in Europe in WW1 to actually have imperialistic goals on a truly large scale. The concept that Germans had some kind of 'destiny' to rule Europe and break the balance of power is what basically caused WW1. That same ultranationalism that fueled WW1 eventually metastasized into Nazism. A lot of people tend to think of WW1 and WW2 Germany as very ideologically different, but they weren't that different. They had effectively the same ideology of German supremacism/dominance. Nazism just took it to a zealous, religious, almost occultist level of extremism. Everything was a reaction to Germans selfishness. They were the bad guys.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Its always called a trade war.

It is believed these causes of deathspecifically, suicide, alcohol-related liver disease and cirrhosis, and drug/alcohol poisoningare driving the overall mortality rate for middle-aged WNHs and have been coined deaths of despair (DOD) by Case and Deaton (2017). \\nI was referring to what were list as contributing factors to 'despair deaths'.  That notwithstanding, I just didn't see any specific reference to any link between political alliance and despair deaths.Unless you're thinking of:\\nAs research shows, there are higher numbers of DOD among men, understanding that specific risk factors associated with masculinity may inform our clinical conceptualization. Precarious Manhood Theory states that masculinity is a dynamic, tenuous state that is frequently impacted by social reinforcement and validation (Vandello, Bosson, Cohen, Burnaford, &amp; Weaver, 2008). Men experience distress when being perceived as less masculine, such as when engaging in gender-role violating behaviors.And:In summary, several existing theoretical models point to potential mechanisms that may explain the transition from adversity associated with living in a rural area with limited economic opportunities to increased mental health distress and subsequent suicide risk.However not in any of the psychopathology models nor in the individual case study is there any mention of political (i.e. conservative v progressive) factors playing a role.Because of the tie to rural residence association a credible case can certainly  be made that there is a 'right wing misery' prevalence of despair deaths, the study itself doesn't address that particular aspect of the phenomenon.And if a study doesn't directly address a question, then another study would need to be conducted for that question.","title":"Trump tied migrant entries and fentanyl to tariffs.

Not exactly what I call unstable. Hungary has only been independent since the end of the Cold War and has only gotten his rep as being authoritarian in the last few years with Orban. But what about it is unstable? China is very stable. Hitler and Mussolinis governments were quite short lived, relatively speaking, and its fairer to say that they were brought down more by outside force than by internal instability supposedly inherent to authoritarianism.

This is for a variety of reasons, including a belief that the mother will devote more time to the kids and be able to provide a more stable home life. So lots of men just agree to give the mother custody and never even try to obtain joint custody. Joint custody doesn't work for everyone. For example if one parent lives 60 miles away from the other, splitting the kids 50/50 every week would not work for school enrollment.But when men are serious about being responsible parents and fighting for joint or sole custody of their kids, they are actually more likely to win. I just checked and it looks like in 60% of \\"contested custody\\" cases (ones in which the two parents are fighting over the kids), the father gets custody. So I am not sure who is telling men that they are not likely to win, other than right-wing movements. Maybe if people stopped spreading this myth, then more fathers would be motivated to fight for custody. I also haven't seen any evidence that women are more likely to be able to afford lawyers. In fact all the research I've seen lately is that men are increasingly being favored in family courts. This is probably because, thanks to movements pushing against gender norms, more and more fathers are taking their role as caretakers seriously rather than going the traditional route of letting the mother handle all the kid/baby stuff.What kind of silly question is this? What does the gender of a lawmaker have to do with the issues people are experiencing due to laws?Quite a lot actually. The gender makeup of government is strongly correlated with what policies they tend to pass or what issues they tend to prioritize. Gender egalitarian governments tend to promote policies that lead to less violence in society in general. And that is especially true for the gender that is under-represented. For example one study found that, within the same country, regions with more female politicians had more than 50% lower rates of murder and violence towards women. Representation really matters when it comes to decision-making entities.Men are adequately represented in government in the US, but working class men are less so, which could explain why working class men experience such poor outcomes around violence and quality of life. Men need to understand that the more they vote in billionaires and, to be quite frank, modern GOP candidates, the less chance they have of improving their life circumstances.A lot of the 4B posts appear to be doing it as a punishment and a way to influence laws. That would be similar to the tactics of terrorists and should be seen in the same light.Why is a man deciding to abstain from women for his own mental health acceptable to you, but when women do it to protect their own safety and try to improve the state of their human rights, you consider it \\"terrorism\\"? Neither 4b or MGTOW resemble anything akin to terrorism. In terms of their effectiveness, I see 4b as potentially more effective because the majority of those voting for and passing policies that hurt women are men. I imagine that the goal of abstaining from men is to convince men to stop voting for people that hurt women. MGTOW will probably not have the same effect because the majority of women already vote for policies that benefit men. That's why men tend to have better outcomes in more egalitarian and progressive states and regions.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"This sounds unconstitutional","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 27, 2024"},{"text":"Yes that sounds familiar to a few other states.

It is a law rooted in discrimination, designed to target and humiliate transgender and nonbinary students. But the consequences wont stop there. This law doesnt just expose marginalized students to harmit creates an environment where any student could become a target of abuse, privacy violations, and humiliation.Rep. Adam Bird, the sponsor of this legislation, has glibly stated that enforcement will be left up to schools. In practice, this means schools are now responsible for managing the chaos and harm this law will unleash. Students who are suspected of using the wrong bathroom will be reported, scrutinized, and, inevitably, harassed. What lawmakers fail to graspor perhaps choose to ignoreis that this law places a dangerous tool in the hands of students.In todays world, nearly every student carries a smartphone. Whats to stop a teenager from taking this law into their own hands by recording or photographing someone they suspect is in the wrong bathroom? Under the guise of enforcing this rule, students could use their phones to invade the most private, vulnerable moments of their peerspeering under stalls, capturing explicit images, and claiming it as evidence of a violation. These acts wouldnt just traumatize the victim; they would cross into criminal territory, creating and distributing child pornography.The reality is chilling. This law essentially grants students a license to harass and humiliate each other. It provides cover for the worst kinds of behaviorsurveillance, bullying, and voyeurismall while claiming to protect safety. What safety is there in a school where any student can be subjected to this level of invasion?\\nEven more horrifying, this law doesnt just target transgender students. A cisgender girl with short hair, a boy with softer features, or anyone who doesnt conform to rigid gender stereotypes could be accused of violating the rule. They could face verbal abuse, threats, or even physical evidence-gathering attempts by their peers. This legislation has turned our schools into battlegrounds, where privacy is obliterated, and no one feels safe in spaces meant to protect them.Ohios leaders have opened a Pandoras box of harm. The trauma inflicted on students targeted under this law will be profound and lasting. For those whose privacy is violated, the scars will not heal easily. And for those emboldened to act as enforcersfilming and photographing their peers in private spacesthe legal and moral consequences will be devastating.This law is not about safety. It is about control, fear, and punishment. It doesnt protect studentsit places them in harms way. Lawmakers have made it clear that their priority is ideological posturing, not the well-being of Ohios children. Their negligence will cost students their dignity, their privacy, and, for some, their futures.We must reject this dangerous, hateful legislation and hold accountable those who pushed it through. Ohios students deserve better than to have their humanity debated and their safety sacrificed on the altar of discrimination.","title":"Emboldened by the Election, Ohio GOPers Push Through a Trans Bathroom Ban.

State like MA and CA are killing it, while states like MS and KY suffer. Without national standards, it might be even a worse divide.","title":"Trump Wants to End the Education Department.

As was incidentally the original plan + usecase for it during the cold war.What its perfectly adequate - and to a certain extent cheaper at - is blowing up sandal wearing jihadi insurgents with AKs and maybe a stinger or something in the middle of nowhere.But so is a cheap trainer aircraft with some basic PGM capabilities duct taped to it (note: more or less the A-10!). Or much better still a predator drone. Or bayraktar. Or hell just some cheap man portable and/or vehicle mounted loitering munitions and/or artillery / mortar support. Or what have you.I think at this point Ive maybe accidentally just looped back around and am arguing that sufficiently cheap and expendable unmanned systems are more cost effective than manned traditional weapons platforms for some / many of these use cases but yeah basically.The A-10 is yes beloved, and a meme.I could point to the history of fairchild, and point out how its pretty funny that another of their divisions basically developed modern semiconductors for apollo and then lost that when their engineers all left to found intel / silicon valleyBut its still pretty fing hilarious that elon named his kid after this particular living aircraft meme.

Heres What That Means."},{"text":"There multiple considerations:1. Trump is always negotiating, to do that you need chips on the table. Tariffs are massive chips; they are protectionistic, they involve money, they can shelter domestic industries to rebuild, they will put heavy strain on other partners.2. Other countries can raise tariffs also, but the USA is the goliath economy. US economy is over twice the size of #2 China, and using 1/6th the people to achieve it. US wealth is even much larger portion of the worlds wealth, US has roughly 45% of worlds wealth, and roughly 4.5% of the population. 3. Tariffs CAN be a short term correction. Trumps last Presidency there was much commentary over Tariffs, but Trump raised them, and long effect our economy boomed. So negative effect is questionable. You never do tariffs in a vacuum, you make other adjustments. Trump opened oil, we became energy independent and actually where shipping more oil than anyone, taxes were lowered, which counteracted some price increases, but even more importantly many regulations were cut, allowing businesses to absorb higher import fees but still lower prices.4. For long term tariffs to functionally work, place tariffs (which becomes an import tax), cut or eliminate income taxes on individuals (only taxed people starting in 1913, and the sales pitch was they would be temporary and only on the rich - heard that before). So if we eliminate income tax, put tariffs in place, cut regulations, drill for oil, you will see an economic explosion the world has never seen.5. how will the dems, rinos, deep state all try to stop this from happening. Well we see thune (dirty commie bastard) placing anti-Trump rinos to head all major committees - that is one. The dems will side with the rinos in senate and congress. 3 the administrative state (deep state, or what Teddy Roosevelt called the invisible government) will look to block, lobby, not carry out directions.6. How does Trump admin get around all of this?  A. Appoint aggressive loyal and small gov dept heads - in process  B. Get them approved thru the senate - that will be the chellange.  C. Eliminate deep state, that is what DOGE will be doing, looking at the massive waste that the deep state is.  D. sell the public on all of these actions.  Has this ever been done before? Yes Alex Hamilton, and a few others went on a massive public relations blitz explaining to the public why the confederated states was not sustainable, and we needed the new Democratic Federal Government.  These public article we know today as the Federalist Papers - probably the single greatest defense of a political system the world has ever seen.

One item of note, this is not 100% endorsement of DoED I'm a firm believer that gov departments and their agencies need constant optimization. Understanding who, what, when, and why is key to doing that.Department of Education's purpose:  \\nThe main purpose of the **United States Department of Education (ED)** is to promote student achievement and ensure equal access to education across the country. It seeks to improve educational quality and support educational opportunities for all students, particularly those who are disadvantaged.Key functions of the Department of Education include:1. **Establishing Education Policy**: The ED works to develop and implement policies that help improve education at the federal, state, and local levels.\\n2. **Distributing Federal Funding**: It administers federal funding for educational programs, such as Title I (for low-income schools), Pell Grants (for college students), and special education programs.\\n3. **Ensuring Equal Access**: The department works to enforce civil rights laws in education to prevent discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age.\\n4. **Data Collection and Research**: The ED gathers data on educational performance, conducts research, and evaluates educational programs to improve policy and practice. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is part of this effort.\\n5. **Supporting Teachers and Schools**: The department provides support and resources for teachers and school leaders, including professional development, grants, and technical assistance.\\n6. **Setting Standards and Accountability**: Through initiatives like the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the ED has helped establish accountability standards for schools, aiming to improve outcomes for all students.Ultimately, the Department of Education strives to create an equitable education system that fosters student success and prepares individuals for lifelong learning and productive citizenship.","title":"Trump Wants to End the Education Department.

The vast majority of deaths were old people, with the percentage of deaths under 50 being in the single digits. Heck for those under 15, the flu is deadlier than COVIDBut apparently it was still enough to do a total lockdown of everyone, despite the fact that these hurt young people much more than the old. For young adults, their primary concerns were financial rather than health  related due to lockdowns. And the consequences were by far the worst for children, who have suffered massively socially and academically due to school lockdowns. Again, children for whom the flu is more dangerous than COVIDWith a PhD in Aerospace engineering, I am someone who generally has faith in academia and expertise, but honestly COVID kind of showed that there absolutely is some credence in experts or academia being kind of ideologically captured. Like seriously, who remembers when all the public health officials decided that the one exception to lockdowns and social distancing should be the BLM protests?Apparently, school lockdowns which disproportionately harm children from minority communities were A-OK, but massive protests about race relations? Nope, that is the only acceptable exemption to lockdowns for... some reasonI think Bhattacharya has largely been proven correct in retrospect, and I honestly do suspect the critique he got back then was largely groupthink motivated by ideology, not scientific fact. We probably could have been softer on lockdowns for young people. There would be slightly higher mortality sure, but millions of young people wouldnt have been forced to pause their lives or actively degrade their futures for the sake of old people. Its not like he was anti-lockdown or anything, go back and read his actual proposed policy.

From a group of ideas to increase their capability beyond the limits set by the treaty, a thing called Plan Z came about. The link below will give you the full story, but part of Plan Z was a great discussion about what would be more effective and less costly. A large contingent of Naval Vessels or 300 U-Boats to attack the commercial lanes that supported the economy of its enemies, of which Great Britain would be the main target.He believes P/Z/UB = Plan Z .

The result of that is 88. In coding for many that 88 represents the letter H, the right letter of the alphabet twice which refers to the WWII German leaders salute..HH.Using that as an indicator of code vs. a shock line, a cryptologist can now easily define P/Z/UB.It was a grand plan under Hitler to create a marine force using up to 1000 u-boats (submarines) to fan out and destroy the great British Fleet. He never achieved that goal, but these Zodiac Navy members , who considered themselves stealth submarines, using code and ciphers, wanted to and did adopt that plan as a strategy to recruit members to Sabotage boats, planes, intelligence and more and eventually murder to get personal revenge and political change outlined in the rest of the document.But seeing this one line decoded gives you a solid road map to how to unravel the rest..Math is Math and that result is valid!..","title":"One very important line defines how an amazing document speaks so simply.

Sure, every single thing it does can be done better by a different multi role fighter. But they can't do it for nearly as long, they can't do it with strained supply lines, they can't do it off of dirt airstrips, and they can't do it filled with hundreds of bullet holes from small arms fire. The latter mostly being because fighters aren't made with any armor to speak of, because they still have to fill the air part of multi role. The mudhen is the closest, but it costs a relative fortune to operate, requires intense maintenance intervals, and needs to be launched from fully completed bases not ragtag FOBs with runways carved into the dirt by a grader or requisitioned highways out in the desert. And it can't stay out for nearly as long, which matters a ton for CAS since shit in the infantry can go from peachy to fucked in a heartbeat, where you don't have time to wait for the mudhen to scramble from 100 miles away. You need that CAS to be in the air circling the AOO the entire time you're out there, and it's just way too expensive to have a fully fueled stream of F15-Es out there swapping back and forth.

We knew who the Republican nominee was and we knew what his track record was. We also know that USMCA was up for debate and have been under greater pressure from our allies as Canada has sunk more and more into a uniquely laggard position within NATO.Rather than reply to everything, I think I'm going to focus here.Canadian politics is a much greater state of disorder than it was 6 years ago. Plus Trump's demands are much more vague and seem to apply more towards Mexico than Canada. The fact that Canadian politicians haven't prepared after two years of threats and that their official plan seems to be to hope that this all just blows over is pretty telling. I get your examples about NAFTA but back then Trump was echoing the same complaints that politicians had been on about for twenty years. Nothing on his agenda was truly groundbreaking and Canada was no stranger to American duties on resource exports. What Trump is proposing now is, plainly, not the same thing. Personally the only way I see out of this is that Trump is talked down from the ledge and proposes a series of wimpy tariffs that prompt a fake-ass do-nothing deal which he can boast as a great success. That's certainly plausible. But if Trump really does activate this 'nuclear option' then I think Canadian politicians will be forced to resist or else be framed as sellouts. Reforming NAFTA was actually popular with some Canadians, but increasing military spending and border security? I'm not so sure.","title":"What's Trump's price for averting tariffs?

Unfortunately, the paratroopers immediately encounter resistance from an unexpected force: a cartel alliance so unified it makes NATO look like a dysfunctional family reunion. Armed with weapons, drones, and memes supplied by BRICS nations, the cartels swiftly dismantle the poorly planned offensive.Enraged by the setback, President Trump, in a Mar-a-Lago briefing livestreamed on Truth Social, declares the invasions failure a conspiracy orchestrated by the BRICS coalition. Trump accuses China of funding taco trucks to fuel Mexican resistance, Brazil of sending samba dancers to distract American troops, and Russia of providing Mexico with super-secret vodka missiles.As the war grinds on into its sixth month, American forces falter. Supply chains crumble because DeSantis insists on banning books and diversity in the field manuals, leaving troops unable to strategize effectively. Meanwhile, BRICS nations ramp up their support, shipping advanced weaponry to Mexico and encouraging TikTok dances mocking U.S. tactics. Mexico begins reclaiming territory in two strategic directions: North Texas and South Florida.Realizing the regular military needs a \\"special touch,\\" Trump appoints Joe Rogan as Commander of the rogue Proud Boys Tactical Assault Force. With a recruitment strategy that involves podcast appearances and prison visits, Rogan rallies an eclectic crew of fitness influencers, conspiracy theorists, and prisoners promised full pardons. Their mission? A meat assault on Guadalajara, featuring CrossFit-style combat tactics and elk meat MREs.But as the Proud Boys unit suffers heavy losses (and high cholesterol), Rogan grows disillusioned. During a viral live-streamed rant from the battlefield, he accuses Trump of being compromised by \\"alien brain waves\\" and declares the invasion an elaborate ploy by the deep state to keep us from finding the real pyramids of Mexico. Rogan then orders his Proud Boys to march on Washington, but the rebellion ends abruptly when Trump challenges him to a one-on-one grudge match at UFC 400. The pay-per-view showdown concludes with Trump declaring victory via a move he dubs the \\"MAGA Slam.\\"Meanwhile, the war devolves into chaos. BRICS powers, now openly mocking the U.S., supply Mexico with long-range missile systems capable of striking deep into American territory.","title":"Special Military Operation meat assaults under 5 star general Marjorie Taylor Greene coming to a city near you.

If you want to support them anyway then that is fine.?\\nIt is quite funny to me that you're implying I'm brainwashed for just pointing out basic economic theory. I haven't even said I'm opposed to further taxes on the poor, but just simply saying something is worse for the poor is evidence of brainwashing in your eyes!

There are plenty of economic and ethical reasons to prefer one. No brainwashing required. Try and understand why smart, reasonable, well informed people might prefer them, because plenty do. Similarly, I won't say you're a sociopath for preferring a flat tax. I will call you ignorant, though, if you don't recognize it's going to place a higher burden on the poor and that your own taxes will go up if we don't also massively cut spending (unless you're rich).

Why, exactly, do you think that chain of alliances was made? Why do you think all of Europe militarized leading up to the war. This wasn't some conflict fought for no reason, no conflict is. Its baffling that this narrative is repeated on Reddit so much. I'll try to explain. WW1 is a bit more nuanced than this, just to be clear, but to sum it up... Germany was rapidly rising, both in terms of its industrial capacity and military strength. It was also increasingly ultranationalist, with [open goals to annex parts of Eastern Europe and install puppet states throughout Europe.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F9qi2ijvtqax81.png) It *wanted to upset the balance of power* and become the dominant european continental force. In that sense, those alliances were made largely with two ideas in mind. You're either trying to stop Germany from dominating Europe, or you wanted to side with Germany, believing them to be the future of Europe. So yes, Germany was bad. Their goals were quite similar to WW2, in that they believed themselves to be the dominant, destined rulers of Europe. They were arguably the only real nation with actual imperialistic goals in WW1. The allies goal was... to stop Germany.A lot of people point to the fact that the Kaiser tried to stop the war in 1914. This is a bit misleading. He was not extremely jingoistic, but his generals and chancellor and general leadership all were. There was also the belief that 1914 was 'too early' and that Germany still needed more years to build up their military force before going to war. Germany also desperetly did not want to be the country to start the war, they wanted the allies to declare war first.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Why cant I give you more than one upvote.

If the average car costs $30k here, which is something we produce, and China wants to compete in our market, it will need to produce a car of similar quality and at a similar price point. If you slap a tariff on Chinese cars and China just adds that to the price of their cars, that makes their cars more expensive and less competitive (let'ssay its $5k per car). The Chinese cars won't artificially push the price of American made cars up, our market is already stable around the price of these cars. The Chinese car companies will need to find away to produce their cars for cheaper to make up for the tariff OR make their cars that much better so as to be worth the $5k price difference.This leads to a less competitive market which can ultimately hurt us (like when we protect Amaeican auto and they didn't have to innovate leading to foreign car companies dominating American cars in the late 90s and a bit after). But it's more complicated than just saying \\"tariffs will raise prices\\" because that is really dependent on the specific tariff.","title":"Can someone give me the counter argument to all Trump Tariff headlines Ive been seeing across all media lately"},{"text":"Story of his life","title":"The Law Went Light on Trumpand Now America Will Pay the Price - Now that Trump has escaped punishment for his many crimes, the lesson is clear: He can do whatever he wants, and get away with it."},{"text":"when will we be shut of him ffs","title":"Special Military Operation meat assaults under 5 star general Marjorie Taylor Greene coming to a city near you.

Poilievre has announced that he would be willing to retaliate and I don't think Trump's deal is a \\"pro-trade\\" deal at all. In fact Trump has indicated that he wants to Canada to allocate some sort of spending towards a nebulous goal of border protection. Plus a lot of its base support comes from areas that will be greatly damaged by tariffs and it doesn't seem like they're willing to spend government dollars just to appease Trump. (At least right now.)I mean, Trump did the same thing last time. Called us a national security threat because it was a loophole for him to apply aluminum and steel tariffs. The end result is we policed our steel dumping, a trade deal was signed (that the Trump Admin authored) and trade between Canada and the USA has increased since then. It's right out of his playbook. You also have Ministers, Premiers, and a former Bank of Canada Governor responding today alone, already saying more can be done on the border. But really, there is comparatively little Canada can do relative to Mexico. Many people are arguing that the most tangible change Canada could make to cool the situation is on defence spending, which is an enormous problem for Democrats, Republicans, and Trump alike. They're just going to be against the type of deal that Trump is proposing as of right now. NAFTA 2.0 negotiations were one thing. This is a straight up shakedown of national Canadian resources to be spent of American interests.Again, so were the steel and aluminum tariffs. And the Conservatives are almost guaranteed to be in power when the new deal is actually negotiated, almost everybody expects the government to collapse with the new budget. The other guy who responded wasn't me, lol. But yea some political figures seem to be expressing their openness deal. Yeah I know lol, until they change the way they approach conversations I'm not going to give them the time of day. Basically the only politicians that have come out with \\"positive messages\\" towards Trump are really just Doug Ford, who has been a MAGA guy since Day 1 and is a personal friend of Trump, and Danielle Smith who has danced around whether or not the tariffs are justified. And Doug Ford did call it a \\"heart to the knife\\" and said he'd help respond. I don't think \\"lots of Canadian politicians\\" was an accurate accounting. But yea some political figures seem to be expressing their openness deal. Even Trudeau seems to want to walk a fine line of being publicly polite to Trump but also promoting this \\"Team Canada\\" mindset. Without a real understanding of what Trump wants exactly, I think the Canadian government is hoping they can reason their way into an exception.The Canadian Government should have been gaming this outcome for almost a year now. We knew who the Republican nominee was and we knew what his track record was. We also know that USMCA was up for debate and have been under greater pressure from our allies as Canada has sunk more and more into a uniquely laggard position within NATO. We also had Team Canada folks in Washington over the past 1-2 weeks who have been told outright by Republicans that the \\"Team Canada Charm Offensive\\" isn't going to work this time. They say we need tangible policy changes to actually steer out of this. Really, nothing short of a concrete action plan is going to get us around this. Our negotiators getting along well with their negotiators isn't going to cut it anymore. Plus, the political environment in Canada just doesn't allow for the same conditions as the Team Canada approach last time around. Members of that council have already said they'll be focusing on the Conservative campaign in the immediate election instead. I don't think the tariffs are the same as USMCA. When it came to NAFTA, Trump's complaints were specifically around jobs and it was reflected in the changes. Now Trump's complaints seem to be something on the level of drugs and migration and... something about inflation? Who fucking knows. If he wanted to renegotiate USMCA then he'd be doing that instead of threatening tariffs in exchange for Canada to enact national policy.Again, I'll circle back to the NAFTA renegotiations. He did, in fact, apply tariffs on Canada to achieve policy outcomes in Canada that affected the USA. Canada did, in fact, crack down on Chinese steel dumping. [Here is a story from 2018 that highlights how 26 days after Trump announced his steel tariffs, Canada announced a crackdown on steel dumping. ](https://globalnews.ca/news/4107759/steel-tariffs-chinese-dumping-justin-trudeau/)","title":"What's Trump's price for averting tariffs?

If H5N1 is very deadly then its virulence would impede its spread, like how ebola has difficulty in becoming more than an endemic communicable disease because it kills its host so fast.  Unfortunately influenza can hit a sweet spot between deadliness and ability to spread, this one just like any other strains of influenza in the past will disproportionately affect immunocompromised, young/old and those that refused vaccinations. I could be wrong but its a bit early to tell how this strain will behave.   \\nAs far as vaccine product, if there's money to be made from demand then private entities from U.S. will definitely chase after it.

USMCA has its origins in a debate wherein the pro-trade Conservatives trumped the protectionist Liberals to make CUSTA. Likewise, the Harper Government expanded Canadas trading partners from 5 countries to 51. I think its more likely conservatives have just tried to score political points over USMCA by claiming wed have gotten a better deal, which doesnt indicate an opposition to a deal at all. I think conservatives are taking both sides on this issue. Poilievre has announced that he would be willing to retaliate and I don't think Trump's deal is a \\"pro-trade\\" deal at all. In fact Trump has indicated that he wants to Canada to allocate some sort of spending towards a nebulous goal of border protection. Plus a lot of its base support comes from areas that will be greatly damaged by tariffs and it doesn't seem like they're willing to spend government dollars just to appease Trump. (At least right now.) So conservatives aren't against \\"a deal.\\" They're just going to be against the type of deal that Trump is proposing as of right now. NAFTA 2.0 negotiations were one thing. This is a straight up shakedown of national Canadian resources to be spent of American interests.  Like who?The other guy who responded wasn't me, lol. But yea some political figures seem to be expressing their openness deal. Even Trudeau seems to want to walk a fine line of being publicly polite to Trump but also promoting this \\"Team Canada\\" mindset. Without a real understanding of what Trump wants exactly, I think the Canadian government is hoping they can reason their way into an exception.  USMCA has a sunset clause. Regardless of who is in government, they will have to renegotiate with Trump. I don't think the tariffs are the same as USMCA. When it came to NAFTA, Trump's complaints were specifically around jobs and it was reflected in the changes.

Get some good basic books on how to teach reading, writing and arithmetic. Books on government and personal finance for older children. Repair books and books on creating things. Maybe a couple basic foreign language books, particularly English, Spanish and French.  In recent history there was more than one group excluded from learning by the ruling regime. It was felt that since those people would be a slave class or eliminated, they had no need to learn with the general public. People of those groups who were working full time were still able to give some of their children the basics of education from whoever had the most learning in the family or neighborhood, then children carried on reading on their own.  You need resources to teach your children about living in cooperation with others who are different in any way, about kindness, about fairness, about helping those in need. Maybe a brief intro to comparative religions so they can see that atheists and religious who are good people all tend to share similar thoughts on how to live a good life and coexist. Make sure your materials are available in hard copy as well as online. Your children may end up forced to participate in a state sponsored program to be indoctrinated by the current regime. You'll have to supplement with what you actually need children from your group to learn of your culture, values and history.  If there are books you cherish, get copies now. As in before January 2025. It isn't unknown for religious books and books about or authored by specific groups to be banned by schools or governments. That has already happened. Stock up on school supplies and art supplies now. Dollar stores still exist and they have whiteboards and chalkboards to help keep the cost low. Prices will only go up, and you will need the materials regardless of where your children are educated. Most of all, figure out what you need to teach children that knowledge should be free, and ideas can't damage them. Hearing about different lifestyles, different appearances, different ways of living, different faiths, can't change who they are. *They get to choose* *inside their hearts* *what they believe*, even when outside influences force them to pretend otherwise to be safe. Make sure they learn that freedom starts inside your head and your heart, no matter where or when in history you are just trying to live your life.","title":"GOP senator introduces bill to abolish Education Department"},{"text":"He is doing that with his vehicles arent they the deadliest now? ?","title":"Mexico warns Trump tariffs would kill 400,000 US jobs, threatens retaliation"},{"text":"Deport this South African moron.","title":"First Buddy Elon Musk accuses Trump impeachment witness of treason and calls for appropriate penalty"},{"text":"These people want to compromise the US' position in a peer-to-peer conflict and ensure the US military is only capable of fighting insurgents - if even that.

Austria of course is the one who actually invaded Serbia, and Russia mobilized their armies against Germany and Austria before either of them did against Russia, meanwhile the French gave Russia assurances that it would help them fight Germany if it came to war, greatly steeling the Russian resolve to fight.
