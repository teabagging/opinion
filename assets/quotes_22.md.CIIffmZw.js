In principle that could have been avoided by a massive occupation army (as was the case in Germany after 1945), but without that it was just impossible.So, it would have been possible to avoid the civil war without a huge occupation army, but it would have needed a clear plan how to keep the country together and functioning, which Bush et co. had completely neglected to do.Sudan would have probably been even harder as it was already in civil war.","title":"CMV: Out of all the conflicts the George W.

The U.S. track record with interventions isn't exactly stellar. Take Iraq, for example. Just removing a brutal leader doesn't magically fix a country, and can actually lead to even more chaos. Look at the mess that followed Saddam's ousting: power vacuums, insurgencies, ISIS, you name it. The resulting scenario often involves prolonged instability, and theres no guarantee Sudan wouldn't have faced similar chaos.On top of that, the Middle East or African nations can't just be reshaped by external forces without major pushbacks and complex outcomes. The international community's absent role led to weaker local responses, but more international meddling might've brought more harm. Cultural differences, historical animosities, and local power dynamics dont simply vanish with a regime change.Plus, the U.S. spreading itself too thin isn't effective either. Remember, during this time, resources were already heavily stretched due to ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Attempting an operation in Sudan would strain military resources even further and likely be unsustainable in the long term. It's overly simplistic to label not intervening as \\"one of the biggest foreign policy failures.\\"Ultimately, a Sudanese-led solution backed by international support could have been more effective. It puts emphasis on Sudan's sovereignty and local leaders taking charge, which might have left room for a more stable geopolitical climate. The hindsight of military intervention being a \\"successful\\" option is lacking a critical lens of historical and practical context. Let's consider the big picture before deeming inaction as the ultimate misstep.","title":"CMV: Out of all the conflicts the George W.

These terms often frame problems so broadly that they leave no clear path to resolution, creating endless debates without tangible outcomes. This isnt a critique of every activist movement but of a trend seen in many modern movements.Examples like Ukrainian activism prove the point that effective activism targets specific harms. The success of pro-Ukrainian activists lies in their direct action, clear objectives, and tangible results, like securing funding or supplies. Their approach highlights what much modern activism lacks: focus, specificity, and a clear cause-effect relationship between advocacy and solutions.The irony here isnt in critiquing vagueness but in deflecting that critique by demanding specificity about which movements are vague, without acknowledging the evidence already provided. Activism that avoids specifics and hides behind abstract language dilutes its purpose. Effective change happens when concrete harms and solutions are clearly defined. Vagueness, in contrast, perpetuates stagnation. My critique isnt aimed at every movement but at a recurring problem that weakens many of them. Counterexamples dont negate the critique but they illustrate how activism should work.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"None of it matters because he's a coward who didn't do a goddamn thing about Trump's insurrection.

That's $150 billion in today's money given with minimal strings attached.The Truman government was completely *infested* with Soviet spies, which was the reason why they got the bomb so quickly. If he hadn't followed in the footsteps of FDR and gave diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union, or better yet, leveraged the bomb to destroy the Soviet Union in 1946 before they could invade the rest of Europe, that would have been a much better outcome than decades of cold war. In Korea, US intervention prevented the entire peninsula from becoming like North Korea. South Korea is now a thriving democracy.But the only reason why this was even an issue was because the Soviet Union was not destroyed immediately after the war. The US has repeatedly pressured Israel to make concessions for peace - Camp David Accords, Oslo Accords, the 2000 talks. We've suspended arms transfers multiple times over settlement issues.Decades and decades of Israeli concessions haven't made the Palestinians any more predisposed to peace. If anything, it has emboldened them. The US hasn't really been pressuring the Palestinians to accept anything.Much of the current geopolitical landscape can be blamed on the fact that the US didn't destroy the Soviet Union when America was the only country with nukes and the will to use them - or better yet, that the US didn't abandon the Soviets to be destroyed by the Germans and then decapitated them both while they were exhausted.

The pricing is insane.But! It's only insane relative to expectations. They didn't increase the 5080 by $200+ and they actually dropped the pricing on the 5070 and Ti by $50. That's insane by expectations, but not by absolute standards.It looks pretty solid on the high end- 5090 and 5080- depending on workload (gaming). It looks *okay kinda (pejorative)* on the mid end imoWe'll have to see what the performance of the 5070 and Ti are actually like. [Hardware Unboxed](https://youtu.be/olfgrLqtXEo) is the only outlet I've seen speculate on price to performance increase from the 40 series.... and for the 5070 and Ti..... it's looking like it could be as little as 20% lol, *which is partially due to price cuts*.Raw performance increases could be wholly unimpressive! You don't have to look very hard at the Nvidia presentation slides to see underwhelming performance comparisons for the 5070 if you realize the 5070 is using MFG 4x (lol) *and that it's compared to a 4070*. Not a 4070 Super. The 5070 looks like it might *barely* be an upgrade over the 4070 Super. *Maybe 10%* when not using frame gen.Just my two cents and food for thought.Also MFG sounds like it's going to be hot garbage. I haven't been able to use Frame Gen myself, but it looks shoddy in most situations, so I can't fathom that going from 1 to 3 virtual frames won't tank whatever quality it has.And I say that as someone who LOVES DLSS. If you don't, it's likely you have not actually tried it and compared, haven't watched serious reviews of it, or are under the impression that it's still back on DLSS 2.0 when it actually sucked.So idk. If you were already going to buy a 4070 Super a month ago, this looks like a nice bump. You can get a little more for a little less.

Claiming that these systems \\"exploit those below them\\" is, ironically, exactly the kind of vague and emotionally charged rhetoric Im critiquing. It doesnt identify specific individuals, laws, policies, or mechanisms that perpetuate exploitation. Instead, it uses an emotionally loaded term as a shortcut to justify a position without providing evidence or actionable steps to address the alleged problem.If there are specific laws, practices, or individuals within these systems exploiting others, name them. For example, if you believe cash bail disproportionately harms low-income individuals, point to specific cases and advocate for reforming or abolishing cash bail. If you think civil asset forfeiture is unjust, focus on how it is misused and campaign against it. Thats tangible activism with clear targets. But simply declaring that \\"the system exploits people\\" contributes nothin. Its an empty accusation that only serves to provoke emotional responses, not meaningful change.This is the core issue with much of modern activism: broad claims like \\"the system exploits people\\" or \\"the system is inherently unjust\\" dont lead to practical solutions. Historically, effective activism has succeeded by identifying specific injustices and rallying public support for targeted reforms. Just as abolitionists focused on repealing slavery laws, and civil rights activists targeted segregation policies, todays activism should focus on clear, actionable goals. Throwing around abstract concepts without specifics doesnt achieve that but just muddies the waters and alienates people who might otherwise support real solutions.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":" why does it need GreenlandBecause Greenland is an important avenue of access to the Arctic, which will become increasingly important in the 2030s and beyond.*When* Greenland secedes from the Danish crown - and it absolutely will as it has been moving to for many years - it will become responsible for its own security. The problem is that both Russia and China are challenging the status quo in the Arctic. Russia has claimed a massive swath of the Arctic sea, including waters inside Greenland's exclusive economic zone, while Russian survey ships have encroached on Greenland's territorial waters as Russia is expanding its bases in the Arctic and its icebreaker fleet. China, on the other hand, has declared itself a \\"near Arctic state\\" and has established a shipping route they call the Polar Silk Road to bring nations closer to Beijing's sphere of influence.Greenland is *also* home to significant deposits of gold, silver, oil, copper, uranium and rare earth minerals - resources that both China and Russia are very interested in acquiring. An independent Greenland would be utterly unable to resist the coercive extraction that China and Russia practice on the regular.The US on the other hand can offer an option that preserves Greenland's sovereignty while also protecting them from China and Russia. America has used Compacts of Free Association for decades with Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands, all of which have full independence and the power to conduct their own foreign relations while also giving Washington unrestricted military access in a defensive pact.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/ndtn7hutbkbe1.jpeg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=302eb04c40866386f716ff8f1fd3824ccf940807Depressing.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The governor seems a tad out of touch with what really goes on in those migrant centers.","title":"Dem gov who vows to fight Trump border enforcement outraged by migrant using shelter for criminal activity"},{"text":"Nerds, the whole lot of them","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Was he able to build his wall?

As far as our intentions I dont disagree, we want to have as much influence over the rest of the world as feasibly possible just as every other country in the world. However the way we achieve those intentions has resulted in outcomes that are positive externalities for the world in a way we havent seen before. Firstly the United States is a capitalist nation( Im not extolling the virtues of any economic system just a fact) which means we desire the freedom of navigation on the seas, the US navy has made the ocean a safer place for international shipping which has allowed countries like china to industrialize as they can safely ship their goods abroad. Secondly we set up a rules based international order, admittedly we designed the rules to favor our interests though, which results in countries having a healthy fear of invasion from their neighbors. I agree US interventions since the Korean War have mostly been immoral power grabs however the fact remains that since the United States and the other allied powers set up organizations like the U.N. And NATO the frequency and size of wars has plummeted on a global scale. Particularly smaller nations that cannot afford a large military. Lastly U.S. foreign policy has, sometimes only in name, pushed democracy as our chief export resulting in countries the United States is allies with being more democratic than the average nation. Obviously the gulf states are the notable exceptions however on the whole Western Europe Canada Mexico Japan South Korea and Taiwan are some of the most democratic nations on earth and the USA either defended or set up many of their democracies.","title":"CMV: Contrary to popular belief, US foreign policy is not exceptional.

Its about the effectiveness of activism in achieving tangible results. In the past, activists fought for clear, specific goals: abolishing slavery, ending segregation, securing voting rights. These movements were driven by concrete problems with identifiable solutions.Todays activism often hides behind vague terms and theories, like systemic oppression or patriarchy, without providing clear pathways for change. This isnt about me feeling excluded or entitled but about questioning whether this approach actually solves anything. If the language being used is so academic or abstract that it alienates people or fails to resonate with the general public, then its ineffective by design.You claim the evidence supports modern activism, but where are the results? If the issues being addressed are as urgent and widespread as activists claim, why arent there more concrete actions or measurable outcomes? Simply pointing to the existence of historical injustices or broad societal problems doesnt prove that modern activism is effective. In fact, the reliance on generalizations suggests the opposite: that the activism is more about sustaining itself than about achieving real change.Im not shifting goalposts but asking for clarity and effectiveness. Activism isnt above criticism, and if activists are serious about making a difference, they should be willing to engage with these critiques instead of dismissing them as selfish. A movement that refuses to examine its methods risks becoming an echo chamber, more concerned with self-validation than solving problems.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Not idiotic but by design.

I've outlined several clear harms from the prison system. Every single person who works in that system is accountable for the actions of their occupation. Who would you specifically want named? The warden? Every police officer that wrongfully shot someone? The cops that don't speak out when a wrongful murder is committed by their peer?You reiterated my points as specific, tangible things that deserve attention, which I know about specifically from reading literature on this exact subject. These are the bricks that make the foundations of systemic oppression. Police violence targeting minorities, pushing them through unjust sentencing, then sending them to prison for literal slave labor aren't several independent variables that just all happen to work together. It's a system built for oppression, working exactly as intended. Every single step deserves to be held accountable, from cop to judge to politician. Dismantling the abuse is going to require action taken on every step. Updating an outdated system isn't some utopian ideal, it is a specific, targeted solution.There were 214k prisoners in the US the year of 1964. In 2022 that number was 1,230,000. What changed in 1964 that might have caused a 500% increase in incarceration rates since? Because if you ask me, making it so slavery was legal as long as it was prisoners seems pretty fucking relevant and not 'present problems framed entirely through the lens of historical grievances.' History doesn't exist in a vacuum contained exclusively in your school textbooks. The history of our country shaped it today in literally every single way, and our slave based prisons are no exception. From ages 20 to 34, 1 out of 9 black men are in prison. For comparison, for white men 18 or older, it's 1 out of 106. I'm not looking for allies in slavers, nor am I trying to reform slavery. It needs to be abolished.The reason you consider systemic oppression abstract and vague is because you simply haven't done the legwork. You haven't read lengthy academic texts about it. This is a deeply nuanced topic that stretches well beyond what can be adequately explained in a reddit thread by lay people. There are plenty of evidence based, clear solutions to these issues in those texts, talked about in exquisite detail. There are actionable proposals in place everywhere along the chain of this system, like barring police from using lethal force, making our officers of law have a law degree, harm reduction training, abolishing mandatory minimum sentences and solitary confinement and death penalties, active decarceration, focus on rehabilitation like Norway or Sweden. It is your refusal to educate yourself on the subject that makes it seem vague and abstract, literally no one is asking you for blind acceptance.

Slavery actually was abolished because of abstract theorizing and endless discussion. It was a philosophical debate amongst several differing groups of people with different political, religious, and philosophical backgrounds.It started with work that began in the late 17th century, with German Quakers creating a petition against slavery. They drafted a two-page white paper condemning slavery using justifications based on their philosophical and religious reservations. Writings from James Oglethorpe and Samuel Sewall brought even more attention and condemnation to the cause, all before 1750. Laws were put in place in several colonies before the official abolition of slavery to outlaw the practice but most were ignored in favor of profits. In fact, in 1652, Rhode Island did make it illegal to be 'bound' for more than ten years but the law was ignored largely because of the enormous profits available through slavery. Slavery was also briefly prohibited in Georgia before being revoked. Continued writing from authors such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, John Brown, Harriet Beecher Stove, William Llyod Garrison etc. all flooded the greater American consciousness with considerations about the cruelty and dehumanizing actions of slavery. All of these discussions, debates, and philosophical condemnations of slavery took place for over 150 years before the official and long-lasting effects of the 13th Amendment signed in 1865 came about. My point is, that despite pointing to specific, undeniable injustices and addressing them with clear solutions, it still took over 100 years for the general public to accept and acknowledge these stories as valuable and justified.I would ask what you recognize as 'modern activism' today? Activists today use the same techniques you mentioned above. Showing the horrors of their causes through concrete examples, spreading individual stories of suffering, evidence of brutality, etc. The language has just evolved to be more specific and highlight more nuanced and complex implications as we have taken more time to study and pick apart the way we interact with our society. I would recommend you take some time to read and understand what words like 'systematic oppression' and 'patriarchy' mean as neither of these terms are vague or even new. Let me know what you find out! Claiming so because you personally do not understand what they mean is a weak argument. Laws alone are not enough to convince people that something is wrong. I feel like you are acknowledging the outcome of activism and advocacy (Encoded laws and regulations) but fail to recognize how those outcomes are directly tied to years and years of academic/philosophical work and shifting societal conscious.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"BIG NEWS - Today, NTP authors published a new article in JAMA Pediatrics detailing their report released in Aug 2024 that concluded fluoride can lower the IQ of children.

The Right's *reaction* is what sows division by treating any attempt to normalize non-traditional lives as immoral. The Left wants you to see these people as human beings, but the Right wants you to see them as Others. If the Right can convince you that you're \\"better\\" than those people, you make yourself *more* exploitable because you'll strive to maintain the tiny little things that keep you from falling into the Out-Group.The real hot water is saying you want working class solidarity, but at the same time you're subtly implying that there should still be an out-group. Let me point out that this has been a well known fascist tactic in the past. \\"Worker solidarity... but just for the German people.\\" Catch my drift? Fascists will talk about solidarity, but then cut lines between the workers until there's one unified, preferred working class entitled to illusionary privileges. Everyone else, though? Not so much.The water heats up because you want to reject a political or economic establishment in ways that, again, were traditionally fascist tactics. Keep in mind that the more savvy fascists of the 20th century were taking notes on Communist rhetoric and tweaking it to appear benign, and even agreeable to the \\"moderates.\\" This way, they could present the moderates with Left-sounding things that moderates would agree to, but were really just veiled right-wing agendas. \\"Yes, we want women in the workforce! We're so progressive! (Then we can treat twice as many people like wage slaves!)\\"Now, I'm saying this impartially and objectively, but I'd diagnose you as a Reactionary. Yes, you want some Leftist things, but you appear scared of actual \\"I'm going to shake hands with my queer, disabled, Person of Color fellow workers and work together\\" Leftism. When those deeper aspects of Leftism confront you, it makes you uncomfortable.  \\nAll that said, yes, the class war is ramping up because we're hitting stage where profits are about to start declining and everything that typically boosted them back up is getting exhausted. The US has no one left to conquer and they aren't the sole superpower in the world. They need to ramp up the internal conflict because they're run out of abjectly impoverished other people to steal from. Now they need to steal more and more from their own internal working class.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"Makes you wonder, like an Executive Order, can the next president undo a presidential medal of freedom?","title":"How to invalidate the Presidential Medal of Freedom in one fell swoop -- Biden made the honor worthless by presenting the medals to the undeserving."},{"text":"Thought it was the germans (Marx and Max Weber)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Honestly, the people of China would tell Americans, they can have it.

These examples show the importance of identifying clear harms, perpetrators, and solutions, yet the rhetoric frequently leaps to sweeping generalizations that obscure accountability and make actionable change harder, not easier.First, many of the injustices cited here, such as police violence, unfair sentencing, or exploitative prison labor, are indeed specific, identifiable problems. These can and should be addressed through focused action: reforming police practices, eliminating prison labor abuses, or revising the 13th Amendment to remove the \\"punishment for crime\\" exception. History has shown that when we focus on tangible goals, like outlawing redlining or passing the Civil Rights Act, we can achieve real progress. But instead of honing in on these clear issues, activists often expand the narrative into grand theories about systemic oppression, creating a nebulous enemy that is difficult to fight and impossible to hold accountable.The claim that these issues require reworking the whole system from the ground up might sound compelling, but its a recipe for inaction. When you frame the problem as everything, the solution becomes nothing. Complex problems dont need utopian overhauls but specific, targeted solutions. Angola Prison, for example, is a glaring injustice tied to prison labor exploitation. Activism should focus on dismantling such practices directly, rather than using them as proof of some monolithic, all-encompassing system.The narrative about the origins of policing also deserves scrutiny. While some police forces historically had ties to slave patrols, modern policing has evolved significantly, and not every issue within law enforcement is reducible to its historical roots. Activism that insists on framing present problems entirely through the lens of historical grievances often oversimplifies the situation, alienates potential allies, and undermines practical reforms.Finally, the argument assumes that people skeptical of systemic oppression are simply uninformed or unwilling to do the legwork. But skepticism often stems not from ignorance but from frustration with the lack of actionable proposals. Telling people to look it up or read dense academic texts doesnt inspire change but it creates further divides. If activists want broad support, they need to present clear, evidence-based solutions to specific issues, not demand blind acceptance of complex theories.In short, addressing real harms requires focusing on tangible actions, not grand abstractions. Activism becomes most effective when it moves beyond vague concepts and tackles concrete problems with practical solutions.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Just because a dog barks doesnt mean it has anything intelligent to say.","title":"CMV: USA Taking Canada Would Result In A Stronger North America.

In the past tangible injustices like slavery, Jim Crow laws, and redlining were addressed through activism, leading to landmark changes such as the Civil Rights Act and the 1967 Fair Housing Act. These were movements with clear, specific goals targeting identifiable policies and practices, resulting in measurable progress. However, the modern landscape of activism is fundamentally different. Many of the most egregious systemic injustices have already been tackled, yet activism today continues to exist in an expanded form, relying on vague terms like \\"systemic oppression\\" to justify its relevance and funding.For example, redlining and discriminatory housing practices were real and harmful injustices that impacted generational wealth. The 1967 Fair Housing Act directly addressed this by outlawing such practices. This is a perfect example of activism achieving concrete results by targeting a specific injustice. However, modern activists often recycle historical injustices without connecting them to actionable, present-day problems. Instead of identifying new, specific laws or policies to change, they rely on broad generalizations about society as a whole, framing it in terms like \\"systemic oppression\\" or \\"patriarchy\\" that are intentionally vague and difficult to challenge.Today, we have more activists, organizations, and funding than ever before, far more than during the eras of slavery, Jim Crow, or redlining. Yet these activists frequently avoid focusing on tangible injustices, instead clinging to abstract theories that lack actionable goals. This shift isnt because society is more unjust now; in fact, much progress has been made. Its because modern activism has become an industry that must continually invent new battles to fight to sustain its relevance. The reliance on generalized concepts like \\"systemic oppression\\" isnt about solving real problems, its about maintaining the existence of activism itself.The 1967 Fair Housing Act is a reminder of how effective activism can be when it targets specific problems with clear solutions. Modern activism, by contrast, often seems more concerned with perpetuating its own existence than addressing concrete harms. In a society with functioning legal and justice systems, activism should focus on actionable issues or step aside rather than manufacture vague, unprovable grievances to justify its continued relevance.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Still is, not in this sub but elsewhere theyre saying he is a great leader and knows when its time to pass the torch and shit like that","title":"JUSTIN TRUDEAU: \\"I intend to resign as [Liberal] Party leader, as Prime Minister [of Canada] after the party selects its next leader.\\""},{"text":"How much more centralized can you get than an absolute monarchy?","title":"CMV: Contrary to popular belief, US foreign policy is not exceptional.

Slavery, for example, wasnt abolished because of abstract theorizing or endless discussions about societal structures. It was abolished through concrete action like targeting specific laws, practices, and individuals responsible for upholding the system of slavery. Activists didnt just raise awareness but they pursued real change by focusing on tangible goals, such as abolishing slave laws, securing legal protections, and holding perpetrators accountable.Yes, public consensus is necessary for laws to reflect societal values, but this consensus isnt built by throwing around vague terms like \\"systemic oppression\\" or \\"patriarchy.\\" Its built by pointing to specific, undeniable injustices and addressing them with clear solutions. For example, abolitionists showed the horrors of slavery through concrete examples, stories of individual suffering, evidence of brutality, and economic arguments against the institution. They didnt rely on abstract academic language or performative rhetoric but they appealed directly to the publics moral and practical sensibilities.The same applies to sexism. Activism that focuses on specific behaviors like workplace harassment or domestic violence and offers concrete solutions is far more effective than activism that speaks in generalized terms about cultural shifts. Cultural change happens when people are confronted with clear, actionable problems and are given practical solutions. It doesnt happen when activism becomes a self-serving exercise in inventing complex theories to justify its own existence.Structural and systemic change is important, but it must be grounded in concrete actions that address real perpetrators and real victims. Without this focus, activism risks being nothing more than an abstract exercise that raises awareness without ever solving the problems it claims to care about.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"[Heres a statement - when people say thats too political, or that they dont want to get political, what they actually mean is that they dont want to talk about politics that threatens a system they exist comfortably in.](https://www.theblackproject.net/opinion-resources/like-it-or-not-everything-is-political)I agree with you.

Because here's where we're at: (1) we're at a unique crossroads in which the digital age is causing some of us to face hard truths about our recent past. This leads to social movement and social movement  backlash. But wait! There's more! We are about 10 years in to a second cold war, which is GPC. Key players are US/EU, Russia/RFS, and China (the last two being loose allies through BRICS). Combine these factors, and you have a massive hybrid war: Russia has been pumping out mis/disinformation to destabilize US/EU. China and US/EU are covertly using economic means to duke it out. US/EU are trying to counter Chinese/Russian influence in Africa.And we are all stuck in the midst of this, feeling the effects: hyper-partisanship, economic struggles, etc.If anything, the converse of your theory is our actual reality.Light reading: (1) \\"Like war: the weaponization of social media.\\" (2) Wikipedia \\"Social Movement Theory.\\" (3) Google \\"what is the 3.5% rule\\"?","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"Toss some pig in there and you got yourself a deal","title":"Trump nominates lesbian Fox host who believes Dems are making \\"human-animal chimera\\" from Hell - Tammy Bruce has a long history of extreme statements.

This dynamic has played out at every level: individual, familial, communal, and state. Thats exactly why we have developed systems like law enforcement and justice: to handle concrete cases of harm by identifying specific perpetrators and seeking justice for specific victims based on evidence. These systems are designed to deal with real-world problems efficiently and fairly, not through abstract theorizing but by addressing tangible harm.Activism, at its best, should complement this by targeting harmful actions, unjust laws, or specific practices that allow exploitation and injustice to persist. For example, advocating to repeal a discriminatory law or calling out specific cases of abuse are legitimate, impactful forms of activism. However, when activists focus on broad, generalized terms like \\"toxic masculinity,\\" \\"patriarchy,\\" or \\"systemic oppression\\" without pointing to specific issues or perpetrators, it becomes an exercise in rhetoric rather than action. These vague concepts neither solve problems nor hold anyone accountable; they only serve as a platform for activists to justify public funding without producing meaningful results.If the goal of activism is real change, it must focus on identifying exact harmful actions, laws, or policies and addressing them directly. Throwing around fancy terms about how society functions doesnt address the victims or stop the perpetrators, it only perpetuates a cycle of discussion without resolution. Society needs solutions rooted in evidence, accountability, and action, not endless theorizing or performative campaigns.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Salary exempt lol.

Greenlands population is very small so there is a very real risk of this.I think this is almost certainly true as something that will happen &amp; that Greenlanders will be opposed to... I'll give a delta () for hammering it, because I think is probably the strongest response to their willingness to agree and I don't have a conclusive response to it. Still, I suppose I simply think that $4 million per person is enough to overcome *a lot*.  I think the methods used would opposition to development projects (Greenlanders would not need the anyway as they would be rich already) leading to a lack of jobs. Another potential tactic could be restriction of the English language in education. This would likely prevent many families from moving to Greenland. So even though immigration cannot be restricted, I still think a large amount of political energy would be used in Greenland to make immigration undesirable.The thing is that, practically speaking, Greenlanders would all but require immigration to benefit from the deal while staying put geographically. If there is no migration, the money would be near meaningless, because everyone would charge proportionately higher prices to do any work.  But I think there is no way that this is not viewed as a hostile move in Denmark. For it not to be viewed as a hostile move, I think Denmark would need substantial financial compensation. I think it sends a message to US allies that helping the US gets you little in return. Denmark was the only European country to lose more soldiers per capita than the US in Afghanistan (a chiefly American war), and one of the only countries to join the US in Iraq. If the US treats its closest allies by strong arming them into selling one of their constituent countries, why be a US ally?I guess I may be thinking of Denmark as more altruistic/pragmatic than is realistic? Realistically, outside of pride and a desire to protect Greenlanders, there's really very little benefit to Denmark to have control of Greenland, so I see a relatively small amount of resistance happening to the deal if Greenlanders vote for it by a significant margin &amp; there's a (relatively small) sweetener added for Denmark. Maybe that's foolhardy though? Do you think Danes are very emotionally attached to Greenland? US territories are also quite poor compared to the US. Greenland is richer per capita than any US territory, and there is no guarantee that Greenland would not become a backwater in the future.I think this gets causation pretty backwards. Puerto Rico is richer than any of its geographic neighbors... by a lot. The same is true of the Pacific Island territories compared to other Pacific Island nations. Access to a vast market of people and resources is almost always beneficial economically. Moreover, it's somewhat irrelevant for the voters in question - they'll be rich and/or somewhere else.  I do not believe that Greenland joining as a state would be possible in the current (or future) US political climate. People would balk at 50000 people getting two senators.Agreed. As it stands, they'd have to merge or wait to grow.  I think you still did not really answer why Greenland joining the US would be beneficial in a substantial way. I do not believe there is a strong security argument, and any resource extraction would likely face delays and substantial political battles.Denmark has been a close ally to the U.S. since World War 2 - 80 years ago. (Ironically, right before that, during WW1, they were neutral and we purchased the Danish West Indies from them.) ~120 years before that, they were actively attacking our merchant ships.The idea that an ally, even a good one, will always be an ally is just raw short-sightedness. To give a scenario, let's say Russia attacks Estonia during the Trump presidency, NATO doesn't respond, and the organization effectively collapses. There are now no active military treaties between the U.S. and Denmark. Russia begins to encroach and pressure further and, eventually, concedes to Russian requests/demands to ask the U.S. to leave Greenland. Later, a more diplomatically competent Russian government comes to power and actually manages to befriend Denmark and the EU through favorable trade deals and friendly treatment, while the U.S. has continued down a surly and isolationist (though still democratic and peaceful) path damaging relations. Suddenly, the Lomonosov Ridge is closed to the U.S. and Canada. Russian and Chinese surveillance ships and submarines are sailing with impunity throughout the majority of the Artic. Trade is flowing with Europe through Artic routes that the U.S. and Canada can't take advantage of - not the end of the world, perhaps, but a disadvantage considering the economy along the European Artic is increasingly booming. Russian and Chinese military assets are also slowly beginning to appear on Greenland - just small amounts so far, at least as far as our satellites can tell, but who knows what sort of missiles may pop up in the future. Oh, all the sudden, tensions have ramped up, and there are reports of nuclear missiles on Greenland... Now there are American ships staring down Russian and Chinese ships in the middle of the Artic and Bobby Kennedy the III (idk) is on the phone with their presidents trying to sort it out. If its sounds outlandish, that's because it's meant to be extreme, but, truly, there is not *that* much standing in the way of Greenland being the site of another Cuban Missile Crisis or from any of those intermediary steps, still bad in their own right, from happening. The same applies to the Carribbean nations, to be clear, it's just that there's not really the same likelihood/possibility of purchase.

The U.S. would NOT be morally justified to invade Greenland just because it didnt like the government of Denmark. It may well do so, but it would be worse morally than doing this.  If youre a supporter of mans rights, then youd know that taking over another country to secure your rights is perfectly justified morally. And if that means bombing them into submission, then so be it. It would be better morally because it would be based on it actually happening rather than purchasing Greenland on baseless hypotheticals.  And there are numerous scenarios where a hostile Denmark could impede U.S. interests without provoking a war - restricting travel through the clear territorial waters of greenland, giving preferred access to the resources there to u.s. adversaries, etc.  Ok. They should be dealt with when theres evidence that becomes likely. Not based on baseless speculation beforehand.    This just assumes that Denmark doesnt ally with a stronger adversary of the U.S.  This is assuming that it would and that the US cant deal with any adversaries before hand. The best way for the US to deal with foreign adversaries is to move the government towards securing rights for many reasons. That would also best encourage Denmark to become a better ally and more free itself. So no, this is too unrealistic a hypothetical to justify  To give a concrete example, would the Cuban Missile Crisis have happened if Cuba was a part of the U.S.?  No. Cuba was no threat to the U.S... until it almost caused the end of humanity.  Cuba was a concern as soon as it adopted communism. It didnt come out of nowhere. And the US was in the middle of badly fighting a Cold War with another communist country. So no, Greenland isnt going to become a threat out of nowhere, especially if the US moves to securing rights, so this hypothetical is too unrealistic a justification for Greenland being a threat.  Individual humans operate on different timelines, risk calculuses, and resources than governments do. Such an investment would likely risk bankrupting those billionaires unless they quickly turned a profit.   Whats your basis for this? The only reason it might be easier to persuade government is because its not their money and because politicians could probably corruptly make a lot of money. Whats your plan? Who is going to develop the land when Greenland becomes part of the US besides private corporations and private individuals? If its private corporations, then theyre going to have to risk their money anyway. Private corporations could just tell the Greenlanders they are willing to buy X property for X dollars. And then Greenlanders could vote themselves control of the land and sell it.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"many have been asking me why category theory is not a real discipline. it is not a real discipline because the arrows confuse and scare me. particularly the ones with dots. what are they hiding? tell me.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"That sounds bad?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" And you want to throw every single bit of that away because some geriatric told you we should just buy everything and violently occupy whatever we want.I hate Trump's guts lmao.

It used to be that you had to present yourself to a reputable lender and convince them of your financial stability and future success to even secure a loan. That loan would most likely be high interest and the lender would keep close tabs on you to ensure that things are going smoothly.Nowadays we can get a loan through apps on our phones in less than 5 minutes. It's the people that are getting into more debt, not the banks forcing people into debt. It seems financial literacy is harder and harder to acquire in the modern world. Explain to me why it should cost just as much to live in my small town away from any major metropolitan area in a one bed room apartment as it does in a major city, rising over 1000-1500 dollars.While inflation does play a role, housing prices have been mainly driven by supply and demand. These massive investment firms hold less than 1% of single family homes in the US. The big driver was covid pushing people to sell their expensive homes in the city and buy homes in the country. The work from home movement pushed it over the edge. Now as long as you have an internet connection you could work your 6 figure job from a rural homestead in the country.  But the constant culture wars and identity politics played in every single legacy news media company throughout the west is driving people to the point of insanity with its divisiveness.This is something I agree with so I can't say much in contrary.

Let's shift gears to homelessness, because it's more concrete.Group 1 - trying to help the homeless, build houses, soup kitchens, etc. They are 'doing something'.Group 2 - trying to fix the underlying societal problems that led to homelessness: housing reform, normalizing seeking mental health help, financial literacy classes, etc.If group 1 got rid of all homelessness today, in 5-20 years we'd be right back where we are started because you need group 2 to 'fix' the issue.Going back to DEI, group 1 is largely done through legal means. Company/person A is sexist/racist/etc, you take them to court under present law. This occasionally gets the news for big companies/public figures, but it's happening all the time.Group 2 is attempting to change society, which is going to take generations, but is equally as important. The existing framework to do this (DEI classes, etc) is relatively new. And because it's new, you have a whole group of people doing just for the money, companies just going through the motions, or people pushing their personal agenda and getting really, really bad DEI programs that ends up getting picked up by people opposed to it on how 'all DEI' is bad. (personal opinion - part of it is bad because a lot of DEI programs just assumes critical race theory is true and moves on from there)Concrete example, moving away from the US: When Megan Markle called out the British news for being racist, the head of the organization that represented all British news came out and said racism wasn't a thing in British news organizations. That guy had to resign because pretty much every person of color in British news organizations called him out on it. This has 'started' the initiation of discussion of racism in Britain and the rest of Europe, when the societal consensus was 'there's no racism in Europe, it's an American problem.' This has started the discussion of various reforms that are long overdue and a slow shift in discussion among younger generations on the presence of racism in their culture.","title":"CMV: Modern Activism Uses Vague Rhetoric to Justify Public Funding While Diverting Resources from Real Problems"},{"text":"Honestly a perfect cameo for him too.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They go low, we go high.

I think that my position gives me a bit of a unique outlook on the situation. I grew up in an extremely conservative, Evangelical household. When I was young, I wanted to become that. When I got older, I saw how narrow their worldview was.So, I say all of this to say that I think that I understand the motivations of both \\"sides\\" of the culture war pretty well. Fundamentally, there is a certain group of Christians who are simply upset that they have to make adjustments to accommodate people. It's kind of interesting. I'm not the sort of person that most people guess is gay. And thus, people talk to me as if they think I'm straight. And, of course, when I was growing up, I heard the whole unvarnished propaganda machine at its' highest level.They don't want to be around LGBT people. That is the entirety of their position. There's not much more to understand or discuss. And, until they stop trying to use the government to control other peoples' lives, the culture wars will continue. LGBT people aren't going back in the closet. One group started the culture war. One group perpetrates the culture war. One group can end the culture war. None of those groups are LGBT people, Democrats, or anybody else. It's the Evangelical Christians that are going to have to change. I don't really see much of another way forward for us as a society.But, I don't see much evidence of this hatred of LGBT people being driven by any sort of intentional force. It seems to me that it's just people who have grow up in a particular world. Nobody is driving them to this spot other than their own prejudices, or that of the families in which they grew up.Looking at your other complaints, they are all essentially complaints that it's hard to maintain a standard of living. I don't disagree with you that all of these economic issues are troubling, and have a hand in driving our politics. But, as far as that goes, I would suggest two things: there is no goal, and it's not as bad as you think.Which is a simpler solution: that there's some sort of massive conspiracy to divide the nation, or that people are making money off of these loans? That there's a conspiracy, or that people are making money off of healthcare and high housing costs? Essentially all of these problems can be solved by simply recognizing that the vested stakeholders want to make money. It's a pretty simple proposition. We don't need to invent some master plan.Also, it's not as bad as you think. Housing prices are too high, certainly. But, it's relatively easy to maintain an adequate standard of living, even on a somewhat lower wage. It seems to me that, as far as economic stuff goes, what we've really lost is the ability to understand where to spend our money in ways that will make us happy. Fundamentally, I think that we are facing a situation in which people simply...don't know what they enjoy. It's an odd thing that I've been realizing about myself. But we feel this need for something new in our lives to finally make us happy. It's not going to be something we buy that does that. Happiness stems from the interpersonal connections that we make and how mindful we are about the world and the things that we enjoy within it. There's a reason that the mindfulness space is booming. We've forgotten how to exercise that part of our minds, and are distressed as a result.Ultimately, all of this is to say that, most importantly, there is no plan here. Your post relies on there being some sort of \\"divide and conquer\\" trick. Why do the assholes have to be working in concerted effort? Why isn't it plausible that these assholes are all making society worse in search of coin? To me, that seems like an incredibly simple and incredibly probable answer.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"And in other news, Trump plans on making nice with election stealing Maduro.","title":"Biden meets exiled Venezuelan opposition candidate"},{"text":"It's possible conservatism is itself the imbalance.It's not.

It is everything from arming illegal deathsquads to illegal exit bans on Chilean nationals when the freedom of movement was enshrined in the Chilean constution. He killed himself moments before his arrest for these crimes.

His actions were illegal as they were outside of the bounds of his office and he needed to be removed from office and tried for his crimes. Pinochet did so and made Chile a far nicer country. Socialists have no successful examples so they misrepresent the people that failed early, in order to paint over how even in their short tenure, even the failures were absolute tyrants the same as Stalin or Mao.","title":"CMV: Contrary to popular belief, US foreign policy is not exceptional.

Brother, how. This reads like Man that watches exclusively media specifically designed to piss them off. These people hold no power man, they cant hurt you. Are they in the room with us right now? I dont think anyone can help you from this deep deep hole. Your media consumption has completely eroded your understanding of reality and somehow has convinced you that police departments lack funding because a public liberal arts school has sociology programs. These institutions are funded through county or city level taxes, and are not competing with funds allocated to activists. Which from the jump makes no sense, because activism isnt typically funded through public means at all. Its usually people giving their time and energy. They communicate about this issues abstractly because they are rather abstract. Youre telling me you think an identifiable group of people having been literally enslaved wouldnt experience unique challenges in the modern world that can be attributed to the structural inequalities? You unironically just dont understand these problems, and so when people discuss them you think they are being performative. At no point did you reflect and try understand their perspective? Instead you make this crusade post blaming activists with ZERO political power. Meanwhile the billionaire class is sending millions of dollars to get on board with the new oligarchy with every motive to squeeze the middle class out of existence.So wild. Very enlightening.

A few thoughts: Clear evidence or line of reasoning to show that Greenlanders would not or could not force a vote if offered $4 million each. (I am pretty skeptical for either point. Most likely to change on the first, but I don't think you'll find polling to that effect). A clear line of reasoning that this would cause a major breakdown of U.S. relations/international order. Pretty skeptical on this again - it feels like this proposal would be difficult to argue against on liberal grounds &amp; it doesn't feel like it presents a major threat of increasing violence. Increasing voluntary purchases of territory seems... fine. Even potentially beneficial by forefronting a release valve other than war.\\n Clear evidence/line of evidence that the U.S. would never recoup its investment in benefits. This is probably impossible in full form, taking into account near-unpredictable geopolitical benefits.

(I'll come back to the actual argument later, just... wow) So whether the US should buy Greenland is entirely dependent on whether thats necessary to secure the rights of Americans. Its not. The US shouldnt buy it. Instead of spending time and energy trying to get Americans to support the purchase of Greenland, persuade Americans to support their own rights. That would be much more beneficial for Americans. There are lots of resources in America that are untapped that Americans could benefit from without trying to buy more land.I think there's probably ~better~ ways to spend $200 bil (at the high end), to be sure. The problem is that the U.S. has entrenched, systemic barriers to the efficient spending of money that seriously reduce the likelihood of actually doing so at the margin.  One, it can show that its such a good country to be a part of that the people of Greenland leave Denmark and join the US.This assumes that Denmark would let it without international/U.S. pressure. And, regardless, it's a wildly hypothetical possibility.  Or it inspires Denmark to remove whatever political barriers are in place, ie violations of rights, that stop private citizens from developing Greenland. Which means that Americans can then just go purchase whatever land they want and develop it. But seriously, why arent people developing it now? There are two reasons. One, its currently uneconomical. Two, its politically unfeasible due to laws violating rights. Which one is it? If its uneconomical, then it doesnt make any sense to purchase it now. The US government shouldnt be speculating like that anyway with taxpayer dollars.I promise you that Greenland would be more developed under the U.S. than under Denmark lol. Just as a baseline matter, there are almost 660x more people in the U.S. who might consider immigrating to Greenland than in Denmark. There are vastly deeper pools of capital in the U.S. that would be more likely to invest in Greenland if it was a part of the U.S. than they are in another country (regardless of that country's politics), etc.  No, this is hopelessly unrealistic. If America is free and Denmark is free, then they will be allies. Free countries are beneficial to each other. If Denmark goes authoritarian, then the people of Greenland can be persuaded to join the US and the US can just take the moral high ground and accept them while ignoring any outcries from the authoritarian Danes. Or the US can just take Greenland and be done with it while having the moral high ground since authoritarian regimes are illegitimate. Whatever Greenlanders want to stay could stay in America and the US could tell the others to leave.No, this is hopelessly naive. The democratic peace theory is a bare 80 years old and has already been violated several times. Yes, it is probably true to a degree that two democracies are less likely to actively fight major wars, but that does not prevent minor conflicts, a lack of friendliness, etc. The U.S. would *NOT* be morally justified to invade Greenland just because it didn't like the government of Denmark. It may well do so, but it would be worse morally than doing this. And there are numerous scenarios where a hostile Denmark could impede U.S. interests without provoking a war - restricting travel through the clear territorial waters of greenland, giving preferred access to the resources there to u.s. adversaries, etc.  So what? It can be taken with the moral high ground without costing one American life in that extremely unlikely scenario. Just bomb Greenland until they surrender. And then kick them all out. Denmark isnt going to fight back, especially if its weakened itself by becoming more authoritarian.This just assumes that Denmark doesn't ally with a stronger adversary of the U.S.To give a concrete example, would the Cuban Missile Crisis have happened if Cuba was a part of the U.S.? No. Cuba was no threat to the U.S... until it almost caused the end of humanity.  If this is such a good idea, you dont need the US government to get involved in the purchase. A bunch of billionaires can pool their money, pay the Greenlanders to join the USA with the understanding that they own all the currently unowned land.Individual humans operate on different timelines, risk calculuses, and resources than governments do. Such an investment would likely risk bankrupting those billionaires unless they *quickly* turned a profit. The U.S. would be putting 1-5% of one year's budget at stake and has hundreds of years to get a net benefit.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"Lex Fridman promising a Russian interview with Zelenskyy only to be told by him that hes not actually at an adult native speaking level and having to use an interpreter instead is soooo humiliating ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Lolwhut?

The worst figures you'll see for voter turnout or informal voting is in our local elections, and you may have 10-12% not show up/vote informally. In our state and federal elections, that number is usually &lt;5%.Our independent Electoral Commissions ensure that voting is easy to do, and easy to access for all people. We can vote before election day, with usually one prepolling location for about every 30k people. On election day itself (which is always a Saturday), in my town of 20k people, there were 10-15 voting locations open all day.

The sense of a \\"national identity\\" is one, for example, and religion is another. I think what we are seeing nowadays is an erosion in both sense of belonging to the group, meaning the division along partisan lines becomes starker and more vitriolic. From Wikipedia, a somewhat amusing argument: British philosopher Phillip Blond, an advocate of the antidisestablishmentarian position, argues that England's having a state church has prevented the country from embracing any sort of ethnic or racial nationalism.[6] Blond has stated that official patronage of the Church of England has allowed the country to withstand and speak against totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century that were plaguing other parts of the world.[6] He further opined that \\"Just as we need the church to protect the political, so we need it to protect the idea of civil society.\\"[6] Blond concludes that the \\"church establishment in England creates a more diverse political and social life, prevents religious extremism and helps to minimise partisan conflict and secular violence.\\"[6] Giles Coren, a British writer, supports antidisestablishmentarianism because it allows all English people to receive meaningful rites such as marriage.[7]There are some merits in the argument, imo. The shared rituals, for example, do help empathize with people different than you. I vastly prefer national identity as something that unites people, being non religious. But it can have its drawback (without a great rethoric about how immigrants can acquire the national identity easily, you risk all of the xenophobia and protectionism). And rituals related to the national identity, instead of the religious ones, are completely possible. Instead, it seems that the rituals to create your ingroup nowadays is shitting on your political opponent in uncivil but somewhat formalized ways. Go out of them, even if you still criticize your opponent, and people can still respond with hostility.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"those 2010 startup names were different.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"American politicians are so childish xD","title":"Biden to block all future oil drilling in 625 million acres of US oceans"},{"text":"Lol!

So whether the US should buy Greenland is entirely dependent on whether thats necessary to secure the rights of Americans. Its not. The US shouldnt buy it. Instead of spending time and energy trying to get Americans to support the purchase of Greenland, persuade Americans to support their own rights. That would be much more beneficial for Americans. There are lots of resources in America that are untapped that Americans could benefit from without trying to buy more land. And, fording policy wise, the best way to ensure America remains safe at home is promote rights abroad, which means promoting rights at home, which means not attempting to purchase Greenland. If the US does get its house in order it can get the benefit of Greenland without buying it. One, it can show that its such a good country to be a part of that the people of Greenland leave Denmark and join the US. Or it inspires Denmark to remove whatever political barriers are in place, ie violations of rights, that stop private citizens from developing Greenland. Which means that Americans can then just go purchase whatever land they want and develop it. But seriously, why arent people developing it now? There are two reasons. One, its currently uneconomical. Two, its politically unfeasible due to laws violating rights. Which one is it? If its uneconomical, then it doesnt make any sense to purchase it now. The US government shouldnt be speculating like that anyway with taxpayer dollars.  While it is true that Denmark is currently an ally of the U.S., the assumption that this is an unending state of affairs is hopelessly naive. Allies come and go more frequently than an integrated area.No, this is hopelessly unrealistic. If America is free and Denmark is free, then they will be allies. Free countries are beneficial to each other. If Denmark goes authoritarian, then the people of Greenland can be persuaded to join the US and the US can just take the moral high ground and accept them while ignoring any outcries from the authoritarian Danes. Or the US can just take Greenland and be done with it while having the moral high ground since authoritarian regimes are illegitimate. Whatever Greenlanders want to stay could stay in America and the US could tell the others to leave.  1) Many scenarios exist where hostile/ambivalent ownership of Greenland harms U.S. security but would not justify a military intervention, Lets be realistic instead of considering unlikely hypotheticals and cross that bridge when it looks to become likely rather than alienating Denmark by failing to persuade them to sell Greenland.  2) any such military seizure would inevitably be more violent than a peaceful purchase.So what? It can be taken with the moral high ground without costing one American life in that extremely unlikely scenario. Just bomb Greenland until they surrender. And then kick them all out. Denmark isnt going to fight back, especially if its weakened itself by becoming more authoritarian. Or how about this. If this is such a good idea, you dont need the US government to get involved in the purchase. A bunch of billionaires can pool their money, pay the Greenlanders to join the USA with the understanding that they own all the currently unowned land.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"Trump is the kind of person who says 'just jokes' to test if maybe the jokes can become very much not jokes.

Greenlanders do not want to become a minority in their own country, which would likely happen if the US bought Greenland, but will never happen in the current situation. Greenlands population is very small so there is a very real risk of this. There are many examples of this happening throughout Americas expansion.You are right that there cannot be restrictions on this in the US. I think the methods used would opposition to development projects (Greenlanders would not need the anyway as they would be rich already) leading to a lack of jobs. Another potential tactic could be restriction of the English language in education. This would likely prevent many families from moving to Greenland. So even though immigration cannot be restricted, I still think a large amount of political energy would be used in Greenland to make immigration undesirable.I had trouble trying to understand what your main point is here. There is no real risk of Denmark asking the US to leave Thule, Denmark has consistently been one of the US' very closest allies in Europe. Any national security concerns can be achieved with Greenland still being part of Denmark. The only exception to that maybe being weapon silos.Maybe you are right in this. But I think there is no way that this is not viewed as a hostile move in Denmark. For it not to be viewed as a hostile move, I think Denmark would need substantial financial compensation. I think it sends a message to US allies that helping the US gets you little in return. Denmark was the only European country to lose more soldiers per capita than the US in Afghanistan (a chiefly American war), and one of the only countries to join the US in Iraq. If the US treats its closest allies by strong arming them into selling one of their constituent countries, why be a US ally?I have seen similar logic used by most people arguing for Greenland to join the US, and is precisely why joining the US is an unpopular idea.Another issue is political representation. Currently alongside more autonomy than any US state, Greenland also has two members in the Danish parliament. If joining as a territory there would be no political representation. US territories are also quite poor compared to the US. Greenland is richer per capita than any US territory, and there is no guarantee that Greenland would not become a backwater in the future. I do not believe that Greenland joining as a state would be possible in the current (or future) US political climate. People would balk at 50000 people getting two senators.I think you still did not really answer why Greenland joining the US would be beneficial in a substantial way. I do not believe there is a strong security argument, and any resource extraction would likely face delays and substantial political battles.Parts of this comment are out of context as it was a response to OP.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"We should just have the parties alternate back and forth instead of having elections.

The idea of joining the US is very unpopular in Greenland due to a desire for independence, and the US' history treating indigenous americans awfully is a large reason for it. Historically purchases from US native americans have been broken, and I think it is hard to be sure that the US would uphold its end of the bargain. Obviously inflation is also an issue like a previous commenter pointed out.I do think this type of purchase would be looked at very negatively internationally. But lets assume it could work for so I can argue the rest of your points. I do think that in addition to compensating Greenlanders living in Greenland, there would probably need to be similar compensation for the 17000 Greenlanders living in Denmark. I also think Denmark would need some compensation for leaving its military bases.Next I think your argument for America benefiting greatly from the purchase is weak. I believe that the US already can get what it needs when it comes to security from Thule air base. If more American presence is needed in Greenland, another base could probably be established. I also think that trying to do this will hurt US European relationships, which is bad for security.I also believe that if Greenland retains autonomy, many projects that could bring economic development to the island would likely be blocked due to strong nativist sentiment from Greenlanders. This would include things like mining and oil. I think the long term economic benefits would be less than you expect due to this reason.Greenlanders would not want to be folded into another US state. If Greenland was to join the US, maintaining a Greenlandic majority would be a huge area of focus for the Greenlandic government. Your comment mentioned migrants but whatever Greenlandic government there would try to restrict migration as much as possible.I think those were my main arguments against it. There are a few other miscellaneous issues, like Greenland needing an opt out to the Jones act, but I think many of these minor issues are more easily solved.It would be kinda funny to have a state with an indigenous language as the official language though.","title":"CMV: The U.S. (probably) can buy Greenland, and it should do so."},{"text":"1) they don't have to be a part of the colony.

His response was that if we weakened Constitutional protections and expanded states rights, one state could legalize pot, while the next state over legalized slavery.

Numerous people on here have commentated what do the powers that be stand to gain from challenging the status quo from causing disarray and political unrest, or potentially even civil war. But I would argue that history has shown numerous times that powerful individuals stand to gain a plethora of benefits through disorder. At the end of periods of civil war or mass unrest it has been repeatedly shown that whatever that whatever there was a society before, is usually replaced with something even worse, and the most important point being normally in favor of powerful individuals who can consolidate their power even more so than before. The average society, even when standing in defiance of greater evil, and even prevailing, will almost always revert back to tribalistic notions of us vs them, and never put people into positions of power that seek to find solutions for all parts of society. So say the boiling point got to such a precarious situation, in which there was mass violence, I have little hope that at the end of it, we will have learned anything. Instead, I think we will do what we have always done as a collective, and go against our best interests as humans, and further enrich the people who brought us to that point to begin with.

The is the only purpose of government and the only purpose thats best for a prosperous and strong America. And, if Americans do this, then one day I expect Canada to willingly join America. And that is the best way for Canada to join America. All of the problems youve listed arent due to a lack of resources at all. Its precisely caused by the people supporting the government further violating property rights, as seen by the growth of government spending and regulations red or blue. The greatest threat to Americans are Americans themselves who oppose their own rights. And all of the problems can be solved simply by securing the rights of Americans. That is the best way for American to be prosperous and strong. You talk about natural resources in Canada, but there are lots of natural resources that Americans cant use in America because its owned by the government, a violation of rights, or because of laws violating rights that stop Americans. And, if America does move towards securing rights, that would inspire Canada to do the same, which would inspire Canadians to use their resources more. And then Americans could just buy the resources from Canadians. However, taking Canada would be violating the rights of Americans (by forcing them to fund such a war and by sending troops to die to do it) and Canadians. And, after the conquest, America would have added 40 million more citizens who oppose mans rights more than Americans do and will vote against mans rights more. Not only wouldnt that solve the problems America faces, but it would make it harder for America to solve its problems. It would hurt the morale of Americans because anyone reasonable would know that America had just committed a terrible evil. Annexing Canada is conquest for the sake of some arbitrary morality rather than actually changing your ideas to support your own unalienable rights. Its the same thing authoritarian regimes have done across history. Rather than changing their own awful policies, they seek plunder elsewhere. You talk about the threat of China? The best way for America to deal with China is to support rights in its own country. Not only does that make America as prosperous and as strong as possible, but it also will inspire the Chinese to become free themselves and therefore become a friend to America. However, if America turns to conquest, that would weaken America. It would make China and other countries across the world less likely to move to freedom and more likely to move to authoritarianism and become enemies. If you want to protect Canada from Russia and China, then the best way is simply to form a willing alliance with Canadians, not to conquer them for their own good. The conquest back in the 19th century is irrelevant regardless of whether it was correct as that its ancient history just like reparations for slavery.","title":"CMV: USA Taking Canada Would Result In A Stronger North America.

Unlike Mexico, Canada shares Americas language, culture, and democratic values. This would be a union of near-equals, not the cultural upheaval seen in past expansions. **Canadians wouldnt lose their identitytheyd gain access to greater security, prosperity, and influence on the world stage.** Its a partnership that benefits both nations, creating a unified North America with unmatched economic and geopolitical strength.Are you sure about that? Because I'm not.So many people in America believe that if you come to America, you MUST become Americanized. You gotta speak English, you gotta this, you gotta that...Many people in Canda speak French. Their culture is different than ours, their speech patterns are different even when they're also speaking English... There's no way that Americans DON'T start telling the conquered people they gotta assimilate.  Annexing Canada would be far simpler and more beneficial. Unlike Mexico, Canada shares Americas language, culture, and democratic values. This would be a union of near-equals, not the cultural upheaval seen in past expansions. Canadians wouldnt lose their identitytheyd gain access to greater security, prosperity, and influence on the world stage. **Its a partnership that benefits both nations, creating a unified North America with unmatched economic and geopolitical strength.**Say it with me, it's not a partnership if you have to CONQUER them into it. If you have to overpower them, fight them tooth and nail, etc, etc, that's not a partnership. That's a country conquering territories.If you're gonna parrot this drivel, at least be fucking honest with yourself. Don't try to convince people that the Canadians really wanna be fucking conquered by the United States.\\n And lets not fool ourselves into thinking this is purely theoretical. **If we dont act, other nations will. Imagine a world where China or Russia taps into Canadas untapped potential. They wont hesitate to exploit its resources, and they wont do so with any regard for democracy or fairness. Annexing Canada ensures these vital resources remain under democratic stewardship while bolstering Americas global standing.**Just because some other country **might** do these things doesn't mean WE should beat them to the punch. Instead, we should be a good neighbor and ally by **offering aid** with our world class military and all the resources we have at our disposal.Because real talk, if ANYONE tries to conquer Canada **that is what other countries allied with them will do**. They won't go \\"You know, they're right. WE should take Canada once we fight the invaders off.\\" You're clearly jonesing for the United States to be British Empire 2: Electric Boogalo but have the common sense to realize being open about that is going to sour people's perception of your idea. So instead you're sugaring it up by trying to pretend we'd be doing them a favor, that they want it, etc, etc. News flash, we all see through it. History has shown us time and again that borders are political constructs, shifting as necessity dictates. **Annexing Canada isnt about conquest for conquests sakeits about securing our future By taking this bold step, we would address our resource shortages, counter rising global competition, and cement North Americas dominance for generations to come.** America has thrived by acting boldly in the past, and its time to do so again.Again, this is British Empire talk. This is you saying you think the United States has a mandate to do these things, that we're better and deserve it as a result, etc, etc..We talk *so much shit* about the British Empire, man. Because no one liked 'em, cause they conquered people and tore their cultures away from them. That model of doing things is *against* the ideals our nation claims to have. It's unamerican to do that just like it was unamerican of us to try to destroy the culture of the various indigenous peoples away. **If we can accept the historical necessity of annexing vast territories from Mexico, why would we stop short at Canadaa nation that already aligns with us in every meaningful way?** This is not just an opportunity. It is the responsibility of a nation that intends to lead the future.Because we know better now. We know better than to run things the way the British Empire did, we know better than to expect conquest to breed anything but contempt, etc, etc. We're, as a nation, generally against imperialism. What you're proposing is the beginning of American imperialism.","title":"CMV: USA Taking Canada Would Result In A Stronger North America.

This is why Baby Boomers were so successful. They were very highly compensated compared to today, especially on the low end. That's how they got so much money. The poverty threshold for a family of 4 in 1970 was 4k, putting the median rent at about 33% of that. The poverty threshold for a family of 4 in 2024 is 31,200, putting median rent at nearly 61% of income. Those #s are not comparable.

There is no inherent value to life that supersedes all the moral wrongs, (rape, mass-murder, etc), that we have come to attribute as worthy of this violent retribution in the form of the death penalty. Some people have forsaken their right to walk this planet side by side with people when they erase their own humanity through volition. However, why are we giving government the authority to kill based on law, which is not morality, (with even this remaining a debatable topic)? The US Government and Governments in general are fallible. They make mistakes, and no system of Justice can be called Just if it results in the death of even one innocent. Just because something is morally permissible in theory, does not mean it is practical. Even though some deserve to die, the Government should never have the right to determine who those people are.","title":"Two death row inmates reject Biden's commutation of their life sentences"},{"text":"He's trying to grab you by your Saskatchewan.","title":"Trump, Who Incited Insurrection, Accuses Biden Of Making Transition 'As Difficult As Possible'"},{"text":"Alphas- notoriously unstable, full of bugs, and unfit for the public?","title":"Trump, Who Incited Insurrection, Accuses Biden Of Making Transition 'As Difficult As Possible'"},{"text":"Why do you describe that as being self-destructive, and particularly self-hating?","title":"CMV: Modern masculinity is in crisis, there is no non-toxic male role model."},{"text":"On the contrary...","title":"Clueless in DC: Schumer Says Dems Lost Because Americans 'Didn't Realize How Much We Had Done'"},{"text":"Absolutely hilarious to think the remedy after the last election to win the people over is to go FARTHER left","title":"Totally Sane Redditor Makes List of Left Wing Populist Demands"},{"text":"Now Canada can finally have the opportunity to have the same piss poor statistics as the US in the categories of: Gun violence, education outcomes, cost of healthcare, prison population, crime rate, life expectancy, number or billionaires, and number of rapists elected to leadership.

In a sport like football, where toughness and confidence are often tied to masculinity, Messi proves you can be the best without being loud or arrogant. He leads by example, letting his performance speak for itself, and always gives credit to his teammates instead of making it all about him. That kind of humility is rare in sports, especially for someone at his level, but Messi shows that you dont need to act tough or boastful to earn respect.Hes calm, focused, and disciplined, and those traits are a big part of what makes him a leader. But in my opinion, Messi has shown humility to be one of the most important traits for a leader to have. Instead of trying to dominate people with words or attitude, Messi leads in a quieter way, he respects his opponents, keeps a low profile off the field, and works hard to keep improving. That balance between being humble and being the best is the reason why he is so admired, it's the reason he finally won the world cup at 35 years old, his teammates were willing to die in the pitch for him, and that's not normal.","title":"CMV: Modern masculinity is in crisis, there is no non-toxic male role model."},{"text":"All the things you enumerate here are not marks of some shadowy 'intention'; they are simply the end product of freedom for freedom's sake. Free press, free markets, free elections, deregulated banks and lending. Power vacuum after power vacuum after power vacuum, and \\"the people\\" left to choose what person or norm should fill it. \\"The people\\" are never all going to imagine the same one outcome for each possible action, so any sort of long term cause-and-effect-based reasoning usually gets lost in the wash of the democratic process. Instead, the plurality vote usually converges on momentary expediency and whatever \\"feels\\" good to the most people, because those are the most universally agreed-upon metrics. Keep doing that for some few hundred years, and we arrive here.\\"Debt slavery\\" is simply what happens when debt is allowed to \\"grease the wheels\\" too much for too long and compromise the normal demand curve for goods and services. If a firm *can* raise prices, they *will* raise prices, and this is only bounded by the point where they lose too much business for the extra per-unit revenue to be worthwhile. When people can simply borrow rather than frown, shake their head and walk away, at least some of them will choose to borrow. Prices can consequently rise further, and before you know it, everyone is carrying revolving debt because the market will not allow them to do otherwise. This seemed innocent enough at first, and allowed the economy to drive ahead on a codified system of trust rather than relying on extant and provable value exchanges - which, for a time anyway, boosted overall productivity and quality of life. Again, expediency + feels good. But now such debt is fully \\"priced in\\", the benefit to the everyday person is negligible to negative, and the real beneficiaries of all that debt are so entrenched into everyone's way of life that it would take an apocalypse to remove them.Excessive inflation is essentially a product of democratic (system, not the party) monetary policy. If politicians did what was necessary to prevent it, people would feel the tax hikes and government service cuts immediately - and the responsible politician would be voted out. On the other hand, the full economic consequences of fiscal irresponsibility do not play out over their current term - and by the time those consequences do rear their ugly heads, \\"the people\\" have had plenty of time to forget who exactly did what. So representatives are glad to whip out the pen and spend more, but infinitely reluctant to tax proportionately. Expediency + feels good.As for the media: again this is simply free and rational actors doing what they do. Pushing narratives of cultural and political \\"wars\\" is a tried-and-true way create and maintain fear. Fear of being uninformed about what evil deed the other side is going to inflict upon the innocent populace next. Unless of course, you tune back in tomorrow so they can tell you. *This produces repeat customers far better than merely stating facts ever will* \\\\- and as long as the press is free to spin whatever narrative they wish and sell their material via competitive markets, such tactics will continue to dominate. Will it spark political instability and damage their bottom line due to the effects of civil wars on the markets and infrastructure through which this inflammatory rubbish is delivered? Maybe someday, but that's for the next guys to figure out. Expediency + feels good.At no point need we invoke some ominous body of scheming masterminds and devious conspirators - unless you want to go as far back as the French or American Revolutions, maybe.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"Comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

Men are not entitled to women's company. If a man cannot find a woman who wants to keep him company he has the option to seek out company from other men, even if he doesn't want to, and even if it's not the type of company that he wants (e.g. romantic company). The option still exists. If he doesn't that's his choice and his responsibility.If all women just up and decided that they no longer wanted to keep men company the only reason why that would result in all men being lonely is if all men just decided that keeping each other company was not an option for themselves, which would be a choice that they'd make, 100% their responsibility because they could choose to do something else (i.e. keep each other company).Men need to consider re-evaluating the company of other men for themselves, and re-evaluating all the types of company that exist. There is value in platonic company between the same sex even if it's not your preferred choice of company. You can either learn to see it and minimize your chances at suffering from loneliness, or don't and maximize them.

A \\"real man\\" isn't just an adult who is male - you can be a man-child after all - instead a \\"real man\\" is someone who is distinguished from a boy, someone dependent, incapable of providing and of taking risks, and typically lacks in confidence. These cultures almost all fear a regressive drive that threatens to turn men back into boys because dependence and security is the path of least resistance, so there's usually some cultural apparatus that applies shame and honour as necessary, as a carrot and stick of sorts, to guide boys into manhood. The initiation doesn't happen on it's own, you need outside help, and many psychologists (such as Marie Louise von Franz) speculate that since the days of industrialisation men simply haven't spent enough quality time with their sons to help them overcome the gap.It's most amplified in cultures where physicality is necessary, such as in cultures that frequently go to war or need to hunt a lot. Conversely, places like Tahiti barely had any concept of a \\"real man\\", presumably because they never went to war and food was abundant. There was nothing a man would do that a woman couldn't, therefore no need for \\"real men\\".We kind of live in a world like that now, so we can rightfully ask what the point of a \\"real man\\" even is now, since it's a bit redundant. Again, there's nothing I can do that a woman couldn't, so isn't it a bit offensive that I might say men should be men? But some authors like Robert Bly and von Franz believe that most moral ideologies often fly in the face of our animal instincts. Whether our nature is vestigial or not doesn't matter, it's still there and we can't kill it, and repressing it in order to achieve some cultural ideal turns us against ourselves and weakens us, and ultimately makes us feel like our lives lack in meaning.For what it's worth, I found all of this quite persuasive so I went down this road and I don't feel like a worse person for it. Actually I am much more dependable, I can connect with people in a more sincere way, I can stand up for myself more, less often fall back on jokes and irony to escape my emotions, and generally feel like I'm operating at a deeper level than I was before, so I think there's merit to the whole idea. But most people I talk to still find it offensive and they think I've been going down some Jordan Peterson rabbit holes or something. And that's a shame because I do think men really need something like this these days, given how they are getting increasingly isolated, depressed, addicted, and falling behind professionally and academically. How long can we elevate an ideal that's destroying our souls? Is the \\"real man\\" really so offensive that we can't resurrect it to help young men who feel lost?","title":"CMV: Modern masculinity is in crisis, there is no non-toxic male role model."},{"text":"Vast majority drink tap","title":"Conspiracy theorists are winning another one"},{"text":"I liked a lot of what Kamala wanted to do, but Bernie is definitely a step up.","title":"How I imagine Biden on his last day in office"},{"text":"I like your list of masculine ideals.

Lol tbh the idea of inflation is the only absurd lie that people keep alive here. 1970s: Someone with a high school diploma could get a job in any business/entry level position, and support a family on a tight budget. Getting a degree costed you maybe 4-6 months of wages. \\nNow: someone with a high school diploma can only get low-paying jobs that can barely afford the cost of living for one person. To get a degree costs more than you make per year and will likely require you to get a loan that will take you 10-20 years to pay it off, unless youre one of the unlucky ppl who deferred their loans or paid the bare minimum, then it will take 30+ years to pay it off (paying off the interest while barely touching the principal keeps the loans on the books for a long time)1970s: Average profit margin for a company: 5-7% because most of the money that companies earned would be spent back on either: employees (bonuses, raises, pensions), assets, or R&amp;D\\nNow: Average profit margin for a company between 30% and 35%. Most of the money is retained, or spent on assets, or treasury stock (buying ones shares back in a company which makes the stock go up). Money is no longer being funneled to employees since Regan opened the door to treasury stock. CGPGrey did a good overview on this subject, but I cant find the video. So yes, ppl earn less money while the costs keep going up. National Inflation Index: monitors prices of specific goods and is used to compare the purchasing power of the dollar bill. Doesnt take into account the increase in profit margins, or outside factors, and only accounts for a price at a certain time. There has been a trend in companies to move towards a verticals supply chain. Meaning a lot companies outsource the production to make the basic parts of a product. You see this a lot in car manufacturing, apart from 2 notable companies: Toyota and Tesla. The issue here is when a lot more companies are required to build a product, and all of them raise their profit margins for goods, the ending result is an increase in cost to the consumers. This is passed off as inflation, but really its corporate greed trying to earn more money and not pass it on to the employees (at least the lower level employees; C level employees always get nice wages assuming they have the profits to take the large wage).","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"In fairness, a drone has no clue what to do about a Bronze Age weapon.

It has been applied to that effect in lower courts but the most authoritative consideration was the Tenth Circuit in *Lorance v Commandant:**Although various federal courts have parroted Burdicks statement that acceptance of a pardon may imply a confession of guilt (or some variation to that effect), see, e.g., Schaffer, 240 F.3d at 38, none have given formal, legal effect to such an implied confession. Instead, they generally cite Burdick to support the proposition that acceptance of a pardon does not erase guilt. See, e.g., Hirschberg v. CFTC, 414 F.3d 679, 682 (7th Cir. 2005) (A pardon in no way reverses the legal conclusion of the courts ?

Nothing in the Court's opinion purports to establish that acceptance of a pardon is the legal equivalent of a confession of guilt, with all accordant legal consequences. We think that is too much baggage to tie to Burdicks dicta, which arose in the context of discussing personal motivations behind refusing a pardon, and, specifically, the public perception associated with acceptance. If the Court had meant to impute other, legal consequences to the acceptance of a presidential pardon, it surely would have said so explicitly.*","title":"Two death row inmates reject Biden's commutation of their life sentences"},{"text":"What would you call that?

We live in a good time to be alive in human history. Maybe the best time ever compared to the past. I can give you a whole litany of reasons and statistics, but for the sake of expediency we tend to live longer now, have more free time and have more material possessions than in the past on average.A lot of people consider the 1950s to be a golden age for US life. Yet the poverty rate was double what it is now. People's lives were shorter, and people were genuinely worried about another World War and nuclear annihilation. People had less free time, went hungry more, had less access to education. The common person could reasonably lament that the world was coming to a breaking point. Did it come to a breaking point? Well kind of, maybe not a world war, but Cold War tensions got high enough for Vietnam  and the Cuba Missile crisis. Poverty got so bad there was a \\"war on poverty\\" and Medicaid was created and welfare was expanded. Then in the immediate aftermath of that era real wages sunk to their lowest ever point during \\"stagflation\\" which combined high unemployment and high inflation. Crime started to skyrocket and the common man could have easily said that society was bringing him to a breaking point. Maybe it did break? Interest rates went through the roof housing became unaffordable, a recession happened, the Cold War heated up again people in the Soviet Union definitely felt their society coming to a breaking point after the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and economic troubles of their own. Yet by the 1990s crime had started to decline the Soviet Union had collapsed the budget was balanced and homes were affordable again. Yet while tensions were happening tensions were growing overseas, the internet was changing everything, rural areas were in steep decline and for some it seemed like the breaking point was coming. Then 9/11...You get the point. For some people there is this feeling that we are always on the precipice of a \\"breaking point.\\" Sometimes we are. Sometimes we break and then correct for our mistakes...or not. At the end of the day technology and medical breakthroughs still happen. The world keeps turning and life goes on. You can always find the ways we are about to see societal collapse and it's not like societies never collapse. One thing is that we should all be invested in keeping our liberal democracy in tact because it can actually respond to these concerns with greater buy-in than most systems. It's flexible. So really you don't need a full on collapse in order to change things for the better. However it is certain that societies should always adapt the best they can to new circumstances. Liberal democracy is a means to do this. There are multiple times in US history where one system was replaced with another without the need to hit an actual \\"breaking point\\" or catastrophic event.","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"No he has bigger issues rn","title":"Do you think Trump will have Biden and Kamala investigated?"},{"text":"so was 2020","title":"Kamala Harris certifies her own election loss"},{"text":"Kamala has that \\"FML\\" look while Little Johnson has that \\"the Master will be so happy when they peg me\\" grin.","title":"Vice President Kamala Harris certifies her election loss"},{"text":"The free world drinks coffee to tolerate each other, tea for when shit needs to be done, and liquor to celebrate the end of it all.

In some ways for the better and in others for the worse. Having self value and standards is good that the changes around that needed to happen. Feminism, when its about men and women being equals, having/respecting boundaries, getting consent every time, basically all of the points about men and women both being humans and deserving of respect and equality isnt the problem. Sure those parts made it so a handful of shit bags couldnt get someone but if the opposite gender literally being treated as less than is what it takes for you to have a partner then nobody really cares if youre lonely. You have to remember that not every single member of a group is rational and reasonable. Extremists exist within every group, feminists and mens rights included. Think of kill all men and your body my choice. Both of those statements are coming from the respective groups even if its only a tiny minority of the group that thinks that way. If extremist views are regulated within the group before they get out or wildly condemned by a huge majority of the group when they get out then that message is attached to the group.So with all that in mind heres my breakdown on the negative side, feminism was largely the driving force that told men the way theyd approached women was wrong and women would let you know while simultaneously telling women that if a man wants you then hell make an effort to get you, which is a problem because youre telling both sides that they should wait until the other makes the first move. This helped lead to the stalemate that is modern dating where nobody is willing to shoot their shot and make the first move.Then on a more individual level which Ive seen with a couple friends and more so in the younger generations of men in my family and their friends. A lot of men are terrified of being accused of something because of the potential social consequences coming just off the accusation with no proof. Not saying that happens all the time but it does happen and the consequences are so severe that some men dont view the risk vs reward as worth it. Its not like those men dont want relationships, a lot of them desperately want the relationship. Its just that some people took the phrase believe all women way too literally and the results of those cases scared the living hell out of a lot of guys.In short, some very vocal extremist feminists that make up a minority of feminists made a big impact on a lot of men because they got their way a few times to the extreme detriment of the men in involved. Thats how feminism helped create the male loneliness epidemic.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Youre the one repeating narratives","title":"CMV: society is intentionally being driven to a breaking point"},{"text":"What's it like to be that ridiculous?","title":"Nancy Mace Mocked for Suggesting Dems Will Try to 'Steal Election from Trump' Despite Peaceful Certification: 'Drama Queen'"},{"text":"If you are so far removed from the mindset of the average American from the working or middle class, that you cant see the media and higher education on both sides constantly putting out fear porn about other cultures and racial groups.

The moderators on the women's forums are incredibly dogmatic and incredibly intolerant of any pushback on that dogmatism.  This is not true on the men's forums, and therefore, the women's forums end up being an indiscriminate cheering section for whatever \\"women first\\" point is being made, regardless of whether that point is genuine or self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing, or outright bigoted.  The men's forum, while it contains a great deal of truly offensive and stupid crap will often have better discussions because a diversity of opinion is tolerated.  \\n2.

If a man is talking about his struggles in life, and one of his struggles is that he lost a custody battle for his kids in court to his ex-wife, that is a part of his story that needs to be addressed. Our entire legal system is overwhelmingly biased towards women. Women get lesser punishments than men for commiting the same crimes and they typically win custody/alimony disputes in divorce court. If I'm trying to workout in the gym and I'm uncomfortable because a woman is filming a video next to me why would you call that a petty issue? If it were the other way around would you still call it petty? If a guy were filming you in the gym without your consent and posting videos making fun of you then you wouldn't be upset? You have some serious internalized misandry that you need to address. You don't even realize that you're being hypocritical and brushing off men's issues. As for your point about therapy, the reason that men don't go to therapy is because the entire industry is extremely gynocentric. What I mean by that is that when men go to therapists to talk about their issues their problems get brushed off by the therapist just like how you are brushing off men's issues right now. The entire system of diagnosis and education is focused on helping women. So when men go to get mental help they feel that it is a waste of time and energy because the education and training that the mental health professionals received is not applicable to the problems that men are facing. For example, many men have body image issues. They take steroids and take protein supplements and eat carnivore diets all in an attempt to get their bodies to look like Wolverine's or Superman's or Captain America's. However, when they go to a therapist to talk about these body image issues the therapists act like there is no problem at all. Why is that? Because the therapists' education and training prepared them for female body image issues not male body image issues. They associate body image issues with bulimia or anorexia. Teenage girls starving themselves to look skinny. They are completely unprepared to help men with the male version of body image issues. So a male who goes to therapy for this issue will just be wasting his time. That is why men do not typically go to therapy. Because therapists are unhelpful for most of the problems that men face.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"In my experience (I worked 6 years in a hellish customer service job), people lash out because nobody was sympathetic when they needed it.

In that same year, there were 48k suicides in the USA. So, 9800 suicides were women, and 38 000 were men. Now, all death is bad.

So if I was to argue against your specific cmv, I would say that. But a more reality based argument is this.

Meanwhile democrats have to pretend to have center-left ish economic views but can't actually push for anything substantial and significant because everything that'd actually benefit the people are anti capitalist class/big business - socialized healthcare, raising taxes, more social and welfare programs, public housing, etc etc. So the democrats have to pretend they wanna do this stuff, but come up with lame reasons they cant do it, like having a \\"rotating villain\\" like Joe Lieberman then Joe Manshin and Christen Sinema and be like \\"awww shucks sorry guys I guess we just dont have the votes oh well, vote blue no matter who harder next time and maybe just maybe\\".  Democrats hate having to play this pretend game, and people wisen up to it over time, what the democrats hate more than anything is actually having a majority but then having to find elaborate ways to tell the people they cant actually do these super popular policies that they campaigned on.

Do you know how many men commit suicide over alimony and bad breakups? How many men are thrown in jail because they cant pay their child support payments?Yes and thats an issue, but the root of the issue is more complex than that. Men and women both commit suicide over bad breakups and alimony. If a man gets primary custody, the woman pays it. If a woman gets primary custody, she pays it. And the parent who has the kid most of the time, whether it be mom or dad, is paying way more expenses for that kid than the person paying child support is. Food, clothes, doctor visits, stuff for school projects, treats, bedding, toilet paper, everything. And in most cases men or women are in jail for child support if theyve went 3+ months without paying which of course is unacceptable. Being a single parent and paying for all of those expenses is hard.

Oftentimes, it doesn't matter if the mother is a crackhead and the father is a productive member of society - 9 times out of 10, the child's still going to the mother.A key element you forgot to mention here is that the judges default to that, because the man doesn't want the children, and does not file for custody.

In the event that men contest custody, and the woman accuses the man of abuse (especially child abuse), the chance of children being awarded to the father **increase**.

In the same vein, organizing on internet (chats, groups etc.) where people have actual sustained contact with each other and talk about actions make these individuals part of a movement. But leaving a comment, filming a tiktok, without actually engaging with the same group of people over a sustained period of time on this issue, in other words actually organizing, doesnt make you part of a movement.

This is obviously upsetting and not a good thing, but I really dont see why a lot of men (and some women too) will always bring up things like what about the male loneliness epidemic or men have it worse when someone brings up how women and girls all over the country are losing their reproductive freedom, stuck raising children on their own financially struggling and not getting a penny of child support, walking home at night in fear, being sexually harassed in the work place and dealing with your body my choice remarks from conservative men. Or if theres any post on social media at all that is about empowering women or glorifying the womens rights movement, theres always people in the comments or stitching the video to talk about how men somehow have it worse because of the loneliness epidemic and a woman didnt have the right to vote, a man in WW1 didnt have the right to keep his life, big deal as if that excuses anything. Well, I think part of it is that a lot of these ideas are BS or partially BS. For every woman not receiving proper child support, there is probably a dude who is getting financially skewered in the same situation. Walking alone at night in fear is, statistically, something men should be more affected than women. How many peope are actually saying \\"your body my choice\\" unironically, outside toxic internet spaces? I think their is a lot of misinformation out there, and we live in a cultural climate that discourages questioning things openly. But even that isn't enough to stop some people reacting to instances of propaganda and fear-mongering with equally stupid and needless counterpoint. Basically, what I'm saying is that you're presuming the shit they are reacting to is positive and that it should have been put out there in the first place. A lot of it isn't and shouldn't. Also there are things like a mens right movement happening, which isnt bad in itself, but a large portion of the so called activists are just straight up misogynistic in the way they talk. They start out speaking of important things like male loneliness, suicide rates and mental health but they they slide into talking about petty things like women having lead roles in movies, women filming at the gym, how unfair child support is etc. I just dont understand why the male loneliness epidemic or other male issues should be used to somehow downplay feminism MRA, like feminism, is an ideological movement. Neither are going to be perfect, especially in terms of the sorts of people they draw. You do realize there are a multitude of self-descfibed feminists out there who are quite misandrist, right?

Men are far less likely to get custody. Less likely to initiate divorce, and more likely to have to pay alimony after divorce. Less men are graduating from college. The patriarchy has become a boogeyman to blame men for the problems men and women face, at a time when people are pushing back on the people of x group before you did abc bad things, so members of x group should be held responsible todayThe problem of mens rights/male loneliness is largely a result of the liberation brought on by the feminist movement where women dont need to rely on a man anymore. And the subsequent male loneliness epidemic is from part of society not adapting to feminisms liberation as a whole, as well as societys broader issue of coming to a conclusion and finding evidence that supports it, rather than asking questions to find answers and then come to a conclusion.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":" If we have 1:1 men and women equally, we have to support equally.\\nWhich is what feminist and (healthy) men's rights are trying to do.?\\n You're just supporting my negative views on feminism that it is one-sided.\\nLol what's negative?

It was about forging a bond between the genders where we could see each other, and our different experiences, and empathise with one another. This comes out very strongly in bell hooks work.I'm a man, and I'm somewhat of a manly man by accident of my hobbies. I have also been a victim of domestic abuse. I had numerous difficulties in my life that were tightly connected to my gender - as many people do. I was put into a situation where my abuser was able to counter-accuse me, be believed, and even once I used the incontestable evidence that I had to prove that I was the victim heard many make the excuse \\"I'm sorry she did that, but she needs the support more right now\\". That was a gendered experience.The point here isn't to make a comparison to what most women go through or experience. It isn't about quantifying relative harm or difficulty. You cannot look at life through such a weak pseudo-utilitarian calculus, this isn't about trying to figure out who has more 'negative utility' from their gender. The point is, the core of feminism is about *radical empathy* which means that women have work to do, as well as men. That is what many of these men are trying to get at when they bring up the male loneliness epidemic, they're trying to make the point (even if they don't have the vocabulary to explain it) *you are asking me to make the effort to understand you, but you are not making the effort to understand me.*To take this a step further, I will highlight that this is a particularly significant problem for white, privileged women. I went from the gutter to earning some serious money after University, and the women that I met at university and after had significantly less empathy for and understanding of men than the women I grew up with. Just look at the writing of Audre Lorde and bell hooks if you want to grasp this distinction between how certain kinds of white, middle-class and upper-class women understand men and how people who have experienced real adversity in their life see them.These women have a taste of power and privilege, but see that there is a caste of men beyond them who have that privilege, plus further power and agency by virtue of their gender. They will take that model and impose it on the rest of the world, even though these men are realistically about 30% of men at most, and they consistently fail to recognise their own privilege within the trappings of their class and race. These people *do* need to do some serious work, and their feminism is often rightly criticised by economically and ethnically marginalised groups for its weaknesses.So I disagree with the premise that it is 'hurting feminism', it is a valid and legitimate critique of some kinds of feminism which often come from a position lacking in mutual empathy. It is up for those feminists who haven't done the work, to go read Lorde and hooks and related writers and do the work to understand why certain groups feel left behind.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"\\"Loneliness\\" is kind of a squishy topic to use as an example of the tension between the goals of feminism and the wellbeing of men. Let's talk about health generally.For 50 years, it has been known that men die younger of every preventable cause, but especially deaths of despair. Setting aside of the effect of suicide and addiction, the other major reason for mens shorter lifespans was the fact that 50% less was spent on their medical care compared to women.The affordable care act was passed in 2005, written by feminist leaning senators and representatives. Given that the acute distress men are in had been known for so long, what was the approach of the new law? The text of the ACA refers to \\"women\\" 145 times and \\"men\\" exactly once - in a section mandating that women should pay no more than men for this superior level of care.The perception of \\"hurting feminism\\" is unavoidable if we are going to shift the spotlight to the people who are most in need of healthcare (including mental healthcare - the indirect point of your OP).","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Except he's the one that did nothing.There are so many points in his presidency where he could have actually either stopped or held those accountable for what they were doing.But he didn't.His legacy will be going back on his word of running again, then rolling over, and essentially paving the way for Trump 2.0And honestly?

I am going out on a limb here and what I am typing could be completely and utterly wrong but here's my perspective as a man who has been on the internet for a while The problem non insane grifter men have with the feminist movement generalizing all men, and they are hurt by the generalizations. They see the generalizations made about them on the internet, things like men are violent is the big one, and they turn to alternative sources that tell them that that is just evil women demonizing the nice boys they are. Usually into alt right circles. Now for this, I actually empathize with that. Words matter and it is hurtful to be lumped in with a group of people performing *heinous* actions. And I know the response will be \\"well if you arent violent we don't mean you\\", but like that doesn't help. Change those 2 words, and make it \\"black people are violent\\" and you have one of the most destructive generalizations ever put on this earth. We don't accept those kind of generalizations and just tell them \\"well if you are not violent we don't mean you\\". Same thing with \\"Women are emotional\\" and \\"well if you arent emotional we don't mean you\\". The generalizations still hurt everyone in the group. I have watched a few friends fall into this spiral, and yeesh its tough to watch. Now the unhinged griftersThey are working backwards. They are starting from a place of \\"women should be subservient\\" and justifying it by using women's actions against them. Most of the time pandering towards that first group. These are the people you are probably interacting with online, and they are the absolute scum IMO. I think a lot of actual men who have fallen into the alt-right were in the first group, but they are edged on by the second group.TLDR: In the era of everyone being online, people have become more and more lonely in general. Add on to that that, feminism has a lot of very divisive rhetoric in the form of generalizations, which hasn't helped the situation with reasonable men, and a ton of bad men acting in bad faith to demonize women for clicks or control or money or power, and you get the male loneliness epidemic.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Thats my point.

But if you're holding on to offensive ideas, I don't know what choice you're giving people. If to be recognized as supporting women's rights, as someone who is empathetic, means I have to understand myself as a monster...it's not a reasonable ask of people. To be clear, I think a power-based understanding of masculinity needs to be replaced with a responsibility-based understanding.

Men used to have clubs and those were insisted on being done away with to make room for women (such as Boy Scouts of America, which is now The Scouts, while the Girl Scouts were left alone). Men used to have hobbies, but those are called toxic and have to be changed for women (such as video games where woke ideology get pushed now making bad games).  Sports have been under assault as well and with the Civil Rights Act male sports in college were reduced to make room for women. So everywhere you look, things that are male get attacked in the name of supporting women, but the reverse is never looked at.  what about the male loneliness epidemic or men have it worse when someone brings up how women and girls all over the country are losing their reproductive freedom, stuck raising children on their own financially struggling and not getting a penny of child support, walking home at night in fear, being sexually harassed in the work place and dealing with your body my choice remarks from conservative men.So even when talking about male loneliness, you have to make it about women.  This is a standard approach in discussion.Also there are things like a mens right movement happening, which isnt bad in itself, but a large portion of the so called activists are just straight up misogynistic in the way they talk.This is you saying it's bad. In fact, this exact topic was covered in a movie by a feminist movie maker.  It's called [\\"The Red Pill\\"](https://youtu.be/_sRp73g7lfU?si=rJfs7Yx_3LfyXjLz).  It's worth a watch if you have time because it's about how this feminist movie maker set out to look into Men's Rights Activists and she came to see the female centric society in the process. In fact, she was attacked for making this movie by former feminists.  I just dont understand why the male loneliness epidemic or other male issues should be used to somehow downplay feminismBecause the source of most of these problems is feminism. How it doesn't care about any aspect of men and looks to demean and combat men. When it comes to male loneliness (and I'm not lonely btw), it's the total destruction of the dating world by feminist liberation movements and the high expectations that have been given to women. So, for example, on a dating app, women will go for the top guys only and 90% of guys don't get any responses. While women will continue to get a lot of interest, men live in a different world where they get none and also have no place to go to hang out with guys and also have no where to escape to for a past time because feminism attacks and ruins all of it.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"\\\\ Im looking for opinions that the male loneliness epidemic is somehow intertwined with feminism or caused by feminismSo a more appropriate title would be:CMV: Feminism has nothing to do with male loneliness epidemicso your view can actually be changed on the central point.\\\\ Im calling the petty things pettySo do men's rights activists, and where does it bring us?

The older kind (which I'll call Old Feminism) wanted to level the playing field by lifting women up. The modern kind (which I'll call New Feminism) wants to level the playing field by tearing men down. As a man, I'll agree 100% that women shouldn't have to walk home in fear, be sexually harassed in the workplace, and such like, and I'll advocate for women's rights on those fronts 100%. But a number of those women will then turn around and say \\"I hate all men,\\" \\"men should die,\\" and cheer whenever an innocent man gets fleeced in a divorce settlement just because he's on the wrong team.So the way I see it (and I could be wrong about this), the Male Loneliness Epidemic is an emotional plea for empathy from the other side. It's men saying, \\"we're struggling too, you know,\\" and that hating on them isn't okay. That's how it hurts New Feminism.And that's *also* where the other stuff you mentioned is coming from:women having lead roles in moviesGuys love women in lead roles. What they don't love is women deliberately replacing men in lead roles. And by that I mean roles where the character was originally male, in a story designed around a male character, replaced by a female character. And even then, guys wouldn't mind so much if the female character wasn't often a man-hating misandrist in the role or a male character in female skin. Writing men out of stories just because they're men isn't cool.women filming at the gymAgain, guys normally wouldn't give a shit, except that women were using their filming rights to bully men by painting them as sexual harassers just because they looked in the woman's general direction for two seconds. Not cool.how unfair child support isIt *is* unfair. No-Fault Divorce is fine, great even, if children aren't involved, but if there are, then the one who put them in this situation should be the one paying for it, *regardless of how much money they're making*. Instead, it's always the higher earner, and because women still act like it's the 50s whenever they enter divorce court, it's almost always the men who pay because the men are almost always the primary earners.And even if we put that aside, when it comes to custody battles, the judges typically default to giving custody to the mothers, even though the law is officially neutral. Oftentimes, it doesn't matter if the mother is a crackhead and the father is a productive member of society - 9 times out of 10, the child's still going to the mother.The point is, not only are men lonely, but a case could be made that it's a direct result of feminism swinging way too far in the wrong direction.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"Trump will win the appeal, but it won't be in time for energy price reductions to occur *before* the midterms.

It's because there is a lot of emphasis put on ameliorating issues that women face (and rightly so!) and the impression some men get is that *their* issues are discounted simply because of their gender.I think there is a lot truth to that, FWIW.  I mean, look at your post.  You are trying to say that men's issues are important, too, but you cannot help but make the comparison to things women face (and raising children without child support isn't a gendered issue, FYI), and not only that, but you can't help but disparage and minimize a male-centric issue!  Again, I agree with everything you're saying, but it's quite telling that you can't even get through a 3 paragraph post that is ostensibly about the \\"male loneliness epidemic\\" without basically telling men that their issues are unimportant and that they should sit down and shut up and focus on women's issues.Lets put it this way.  You (generically) would be absolutely raked over the coals if you went to a topic about reproductive rights and said \\"wait a minute, what about male loneliness?!?!\\"  And yet here you are, discussing male loneliness, and you simply cannot help but make the comparison.  They aren't and shouldn't be considered equally problematic, but it's also nice to think that maybe someone is advocating for you because they think it's worthwhile, and not to be told that simply because you occupy a place of relative privilege, you aren't allowed to have meaningful problems.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"I got piled on and perma-banned from r/news for noting that an article being discussed was based on a leaked draft of the Matt Goetz report--and not the actual report as the headline suggested.

The unfortunate reality is that the latter is more likely to wind up with people getting killed.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"\\"I genuinely don't see why this 'gender wars' stuff is happening ... and there's no good reason for it\\"Well, immediately after you say this, you go on to belittle male issues as \\"men just don't have friends and therefore feel lonely\\" and then compare it to how women have many more problems than men and try to group it in with far-right \\"men's rights activists\\" that everyone knows are just pushing a sexist grift to shill for cash. So you yourself are participating in this \\"gender war\\" and using women's issues to downplay men's issues. Which, though you certainly didn't mean to do it consciously, is incredibly hypocritical.I am aware that often, people discussing women's issues are invaded by men complaining as you describe. On the flip side, though, I have NEVER seen male issues discussed without someone trying to say \\"yeah, well women have it worse so you don't really have much to complain about\\". As in, I've been at parties where a guy is opening up about his struggles with clinical depression and suicidal thoughts, including a previous attempt, and SEVERAL women casually brush it off with \\"yeah, but you've never been catcalled, so I don't feel bad for you\\". I even know a guy whose girlfriend broke up with him because he cried when his immediate family member (a brother or father, iirc) died. She \\"got the ick\\" and couldn't see him as masculine anymore. Neither of these things are uncommon experiences for men. Women often tell men they need to be more emotionally available, but most men have several experiences telling them that is a lie.So while I agree with you men's issues shouldn't be used to downplay women's issues, the inverse is also true. Men have legitimate and unique issues that shouldn't be downplayed by \\"oh, but women have X problem you don't have, so you can't have problems\\". Until women recognize that, this shutting down of gendered issues is going to continue, because you can't expect someone to stop doing something that you keep doing to them.","title":"CMV: The male loneliness epidemic shouldnt be used to hurt feminism"},{"text":"tandard by which things are judged.

Ultimately, the biggest problem is that many are not saving enough for retirement, and people are tending to live longer and need more to live. We can debate the mechanisms to work within that. Preserving Social Security and using 401k's as retirement vehicles are equally valuable goals. I think the video is a bit biased since they look at auto workers who don't realize how well the stock market has done over the past few decades and have too much nostalgia for auto as an industry in America. Pensions ended up costing way too much, and many companies couldn't fully fund their pensions (unlike government pensions where public pressure is enough to strongly support it). I guess what I'm figuring out is there should be ways of encouraging saving through investment vehicles, but they can neither be fully government run or individual run. Any reasonable policy to reform Social Security should recognize how lifespans have increased, and therefore benefits are basically being stretched further into the future to pay for older people. Whether that means tax increases of some kind, or spending cuts like extending the retirement age, or some combination of both, that will come to a head in coming years.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 6, 2025"},{"text":"Like the other user said, we've never been in this situation before.

I don't know much about the guy himself, but I don't see him blindly going along with Trump because he's aware that that doesn't play well in a swing state.Tillis is another one to watch. I'm sure he's well aware that his seat is vulnerable, that he and Collins are going to be the two biggest targets for Dems in 2026, and that 2026 will likely be a blue year. I'm also sure he noticed how Democrats did very well in North Carolina this past election outside of the presidential results, in spite of the generally red environment.Even if every single other Republican rubber stamped every single bit of Trump's nonsense, I count 5 with your list plus Tillis who are very unlikely to do the same. Considering that those 5 plus others aren't going to agree to killing the filibuster, there's not all that much that can happen. Even if they somehow did nix the filibuster, they can only afford 3 defections on a given vote with Vance as the tiebreaker.We're not in an ideal position, but we're in a *far* better position than we could've been.

Unfortunately you are partially correct. Those in power don't stand to benefit from society losing functionality as they only obtain and retain wealth and influence on the certainty that things remain the way they are, the tried and true methods, inheritance, etc. Should society truly reach a breaking point, they would generally stand to lose the most.For most people debt should not be necessary unless their family has failed/abandoned them, they grew up without one, or they are attempting to live in a city that is too expensive for them or above their means. Though it is true that housing prices, both mortgages and especially rent, are currently outrageous and while I'd love to see them halved, this isn't likely. However they could always improve with time and sufficient public pressure. I make great money and can pay for necessities and even wants many times over but I still have to live with my parents and know I would struggle financially if I wasn't. When something on the market that is as essential as housing isn't even available to many making good money you know there is a problem. Though I do think it will improve with time.Media is incredibly divisive and this is primarily the fault of the consumer. Headlines are insane and divisive because it obtains the attention of the consumer. If not enough people wanted that it wouldn't generate reliable revenue and we would see improvement overnight. So long as we foster a world where individuals understand that they themselves are in bubbles and could always be wrong provided sufficient evidence, we'll be better off for it. Yes we can have a hard time changing our minds but it's good to remember it has always been that way.And yes those with obscene amounts of wealth/influence to improve things fall into the trap of laziness just like anyone else. Laziness that is easier to rest in when the people who could be making demands of them are too busy fighting amongst themselves to be organized enough to accomplish what they want and make specific demands. They also acclimate to their daily lives and want to keep what they have like anyone else. And due to this it's true that we don't see them improving the world like we would all love to see happen. But these things take time, and thankfully don't require us as individuals to waste our time thinking about what we can't change. Speaking of change, all you have to do is seek them out and you will find many things that have changed for the better in just the last 10 years, not to mention over the course of history.
