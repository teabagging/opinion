Since Congress relinquished most of its control in 1962, the president can impose or lift these taxes on imported goods with minimal oversight. This essentially unilateral control provides fertile ground for corruption.During Trumps term in office, he wielded tariffs like a blunt instrument, frequently invoking them to achieve political goals, reward allies and punish adversaries.For example, when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 under the guise of national security, members of **Congress presented evidence that Trump administration officials were more likely to grant exemptions to companies with connections to the Trump family.** **The notable exemptions included a sanctioned Russian metals company with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.**","title":"Eric Trump demonstrates in 30 seconds he doesnt have a clue how tariffs work"},{"text":"We were hopeful.

They of course were given the keys to this election, too, and they turned Walz into Tim Kaine 2.0 while hiding Harris from the press as part of their let Trump beat himself plan. Plouffe claimed Harris was positioned to win all 7 swing states days before this election. In 2016 he claimed it was mathematically impossible for Hillary to lose. Enough.

Across Europe, from the Slavs to the Celts to the peoples of the Mediterranean, those now reductively referred to as white were once excluded from this category. Their gradual inclusion reflects the needs of ruling classes to consolidate power, not any inherent kinship. Human populations in the Eurasian Steppe and beyond lost pigment over millennia due to environmental adaptation, but this biological fact was twisted into a tool of division, creating a racial hierarchy and now disunion where none naturally existed.Hancocks work implicitly critiques constructs like race by focusing on humanitys deep, shared origins and interconnectedness. He highlights how early human migrations and environmental adaptations (such as the loss of skin pigmentation) were natural processes, not markers of inherent division. For Hancock, the story of ancient civilizations is one of unity and shared innovation, challenging the political narratives that later fragmented humanity.By emphasizing the cultural and genetic blending of ancient peoples, Hancock undermines the idea of fixed racial categories. He reveals that artificial divisions like whiteness serve not to reflect biological truths but to reinforce power structures. His work resonates with the understanding that race is a tool of separation, a modern construct imposed on an ancient, deeply interconnected human story.Of course they want to discredit him and his work.","title":"Society for American Archaeology wrote an open letter to Netflix recently, essentially calling Graham Hancock a white supremacist and demanding the show be labeled false.. why does Graham get such vehement pushback?

Same reason two people taking the same dose of shrooms will never experience the same exact trip. I dont know why DMT works like it does, but apparently it does, and I find it quite interesting that so many people seem to encounter similar beings on their trips. As for the last part, its interesting you should say that. I do recall seeing posts on the astral projection subreddit where people claimed to have done exactly what you described. Like someone visiting a friend on their journey and telling them something, and then later on having the person recall what it was somehow. Or having someone write a note for example that you read while projecting, and when you return you read back what was on the note. But honestly, I dont see any of that as *real* evidence. Everything weve discussed so far has just been other peoples experiences that weve read about online. While I do mostly believe astral projection is a real thing, its impossible for me to say without having experienced it for myself. And even then, I could tell my story to a buddy and maybe he wouldnt believe me because I cant prove it.I think it all leads back to me not being able to prove to you that Ive had a dream. I mean, Ive met countless friends in my dreams, but its not like theyll know what I blabbered on about in my dream and vice versa. Until we have experienced it for ourselves, I dont think either of us will ever be fully convinced by other peoples accounts.

What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed, I emphasize, will not be allowed, to threaten the security of Israel again.The neighboring Middle Eastern countries have exchanged fire since October 2023, after Israel launched an expansive retaliatory military campaign in the Gaza Strip in response to a terror attack in Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas.Over the next 60 days, the Lebanese army and state security forces will deploy and take control of their own territory, said Biden. And over the next 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces.Civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities, and begin to rebuild their homes, their schools, their farms, their businesses and their very lives, said the outgoing president.Earlier in the day Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address that he supported the ceasefire deal, which he sent to his Cabinet for approval.The ceasefire allows us to focus on the Iranian threat, said Netanyahu.

They *don't want* a healthy economy.  They want to destroy it so the rich can buy up everything for cheap, squeeze the populus for every last penny they have, and make them work for them for nothing.  Look at COVID and the absolute lack of any real stimulus beyond the single check that people had to fight to get.  Other countries understood that providing a stimulus to the population whom were out of work from COVID would help keep the economy afloat, they instead chose to ignore that and tank the economy by refusing to provide anything and coerce the public to return to work in shit jobs for pennies.  Universal, affordable health insurance would save money for millions as they could then spend the money that one *might* have for medical emergencies, as well as whatever they spend on insurance, in other aspects of the economy.  But they won't do that so they can instead keep shoveling money to insurance agencies and for-profit health systems.  Increasing the minimum wage gives the working class more money to be able to actually spend on things, but they won't do that because it's easier for companies like Walmart to pay pennies, limit hours to avoid benefits, and force their staff to enroll in government programs like Food Stamps that the same companies help collect.  They **KNOW** all of these things, hence why Republicans refuse to actual do them and demonize them so their base keeps voting them in.  Because they actively do not want them coming through so that they can help the rich get even richer.  Of course, there's also a breaking point that they actively ignore, which we've in fact seen.  The previously mentioned lack of stimulus didn't work as people refused to return to low paying positions during COVID and resulted in a number of businesses tanking or outright closing because, shockingly, when people can't afford things during a pandemic they aren't going to spend on it.  American's quality of health in general is horrible compared to much of the rest of the world, because people flat out refuse to visit a doctor when they should due to cost, only going in an absolute emergency (which in turn also impacts productivity as a unhealthy workforce is less productive than a healthy one).  As previously mentioned people got fed up from constant low wages, especially as it was made worse during COVID, and we have long seen industries and businesses suffer as a result, with, again, COVID providing even more impact or an outright kick over the edge as people tightened their wallets.  Many of course attempted to rectify it by increasing prices and reducing quantity or quality while blaming \\"inflation\\", but there are still large companies still feeling the shocks because it's just a bandage fix to a problem they created and had backfire on them.  As for it backfiring even more, frankly with the 2024 election showing how absolutely moronic and gullible a large portion of the population is, even outside the cult of Trump crowd, it's not going to backfire the way you think.  There will be many buying into it being anything else than the people they helped prop up and will eagerly take the crumbs they give and think nothing else.

The cure is still modifying your food environment, practicing portion control, and choosing nutrient rich foods (especially fiber for fullness). It's great we have these drugs.

And its hard to pay for that when people keep electing Republicans.  Thus, my initial point that there needs to be a consideration of the long term and incentivizing the keeping the weight off piece as well.  That would reduce the number of folks on these forever and would help costs in terms of Medicare and Medicaid (both in terms of Rx costs and long term health of patients).

After his death, possible successors to continue the cult emerged like Leonid Brezhnev, Nikita Khrushchev, Lavrenity Beria, Georgy Malenkov, and Nikolai Bulganin. However, all lacked the strength and charisma to continue it. The Communist Party also went into big infighting over what the path forward should be. Khrushchev eventually denounced Stalin and his cult some time later and began to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union.Vance likely lacks the power to continue MAGA, and when the day comes that Trump is gone, we will inevitably see huge fighting within the Republican Party between McCain and Romney-like Republicans and the more right-wing factions of the party.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 26, 2024"},{"text":"People *did* vote for his children this time though.

We should increase the amount of ways that common people are included in government. Big decisions on policy measures or constitutional changes should be decided by assemblies selected by sortition (random selection, like juries). The problems that are creating demagogues is that people feel alienated from experts and the elites and are being asked to make decisions with limited information in a very tribal system of politics. Sortition assemblies have the advantage of slowing the process down. They pull experiences from all of society rather than the class of people typically represented in elected assemblies. Sortition assemblies can work through problems, talk to experts themselves, and form an opinion that's broadly acceptable to a wider group of people. The positions that these assemblies take are harder to smear as merely partisan. And in general, they work and make good evidence-based decisions. Citizens Assemblies have been tried in many places and their recommendations tend to be more informed by evidence and less by raw political calculation than elected assemblies.","title":"CMV: Instead of democracy, we should have a form of government where only candidates with the best ability are able to become leaders"},{"text":"Its their fault for getting educated.Learning about history, the losing and building of freedom, and critical thinking and stuff.","title":"Trump team eyes quick rollback of Biden student debt relief"},{"text":"Help himself and rich buddies that kiss his ass.

Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?Sen. Van Hollen: \\nI think there are things that can be done, and I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7 of last year and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the President had effectively used US leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely, and then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months, the President will finally make more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law, to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza and they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.Margaret Brennan:  \\nSo you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding, US law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the **State Department is reviewing 500 incidents where US weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm**. The State Department has said Israel is doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?Sen. Van Hollen: \\nI'm suggesting that the President of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500 as you said. And we haven't gotten the bottom of those.Margaret Brennan: \\nWhy?Sen. Van Hollen: \\nBecause the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process, because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen US weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM-20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that US weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.? News article regarding those 500 incidents.:US identified 500 cases where its weapons harmed Gaza civilians but hasnt taken action | Some of the incidents might have violated international humanitarian law, according to the sources \\n[The Guardian]\\n(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/civilian-harm-us-weapons-israel-gaza-war)PS: He is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.","title":"Sen.

It's an outcome of the system of contributing factors encouraging obesity. If you want to change the outcome, you have to actually change those contributing factors. We have to think of this problem structurally, and look for an actual solution. At this scale, it's a game theory problem, it's about incentives and reward structures.We're not going to suddenly put people back on subsistence semi-starvation diets where they *can't* find excess calories. We live in a post-calorie-scarcity world in the US. Regulation of extremely processed foods can help mitigate the issue, but not to the degree we need and not without immense resistance to the regulatory changes it would require.We're also not going to go back to an undeveloped economy where we're forced to burn substantially more calories in manual labor. We live in an industrialized world and that is also not changing.The simplest solution to change the structure of this system at scale is to change the reward mechanism that causes overeating in the first place. In the case of ozempic, by mimicking satiety signaling hormones and telling the body it is not hungry.That's also the most effective method to make an undesired behavior (such as overeating) extinct in behavioral psychology: you remove the reward.","title":"Biden proposes Medicare and Medicaid cover costly weight-loss drugs for millions of obese Americans"},{"text":"These drugs have been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular disease and diabetes starting very soon after initiating treatment.

I'm not going to look it up now, but those disappeared several Farm Bills ago. They aren't needed, and production based farm subsidies are not WTO compliant. The U.S., as a major food exporter and historically by far the largest corn exporter, has long been the champion of eliminating artificial barriers to agricultural products internationally.What does remain is the blending mandate on gasoline. The oil companies HATE ethanol because it eats into their market share, and the oil companies control refining and distribution. They would freeze out ethanol entirely if they could.Ethanol in the U.S. historically was a regional niche product, beloved in the corn belt but without great appeal elsewhere. That changed after the First Gulf War. OPEC was rocked back and oil prices cratered to $12 a barrel. That was one of the underlying reasons for the economic boom of that era. (Desktop computing and the internet were bigger factors; they are huge productivity boosters in every sector. Well, almost every sector; maybe not strip clubs and bowling alleys.)With rapid global economic growth -- which incidentally lifted a couple of billion people out of poverty -- oil began an inexorable upward march, reaching $150 a barrel. At some point in the range of $60-80 a barrel, ethanol became cost competitive without subsidy and the U.S. ethanol industry boomed. In the long economic expansion, the U.S. weathered the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash and the bursting of the real estate bubble, but those were temporary factors. It was really fracking that brought oil prices back down to a more sustainable level.The expansion of the U.S. ethanol complex, btw, was supported by new production driven by improved yields due to precision agriculture and seed tech. The U.S. built out a huge ethanol production capacity without shorting food, feed or export markets one bushel of corn. The direct ethanol subsidies were withdrawn. The blending mandate was imposed to prevent the oil companies from embargoing a new competitor.Row crops, including corn, are not directly subsidized in the U.S. What does still exist is federal crop insurance, but we should note that Congress did not enact crop insurance to protect the big farmers or agribusiness companies, which are fully capable of self-insuring. Subsidized crop insurance was provided as a hedge to the hard-pressed small farmers -- the guys who own 185 acres, farm on evenings and weekends, use second hand equipment, and earn most of their income from their jobs in town. These guys can be wiped out by spring flooding, a hailstorm, or an untimely freeze. The economic pressures in U.S. agriculture have been \\"get big or die\\" since the 1950's. The small farmers are being squeezed relentlessly. Compete with the guys who are farming 2-5,000 acres, who lease a new combine every three years, and are all in on precision agriculture? Dream on. If you want the big fish to finish swallowing the little fish, eliminate crop insurance.And none of that has anything to do with fructose. Want to reduce the use of high fructose corn syrup? Easy. The U.S. has eliminated direct support and quotas for most commodities and for row crops particularly, but ag is complicated and a handful of exceptions still exist. Dairy is a big one, because picturesque small farmers in Vermont can't compete with Iowa and Nebraska. Sugar import quotas are another. Get rid of those, U.S. sugar producers would go out of business, and we would import much cheaper foreign sugar.Americans would still consume too many calories, but we would get fewer of them from corn syrup.","title":"Oh, Oh, Oh, Ozempic"},{"text":"I think the idea of charisma is sometimes applied retroactively to an extent.

You know how we have had a decade of kids arguing against that point? Well this is where we end up. Every single piece of information you read (yes even this comment, and yes even that blog youre thinking of) is biased. Bias is an intrinsic part of being a human. That's why teachers told us to use Wikipedia as a starting point for our research, it does a good job of introducing you to the terms you'll need and maybe can give you some links to jump off of. Wikipedia itself is not a reliable source. In any capacity.Also, you mentioned that there are bots controlling edits? That's actually a thing the Wikipedia foundation [talks about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) a lot! There are bots that the Wikipedia foundation hosts, there are APIs for businesses and individuals to make bots, and when you edit enough articles you get [very powerful tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools/Editing_tools) to make it easier to edit things. Thats how people can end up with [millions of edits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits/1%E2%80%931000).

Rooted in the belief that cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations would stimulate investment and create broad prosperity, it has instead exacerbated inequality, hollowed out the middle class, and concentrated wealth in the hands of the few. As a nation, it is time to acknowledge this failure and pivot toward a progressive economic framework that ensures opportunity and dignity for all Americans.The Failures of Trickle-Down Economics1. Widening Inequality\\nOver the past 40 years, the gap between the richest and poorest Americans has grown exponentially. Tax cuts favoring the wealthy have led to an economy where 1% of the population controls nearly 40% of the nations wealth. Meanwhile, wages for working- and middle-class families have stagnated.\\n2. Weak Job Creation\\nContrary to the promise of trickle-down policies, corporations often use tax breaks and incentives for stock buybacks or executive bonuses instead of reinvesting in jobs or infrastructure. This has left many Americans in precarious employment situations.\\n3. Underfunded Public Services\\nTax cuts for the wealthy have drained federal and state revenues, leading to underfunded schools, healthcare systems, and infrastructure. This lack of investment erodes the foundational structures necessary for a thriving, equitable society.\\n4. Economic Instability\\nWealth concentration contributes to economic instability, as consumer spendingfueled by the middle and lower classesdrives the majority of economic growth. Without robust purchasing power in these groups, recessions become more frequent and severe.Turning Toward Progress\\nTo create a future where prosperity is shared, we must replace the failed trickle-down model with a bottom-up, middle-out approach that prioritizes equitable growth and long-term investment.1. Progressive Tax ReformImplement higher marginal tax rates on top earners to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.Close corporate tax loopholes and introduce a minimum tax for large corporations.Reinstate estate taxes on ultra-wealthy inheritances to combat intergenerational wealth hoarding.2. Invest in Public GoodsRebuild Americas infrastructure, focusing on clean energy, broadband access, and sustainable transportation.Fully fund public education, including universal pre-K and affordable college options.Expand access to healthcare through programs like Medicare for All or a robust public option.3. Empower WorkersStrengthen labor laws to protect the right to unionize and bargain collectively.Raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage tied to inflation.Provide paid family leave, affordable childcare, and other workplace protections.4. Encourage Inclusive GrowthCreate targeted investments in historically underserved communities, particularly Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color.Foster small businesses through grants, low-interest loans, and technical support.Promote innovation through federal research and development programs.5. Adopt Green Economic PoliciesTransition to renewable energy sources to combat climate change while creating millions of green jobs.Provide job training for workers displaced by the decline of fossil fuel industries.Incentivize sustainable practices in agriculture and manufacturing.\\nTrickle-down economics has failed to deliver its promises of prosperity for all. Instead, it has deepened inequality, weakened our economic foundations, and left millions of Americans struggling. By embracing a progressive economic framework, we can create a society that prioritizes shared growth, economic justice, and sustainable prosperity. It is time for America to move forward with bold action and a renewed commitment to the common good.","title":"Reaganomics: its not working"},{"text":"And that lady in charge of Mexico thinks Mexico can better withstand tariffs lol","title":"BREAKING: Trudeau Folds to Trumps Tariff Demands in Under 24 Hours C He Has the Face of a Beaten Man (Video)"},{"text":"Similarly, when the Republicans started advertising based on trans surgeries for prisoners, the campaign should have been realistic about the fact that many voters want their taxes to fund zero elective surgeries for prisoners.

Telling women \\"you are right to be afraid of men and avoid them because they're (all/mostly) dangerous\\" *is* wrong. It's like the man vs bear example: rationally speaking, if you told me I was going to be 5 feet away from a random man or a random bear in the middle of the wilderness, of *course* I ought to choose the random man, because almost all men would be perfectly safe to encounter in the wilderness, whereas a random bear has a nontrivial probability of attacking you in that situation. Any person/politician who says the bear is the safer choice is doing something wrong.At the same time, I *don't* think it's \\"bigoted\\" to \\"take precautions around men\\". NOT because all men are dangerous, but because a small portion of men are dangerous, and it's OK to be a bit cautious.I've had *many* female friends who have a story about a man approaching them and giving off super-creepy vibes. E.g., my girlfriend has multiple times had a guy follow her in a car while she was jogging. Just... follow her, going at her speed for a few blocks, until she found a way to \\"get away\\" / get to a place with other cars. I've never had that happen to me, and I can't really imagine it happening to me - but if that was something that had happened to me a couple times, I'd be a bit more cautious walking around by myself.I think whether caution like this is bigoted depends on your reasoning and your level of caution.I think it's *always* bigoted to turn away customers of a \\"public accommodation\\" (a business/service open to the public) because of their race, gender, etc. Part of running that kind of business is agreeing to work with everyone. E.g., an Uber driver only picking up women, or refusing to pick up black people, would be wrong.I think it's *not* always bigoted for a woman to cross the street when a big, burly man is coming her way on a dark night. After all, while almost all big, burly men are lovely people, a small fraction are not - and being big and burly, the tiny fraction who *are* dangerous would be able to overpower a woman who got too close to them. If it were *always* bigoted to cross the street in this situation, then wouldn't we be telling women that they have to frequently get very close to strange men on a dark night, even though a small fraction of men harass or assault women, and wouldn't this lead to women occasionally being assaulted when they could have avoided it?That said, it *can* be bigoted to cross the street in this case, if the woman's decision-making is based on bigoted beliefs (e.g., \\"all men are pigs / monsters\\").Edit to add: it'd also be either bigoted or simply rude/hurtful for a woman to ostentatiously cross the street, glaring fearfully at the approaching man. Obviously she should look out for herself first, but she should be aware that he's almost certainly a lovely person and should be mindful of his experience, too.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Thats the only time the left cares about dead kids.

In simple terms, they trick your brain into thinking you've already eaten recently so that you won't be hungry. They do this by mimicking the chemical (GLP-1) your stomach uses to tell your brain you ate. Your endocrine system then releases insulin, and won't release glucagon (a chemical that increases your blood sugar), so your blood sugar is lower. Your stomach will also digest food more slowly. All of this adds up to lower blood sugar (good for diabetics) and eating less. Practically speaking, when you take Ozempic, your appetite significantly shrinks. You get hungry less often and you can't eat as much when you do eat. Your tastes and cravings may also change: many people on Ozempic can no longer tolerate highly fatty, sweet or processed foods.Obviously this doesn't come without risks and side effects, but it's well tolerated for most people and can even have positive side effects like reducing problem drinking and improving cardiovascular health.

Can't get clean and fresh with water pouring out of the pipes before the shower head!We, the People, can make a difference.  A.I. hasn't dominated every facet of making and selling things . . . yet.I'll focus, for the sake of brevity, on one aspect.  Unions.Most labor unions were compromised and corrupted for a very long time, and no longer truly work for the benefit of the represented employee, under it's idealistic design of 100+ years ago.Yet, they do still have potential power, if forced by their membership to properly utilize it.The Teamsters were forced to listen to their membership and hold off on making a POTUS candidate endorsement, which goes completely against their standard operating procedure these days.  They've grown political, using membership dues for influence in government, rather than forcing prudent corporate governance.  The proverbial cutting out the copper before the showerhead.If you look into the history of the labor union, it began with \\"locals\\" being just that.  Local.  Like, within a specific company, and within a specific shop within that company, some workers represented the group to management, knowing the needs of their co-workers from practical experience.Fast forward to today, and you can go to college and get a degree in Union Management, never be in that craft, yet speaking for the worker that is.  This is a flaw.  But, it can be corrected.  Once people become informed as to how bastardized their paid-for power is with union representation, they can work to make changes on the short term that place a union in a position to help protect that copper piping and keep the shower head running.  The union is more nimble in their ability to be a voice for positive change than the behemoth corporation, or the super-behemoth government.   The unionized worker has great power, if they return the power to themselves.But, in many facets beyond just unions, we're going to have to prepare for some pain to reap the reward.  On a personal note, I was doing some home remodeling.  In that process, I spilled blood and sweat and tears.  But, the sweetness of the reward of finishing it was enhanced by my very own \\"skin\\" in my very own \\"game\\".  The project took much longer than expected.  However, for better, or worse, I don't have a nagging wife harping on me to finish it quicker.  I'm confident that if I did, it would have been finished faster, with the same amount or more of blood, sweat and tears that accompanied.  A Union has the ability to be the corporations nagging wife.","title":"Tariffs and slave labor"},{"text":"Protest voting is performance art for narcissists who want to virtue signal but don't actually care about the people or values they profess to.","title":"Eric Trump demonstrates in 30 seconds he doesnt have a clue how tariffs work"},{"text":"This is true here.

There are actually two separate codes provided by two separate parties. You would consider one party good and one party bad. I don't place those labels, because I don't find them necessary or accurate.Both codes serve the same purpose- to provide information to the public. The codes are not a secret language that the issuing entities use to communicate to each other. Both issuing entities are fully telepathic. Any major event that is planned to happen in our reality by any party with power to control the reality is required by the hard coded laws of this world to disclose those plans in advance. There is no getting around this rule. However, disclosure does not have to be straightforward. It can be hidden in plain sight, and the party you would consider bad has created so many distractions that it is virtually impossible for most people to see the code, let alone crack it.The codes themselves are largely irrelevant. Cracking them does not really help you. Until you master your own self, you cannot do anything to stop or change planned events. What it is important to focus on is your own personal growth.

Although Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are expected to dominate the market for the time being, challengers are racing to develop alternatives, forcing the duo to continue innovating. Citeline, a research firm, estimates that more than 300 drug candidates are in the works, plenty of which are expected to arrive in the next few years.As for the rest, it's a fair point, but I just looked up the retention rate and things are not as dire here either:  [Many Patients Who Stop Weight Loss Drug Keep Pounds Off: Study](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240124/many-patients-who-stop-weight-loss-drugs-keep-pounds-off-study)Among the 17,733 people in the study who were prescribed liraglutide and lost at least 5 pounds, about 19% regained all or more of the weight they lost in the year after stopping the drug. But the new Epic study also showed that 56% of people either remained around the same weight they were at when stopping the medication or continued to lose additional weight, the authors wrote. The researchers did not publish an exact figure of how many people maintained their weight loss of 5 pounds of more during the 12 months after stopping the drug, but they did report that more than 1 in 3 people in the study lost at least another pound during that year, and 19% of the people more than doubled their weight loss.If these numbers are anything to go by, the vast majority of the users wouldn't need a repeat treatment for many years, if not decades.","title":"Biden proposes Medicare and Medicaid cover costly weight-loss drugs for millions of obese Americans"},{"text":"If they have a left-wing or center source say in a sentence somewhere off site that something is right-wing then it is sourced to the first sentence because _nothing with political bias can be used as a source on Wikipedia_.

You're looking for individual promises made by candidates during a short campaign vs the overall ideologies (or at least perceived ideologies) of the two parties. The left has, for a long while now, been hyper-focused on identity politics. Everything is seemingly broken down into who should be considered an oppressed class and who should be an oppressor class. Race, class, and sex. And the bad guys, in most of the breakdowns, are men. Unless it's a question just of race, in which case minority men and women would be the oppressed and white men and women would be the oppressors. But even in those cases, there's \\"intersectionality\\" where minority women can be oppressed by the intersecting oppressors of both whites and men.The whole idea of toxic masculinity is from the left and, while not against all men, does give the lingering impression that its message is basically \\"all men are trained to be toxic by society.\\" But most, if not all, of the characteristics that are considered \\"toxically masculine\\" are actually not at all gender specific. So on one hand you have a \\"men are bad\\" message, then on the other hand, the left promotes quite vigorously the idea that there's no such thing as the \\"gender binary.\\" People are not born one gender, they're just assigned one at birth. So the message young men hear from the leftand I'm not saying this is the accurate message, just their perceptionis that men are mostly bad, but also not really an actual thing, unless we need to point out how they're running everything and getting paid more than women and dangerous, in which case they're a thing that's bad.I don't think there's a lot of messaging coming out of the left, for a long while, that's particularly inviting to men. I wouldn't go so far as to call it misandrist, but I think it can be seen that way. Especially online. I can imagine a lot of leftists on reddit responding to this argument I'm making in this post by simply calling the men I'm talking about a bunch of incels instead of actually engaging with the content of the argument.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"The dumbest family in America.

These people are absolutely conditioned to resist *anything and everything* associated with Democrats no matter what. There's an extreme saturation of right-wing media that immediately and constantly attacks anything on the Democrats agenda and doesn't mind resorting to obvious lies to do so knowing a good percentage of the population will believe it. It's obvious Biden winning in 2020 was an anomaly. People don't really want peace. They don't want equality. They don't want healthcare. They don't want women's rights. They don't want low grocery prices. They don't want low gas prices. Because every time they've had a chance to vote for all that they decided to vote the guys who will do the opposite of all of that. They voted the guy who attacks liberals and Democrats. They voted the guy who attacks minorities. They voted the guy who cheats to win, doesn't respect the constitution, encourages corruption within the federal government. The common blue collar voter picked the east coast elite billionaire to lead the country.

And we now see those people make up over 50% of voters in the nation and likely a good part of the non-voters. This is the United States we now live in.

They are mainly a tool in the toolbox of negotiations for long term trade deals.We have been corporate captured as far back as POTUS Nixon, where trade deals did not favor the USA citizenry, but, benefited corporations and the citizenry of other countries.  If you look into when mom had to enter the workforce in the early 1970's, as heavy industry was shipped overseas and the imbalances began in earnest, you saw entire towns and entire industries devastated by the loss of good paying jobs and plant closures.  Dads were not only jobless, but, without a career at all with the loss of an entire industry.Using OP's example of the steel industry, the US used to be the most major miner of ore and producer of finished steel.  That number is way down now, in comparison.  Although China is one of the major producers, they are not as big a producer as Australia.  So, to implement tariffs on Chinese steel vs. Australian steel with no tariffs, the supply chain could adjust to continue to provide for our needs at reasonable price-points as we re-tool, re-start and ramp up our former best industry.I would have to trust, at the onset, the manner tariffs are implemented and applied under the Trump administration, and I'm willing to give benefit of the doubt, for now, that they aren't going to ruin the US in the process.  But, my amateur ass is watching, and learning, and ready to shout out objection and protest if there's no good explanation of things going more sideways than they are today.

Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), legislators wrote that the simple descheduling of marijuana will not end federal criminalization, resolve its harms, or meaningfully address the gap between federal and state cannabis policy. Possession and use of recreational marijuana  and much state-legal medical marijuana   will continue to be a violation of federal law.The letter was signed by six other Senators, and six members of the House. The signatories include Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), as well as Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).President Joe Biden issued several rounds of pardons to individuals convicted of marijuana possession and other non-violent drug offenses throughout his administration. Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Criminal records for marijuana possession have also imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities, Biden said in 2022 after the wave of pardons.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dems-biden-decriminalize-weed-trump-1235181464/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dems-biden-decriminalize-weed-trump-1235181464/)","title":"Dems Call on Biden to Limit Weed Prosecutions Before Trump Takes Over"},{"text":"A bit late,but in the long run it would be cost effective, especially if they can get it to go generic.

He won men by 11% in 2016, and he won then by 12% in 2024.The big story of 2024 is that Trump won big with women. Democrats used to win women by 13%, but now are only winning by 8%. They lost 5% of women in 8 years.Democrats don't need to win back the votes of men. They need to win back the votes of men and women. They held one of the most important cards about bodily autonomy in this election, and women turned away from them in droves.It's also not all men and women that Democrats are losing. They're losing minority men and women and they're losing people who are less educated. Trump actually did worse with white men and women in 2024 than he did in 2016!So the story is not Democrats need to win back men. The story is, Democrats need to win back men and women who are black and latino and people who are less educated.

Just like a 'republic' is supposed to be 2/3 needed to win. While you could argue that not getting a primary wasn't giving the people the chance to choose, those within the DNC did vote. Behind closed doors. And they picked who won. No where in a democracy does it say we, the people get to be the ones who vote and get 50.1% victory.

I *don't* think it's necessarily bigotry for a woman to only accept rides from female Uber drivers - putting yourself in a car with someone gives them a ton of power over you, so a woman who's been sexually assaulted by a man (for example) might feel extremely anxious getting in a car driven by a strange man, or entering an elevator alone with a man. Now, this may not be an entirely rational fear - but then, the woman isn't preventing the man from using the elevator or driving the car, nor is she (necessarily) saying that the man is dangerous or evil or worse than a woman. She might be saying, I like men plenty and think they should totally take the elevator and drive for Uber, it's just that my anxiety spikes when I'm alone with a strange man due to past experiences.Rather than expand the definition of bigotry, I'd rather contract it slightly. So, e.g., if someone votes for Trump due to his economic message, some Democrats view this as misogynist since Trump has sexually assaulted women (\\"you must not care about women since you voted for this guy who's hurt women\\"), but I don't think this should be seen as misogyny. Or, if a white person accidentally says a racial slur (e.g., I think I read about a city council member who was invited to participate in a class discussion about race, and they were asked a question about the word and used it while saying it was a wrong word to use, then apologized), this should not be seen as proof that the person is racist.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":" I saw an article about how she didn't really seem to want to be president.

Changing habits and not relying on a drug is the happy path.  I guess the conflict I have is that obesity is such a huge health problem, and very difficult for a lot of people to control.  Maybe the answer is a little bit of both approaches here.  For example, people struggle with smoking addiction and changing/quitting their habits, and the future health impact is immense (increased cancer risk, respiratory issues, etc).  Offering a medicine that can help make people quit, helps reduce the number of smokers and reduces those kinds of negative outcomes.  Couple that with policies that have also slowly been introduced (public smoking bans, banning smoking in restaurants and bars, etc) help to solidify that reduction for future generations.  I don't see why the same approach couldn't work for obesity.  Get people struggling with \\"food addiction\\"--or whatever you want to call it--off of food (eating too much of it), immediately.  Gradually introduce legislation that'll help guide future generations into better habits.","title":"Biden Proposes Medicare and Medicaid Coverage of Obesity Drugs"},{"text":"That's EXACTLY right.

Its why no one stood a chance against Trump in republican primaries. The ?left in huge numbers fails to understand that their home, due to the two party system, can only be Democratic Party and that they have to influence and pressure it from the inside. Its something essential that Bernie understood and did after 2016 and 2020 - getting really a lot of his platform positioned inside the dems. However, due to whatever reasons (and there are plenty), left leaning people opposed the democrats to force them to whatever policy outcomes they preferred from the outside, while the centrist remained. They pushed to the center and embraced neocons like Cheney, because their was no strong enough inside opposition. So in part, its not just democrats or the campaign that is to be blamed.

I think that's BS of course.  There are so many obesity related negative health outcomes that will eventually hit things that insurance does cover, probably at great expense (diabetes, high blood pressure, whatever).  At a certain point, I suspect that insurances will find that treating obesity with a med like this will reap savings in the long run for them.  Heck, once the patent expires, I bet it'd happen overnight.This is of course all opinion and speculation.

This comment really highlights the disconnect that the Democratic party has and what /u/WannbeInFlatable is talking about in his original post.  The idea that gender inequality can *only* be addressed by uplifting women and/or dragging down men is, in the opinion of many people - men and women - incorrect.I voted for Kamala.  I voted for the abortion amendment in my state.  I would never vote for Trump or any MAGA-sympathizing politician.  But I can still recognize that in the United States, men have some advantages in some areas and women have some advantages in other areas.  Overall, it's probably pretty close to equal.So by continuing to adopt policies that advantage women and/or disadvantage men, we are no longer eliminating inequality, **we are creating inequality**.  We need to start ignoring demographics, and just start adopting policies that advantage as many people as possible and disadvantage as few of people as possible - regardless of the demographics of those people.So long as Democratic leaders continue to genuinely believe that, overall, men are advantaged in the United States and women are disadvantaged, they will continue to lose more and more voters who disagree with that premise.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"You know the series producers used the thinfoil stuff material to base the series on and not otherwise dont you?

These drugs make things easier because they chemically change your body in ways that reduce your likelihood of overeating to the extent that it increases your weight substantially.  They are wonderful.But theyre a band aid.  Obesity is not always a lifelong issue.  Its not necessarily easy to manage (income, location, etc. play roles in access to the quality of foods you can get).  But a lifelong drug to stop overeating is a hard sell imho given the high costs.  Drug companies are psyched because you must stay on these drugs forever, or make substantial lifestyle changes.  And most people will not try and make the lifestyle changes.  I think incentivizing people to make the lifestyle changes after a year or two on these is the right approach.  A limited time of coverage so that you can lose enough weight to get more active and adjust your diet.  Do that over a year or two, then coverage decreases, or is phases out (only for specifically the obesity piece, not the Type II diabetes coverage for these).  People who really need the enablement benefit get that.  People who just want an easy way out are greatly reduced in leaning on expensive drugs.

I believe it is (a), but it is often messaged as (b) - especially by supporters of the Democratic party.  And that messaging is often subtle, such as the comment I'm responding to.I agree with the OP that if the leaders of the Democratic party did the bare minimum to support men and distance themselves from the male-bashing, they could easily sway 5%-10% of men (especially young men) who weren't enthusiastic about Trump, but were offered nothing by the Democrats.In my opinion, Dems already have a bit of a monopoly on the \\"bigotry is bad\\" message.  All they need to do is to expand that and say, out loud, \\"bigotry is bad, and that includes bigotry against men\\".  Like just add that to the party platform and mention it occasionally.And then have the party leaders just kind of live that.  Start telling people that if they treat men differently than women because of his gender, that's bigotry, and that's wrong.  That if you wait for the next elevator because you fear sharing one with a man (but not a woman), that's bigotry, and that's wrong.  That if only accept rides from female Uber drivers, that's bigotry, and that's wrong.Instead, Democratic party leadership has spent years - perhaps decades - perpetuating the \\"it's men's fault\\" bigotry like [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htGmvHKcCNY) of U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) telling men they need to \\"shut up and step up\\" because it is someone their fault that Brett Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted someone in college.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"... this is a republican president destroying the economy bud, not leftists.

Specifically I feel this is going to be an \\"attack\\" on not just the \\"no child left behind\\" rhetoric of most public schools, but also holding the teachers accountable for their performance. Ultimately this will also go into not just public schools, but also take a jab at colleges that provide little to no substance in terms of degrees and tack on unnecessary classes for degrees.On overhaul on education would make the jobs out there like construction, manufacturing, stem related, and yes, the jobs most people see as \\"deplorable\\" actually get more interest. Which honestly I still do not comprehend why people see them as deplorable as many jobs in those fields are paying record highs due to lack of workers and at minimum only a high school diploma is needed and most of the companies pay for additional schooling for short classes that last at a minimum a few months and up to 2 years. After that pay is 75-125k in most cases. The current model focuses on kids going to college for degrees they're statistically likely to never use, but they're still responsible for that debt incurred. Yes, 4 years is hardly enough time to end this malicious cycle of colleges scamming young adults for worthless pieces of paper, but a lot can be done to fix the broken education system we have currently at the root of it by overhauling everything and cutting the wasteful spending and bad teachers that focus more on gender and critical race theory instead of math, history, and other subjects that sadly most young adults today have limited knowledge on.","title":"thoughts?"},{"text":"So...how bout them egg/milk prices??","title":"trump is now starting a tarrif war with Canada and Mexico"},{"text":"Yes - and they shouldnt.","title":"This is how democracy dies"},{"text":"Yeah, I'm not really sure either.

Before Trump begins implementing tariffs carte blanche against countries, hes going to use the threat of tariffs to put pressure on those countries. The goal is force countries where we have serious trade imbalances to resolve said imbalances and deficits. Whether that is by renegotiating awfully one sided trade agreements, forcing other countries to reduce their tariffs against us, coercing those countries to pledge an increase of imports from the US, or coercing them into moving some operations on US soil. Now the only other scenario where tariffs will be used as coercion will be with Mexico to force them to get migrant caravans in check. Right now they know the caravans come through their country, they know cartels are smuggling people, and they turn a blind eye to it because its not their problem. They just allow them to pass through their country with impunity because they are on the way here. Trump is telling them, either you crack down on that and help us here, or the hammer is dropping. Its all leverage, the art of the deal type stuff. Anyone who says, Tariffs are a tax on the consumer, dont run the full exercise. Universal tariffs likely would be since now all imports would cost X% more to bring in country. But what people neglect is when tariffs hurt economies of other countries, they look to circumvent those tariffs. The easiest way to do that is to stand up operations inside the country so they still receive the business but dont have to pay the import tax. Think what Japan did building multiple Toyota factories in the US. US labor is not much more expensive than Japanese labor, so that leads to a negligible increase in product price, and promotes job growth in the country.","title":"thoughts?"},{"text":"They should just allow the Republicans to run amok for the next four years thereby assuring they'll create such an economic catastrophe they won't win again for 50 years.","title":"Mary Trump urges Democrats to \\"fight back\\" against GOP's total control"},{"text":"I'm not even going to speculate on that.

The Department of Transportation has authorised $3.4bn in grants for passenger rail, road safety and port expansion projects.As Inauguration Day draws nearer, this burst of activity will continue. The United States Senate, currently controlled 51-49 by the Democrats, will attempt to confirm the nominations of as many federal judges as possible, to see them safely ensconced on the bench before Trump takes the oath of office.Civil liberties group the ACLU has also urged Biden to halt any expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, commute the sentences of prisoners on death row to life imprisonment and consider some 8,000 petitions for clemency from other prisoners.There is a limit, however, to how far Biden can make any changes irreversible. Trump, just as in January 2017, is likely to arrive in the Oval Office primed to issue a blizzard of executive orders under Article Two of the US Constitution, to carry out as much policy without congressional approval or legislation as possible. But all of this activity raises a more profound issue.No one seriously contests the validity of the outcome of this months presidential election. A small margin in the popular vote was magnified by the quirks of the Electoral College, but Trump defeated Vice-President Kamala Harris clearly if not emphatically. Like it or not, he will be a legitimate president and he has never hidden his intentions from the voters. So it is possible to understand, at least, the unhappy accusations of some Republicans that Biden is engaged in last-gasp sabotage.There is still a significant section of the Democratic Party that believes Harris should have won the election, that because of her obvious virtue she deserved victory. For them, no popular mandate can redeem Trumps monstrousness.And it is because of this revulsion that, in practical terms, all of this Trump-proofing will prove self-defeating. President Trump 2.0 is a fact of life. If the Democrats are to have any hope of a speedy recovery and a realistic chance of recapturing the White House in 2028, they will first have to understand and analyse the reasons they lost unexpectedly in 2024.

This transition period between presidents can feel alien to British observers: we are used to a new prime minister walking triumphantly up Downing Street the morning after a general election, ready to take possession of No 10 and begin appointing ministers.For the incoming president, the transition period is increasingly seen as a critical time for preparation, ensuring that the new administration is already at full speed come January. For the outgoing president, the transition inevitably has a very different atmosphere.Only two men C Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump himself C have left the White House and then returned after an interval, so a departing chief executive is usually all but certain that his political career is over. Biden is 82 years old, but Bill Clinton was only 54 and Theodore Roosevelt 50. This transition period is often thought of as the lame duck period, when a president is, to use Norman Lamonts phrase, in office but not in power.President Biden has not entirely conformed to stereotype. Despite his age and the fact that he abruptly stepped aside from his partys nomination in July because of seeming cognitive decline, there has been a sudden crackle of electricity. The popular perception is that the re-election of Donald Trump has been so shocking and offensive to the Democratic Party that Biden has suddenly resolved not to go gentle into that good night.Instead, he has set about Trump-proofing his political legacy.

They run on the status quo economic policy, and all of the social issue stuff comes across as pandering and virtue signaling. Yes, Trumps narrative is horrible, but at least he actually has a narrative that people resonate with. The democrats dont have a single narrative to actually get people excited to vote, this is coupled with those same clintonite consultants refusing to utilize independent media on the internet. The right wing has effectively utilized populism and social media to control and dominate the narrative.

Full stop. I'm not talking about individual accountability. I'm talking about groups of people. Imagine for a second that you are a doctor who sees diabetic patients. Every patient  gets roughly the same diet advice.  Lose weight, control your carb intake avoid processed sugars. Most offer documentation for a lot more specific steps or referrals to nutritionist for patients who ask. Do you know what the compliance rate for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes is for diet recommendations from their doctors? It's about 37%.  Two out of three patients, *who actually have diabetes* fail to follow physician recommendations and typically end up making their diabetes worse.   These people typically end up in worse condition and end up costing the medical system billions of dollars and more intensive treatments to solve the symptoms of the underlying disease.Your solution is doubling down and telling them that they should stop eating shitty food, which we've already established does not work.","title":"Biden Proposes Medicare and Medicaid Coverage of Obesity Drugs"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 3:  **Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view, or of arguing in bad faith**.

Taxes is the big one. They dont pay their 'fair share' and it places stresses on local government services which become quickly underfunded for the population; additional stress on housing, public transport and infrastructure. This is without including detention centres, deportation and the justice system trying to pick up the slack. Further to this some states even pay welfare to illegal immigrants. Its easy to see hidden costs quickly add up.But doesn't the US need the cheap immigrant labour? No, what you need is costs to accurately reflect their inputs and everyone to pay their fair share (unlikely in the US I know). Prices will adjust and the market will take a shock as real input labour prices adjust. Industries relying on black market labour will be heavily audited once Trump gets in office and I think many family farms and construction companies will go under due to these changes. It will depend on the domestic producer policies they initiate in conjunction with the deportation policy.I think Trump is moving to a immigration policy more similar to Australia's. The only people who come in are skilled labourers in demand or seasonal workers who are only here for the work season, mainly picking fruit, then they go home. We do accept political refugees but they must be legitimate and enter through the system. No one just gets in.Tariffs will increase costs from other countries, part of Trumps plan to rebuild domestic supply chains, infrastructure and bring jobs back home.

Things like abortion, wage gap, maternity entitlements, medical/hygiene product costs, family law, gendered violence, etc are all constant running themes - as most should be. But at best, they do nothing for men, and at worst, demonise them.The Dems advertising targeted at men was awful, with \\"nobody has to know\\" being a main theme! The best they could offer was the guy who looks at his daughter and \\"does it for her.\\" A noble gesture, sure, but it's also tells men \\"yeah sorry pal, we've got nothing for you.\\" The ads where the two wives wink and nod while voting Dem also goes with the \\"nobody has to know\\" theme, implying their evil, Republican husbands would beat them if they found out. Just awful messaging.But back my main point, to successfully win male voters, their efforts would need to outweigh any perceived (rightly or wrongly) anti-male/pro-female platform. This risks alienating or discouraging the least engaged, who really need to be fired up and motivated. And also some of the most staunchly engaged, who would see any inch given as a betrayal and abandonment - as already demonstrated somewhat in the comments. They could cut down the rhetoric - which would result in capturing less of the female vote. Or they could push policies that benefited men  - which would then be perceived as anti-women and also capture less of the female vote.It may be true that a legitimate effort to woo male voters would not necessarily require a great sacrifice in terms of policy or political position. The sacrifice would come in the form of votes they fail to capture from their most dependable base - votes lost, which would far outweigh any votes gained.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"See what i mean?

The first is putting a lot of emphasis on the abortion issue. If men can't get abortions, then their interest in it is philosophical or academic, not a \\"bread-and-butter\\" issue. The other was the emphasis on celebrities. Unless maybe they're major sports figures, men just don't care who Oprah, Taylor Swift, Beyonce or George Clooney are voting for.

In fact, research shows a growing divide between male and female (far more so in younger people) all across the west - you can see the same patterns in Europe, for instance, with men far more likely to vote for right wing parties than women. So that extent USA 24 was just a development that's already underway. The motivating factor appears to be women becoming more left wing rather than men become more right wing, to the point where women make left wing parties unappealing to men.[https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/gen-z-gender-gap-political-left-women](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/gen-z-gender-gap-political-left-women)[https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-male-dominated-gender-balance-equality-stalls-right-wing-decline/](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-male-dominated-gender-balance-equality-stalls-right-wing-decline/)Lots of reasons as to why. Personally I think this is because the left wing personifies feminine values more - harm avoidance, care for the marginalised and vulnerable, not much of a risk appetite, whereas the right wing personifies male values more - merit over equality, self-responsibility rather than relying on others, and greater appetite for risk.However, it's also been pointed out the current gender split was reversed until quite recently - women were more conservative than men - and what's causing this change might simply be due to the fact that women are more socially influenceable than men, particularly at places like colleges, and have become left wing because of this. Basically, women tend to uphold whatever status quo is around them, men to be more stubborn. And currently in colleges and corporate culture, the slant is left.[https://theconversation.com/women-used-to-be-more-likely-to-vote-conservative-than-men-but-that-all-changed-in-2017-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-214019](https://theconversation.com/women-used-to-be-more-likely-to-vote-conservative-than-men-but-that-all-changed-in-2017-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-214019)You say 'a mere lip-service towards men' should be enough to address men's concerns and counterbalance  republican arguments. However, as you point out, when the Harris campaign became aware it had a 'man problem' it already tried to address this issue with 'mere lip-service' and it didn't work. Although Harris didn't make any explicit sexist arguments, the entire Democratic party still represents left wing values which men find unappealing.The question you should ask yourself is whether you think right wing parties could persuade more women to vote for them by mere lip-service? Because if the answer is no, then I don't see why you would expect it to work the other way around. The only way it will change is for more men to become involved in the left, but for that to work the left would have to change, which I'm not sure its willing to do.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"There were 4 years before an election to do something.","title":"Buttigieg Warns Trump-Panicked Democrats, We Cannot Be Mesmerized"},{"text":"How many?

The revolution-talk and progress-talk are two different flavours of rhetoric for middle/upper middle class-types who sense opportunities for social-climbing. The usual analogy you get from right-wingers is that the Left is 'postmodern' or 'Neo-Marxist'  which are just jargony, fancy-sounding ways to say 'whacky Marxism that isn't as stuffy as Soviet stuff'. But I think a much better analog can be found in the Shu'ubiyya movement from Persia: downwardly mobile, middle-men of all shapes and sizes who feel the powers that be don't treat them with the respect they're owed. These people are less interested in seriously overthrowing or reforming the Empire, and more interested in getting a seat at the table. Just as the Persians had ruthlessly criticized the Arabs, calling them chauvinistic, slaving colonizers, who contrive their religion to maintain social control, so too do people do the same to whites today. Hence, the Left is Neo-Shu'ubist and not Neo-Marxist. And just as the Shu'ubites could never give up the rhetorical device of the despoiling, looter Arab, so too can the Neo-Shu'ubites never give up the rhetorical device of the oppressive white.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"OK.

I think we should take them seriously and leverage them both in style and in substance to reify non-Western liberal democracies.\\\\-As a supplement, here is President Mandela's description of the democratic traditions of the Thembu people, which inspired him. The Thembu are a Xhosa-speaking group in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. This excerpt is taken from Mandela's autobiography, *Long Walk to Freedom*:My later notions of leadership were profoundly influenced by observing the regent and his court. I watched and learned from the tribal meetings that were regularly held at the Great Place. These were not scheduled, but were called as needed, and were held to discuss national matters such as a drought, the culling of cattle, policies ordered by the magistrate, or new laws decreed by the government. All Thembus were free to come - and a great many did, on horseback or by foot.On these occasions, the regent was surrounded by his *amaphakathi*, a group of councillors of high rank who functioned as the regent's parliament and judiciary. They were wise men who retained the knowledge of tribal history and custom in their heads and whose opinions carried great weight.Letters advising these chiefs and headmen of a meeting were dispatched from the regent, and soon the Great Place became alive with important visitors and travelers from all over Thembuland. The guests would gather in the courtyard in front of the regent's house and he would open the meeting by thanking everyone for coming and explaining why he had summoned them. From that point on, he would not utter another word until the meeting was nearing its end.Everyone who wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in its purest form. There may have been a hierarchy of importance among the speakers, but everyone was heard: chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, shopkeeper and farmer, landowner and labourer. People spoke without interruption and the meetings lasted for many hours. The foundation of self-government was that all men were free to voice their opinions in their values as citizens. (Women, I am afraid, were deemed second-class citizens).A great banquet was served during the day, and I often gave myself a bellyache by eating too much while listening to speaker after speaker. I noticed how some speakers rambled and never seemed to get to the point. I grasped how others came to the matter at hand directly, and who made a set of arguments succinctly and cogently. I observed how some speakers used emotion and dramatic language, and tried to move the audience with such techniques, while others were sober and even, and shunned emotion.At first, I was astonished by the vehemence - and candour - with which people criticized the regent. He was not above criticism - in fact, he was often the principal target of it. But no matter how serious the charge, the regent simply listened, not defending himself, showing no emotion at all.The meetings would continue until some kind of consensus was reached. They ended in unanimity or not at all. Unanimity, however, might be an agreement to disagree, to wait for a more propitious time to propose a solution. Democracy meant all men were to be heard, and a decision was taken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be crushed by a majority.Only at the end of the meeting, as the sun was setting, would the regent speak. His purpose was to sum up what had been said and form some consensus among the diverse opinions. But no conclusion was forced on people who disagreed. If no agreement could be reached, another meeting would be held. At the very end of the council, a praise-singer or poet would deliver a panegyric to the ancient kings, and a mixture of compliments to and satire on the present chiefs; the audience, led by the regent, would roar with laughter.As a leader, I have always followed the principles I first saw demonstrated by the regent at the Great Place. I have always endeavoured to listen to what each and every person in a discussion had to say before venturing my own opinion. Oftentimes, my own opinion will simply represent a consensus of what I heard in the discussion. I always remember the regent's axiom: a leader, he said, is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go on ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.","title":"In a world where political polarization and disengagement are denting democracy, does Botswanas kgotla system hold the key?"},{"text":"NeitherIll just blame my wallet for not being thick enough to survive another economic curveball.","title":"Republicans of Reddit, when Trump signs the 25% tariff order on day one and everything increases in price are you going to blame Woke or Biden?"},{"text":"Why?

Dole will consider shipping low value unprocessed pears straight from Argentina to the USA, and have them processed there. Because suddenly, it has become the cheapest option.In the process, what Dole used to pay workers in Thailand will be spent on machines and operators in the USA, thus creating domestic jobs.A 20% or 25% tariff on raw materials is not different than what the European Union has in place, and they offer opportunities to offset it.When it comes to tariffs on finished goods, China, Brazil and India have been using them precisely to foster their domestic manufacturing industry.The high tariff only serves to incentivise corporations to build local assembly factories. They are still allowed to import raw materials, albeit with a 20% to 25% tariff, but they are not taxed on the good that they produce locally, apart perhaps from having to collect sales tax.","title":"CMV: Implementing high tariffs on imported auto parts will harm the U.S. automobile industry and economy."},{"text":"LIZZID PEEPLE!","title":"In the 2010 TV series called V, the reptilians who disguise themselves as humans to infiltrate human society constantly make this hand sign.

The reason that white men (because it's white men we're talking about here) favour conservatism is that progressives target the patriarchy and white privilege and white men are threatened by that; they have power, they don't want to lose it.   \\nThis is a problem for progressive parties to solve but adding men's issues to your platform can't solve it because that's not what white men are worried about. Progressive parties need to convince white men to sharing their privilege is OK and that's nigh on impossible without long term social change.   The truth is that 'men's issues' aren't, and shouldn't be, part of progressive strategy, partly because it goes directly against their ideology (promoting equality) but also because for every vote you gain by defending white male privilege you lose elsewhere from women and minorities.   The actual strategy to pursue is wealth disparity. A large proportion of conservative voters are working class men who currently vote against their interests because of populist causes like immigration and nationalism. If they can be convinced to vote for progressive policies that will increase their wages and job security then progressives could clean up but, currently these voters believe that conservatism is what helps them.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"last night's sunset fucking sucked ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Do you have any specific misandrists to name?","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"probably saved it to keep Bill Kristol in your prayers","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The cases are impossible without dirty Democrat judges and dirty Democrat prosecutors.All of those cases were novel uses of law used uniquely against Trump.

My point here is that there was no single leader who decides, no committee of grey beards who vote on what should be championed. The closest we get are the primary voters, who skew to the extremes for both Dems and GOP.So when the Harris campaign a few months prior to the election began signalling its changing priorities, any voter can reasonably wonder if that change is genuine, considering the years prior.My point therefore is that making the kind of change you outline takes far more effort. There is no central committee. Rather, donors, primary voters, interest groups, and left-leaning cultural institutions have to change somewhat for some duration to be credible. Will they? Perhaps, but it wouldn't be without sacrifice. None of the above is an argument for or against the change you outline. My only point is that in decentralized or weak institutions, coordinated change is hard, especially when years of growing interest groups have attached to one party over the other. Of course, a major electoral loss tends to be a galvanizing moment for change.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"tbf this wouldnt have fooled the teachers at the school i used to go to","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If killing 500  North Korean soldiers  with the missiles is an act of escalating,, then wait until they come for you.","title":"Biden isnt escalating the war in Ukraine  hes doing the right thing"},{"text":"??would give a ride to a scorpion","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"How exactly would it harm women and minorities if you admit that men can be discriminated against for their gender?","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Republicans have captured all the media channels.

And when these types of people get in power they just rip through like a shitnado, leaving messes in their wake that reasonable, honest, people then have to take time to clean up. And proper, fair, due process is slow and methodical - by the time you've got the facts straight on one thing, they're 3 more catastrophes further down the road.I think it highlights a fundamental flaw in democracy, and the roles of leaders, because the expectation is that these people will be acting in the public interest - but it takes so long to unfuck the problems when they exploit their power and roles, that the damage of them is often done, and the remedy is too little too late.More and more I'm starting to think that the big 'conspiracy' is really just that cumulative incompetence, selfishness, and stupidity looks like a domino run of things that seem premeditated and coordinated when you look at the chain of events as a whole... but really it's just the knock on effect of bullshit into bullshit that forms a pattern that just feels like it's malicious because we can't believe people can be this fucking evil by accident... but I think they actually just can.","title":"Biden's DOJ drops all Jan 6 charges against Trump.

As much as I hate the slippery slope shoe on the other foot argument, it still has some merit here. That being said I would agree with the point that Trump coming in after and packing the court isn't much different to the wildly lopsided composition we already have but...\\n \\n The president has basically no other check or power over the court\\n \\n As for his legacy, the fact is you're only correct in that a legacy is dictated by how people view history, not the actual fact of the matter. The biggest mistake the biden administration made was not treating MAGA as the \\"fascism without any ideological consistency\\" scurge that it is and not going harder on trying to throw Trump in a dark prison for insurrection as soon as he took office.I'm not saying that as President, he should have just silenced the supreme court. Instead, what I seem to have noticed is that Biden merely being president angered enough people that they worked extra hard to undermine him, such as undermining Roe vs Wade and launching the January 6 insurrection. Biden didn't necessarily do anything to deserve this, enough people just hate him enough that they worked super hard to ensure his presidency failed.Biden, as far as I'm concerned, actually did a pretty good job. America outperformed every other country in the world with regards to inflation. Unemployment is low. Much needed infrastructure was passed. He had the balls to finally pull out of Afghanistan despite the political backlash that was always going to happen because there was no good way to do it. He supported our allies while doing what he could to properly restrain them (to all the \\"genocide in gaza crowd\\" I don't care, you're wrong). Sure, he may have been sliding not so slowly into dementia, but from his actual job as president he's either a fantastic decision maker behind the scenes or his handlers are.!deltaOn these topics, there were no good options and Biden (or his handlers) did the best with what he had. Regarding Afghanistan, that was a guaranteed defeat at that point. The USA desperately needed infrastructure spending regardless of whether it won votes or not. Netanyahu was an ally, but a nasty one and one who was nothing but a headache to Biden (he supported Trump over Biden and basically cornered the USA into further aiding him).","title":"CMV: As someone who would have voted Democrat if I were American, Joe Biden's historical legacy will be like that of Jimmy Carter, if not worse."},{"text":"What vidya will you play??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Asia is the only continent where you can't use the Euro.
