As to your original points though the Democrats wanted to expand slavery, Republicans wanted to ban it.

But he said that this was because of the legal chaos left behind by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.Tusk was speaking on Tuesday at a conference entitled Ways Out of the Constitutional Crisis held in the Senate with the participation of the speakers of both houses of parliament as well as various prominent legal authorities, including four former chief justices of the constitutional court.In his remarks, which came a day after the prime minister was accused of?unlawfully withdrawing his signature?from a document, he said that in its eight years of rule PiS truly devastated the \\\\[legal\\\\] system, and not even in a black and white way, because we are all drowning in shades of grey, in these interpretative gaps.This situation is no accident, said Tusk, who accused PiS of having the specific intention to destroy the \\\\[constitutional\\\\] order and not to strengthen or build it, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).If we want to restore the constitutional order and the foundations of liberal democracy\\\\[we\\\\] will probably make mistakes or commit actions that, according to some legal authorities, will be inconsistent or not fully compliant with the provisions of the law, admitted the prime minister.Every day, I have to make decisionswith full awareness of the risk that not all of them will meet the criteria of full legality from the point of view of purists C in the good sense of the word, he added.But nothing excuses us from the obligation to act, concluded Tusk. Without these decisions, there would be no point in me taking on the responsibility of running the governments work.Tusks remarks were ridiculed by figures from PiS, which is now the main conservative opposition party. Tusk \\\\[says he\\\\] will probably break the law to restore the law, wrote MP Tobiasz Bocheski. According to this logic, one must steal to become honest.During PiSs eight years in power, many of its actions C particularly in relation to its overhaul of the judiciary C were found by?Polish?and?European?courts, as well as a range of domestic and?international organisations, to have violated the rule of law. Opinion polls showed that?most of the public?held this view too.When Tusks new, more liberal ruling coalition took power in December, one of its central goals was to?restore the rule of law. However, it has itself been accused of violating the law. Its takeover of public media in December was?questioned by many independent legal experts?and aspects of it were?rejected by courts.This week, Tusk himself aroused controversy when he?announced that he was revoking his signature?from a judicial appointment that he said he had made by mistake. Many respected legal authorities have said he had no legal basis for such a decision.Today, another opposition party, Confederation (Konfederacja), announced that it was submitting a notification to prosecutors accusing Tusk of violating the law by withdrawing his signature.","title":"Actions to restore democracy may sometimes not fully comply with law, admits Polish PM Tusk"},{"text":"!ping crosswords","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If a religion was true - it would be more important than anything else, because it would teach actual knowledge about the universe and it's rules. \\"Super natural\\" is natural in a world where it existed.Fortunately that's not the case.

You state yourself \\"its not an explicit and clear guide\\".

Are you serioisly holding to this opinion or are you just opposing anything that goes against your narrow (which ironically makes it hypocritical) view of the world?Then you additionally bring up the argument because a source of authority isn't clear it can't be used. Which again is incorrect. We use unclear evidence to make decisions all the time. In fact when a person gets legal rights is a perfect example of unclear evidence. When a person becomes a legal person is arbitrary and subjective not based on when an individual is conscious living and self-aware or something apart from \\"we've decided this just because this is what we want\\".Then finally you make the argument we don't fully follow something so people shouldn't be allowed to argue we should fully follow something.

But as diets continue to change, so will the climate.\\nToday, about one billion Indians follow Hinduism, and many Hindus avoid eating meat to minimize harming animals. As a result, India is often misperceived as a majority vegetarian nation. But according to the International Institute of Population Sciences, in 2017, nearly 70 percent of Indians consumed meat at least occasionally.The consumption patterns in India are mostly driven by socio-economic conditions and religious beliefs. According to a recent study, while meat consumption is on the rise in the country, there are social stigmas attached to it. These social stigmas have thereby given rise to discrepancies in meat consumption patterns in public and private spaces.The study points out how private meat consumption in India happens in a variety of different ways. Places outside the home like restaurants, food courts, offices, or segregated safe spaces like lawns, separate kitchens, and dining spaces for non-vegetarian family members at home are backstage settings for eating meat in India.However, getting an accurate estimate of meat consumption in India is a struggle. Various research notes that Indians are particularly likely to underreport their consumption of meat due to cultural restrictions and taboos associated with eating it.https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/veg-friendly-india-meat-consumption-rise#:~:text=Since%202006%2C%20Indians%20have%20witnessed,one%20that%20contains%20more%20meat.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":" Or is it yet another manifestation of Trump running his mouth about some trope, as he always has done, followed by gasps of But Trump?\\n \\n Whether Trump is correct or this claim is not is up for debate.But the instinct in dismissing it as Trump pushing a \\"trope\\" (a term which annoys me to no end) is silly and does more harm than good.

I used to try to put a sandbox around art to try to understand it. But it's hard to measure thoughtlessness or thoughtfulness, offensiveness, meaningfulness.

It's hard to say how many people it must speak to in order to be art, and in what way it must speak to them.The argument here could be that art is meant to provoke, and provoke you it has. I think by focusing your view on whether or not this is art, you're directing your attention to some esoteric debate over what exactly is art.

Biden reaction in 2020 and Harris in 2024"},{"text":"1.  Midterm gains is false because of the results of the 2022 House Races.  \\n2.  No primary contest is inconclusive because the winner of the Democratic Primary is not the nominee.  They had a primary contest where Biden won the nomination but he is not the nominee.  So I'm not saying this is a key for either Trump or Harris.  \\n3.  Incumbent seeking reelection is false.  The incumbent is Biden.  Biden is not running for reelection.  Therefore the key is false.  I'm surprised Lichtman didn't come up with some mental gymnastic backflipping way to say this key is for Harris.  \\n4.  The third party is true now after the RFK endorsement of Trump.  According to Lictman's model, the RFK endorsement is a double edged sword because had he stayed in the race, this key would have been rated false.  But the positive from the endorsement is that a number of RFK supporters who were supporting RFK at the time will consider voting for Trump now.  \\n5.  Short term economy as of now is inconclusive.  The short term economy compares GDP growth of the previous 3 quarters.  The 2024 Q3 economic numbers won't be released until midway through October.  \\n6.  Long term economy is true  The long term economy compares today's GDP growth to the GDP growth 4 years ago.  4 years ago was COVID.  The COVID economy was as close to 0 as you can get it.  So I can see the argument that this key is true because the economy is better than it was 4 years ago.  But will the voters be blaming Trump for the COVID economy.  Polling shows that Trump is better for the economy than Harris, so is this key false then?  Outside of everything, based on the wording of this key alone, this key is true with caveats.  \\n7.  Major policy change is true.  The Biden administration had only one strategy, do the opposite of what Trump did.  And everything has blown up in his face because of it.  One of the first things that they did close down the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline which put the construction workers out of work.  It made America depended on foreign oil.  Which raised the gas prices.  Which is tied to everything else causing the supply chain crisis and the increased cost of living.  And similar to the long term economy key, by the wording alone of the policy change key, it is true... but with a METRIC FUCK TON of caveats.  \\n8.  Social unrest is true-ish.  I mean Republicans don't riot to the extent that Democrats do.  People are unhappy right now but there's very little rioting going on.  I'm surprised that there's not a general strike going on in this country right now.  I guess this is likely true, but if something like a general strike were to happen in the next month and a half, it would be changed to false.  \\n9.  Scandal is the same as policy change, true with a fuck ton of caveats.  Lichtman's wording seems to imply that it's only a scandal if both parties agree that it's a scandal.  In which case, nothing is a scandal now going forward.  But we're going to ignore Hunter's laptop, Ashley's diary, the fact that the Dems had no primary and just appointed their nominee without voting on them, and a whole host of other incredulities because the Dems shut their eyes and covered their ears to them?  But fine, we'll say that it's likely true because no scandal has come out but still might come out in the next month and a half.   \\n10.  Foreign/Military failure is false.  It is false by mention of these three words:  Botched Afghanistan withdrawal.  \\n11.  Foreign/Military success is false.  It's only false because there is an absence of success.  Something could change in the last month and a half to make this true.  But has it stands now, it is only likely false.  \\n12.  Charismatic incumbent is false.  Neither Biden nor Harris was particularly charismatic.  Polling following the first debate shows that Harris wasn't seen in a positive light.  It would take an Obama or a JFK to to be running for the Dems to make this true.  \\n13.  Charismatic challenger is false.  Donald Trump is Donald Trump.  The dude is charismatic.  No amount of mental gymnastics will ever change this key to not be in Trump's favor.  \\nSo by my count;  there are 5 keys that are false, 1 that is likely false, 2 that remain inconclusive, 2 that are likely true, and 3 that are true.  Based on Lichtman's model and my interpretation, Trump has 5 keys and needs only 1 more to win.  So if the Foreign/Military success key that I have as likely false remains false, that would be the 6 keys Trump needs to win.  Harris needs every key, including the Foreign/Military success key, that are not the 5 keys currently held by Trump.","title":"Alan Lichtman predicts Harris win"},{"text":"They must be hating Braun for the Americanized pronunciation of our last name, instead of sticking w/ a more German pronunciation","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 13, 2024 - 53 days until election day!"},{"text":"Which news outlets do you think do honorable reporting?","title":"Debate moderator Linsey Davis, is sorority sister of Kamala Harris both Alpha Kappa Alpha members --- WHAT "},{"text":"It was [Tad Devine](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303868-sanders-aide-defends-donna-brazile-after-leaked-emails/) but otherwise yes.

Funny how the internet left always ignores that to keep the conspiracy alive.  Brazille at no point denied her interactions with BOTH CAMPAIGNS.  There was no secret plot to help the Clinton campaign.  That was a fabrication from internet fanboys that willfully ignored public information that contradicted the story they wanted to believe.And if we're going to be precise, Brazille took leave from CNN when she was appointed the interim DNC chair.  And it was her decision to resign from CNN when BernieBros decided to throw a hissy fit about one of the many dumbass conspiracies they glommed onto in 2016.

For example they were America's most ardent supporter of slavery and a democrat was on the news shooting up a church just this year. So their views don't belong in public policy and definitely not in public school. Paragraph 4: democrats can talk about socialism and communist systems but America is not one of those types of governments. Democrats talking about non-socialistic governments just goes off the rails.Let me know if you meant something else. But hopefully when you see your own arguments used against something not religious you are able to see the flaws in reasoning. You over generalize a group of people and you limit faith to only belonging to the afterlife when it has to do with more than that.Let me ask you a further question. If you knew there was a person who was all knowing, all powerful and you trusted and loved him, would everything he did and said shape everything else you choose to trust in? The reason I ask this question which can be hard for people to understand conceptually is because truly religious people don't have a belief in abortion, a belief in marriage and a belief in God. Their faith in God is who they are. They fully invest everything into God because they believe God is worth everything they are. To deny religious based beliefs is to say you can't voice your opinion at all. Belief in a Christian God is an I'm all in or I'm all out kind of belief. To do it halfway means you haven't really considered the importance of well eternity and pretty much everything but the blip you call life on earth.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"Cool.

You might as well argue that we should throw out the US Constitution because many of it's authors owned slaves. Just because a group did bad things in the past, doesn't mean all their views today are unworthy of being heard.I'm going to seriously disagree with you here for 1 very important reason. Religious organizations that claim moral superiority, like the Catholic Church, contradict their teachings. The claim is that their god is omniscient, all loving, etc., this is problematic because the followers of that religion do not embody those values.Why is this relevant to this conversation? Look at your first point about abortion. Among Christians, and even among Catholic diocese, there is a variance in the application of religious tenet interpretation. Not all Christians, and by extension Catholics, hold the same view on abortion.Given that, why would a non-Christian take a Christians opinion on abortion seriously? An Atheist or a theist from another religion isn't going to want have to abide by a Christian's interpretation of abortion.This is why we have constant fighting about social issues in the US.  The fact that we have crazy echo chambers these days, and the fact that groups want to legislate based on their personal worldview.To get around this, we have secular law that is legislated on the aggregate values of the citizens of the country.  There are obviously some things that have a religious undertone, and that's due to having enough members of that religion getting a law pushed through.This is why there is such a big disconnect when looking at laws via a Federal vs. Confederal lens. The Right tends to lean more fundamentally religious, so they want more religious backed laws, like abortion.  The chances of getting a federal law in relation to abortion is challenging due to the split partisan nature of the legislative branch.  So the right used the judicial branch to push the abortion decision to States via the Roe decision.  They prefer this because they have better control in several states at the local level.Anyway, slight tangent, but to sum it up, legislating all people against the values of one group will always cause friction, and the US is supposed to be secularly run.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"I dont like this Trump/Putin ticket.","title":"Russia responds to Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate: \\"Leave our president alone\\""},{"text":"The entire US GDP is 25 trillion per year.

Let's look at each:# Religious Stuff Shouldn't Be In SchoolsThis is a pretty weird claim. You basically can't understand anything in the western canon (or other canons) without understanding the popular religion of the relevant authors. Because of the emphasis on the western canon in college, you can't have a genuine liberal arts education without a core understanding of abrahamic traditions. This includes a deep dive into the bible, and possibly various commentaries on it.US Schools have almost never (with a few exceptions led by some progressive educational thinkers) cared about really preparing students for college. High school students were, by and large, not supposed to go to college, they were supposed to learn a very specific skill and contribute to society that way, not get the kind of diverse education in the liberal arts necessary for the \\"knowledge class\\" that was meant to carry on the traditions of the higher classes in the Middle Ages.Nowadays the purpose of K12 school is actually college readiness, because we've sided with those earlier progressive thinkers (like Dewey) in thinking that a US inhabitant cannot be effective at participating in democracy without a liberal arts background. However, there is huge political and corporate resistance to public schools actually providing education that way, which is why we're still using materials that have been proven ineffective decades ago. Independent schools have carried on in small amounts for those \\"in the know\\" to use them, and many of them emphasize spiritual traditions. The vast majority of people unfortunately have to go with traditional public schools, which stick to traditions that were never designed to get you ready for college.# You shouldn't use your religion to inform your policyThis is also unusual. Your religion is the core of your ideas about how ethical conduct in society is supposed to go. It is the source of moral intuition and correct judgement. For example, to a religious person, permitting society to be snooty about homelessness or poverty and not do anything about it is morally abhorrent. To many atheists and secularists, it is perfectly fine, or they make all sorts of strange justifications about it, like \\"I worked for my money they can too\\" and things like that that seem on the face of it to make sense but break down with a robust moral system.Religions have been arguing for hundreds of years on justice, morality, etc. so their moral systems are very sophisticated. Secularists have only taken a significant stab at it since about the year 1600, and the ideas they've come up with have not settled on a single common and effective approach, so trying to apply these secular systems, like Kantian ethics, often goes horribly wrong.In light of this, it's strange to say \\"you should keep your religion to yourself and not vote based on your religious moral principles\\". It's a bit like telling the PhDs in the physics department that you've come up with a great \\"grand unified theory\\" along with the folks at the pub down the street, and they should really take a look at it and stop advising engineers based on their outdated, primitive theories. They would find this very amusing. In facts, the secularists themselves would never have agreed with you, and all of them (Mill, Kant, etc.) thought of belief in a deity and the systems around that belief were essential to reasoned judgement (not just in ethics). So it's also like you were sent from the pub by the other people as a prank.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"On FOX.","title":"Trump declares there will be NO THIRD DEBATE with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I mean, to be fair someone like Candace Owens does this shit all the time.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 13, 2024 - 53 days until election day!"},{"text":"That point doesn't hold, because since religious people are the ones making the claim their god exists, they are the ones who have to prove it, and if they can prove it it becomes silly to ignore, but otherwise, it holds the same weight as the claim earth is flat.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"Because, like a pack of wild dogs, they salivate over watching him get railroaded.","title":"Trump declares there will be NO THIRD DEBATE with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Thank you very much.","title":"Americans that are Not liberals democrats what is your honest opinion no bias on trump?"},{"text":"It's a no win situation?","title":"Trump declares there will be NO THIRD DEBATE with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"even then you'd still have a corporate media system designed to marginalize any candidates that put Americans first over the profits of global corporationsyou could get every dollar out and billionaires would still buy media companies to make sure we call it \\"far left\\" to enact a reform shown to lower Healthcare inflation and save hundreds of thousands of lives","title":"Kristen Welker / Bernie Sanders Interview: Kamala has flipped her stance on Universal Healthcare"},{"text":" Then get a candidate who doesn't surround himself with those people and that media.Ah.

She was there with \\"International Solidarity Movement\\", its... bad.... just from the Guardian it is a real bad organization and I really do not want to read into it further. From my research:Can you give a source for the 2003 incident you mention? The closest to what you describe that I can find is Shapiro writing a *response* to a pro-suicide bombing article in which he and Arraf argue that non-violence must be considered as a tool by the Palestinians, and encouraging them to do something nonviolent *instead* of suicide bombing.The ISM very stridently and insistently preaching absolute nonviolence in its methods, which yes, includes serving as human shields. The ISM does not support or condone any acts of terrorism C which is not legitimate armed struggle. The ISM does not associate, support, or have anything to do with armed or violent resistance to the occupation. The ISM does not assist or engage in any kind of armed resistance, no matter what form it may take. The organization unfortunately has hero-worship around a certain event that occurred in October, of at least some of its founders. However it does seem to have split the group slightly, with some leaders justifiably calling them out, its just a horrific look around what the quiet opinion is.Can you provide a source for this, too? While they put out a statement blaming the Israeli government's actions for what Hamas did, I can't find anything suggesting that they *approved* of what happened. whereas she was likely (like many Redditors) trying to inexplicably paint Hamas as a hero.The interactions with Hamas that I can find are them trying to encourage Hamas to protest nonviolently.I could absolutely understand criticizing the group as unrealistic or inconvenient, but it seems completely absurd, given the evidence, to insinuate that they are violent or \\"extremist\\" in any other sense than \\"extreme pacifists\\". Maybe there's some hard-to-find evidence that they're actually gleefully doing the one thing they preach most against, after all PETA goes around killing animals so it wouldn't be the first time, but this feels a bit like saying that there's a hospital directing the ambulances to run people over so they can get more patients.","title":"CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today"},{"text":"Stability =/= prosperity.","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"All the immigrants that have crossed the border illegally under Biden need to go back.","title":"\\"Donald Trump resorted to the same deranged and despicable rhetoric that is meant to divide people.

We don't prosecute people for doing things that are wrong, we prosecute them for doing things that are harmful to us and those we love.  Nobody is going to abort my wife or my child.  But they might rob or murder them. (as an example comparing abortion or murder).  I've got plenty of morals that would disagree with most people, but I would be *apalled* if I were so unjust as to try to punish people for not following them.For the rest, there's a 90%+ overlap between all non-relativist philosophies about right and wrong.  It's pretty straightforward stuff.  Most disagreements in politics have nothing to do with religion.So we can count on 1 hand the types of things that people shouldn't be pushing into the country.  I won't push for a law against proselytization despite thinking it's terribly immoral.  Christians stop pushing for abortion laws or banning gay marriage or gay sex.  Pacifist religions don't push for bans on fighting sports.  We all sing kumbaya and \\nlive happily ever after (until we disagree on healthcare or something else that at least has nothing to do with religion). Religion is basically a philosophy like any other. Except it is more objective since there is basically no way to know that any given philosophy is right without religion.I argue the opposite.  WRT morals/ethics, religion is basically the ONLY philosophy that doesn't need to be coherent and rational.  Utilitarianism, Deontology, and other philosophical ethical positions all are expected to put up or shut up.  Divine Command can hypothetically say \\"punish people who wear white shoes after labor day because God said so\\".  The inescapable integration with Fideism is always a problem with running a country.

Prior to the sixties, GOP and Dems collaborated on many initiatives. They were (somewhat) divided on details, not on wholesale concepts of personhood. That all changed with Nixon's \\"Southern Strategy\\" in '68. There was recognition on both sides of the aisles that the folks on the other side were smart, worthy of some respect, and just as dedicated to the welfare of their constituents (albeit with different ideas of how to improve things). There was willingness to compromise in order to get things done. There was ~~no~~ less \\"winner take all\\" mentality because the GOP of the time knew that things had to get done, and governing is the art of compromise. Today's MAGA-infected GOP sees (and enforces) any cooperation with Dems as capitulation, and punishes it accordingly. Those that don't stay in lockstep with the radical fringes of the party are attacked, castigated, and isolated. Anything proposed by Dems is automatically bad. Anything put forth by members of the GOP is enthusiastically supported and treated as if it came from a place of serious thought and reasoning - even when it's obviously loony.  That... isn't a good way to run a society. That didn't used to be the case, pre-Nixon. From Nixon's cabinet, we got Bush Sr., Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others - they persisted into Reagan, and Bush Sr., Bush Jr. They built the divide that we now see between the parties, over the course of 5 decades being in control. Having the GOP that was working w Dems back in the 50's and 60's would help a LOT - but I don't see it coming back. Today's voters would treat them as Quislings, as weak, and as betraying them, any time they tried to compromise.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Its been a great week!

Or murder? Like, if God said it was okay, you'd go out and steal your neighbours blind? Or you'd murder those people that won't turn down their TV in the next apartment, if God gave you blessings to do so? You don't do it because you're afraid of punishment after you die? See, that makes us different - I don't steal because I don't want to. I don't need to be threatened - I believe that stealing from others is wrong **simply because it would hurt them**. What if I had a book that said that all goods owned by unbelievers were available to be stolen. Or if I had a book that said that unbelievers could be killed or enslaved out of hand? Should I be listened to if I lobby for those rules to be followed by all? And whose books are valid? You talk about the Bible, but what about the Vedic texts? Or the Koran? Are they equally valid? And which versions of these books are valid? The bible has been translated, re-interpreted, and misprinted throughout history. Which version is correct? We don't even HAVE the original copies of most of the books, so it's not like we can go back and recheck the translations, right? Maybe the 10 Commandments DID actually allow you to steal from non-citizens. And what if I want to live by the Jedi Code - is that any less valid than your Bible? Or what if I want to follow the examples shown in the stories of Spider-man - Peter Parker is a pretty upright dude, we have lots of stories where he does the right thing even though it costs him, he's put up with about as much misery as Lot went through, and still does the right thing when he can. \\"With great power comes great responsibility\\" (book of Uncle Ben, 12:2).Is that a less valid way to live ones life than by poring over a book written collectively by bronze age shepherd, carpenters, and fishermen?In the end, morals don't come from a books. They come from empathy, intelligence **and social consequences**. They are enforced by collective action, or by the failure of societies that DON'T have good social rules. It's pretty straightforward to understand - if you have a society of people that have good rules for getting along (don't steal, don't rape, don't murder, don't evade responsibilities or taxes, pay your debts, etc.), then that society does well. And that reinforces the rules. And society grows. If you have a society where there are less optimal rules (e.g. You can steal from certain groups of people, you can murder under certain circumstances, taxes are only paid by those that are lower in social status) then you get worse results. People don't contribute because of fear of murder, or resentment about taxes, or because they are too busy guarding their meager possessions from being stolen. Those societies tend to do worse, with more internal pressures (see: resentment) and with a great deal of energy being spent enforcing these intuitively unfair rules. Those societies either fail (people leave, there are famines, diseases, etc.) or they undergo revolution into a different kind of society (see: Tsarist Russia, French Revolution, etc.)If you steal from me, then it encourages me to steal from you, or others. That hurts us all, because instead of having energy available to make our lives better (by going out hunting, or by figuring out how to make crops grow better, etc.) I have to put my physical and mental energy into guarding my stuff so you don't steal it. We live in a pluralistic society - there are people of all faiths, creeds, ethnicities, and experiential backgrounds in our society, and they're ALL equal under the law. Claiming that something should or shouldn't be done because a group of Bronze Age goat herders wrote it down isn't relevant in today's society. Every aspect of human knowledge and society has evolved in the millennia since. I see no reason why we should run our society as if we were a subsistence society with no real knowledge of how anything works. that hardly means that today's Catholics shouldn't be allowed to participate in today's political discussions.I have no problem with ANY religious people proposing policy or lobbying for change. Catholics should absolutely speak their mind and lobby for policy changes that they feel would benefit society. But - arguments based on \\"my book says ...\\" or \\"my God says...\\" have no place in policy. Your religious rules and beliefs are YOURS - if you cannot convince me, through words alone, that a change is going to benefit society, then your argument fails - even if your \\"holy book\\" says differently. If the Pope can make a clear and cogent argument as to why birth control should be banned, without referencing God, Jesus, the Bible, or the like, then I will listen. Otherwise, he's trying to put HIS rules over me, and I'm not Catholic. Tell me how the policy change being provided will benefit society in real-world ways, and we can have a discussion. That's how a pluralistic society works best. why should my voice count less then someone who thinks that it's not murder based on secular reasons? Because you don't think my God is real?It's not because \\"I don't think your God is real\\" that I find your arguments uncompelling. It's because those proposing changes that align with religious texts tend to not believe that anyone else's Gods or faiths are real or valid. (e.g. Thou shalt have other gods before me) Many of those that are proposing rules that are perfectly valid **within their religion** are justifying them **as being \\"moral\\" mostly because they are components of their religion**. And that's putting YOUR religious rules over MY actions. I got a problem with that. So does my Sikh neighbour. And my Jewish dentist. And my atheist accountant. And, if you think about it, so do you. After all, that's what the Bible says, right? \\n\\"So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.\\", Matthew 7:12. If you don't want other religions to be able to impose their rules over you, don't try to impose your religious rules over them. In the end, the Golden Rule is all we really need to have good morals.

In fact, the Golden rule is a strictly inferior construct to \\"Treat others the way THEY WOULD WANT to be treated\\".  It's a subtle difference, but one of the best moral lessons for a kid to learn is that others might not want the same things they want... And the Golden rule teaches the opposite.As a Christian, YOU might want accountability if you commit a \\"Christian sin\\" by thinking in good faith it's morally ok (premarital sex, or masturbation for example?).  But a non-Christian *does not want to be treated that way*.  Similarly, if I were a bigot, **I would want to be put in my place.**  But conservative Christians seem to have a *real problem* if I follow the Golden rule and constantly bring up their view on homosexuality.  When I was Christian (twice), I had the same sort of mental contradiction you're having.  You seem to think a child cannot be raised to know right from wrong without Christian concepts.  That's simply false.  My religion has morals I think are better than Christianity's, and *I* don't think schools need to teach those morals either.  \\"All acts of love and pleasure are my sacramant\\" is a GREAT rule to live by, but I'm not losing sleep if schools instead teach kids **more balanced secular ethics.**  You can have a well-balanced understanding of how to behave without once learning any religion's values.  And you'll probably be better off than if you had.  you can't teach the crusades without explaining a little bit of religious history. But I believe that's all it should be. History.I went to a Catholic school, and my history class covering the crusades didn't touch anything OP would consider \\"teaching religion\\".  That said, I think there's a huge value in teaching a comparative religion course.  It even helps people considering atheism because it teaches them that there's not this one \\"exceptional\\" religion. I also think the changing of B.C to B.C.E and A.D. to C.E is purely historical censorship on a basis of hating religion.There were actually a lot of reasons to make the change.  But yeah, everbody saying \\"in the year of our Lord\\" (even by acronym) is sorta douchy.  A better reason IMO is that it's simply inaccurate.  It's linked to an erroneous birth year anyway.  I think continuing to use the same zero-point is more than enough to be respectful to Christians.  And I say this as a non-christian who writes \\"AD\\" most of the time anyway.  There's nothing hating or insulting to BCE/CE.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"https://archive.ph/BzW46They take more and more money from us instead of taking it from those who have more.

If I believe abortion is murder because God told me so, why should my voice count less then someone who thinks that it's not murder based on secular reasons?I mean, that's not how criminal law was intended to work.  There's no effective defense to litigate and prosecute one's own morals this way.  Most religions are NOT trying to get people put into jail for their own morals *because that would be wrong to do so* for both reasonable-legal-theory reasons and ethical reasons. What if I am also against stealing because the Bible says that's bad also? Am I not allowed to express that either?Criminal law is largely designed (and most effective) when it is working to benefit a peaceful and safe society.  People don't want to be victimized.  Theft is (and should be) illegal because it victimizes myself and those I love.  I'm afraid of being robbed.  I'm afraid of being raped, or murdered, or having my identity stolen.  I'm NOT afraid of being aborted.  I'm not afraid of my child or wife being aborted.  Despite the fact **I think theft is morally acceptable** (my moral position on property is towards Weak property), I have no choice but support it continue to be illegal.  See?  I express a legal position that directly opposes my moral position because to do otherwise would be indefensible.But it's is/ought.  If someone can get abortion, or blasphemy, or \\"being another religion\\" to be illegal, they can.  Let's analyze whether you really think people who have a different worldview should be able to express their opinions as law.What if a religion's morals involved *exterminating* the non-religious entirely, and/or force-converting them?  Would that be an ok expression of their legal opinions?  If not, what's the difference?  Similarly to abortion, we're talking about victimizing and punishing nonbelievers for doing moral actions.  These aren't hypotheticals; the \\"separation of church and state\\" as a concept extends (and was strengthened) from *actual* situations like this. True, but that hardly means that today's Catholics shouldn't be allowed to participate in today's political discussionsI don't think OP is saying that only atheists should be allowed to vote, or anything that resembles that.  Of COURSE Catholics can participate.  And before a recent push, a large majority of them voted with a pro-choice candidate despite the religion's position on abortion.  You know what changed?  Priests telling parishiners that they could not be Catholic and vote for a pro-choice candidate.  I know this because I have Catholic family that shame-voted Trump in 2016 because their Church told them to.  Illegal but unenforceable.Religious people *can* separate our religious rules from legislation.  It's SO easy to do.  I *strongly* believe that proselytization is an extremely immoral thing to do.

The government has a long history of either being used intentionally as a cudgel against religious groups or needing religious groups to work hard to work with it to continue their way of life. I'll give some examples in America, since I'm most familiar with it and it has a long history of genuinely trying to work with religious groups.The American Indian Religious Freedom Act was the result of generations of Native American tribes working to get the American government to give them religious liberties. It was passed in 1978 and expanded in 1994, and defends several aspects of Native American ceremonies and religion from ligislation against them. This was only possible because Native Americans brought their beliefs to politics.On December 17, 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant issued and signed General Orders No. 11 to evict Jews from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Grant wanted to end the black market of Southern cotton, which he believed was run by Jewish traders. Believe it or not, it passed, and Jews were rounded up and forced to leave on foot. Jewish communities protested, and one month later, President Abraham Lincoln coubtermanded the order.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 defends religious people in the workplace. It's been used by Muslims and Sikhs to defend their religious headwear. Sabbath observant Jews have used it for jobs that tried to keep them from joining by calling them in on Saturdays for no reason. It's used by people of all religions to defend against religious discrimination in the form of harassment in the workplace. Protections like this are not \\"fire and forget.\\" They require vigilant upkeep. Public policy needs to work for all people, including religious people.

You *say* the Catholic church isn't pretty, but much of Common Law as we know it is largely inseparable from Catholicism and Christianity.Religions are themselves neither \\"the good guy\\" nor \\"the bad guy\\", in this.  They are a major vehicle by which tradition becomes law.  Western countries simply cannot separate much of our foundational laws from Mosaic law.  And so long as we have solid walls of religious tolerance in place, THAT'S OKAY.  I mean, let's just look at the Catholic Church.  European law, even in secular countries today, has the simliarities it has because Catholicism spread through Europe and involved itself in lawmaking.  It was a slow yoke that brought much of Europe from barbarism to despotism, to feudalism.  YES, we broke the yoke a bit and moved on to things they would've never wanted like Democracy, but we can never separate Christianity from our roots, from our jurisprudence, from the way laws work at all in the West.  *The very fact that we teach law in college comes from Catholicism.*[This article](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2541&amp;context=lawreview) gets into a lot more detail than I could.

Today's classical music does not showcase improvisation as a major part of the movement. If you're expecting Beethoven's 9th symphony and the pianist starts improvising in the middle of the song, it will ruin the song. They need to play along with what the conductor has arranged (and if improv is part of what they want, then I would argue it is not stricly classical music).Plus, how someone was trained at the time does not mean it is the best way to train today. Jazz pianists of the early Jazz movement were all classically trained pianists. However, if I wanted to learn to play Jazz, learning all of the classical piano that they learned would be a waste of time for the most part. Some of it is useful to learn basic musical skills, but I do not need to become fully classically trained pianist to play Jazz. You are not an 18th century musician and composer trying to eek out a living by playing for nobles and presumably required to improvise a song for them for time to time.If we are strictly talking about learning to be a classical pianist (able to play in Orchestras and other venues where classical music is being played), then learning improvisation is not required. If your goal is to become a musician who can play a larger inventory of music and jam sessions, sure. But that style of music is not classical music.Honestly, I think the issue is that you went to learn classical music when you were not interested in classical music (or at least, not as interested as modern music). Should music teachers teach improvisation alongside sight reading? I think so, ideally they should cover a wide range of skills and focus on the ones that interest the student. Should classical music teachers teach improvisation though? I do not think so. Do not go to a classical music teacher if your goal is not to learn classical music.","title":"CMV: Piano Improvisation Is A Far Superior Skill to Sight-Reading in the Modern Society."},{"text":"?","title":"Biden Poised to Approve Ukraines Use of Long-Range Western Weapons in Russia"},{"text":"Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen.?[JD Vance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/jd-vance/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2)?(Ohio) recently laid out a potential Trump administrations approach to end Russias war in Ukraine, saying former president Donald Trumps handling of the conflict could include establishing a demilitarized zone in Ukrainian territory now occupied by Russia.The approach would mark a dramatic change from the Biden administrations policy  which is focused on providing military and other assistance, along with Europe and other allies  to help Ukraine repel and reverse Russian aggression.I think what this looks like is Trump sits down, he says to the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Europeans: You guys need to figure out -- What does a peaceful settlement look like? And what it probably looks like is the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine, that becomes like a demilitarized zone, Vance said Wednesday on The Shawn Ryan Show.The proposed demilitarized zone, Vance added, would be heavily fortified so the Russians dont invade again.

And by living I mean capable of breathing, taking in nutrients, and all that without the biological support of the mother's body. It is not a person, it is a parasite.Except this isnt a fact, this is an opinion about whether or not a fetus is a person. After all if I tested its DNA, it would be human. It has all the characteristics of human well before it is born.  Also this implies that our definition of a person is directly related to current medical technology. Does that means your definition changes based off location? Also choosing to differentiate between biological life support and artificial life support is also arbitrary, after all it both cases the baby cant survive on its own. I find pretty often you have to be careful when you claim you believe in facts not feelings because it is easy to blinded to the role feeling/belief is playing in an opinion. Being able to rationalize a feeling or belief can often be done with actual proper facts. Trying to ask a religious person to completely remove their religion from a conversation is like trying to completely remove anyones bias, functionally impossible. If something is used as a foundation for your moral beliefs its going to impact your understanding of politics.-I do want to clarify I am overall pro-choice, but against late state abortion that is not a medically recommendation. Which is to say I do think the morality of abortion is a balance of a considering a fetus to be human life and bodily autonomy.

Let's assume you can get around the ways people might game this (a massive assumption, this might be impossible). What are the effects of taxing overtime less?Usually part of the reason it's bad to tax income is that it creates an incentive not to work. Because taxation in the US is marginal, you pay the highest taxes on your extra work. When people work less, there are fewer goods and services which is bad. If we make overtime tax free we are massively incentivizing working more than 40 hours a week. We did it, we massively reduced the deadweight loss of income taxation.I think this is actually bad though.   * Working overtime is less productive. People aren't automatons that can work endlessly, productivity goes down as people burn out. I'm not sure I buy that going to a 32 hour work week has the same productivity as a 40 hour work week, but I definitely buy that the first 20 hours of work done a week are far far more productive than hours 45-65.\\n* Leisure time is good. People want time away from work and there is nothing wrong with that. For normal people who aren't workaholics, this is an implicit tax on free time. This also means less time for family in a world where fertility is already dangerously low.\\n* Inter-temporal substitution of time can undo the increased labor. The financial independence retire early movement (FIRE) people might love this. They plan to work hard in their 20s and 30s saving vast amounts of money, then retire with 1-10+ million dollars in assets and live the rest of their life as leisure. Rewarding intense work makes this go better but in the longer run might not increase total hours worked.Ultimately, I think this is a bad way to overcome the disincentive towards work from income taxes. The better solution is to transition towards a progressive consumption tax. The market for overtime work is not broken. Productive, high-endurance employees who can work long hours and people who value leisure at low levels can already negotiate with employers to work more than 40 hours a week. The government should take the default path of not putting their fingers on the scales of a functioning market.","title":"Trump proposes ending taxes on overtime pay"},{"text":"I would like to propose a daily evening debate from now until the election.

I saw a post debate interview with Chris Christiewho helped prepare him for the 2020 debate against Biden.

He reflected back to his preparation coaching for the Biden debate and mentioned that he really doesnt want to work for anything, and how difficult it was to get him to take things seriously.His professors at Wharton called him one of the dumbest students they ever taught.

First you have the impression that democracy is where people are put in charge and therefore they need to be intelligent. But then you go on and talk about how those in charge handle the economy.Here is what you are not connecting in your own analysis: THE PEOPLE are not the ones in charge, they are not the ones taking decisions or running the economy, so your issue with their intelligence shouldn't be an issue. All they do is elect those who will be in charge; it is they who need to be intelligent. They pick between 1 of only 2 viable candidates, who u say don't have much control either.

It's normal.As I have said, first correct your understanding of democracy. The US is not a democracy. The US is a \\"republic.\\"The difference is that in a democracy, the people are still in control of decisions taken (on the economy etc.). So, yes, in a proper democracy, if the people are unintelligent, it can create problems. There is the possibility for that.It is for the same reason why the US was not designed to be a democracy but rather something in which the people give up power or control to those who will be more intelligent and responsible. So your arguments cannot apply to the US. And you are identifying your problems wrong.But in an actual democracy, your title could have weight, but would still be wrong. Because, it doesn't mean, by all means, democracies are inefficient. It's only if you don't set it up well. Every form of government can be inefficient if you don't set it up well. It's not a constant. It CAN BE inefficient, not that democracies ARE inefficient; someone can make it not so. Just like house parties CAN BE chaotic, doesn't mean house parties are always chaotic.

Public schools are not permitted to preach a religion in a devotional manner and are only allowed to teach religion in an academic perspective.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":" singlehandedlylol. lmao even","title":"Let's talk about this \\"ABC whistleblower.\\""},{"text":"How do even expect people to debate you about a deleted comment they cannot even see.That's context that completely changes the meaning of the picture.South Park had an episode that had Britney Spears blow her head off with a shotgun, how morbid is that?

Historically, most monarchs tend to reduce their accountability over time, and with their level of power, its often achievable. Take Xi Jinping, for example, who removed term limits, allowing him to stay in power indefinitely. This is why, when I argue for a monarchy, accountability must be mandatory and enforceable.One of the benefits of centralised power is efficiency in everyday decisions. For instance, if infrastructure is failing, a monarch can swiftly order repairs, allocate resources, and begin work without years of bureaucratic delays or political changes. Workers and resources are allocated to begin next week. Not bounced around in civil service beurocracies for 3 years before being dropped as a new party came into power. This kind of efficiency is partly why China has developed so rapidly.However, these systems are fragile and brittle. During COVID-19, Chinas drastic measures seemed to severely impact lives, particularly from an outsiders perspective. When the state enforces controversial policies, such as those related to the Uighurs or the Hong Kong protests, there are very limited mechanisms to challenge it. Additionally, maintaining control often requires isolation from external influences, which can hinder technological and cultural progress.I guess it depends on whether you want something effective and progressive or something robust and considerate. My main frustration with democracy is that we value everyone equally. The average person is dumb enough. Some dude with no education and no background research can go and vote on financial legislation. He votes the opposite way from a financial expert with 40 years of banking experience. The result of this should not be neutrality. It is also worth mentioning that we clearly dont have a proper democracy. We vote for a person who makes decisions and we hope they are related somewhat to our personal principles. That is far removed from individuals voting referendum style. But if mass voting actually provided the best outcomes, then our markets would be full of co-ops who have out-competed standard capitalist CEO business models.","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"Lol i love how you pretended to be receptive of different viewpoints and then threw it completely out the window with this comment","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"Wouldnt it be funny if Taylor Swift was the clonaid clone who was kept secret ?","title":"My dumb silly recent conspiracy, Taylor swift inc. influenced the media to release the news about Dave grohl cheating simultaneously with her endorsing Kamala Harris to maximize publicity and take any of the hate off her."},{"text":"Isnt this logic tantamount to saying Trump was utterly ineffective at counteracting the eight years of Obama, so net-net we have a cumulative 12 years of progressive problems?

And Ill also give you that if it was only 1 ricochet, especially if a volley of bullets was fired, that would be a significant mitigating factor. However, thats not the case here. According to all sources I could find, 2 shots were fired, possibly 3 but I only saw that one place. So based of the official story, currently, an IDF office fired 2 shots at a target 200 yards away, and apparently managed to hit 2 separate people, 30 yards apart, neither of which were near the lead instigator, and apparently both shots were ricochets? That is a LOT of coincidences and at the very least merits an investigation Id say. I would also like to point out that neither injuries were glancing wounds, one was to the side of her head and the other was into another participants stomach. So now on top of all those other coincidences, the fact that both shots managed to actually hit people, not graze them, when the bullet could have gone, as you said, in any direction you didnt intend.

Now I am somewhat perplexed how a union is something that can be kept personal. In any case, as a Catholic I would be obligated to support these policies.Catholicism is also somewhat unique in that it is very deep as well as broad in its moral teachings. Most religions tend to just say \\"Holy Book says X, therefore X\\". Catholicism will say \\"Holy Book says X, therefore, therefore, therefore ....Unions are a human right\\" we could have an entire conversation on Unions and from your perspective it might seem that I am arguing from a secular perspective but that's only because you didn't probe deep enough to see that my position has a religious foundation.So let us see the issues with your proposition.Solution 1: I just disenfranchise myself and don't vote at all. I cannot choose a candidate as everything I support finds it's origin in my religion. Criminal Law and Sentencing, Economic Systems, Labour relations, Environmentalism, all have moral precepts under Catholicism. Solution 2: I simply pick a secular ideology or ideologies which gives me the results I want. This raises an issue because I don't care about the truth value of that ideology. Imagine this conversation playing out;-why are you against abortion\\n* We need to keep up population growth\\n- isn't using people as breeding stock evil\\n* Yup\\n- so you are evil?\\n* No\\n- that doesn't make logical sense\\n* So?\\n- are you going to change your vote?\\n* NopeNow this seems like it would embarrass the pro-life person, but we exist in a world where generally people say what they believe. But if every religious person starts doing it, others will recognize what they are doing. Some argue this already occurs in a racial context. Racist dog whistles.

Then, the demand is still getting higher and higher since the population's growing. Farmers cannot breed animals for the exact amount of people that are going to consume them, so they just breed more, as many as they can. When it ends up in the stores, people consider how much they need and the price. The amount of people potentially eating that meat at that point in time will be lower by a few people who have chosen to be vegans and vegetarians some time ago, but they didn't affect the supply of animal products, and the slightly lower potential demand will likely cause a slight decrease in the price offered, which might cause many people to buy slightly more than if the price was as high as it could have been. And even if they don't buy more, the demand is still increasing, and farmers aren't going to slow down because they cannot predict the exact amount of people who will eat it, only the fact that they have to breed faster to supply more, at the speed they can.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"I want to say that neither of the targets were behind the lead instigator, they were but I cant find my source for that currently, so Ill just go with the second part of my argument.

To my knowledge they hated Catholics in Salem. More to the point, just because you are led to a particular political view by religion, that does not mean that the view cant also have a secular justification. For instance, Life begins at conception is often not seen as a secular view, but there is nothing stopping a secular person from holding that belief. After all, a zygote is composed of distinct human biomass and is presumably developing normally as a part of the human life cycle. Add to this the pretty normal idea that you cannot force someone to undergo a medical procedure, and the rights of that zygote would prevent an abortion. While you could say that denying an abortion is essentially forcing the pregnancy on the mother, one could counter that not forcing something on someone is barring an act of *commission,* while refusing an abortion is  *omission,* which is philosophically different. For example while it is illegal to *commit* crimes, it may not be required for a civilian to *prevent* those crimes from occurring. This combination of beliefs results in a secular opposition to abortion. With all of this in mind, a religious person may have started from a position of religion but that motivation is irrelevant to any discussion if they can make a secular defense of it, as is very common in less extreme topics. There is a rich history of theologians, especially in Catholicism, of exploring the logic behind tenets of faith. Unfortunately there is little denying that logic gets ignored in favor of pathos and pearl-clutching in many debates, but that problem is hardly limited to any particular groups.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"Here ","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Had to get my qualia removed last year.

The number of meat eaters is increasing, even if their percentage decreases.By this logic no one should ever start any good movement because at the start its small and will have little impact.It depends.

If the movement is about animal rights and it is about trying to get the public to notice that and vote to get the government to force the meat industry to treat animals humanely, then yes, even if it has a small impact, it can do something.

The term used to be medical (e.g. cleansing the body of parasites), but Aristotle famously applied it to poetry and theatre in his explanation of why we watch stories of horror like Euripides' *Medea* where the sorceress nails her own children to the sides of her dragon-driven chariot and burns down her house, leaving the city for Athens, to punish her errant husband; or Aeschylus' *Oresteia*, where the prince kills his mother the queen for assassinating his father as she begs him to spare her; etc.","title":"CMV: most shockcore is normalized sociopathy posing as art"},{"text":"I think Sharia Law will be just fine in our schools by 2050 when Islam overtakes Christianity as the most common religion.","title":"CMV: Religious beliefs are best kept to churches and religious communities/events- not in public policy, and not in public schools"},{"text":"Sorry, u/Dry_Bumblebee1111 C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 3:  **Refrain from accusing OP or anyone else of being unwilling to change their view, or of arguing in bad faith**.

The solid-state of the election is probably a slim Trump victory, so Harris' team needs to keep pushing the pendulum toward her advantage and keep it there to get as many voters registered while they can, to bank as many early votes as they can where they can, and then to finish strong with an October where Trump never gets any traction.Most campaigns are a marathon, not a sprint.

If there are three people running, if first place is getting less than 50% of the vote, it makes political sense for two people to make a deal for one of them to drop out and the other to give some concession to the person who dropped out. You actually saw this happen across France in the most recent election: a couple parties teamed up and had some of their people drop out so that instead of splitting the vote, they outright won a lot of votes.There's two ways to change this: proportional representation, and ranked choice voting.Proportional representation means you vote for a party rather than a person; and each party gets seats based on what fraction of the vote they got. For example, if there are four parties with 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the vote, and 6 seats, the parties would get 3, 2, 1, and 0 seats, respectively. If there were 7 seats instead, the fourth party would get 1 seat.Ranked choice means that instead of voting for one person, you rank everyone from best to worst. Then, you eliminate the person with the most first-choice votes; and anyone who voted for them automatically votes for their second choice; and you keep doing that until you have a winner.Both of these options would mean that multiple parties wouldn't risk \\"spoiling\\" elections by taking enough votes from a candidate they kind of like to cost them the election - which is a very real thing. Look at 2016, when both the Green Party and Libertarian Party candidates took enough votes from Clinton and Trump respectively to swing the election several times; or 2000 when Ralph Nader's presence in Florida contributed to Al Gore's loss of the election; or 1996 or 1992 when Newt Gingrich's participation may have cost the Republican (Bob Dole and Bush Sr., respectively) enough votes to give Clinton the win.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Born to be a polymathForced to specialze?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"How would that be bad?

This means that, yes, in the end, a few animals that would otherwise end up being tortured for meat simply don't exist because the economic incentive isn't there to raise them.

Humans are humans, and power concentrated that tightly is guaranteed to corrupt. Top-down does not work without strict guardrails. The answer is democracy, but not what we currently have.

Just to make things easier, this is a person who is an atheist and always has been, but decided that virtue ethics makes the most sense and applies that to their political decisions. Is that acceptable to you?If it is, then presumably other forms of ethics would be acceptable too - except, apparently, divine command theory. Why is it that their moral system is ineligible to affect policies simply because they decided that's where morality came from?If you argue that it's because in the first case the morality came from the person themselves, whereas with the religious person it came from a text, well. There are plenty of people who determined what is moral based off of a philosophers text.

Look at the lady whose husband was killed at the Trump rally and refused to take Biden's call, because said dead husband wouldn't have wanted her to. Those types of relationships with those power dynamics exist, where a controlling husband will either fill out or at least \\"check\\" every ballot before they get mailed off.2) Many ads that the Democrats are running are specifically stressing that your vote is completely private one you get in that booth. Your parents don't have to know how you voted. Your spouse doesn't have to know how you voted. It's your right and it's a sacred one.I haven't seen a single Republican ad that takes this angle.

If the second is able to be considered within the acceptable applicant ranges for a school like Harvard, that is very impressive by itself but more so that the kid did it with everything going against him. If Im Harvard, I could look at that exactly the way you did and see it as one kid finishing a race a whole minute ahead of another, and from that perspective it makes sense that picking anyone but the winner would be wrong and unfair. And thats what we were and still to an extent are doing, but for affirmative action.The problem we see with that is if were only looking at the finish line and picking the winner, were missing the fact that some of those kids who finish a minute, or even ten minutes, behind the winner had started an hour later. And thats the role of affirmative action. Affirmative action doesnt say shortest time only, it isnt denying the winners admission. For the most part, the students admitted are the ones who have won their races. Affirmative action just says hold on, we can continue to pick the winners but lets also give some seats to the runners who had the fastest times, because they may not have won but theres a good chance those kids are going to pass the winners and we want them to be Harvard graduates. Or we want them to be the ones operating on us and teaching our kids, they may be behind but theyre faster and they could very well end up ahead of everyone else at the end. So where I do understand what youre saying and I think it is a logical conclusion, it also makes sense to have the top performers get admitted to the top schools, but I think it would be unfair to not let the fastest runners have a shot at winning the race. It might mean that whoever was in third gets pulled off the podium, but its not an act of charity to the one who replaces them, its a recognition of their speed and not just the order they crossed the line.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"Still better than outright rejecting it?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"That depends.

However is this really true when in each election there are millions of Americans, who have the numbers to swing an election,who are ignorant and brainwashed, vote based on emotions and not facts or a 30 second highly misleading ad? Democracy might be a fair form of government but fair is not always best as evident by the fact the Founding Fathers gave us the Electoral College. While putting the choice of leadership and policy into people hands is something people really like; I'm not sure I'd say that's the reason why democracy is widely considered the best.When it comes to government there are a number of attributes that are expected or hoped for. In particular, the following seem most fundamental:Stability - because change usually makes things hard for people. Effectiveness - because the more effective the government the more benefits people get out of it in terms of what they put in. Alignment with personal benefit - people want the government to help them, and not hurt them as much as possible.There are other factors, but they can largely be put in terms of these three. For example, people are strongly opposed to corruption, as corruption makes all three of those aspects worse. There are no governments that can score high in both stability and efficiency. In order to score high on one, you necessarily sacrifice the other - the more efficient you are, the faster things change and the less stable things are. Additionally, alignment to personal benefit has potential to change over time. Democracy scores high in stability and has the highest potential to align with personal benefit, as each voter can make decisions to try and align government action with their personal benefit. Many other systems of government directly score lower on average. Feudal monarchies for example are about as stable as democracies, but are generally less aligned with the average persons personal benefit. The only system that seems to really have any potential for being better than Democracy is a dictatorship of some kind. After all, it's the most efficient system by far, and still has high potential for aligning with the personal benefit of the average citizen as long as it's useful for the dictator. But it is also extremely unstable, as is the alignment to the average citizen. Generally, most people prefer the stability of democracy over the the high risk high reward of dictatorship. Now if you want to discuss which form of democracy is the best that's another topic altogether - like if you prefer the democracy of Sweden, the UK, or the USA.","title":"CMV: Democracy is an inefficient form of government and serves citizens poorly"},{"text":"When I say care the most about I mean election they are the most engaged in as your question was about non presidential elections.

Affirmative action doesnt give students better grades or performance reviews, it doesnt give them easier responsibilities or course work, it simply gives them a seat in the class. Like a person who has played piano for a year will know more piano than someone starting out, but that doesnt mean the first is always going to be better, the second could easily have more diligence or skill and be a more successful musician, they just need access to a piano or a way to learn how to play. If they dont succeed,  they dont succeed, they arent getting an advantage. To this example, if a school is aware of this then they may give the younger kids the same attention and coaching as the older kids. They would recognize that these little kids have had nine months less to grow and if you evaluate them within that context then they will be more accurate at identifying the ones who truly are the best. Some younger kids will still be terrible at a sport and some may hate sports, but because we know their size as a 6 year old isnt something they can control and it isnt something thats a true indicator of ability or lack of potential, its dumb that we dont take them seriously simply because we have decided as a society that these decisions need to be be at a point in time instead of in consideration of the full context of whats led them to be where they are at this point in time. The bigger kids would still have the same experience and opportunity to be successful, theyd just have more competition to achieve it. If they dont make the team, it isnt because a little guy got handout or that the less talented person was picked just yo be fair to all birthdays. If they arent picked its because the little guy is a better player, or he may be playing a whole song from memory but hes had a year to get there and the little guy may not be playing a full song but hes only had a month and hes reading music and can play parts of any song. If Im their music teacher, Im going with little guy because he may not appear as impressive at the moment but his skill and effort into learning are showing that hell likely be playing multiple songs and not need to rely on memory well within a year of time. That might suck for the first kid, but in each situation one of them could argue its unfair, and going with the first only benefits him whereas going with the second benefits everyone including the first. The first can still be successful, they can still play the piano and potentially work harder or have better connections that result in a more successful music career, but choosing to pick the second to invest in is the smarter decision.","title":"cmv: Affirmative Action has only been supported for so long because it privileged a majority of people at the expense of a minority."},{"text":"I learned a new word and went down the can trip rabbit hole.

We all know in our heart of hearts it's not... I mean, duh... Doesnt take a rocket scientist.Being a Republican today is just trusting your gut. This doesn't mean not examining facts, it just means interpreting facts normally. Like when I hear a man thinks he's a woman, I think 'huh, that's abnormal'... Because it is. We all know it. Even if that's legally allowed we all know it's abnormal. Same with the border. Hearing your country's door is wide open makes normal people want to close it, just like you'd close your front door if it were open during a storm. But, the Democrats dissociate from their normal responses .It's why so many Republicans like Trump.

However, not keeping up with or accepting changing ideas about a fetus's consciousness or ability to feel pain, and imposing what becomes a strictly religious value on others despite what we currently know in terms of scientific and medical research, that becomes a clear distinction. I would say the best distinction overall, is that everybody shares and accepts math-based science and medical research, because math is the language of our universe. Not everybody accepts religious-based values, because not everybody shares the same religion and it sometimes contradicts with the scientific and medical research. It shouldn't be a part of the conversation, because religion is as I said, about the afterlife. They're stories passed down about the spirit world. And you're totally free to follow those yourself, but imposing your personal beliefs on others is an immoral restriction on freedoms.

Haitian Vodou does incorporate animal sacrifice(as have many other world religions, but thats not what the topic of this discussion is about). Its mostly an antiquated practice, but more traditional practices still involve ritualistic sacrifice. As it relates to *eating* cats though, its not exactly related to Voodoo(Haitian Vodou specifically), but it has been observed en masse in Haiti through their recent economic turmoil and rise of gang leaders replacing what was basically a symbolic government. Its not so much that they choose to eat pets in this instance, when more likely, food supply has been so scarce that Haitians have had to resort to eating stray animals(think of Appalachia as a comparison). So to claim that its happening the way Trump describes it, thats definitely more of a racist non sequitur than what Marianne was saying, where she just wanted to acknowledge that religious practices of Haitian Vodou *do include* ritualistic animal sacrifice, so to assume that Haitian migrants dont do it here isnt exactly fair or verifiable. She clarified as much when she said that she was not validating Trumps claims or accusing Haitian migrants of doing so, only that it *does* have its place in a prominent religion that they might be bringing with them, and that we should be more aware of the possibility of an animal  perhaps even a cat  in your neighborhood being sacrificed if you happen to live among Haitian migrants who practice this form of Voodoo.

These abortions are clearly not easy for a person to go through. I believe that if a woman can endure one, early or late, one or multiple abortions; and not carry so much grief and emotional baggage with them for a lifetime from it, then they have to be some sort of sociopath. Im not saying that to judge or even condemn people. Im just saying that the tremendous grief that comes with these and the emotional scarring isnt as present in the conversation surrounding them. Its all hyper-focused on the definition of a human life, womens rights, and the morality of the act of abortion itself. The turmoil and grief that someone is opening themselves up to with these is not discussed enough. Im sure plenty of women carry that to their graves, and I would argue that its possible many of them feel some degree of regret surrounding their choice at some point in their lives. It should be discussed. The misery we put ourselves through and compound onto our lives when we follow the precedents set by modern and secular lifestyles is barely brought into the conversation. Its always about doing what we want, and as a culture and society, we lean more heavily into that than ever before. Yet, so many people are miserable. Absolutely miserable and deeply depressed. Why is that side of the conversation written off and ignored? Why cant we open up the dialogue to discuss that maybe these ways are more foolish than some people tend to believe?","title":"ABC is wrong. Babies ARE left to die (purposely) after failed abortions.

A lifetime ban or a temporary ban depending on the comment,  a fine, more fines if found repeating the crime and /or using any platform to spew hate again and/or using a platform with false credentials and found guilty of trying to evade ban etc .would all be a better option than a 15 month jail term...The lack of context is why m getting downvoted and I get it but in essence, a comment, (not even a post) however heinous on a closed facebook group should not come under the definition of incitement of hate..it is vile behavior and does deserve a consequence and the consequences are listed above..I've read so much racist shit on this very platform..vile racist shit against so many minorities  and the answer is the account gets blocked after repeated hateful posts violating site wide rules and/or the person is removed from the respective sub. basically you cut the legs of the person..take away their power.

He did leave them a bad unemployment situation, but it wasn't as bad as she stated. Unlike Republicans, we aren't afraid to admit when our candidate misspeaks or even fucks up, and to take them to task over it.I don't believe that she intended to lie, but for the sake of argument let's say that she did -- that would still be *one* lie as compared to 33 lies **from trump**.Moderators absolutely did *not* let her off the hook -- they didn't catch her misstatement when she said it, but the fact-checker did note it afterwards, right before he noted the top five or six or so of trump's 33 lies.  The moderators also allowed trump to rebut *after* Kamala rebutted his statements, and they did so multiple times during the debate. The one time Kamala tried to do the same thing, they cut her off and didn't allow it (although she was able to state what she wanted to state at the beginning of her next regular answer). In allowing trump those additional rebuttals, the moderators gave him about 6.5 extra minutes of speaking time more than Kamala.Even aside from all his lies, trump couldn't manage to answer more than a couple of questions on topic -- he did answer the first couple of questions reasonably well, I'll give him that. But then he went completely off the rails, just ranting and lying and spewing bullshit, which is par for the course from him.  He is not fit to be president, and he never was.

I wouldnt consider the examples mentioned of people Ive known to have been a willing abortion. They didnt want to do it at all bc at our cores, were all humans and grieve over it, but they did it as a form of birth control. They didnt do it as a fun or enjoyable thing. They didnt do it with a light heart and get right back to life the minute they stepped out of the clinic. I have a friend who said she went into a heavy, deep depression for weeks and came very close to killing herself.I think that people like OP should be able to speak up about this bc its a right they have as an American, but I dont think that any adult on either side of the debate would conclude that people are willingly getting these abortions. I guess someone on the conservative end could be intellectually dishonest too by claiming that women are willingly getting these, but I tend to see more sense in that idea considering the fact that it certainly is being used as a form of birth control.

Lebanese-Canadians living in Lebanon were airlifted out when Israel and Lebanon last went to war. Our government worked to get Palestinian-Canadians safely out of Gaza. I think the same is true of Ukraine now. And during the pandemic, Indian-Canadians living in India were allowed back into Canada.The idea that a dual-citizen can reside in one country but oblige their other country of citizenship to save them when things get bad there seems, at the very least, questionable to me. That is a huge privilege to assert.The expectation of safe international travel also seems privileged to me. Im privileged to be cis-het, but I know folks who cant expect to travel safely to vacation spots or to see family members living in countries where homosexuality is illegal.I dont know if your state will protect you so long as you remain within its borders is a practical position. It would put people with a bona fide travel requirement (eg. people in shipping) at risk, and thats not fair either.

At one point, Trump had the highest level since 1948, not the Depression. And it recovered from around 14% to around 6% by the time he left office. Covid would've affected employment no matter who was president, so the only reason I care what Biden started with is whether or not he improved it. He improved it more than Trump, and most jobs went to US citizens. That said, Harris' statement was incorrect and unfair.The military - your fact check said that's true, but there are still some troops in dangerous areas.Fracking - her statement was true. She didn't ban fracking. Her stance on fracking changed to a policy of growing clean energy (which Biden has done) alongside fracking.Trump wasn't fact checked on everything he said - and he made many more false statements that Harris.

Innocent people have already gotten bomb threats since the debate based on this laughably false statement.They fact checked him on abortion for the same reason. \\"Post birth abortion\\" is murder and is illegal in all states.

It's because the wealth gap has gotten so huge that there is no real middle class to save. It used to be that the middle class would drive the economy. Small business. Small loans. Tons of free trade and competition. But the constant monopoly and wealth hoarding has eaten away at the middle class. It used to be that all the middle class needed was some careful deregulation, more access to capital, and low taxes, and they could get shit up and running. And they could actually compete. But now, only giant corporations can compete. And if a small business exists, it exists as a satellite sub contractor. And even then, they are getting bought out like crazy in the manufacturing sector. So Republicans are going to need to become working class folks again and find ways to get wealth to go back to the middle by large margins. This is why Maga has gone mainstream. Because all they have now is culture war. They can't support the middle class. They capitulate to the rich. They don't have any real economic policies anymore. And they are getting dangerously close to ethno nationalism. All because the middle class has vanished. So yeah. They gonna need a new way forward.

We leave more babies in cars. We drunkenly roll over on more babies than that, no one is telling you that you cant have a fucking car or alcohol because some people are pieces of shit and are outliers in the system. You realize that the vast majority of doctors would never just late term abort a baby for funsies, or for sex selection. Youre talking about the occasional fucking wackadoodle doctor, we have them turning half of Hollywood into god damned monsters, lets stop fucking attacking the good people providing maternity care because maybe a couple questionable abortions happened over a DECADE.

Nobody would ever come home.

In reality, everyone negotiates with terrorists all the time. One thing the US does not do, by custom, is pay ransoms, but we agree to prisoner swaps, aid deals, etc. This is quite common and it's in the news every few years or so.You must not know much about current events in Russia. American journalists operated relatively freely in Russia until quite recently. The invasion of Ukraine spurred Russia to crack down on journalists, both foreign and domestic. But up until Gershkovich was arrested, foreign journalists registered with the Foreign Ministry didn't have much trouble. Presumably, Putin saw the opportunity to both silence much of the bad press about the war inside his borders and gain a valuable bargaining chip. It seems Russia is much more willing to imprison bargaining chips nakedly, and the State Department has accordingly adjusted its travel advisories.I think \\"the military of a state with a poor human rights record\\" is a bit weak, but it is certainly miles more than the US government has ever said about Israel or the IDF.Israel has a particular problem, where they quite literally did agree to a 1,000 to 1 swap to get the soldier Gilad Shalit back. I think you misunderstand their social contract, though: because of the proximity, the common understanding in Israel is that the IDF will go very, very far to get hostages back from Hamas. The only way this war can continue is for Netanyahu to pretend that it is the best way to get the hostages back safely.But the broader point: I don't know if Canada just doesn't care about its citizens' lives and freedoms very much, but I would say the public in the US has a strong expectation that nobody takes American hostages and gets away with it, and that the federal government/military will move heaven and earth to retrieve hostages and return them to their families. It seems like you aren't very familiar with how much the State Department respects American passports and doesn't even really care if an outsider wanted to victim-blame you and say you just shouldn't have been there. You ask, \\"Why negotiate?\\" Because citizenship means something, and governments survive on their peoples' confidence that they will be protected and fought for.
