One such voting group is the progressives. A proper primary that wasn't just a formality with progressive candidates able to properly run (and no Biden, him running throws off the primary completely just by him being there) would've had Kamala talking about policy earlier, reduced uncertainty, and given a chance for Kamala to \\"beat\\" or compromise with the progressives instead of just making them feel ignored and snuffed. That increased legitimacy from Biden really helped boost turnout. And if she does win (which she probably would), when someone says something along the lines of what's going on in Palestine, talk about how the Dems would be infinitely better than trump enabling Israel to just glass Palestine and would work towards conflict resolution instead of \\"if you don't want trump to win, I'm talking.\\" That was how Harris addressed every single concern, if you don't vote for me, trump would win and he's the big bad fascist.

This is nothing like the historical playbook either, lets look at 1930s Germany for example. Weimar's democratic institutions, imposed by the Entente, had ZERO legitimacy without the Kaiser at the helm. The politicians running the show were totally beholden to the Great Powers next door. A majority of Germans hated their imposed democracy.The KPD and NSDAP also had fully armed paramilitaries almost 20 times the size of the German Army at the time (100,000 men limited by Versailles, so it was all officers). The SA and Red Gaurds had massive gun battles in the street all over Germany, people died by the thousands and the Heer was powerless to stop it. Unemployment was over 30% and young men universally traumatized by The Great War were all EXTREMELY radicalized towards revolution. The NSDAP grew out of that revolutionary spirit. If it didn't happen electorally in 1933 it would have happened \\"1793 style\\" eventually.  Compare that to Modern America, where the economy is booming and we have a 250 year old Democratic tradition that is universally adored and accepted by everyone (even MAGA base, they worship the constitution). Changing the constitution to enable that truly fascistic form of government would be 10000% political suicide for anyone who even brought it up. So yes, it will never happen here.

No ... no the fuck he didn't. He didn't offer them a solution to their financial struggles. and the guy still in the white house fought for student loan forgiveness, and the next lady wanted to help you buy a house.Trump dug into their little insecurities and he put coal around them and lit a match. The little voice when you're younger that's trying to talk you into the low-hanging fruit of hatred and aggression. Someone like Kamala reminded us that we can do better, but Trump reminded them that they don't have to.

So she convinced herself that with Biden out, she could turn the election into a referendum on Trump. I think she believed that the 2020 election was a referendum on Trump that he lost because America hated him personally, and that she could repeat that by bringing out moderates and Never Trump Republicans.But 2020 wasn't a referendum on Trump the man, it was a referendum on his presidency and the status quo, and going into 2024 though people felt the same way about Biden as they had felt about Trump four years ago. When Kamala came in, those demographics who stayed home or split for Trump in 2016 but turned out in 2020 to win it for Biden, they were excited by the feeling of change. But as the election went on and Kamala kept pivoting towards the status quo, they got just as disillusioned with her as they had been with Biden, and so they stayed home or voted Trump out of spite and we got 2016'd again.The key to winning elections right now isn't about where you fall on the ideological axis. Faith in government institutions is at historic lows, you have even moderate liberals floating ideas like court packing while rank and file conservatives discuss outright coups, and virtually nobody is meaningfully happy. There are a lot of people who don't know much about politics and just want to see anyone fighting to change things. Centrists just don't have compelling answers to those questions that motivate people to vote, that's why they failed in 2016 and 2024, and that's why even Biden's win in 2020 was a serious underperformance versus what people thought he'd get. We've had three consecutive elections determined more by hate of the incumbent than support for the victor, and it's because the median American voter wants change and Democrats keep running as the party of keeping things 98% the same.","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"That's a minority of black men and 24% of black men is different from most white people.","title":"Trump increased his support with women, Latino, black men and young people in 2024"},{"text":"Hes going to fill the White House with people who agree with him this time round.","title":"Trump names campaign manager Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff"},{"text":"I dont get it.

That being the case, the idea is to reform the agencies in such a manner as to make it difficult to undo when the balance of power shifts. The Administrative Procedures Act makes it difficult, if not legally impossible for the executive to fire the career bureaucrats because they arent politically aligned with him, so project 2025 makes an effort to reign in activist bureaucrats politically aligned with the left.  I am intrigued by Viveks plan to simply shutter the agencies, but in that case you run up against the legal question as to whether or not the president can unilaterally refuse expenditures authorized by Congress, as Article II grants Congress plenary budgeting power. How that would be answered by the Court is a guess, and you cannot hinge your entire plan for governing on the outcome of a single legal question. Project 2025 is crafted in such a way as to avoid these potential snares, and I would argue that is why it is flawed; because the laws it trying not to run afoul of are both byzantine and flawed.","title":"Apparently Trump is getting rid of libraries next"},{"text":"It amazes me how much hate these so called wonderful people have for us that vote for who we want to.

I remember. 2008 GOP House leadership was literally prognosticating that the Dems landslide trifecta was a generational repudiation of the GOP. The margins and demographic realignments  by which 2008 was won had commentators questioning that they would never be back in power again for decades and decades, because young people, working class people, people of color, and pretty much everyone had institutionally made their exodus from the GOP in reaction to the Great Recession. I was one of those people who thought about that theoryFunny how that got proven wrong in two short years right after bailout spending and the ACA was passed and the Republican version of the liberal resistance woke up and came to play ball. Democrats have seen this game before. 2016 was arguably an even greater handicap given how unforeseen a GOP trifecta was, with Trump at the top of the ticket. Republicans had a House majority greater than 20+ what theyll end up with now and a Senate that was willing to toe the line, sans McCain, Murkowski, and Collins. How they didnt repeal the ACA entirely was a McCain miracle and nothing else. A razor thin GOP house majority will also probably flip in 2026 once low propensity Trump-only voters get apathetic during the midterms, like they seem to always do, and a 2018 redux happens simply because Democrats remembered to wake up after realizing what theyre in for by 2025, while reliably Trump-only voters stay home because they dont actually care if their congressional district matters to passing agenda. Trump wont be on the ballot again in 2028, so its difficult to foretell if MAGA will fall apart like the Reagan Coalition and disband once the OG can no longer run for elections, or if 95% of that base will still reliably flock to Vance. Somehow I doubt its the latter. The majority of low-propensity Trump voters are attached to him and him alone and do not care about any of the GOPs institutional legacies to want to be just as enthusiastic about Vance. I think there is a solid, solid chance that Dems can win back a narrow trifecta in 2028 as a culmination of those reasons. A narrow thin House majority will also mean the ACA most likely wont be repealed, and the more extreme elements of the conservative agenda could only pass in lite versions, if at all. Too many Republicans in blue states or purple states will make up the new Congress, and I doubt they are willing to permanently anger their electorates (many of whom are probably on the ACA) and be voted out by 2026 simply to appease Mike Johnson and co.","title":"Folks, I know were tired, scared and disappointed.

Service workers had the power to negotiate their hourly wage especially in small rural towns.  All racial groups did better economically during that time.Take that vs what people are feeling now.  Biden did an excellent job managing inflation and showcasing American's economy robustness. (i.e. take our economy vs China's with their housing crisis). It doesn't matter. Democrats tried to explain that -- but people are hurting. being told \\"well things are not that bad\\" to a struggling family is hard to swallow.Both presidents probably did contribute to the economy but both probably had very little to do with the overall benefits. The complete distrust that people have for the democrats show just how disconnected they are to the people who traditionally supported them.

I am arguing that gaslighting voters about their impacts didnt work. In exit polls, 75% of voters report being financially worse off than they were four years ago. 70% report that inflation is still harming them. Instead of denying peoples lived experiences, or lecturing them about why they are wrong, acknowledging the validity of voters concerns about the economic struggles of normal people and presenting a case for how you will improve the situation would have been a smarter move. Trump made the case that the economy would be better under him by pointing out that people were financially better off when he was president. Its not a very strong case, but its the one he made. Harris, in the meantime, made the case that the economy actually is good. That is a weaker case because it directly contradicts what people are experiencing. Learning to talk about the things that matter to voters rather than trying to convince voters to care about something else would be a good lesson moving forward if the goal is to win electionsI am assuming that you and I agree that Trump sweeping the swing states and Republicans assuming control of every branch of the federal government was the worst-case outcome for this election. Im not sure how you can square that with also deciding that there isnt significant room for improvement in how our party reaches voters. If you have made up your mind that telling people that the economy is good when that is not how most of the electorate experiences it was the right strategy, I doubt I can convince you otherwise. I do hope that Democratic Party leaders are willing to be more curious and self-reflective than that though, so that we dont continue doing the same thing and expecting different results.","title":"At a sombre watch party, Arab Americans turn their backs on Harris, open a door to Trump"},{"text":"That's where I'm at now.

This combined with supply chain inconsistency made for an inflationary situation.However, for the most part corporations will not lower prices unless they need to.  The more inelastic the demand, the more likely corporations would slow bringing prices to post inflation normal.  In markets with only a few major players (think corporations, not brands), these businesses can continue to hold the higher prices for mutual benefit until one tries to increase their market share or a new competitor tries to move in with lower costs.But this is all nuanced, you aren't going to win those who have been impacted the most with that.  Instead the argument should have been that Democrats had to save the economy during COVID by using the one tool (government spending) left available after years of mismanagement of the interest rate during Trump's presidency.  They should have indicated that they understood the challenges that came with inflation but that it was better than the economy getting hurt even more than it did and the US came out in better shape than any other country.  Then they should have had a better plan of how it was going to continue to improve and push wages higher to catch up to the impact of inflation.  Maybe even helping encouraging home building to help improve housing inventory, maybe even making rules to discourage investors from pushing families out of the housing market.Instead we got attacking price gouging for food.","title":"Exit polls about the economy clues why Trump won over Harris"},{"text":"Christ, good job he never crossed paths with Corbyn.","title":"Last-Minute Ukraine Aid, Protecting the Polar Bears: Biden Races to Blunt the Impact of Trump"},{"text":"I dont see the contradiction.

An additional 2.3 million removable immigrants were released into the United States between January 2023 and April 2024 and would also be targeted in any mass deportation operation.\\n* A one-time operation to deport these immigrants would cost at least $315 billion, broken down as follows:\\n    * The government would have to spend $89.3 billion to conduct sufficient arrests.\\n    * The government would have to spend $167.8 billion to detain immigrants en masse.\\n    * The government would have to spend $34.1 billion on legal processing.\\n    * The government would have to spend $24.1 billion on removals.\\n* Deporting one million immigrants per year would incur an annual cost of $88 billion, with the majority of that cost going towards building detention camps. It would take over ten years,  and the building of hundreds to thousands of new detention facilities, to arrest, detain, process, and remove all 13.3 million targeted immigrantseven assuming that 20 percent of that population would depart voluntarily during any multi-year mass deportation effort. The total cost over 10.6 years (assuming an annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent) would be $967.9 billion. The annual costs would break down as follows:\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $7 billion per year to conduct one million arrests annually.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $66 billion per year to detain one million immigrants annually, or surveil them on alternatives to detention programs while detention capacity ramps up to one million.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $12.6 billion per year to carry out legal processing for an average of one million immigrants annually.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $2.1 billion per year to remove one million immigrants annually.\\n* To carry out over 13 million arrests in a short period of time would require somewhere between 220,000 and 409,000 new government employees and law enforcement officers, which would be nearly impossible given current hiring challenges across law enforcement agencies. Even carrying out one million at-large arrests per year would require ICE to hire over 30,000 new law enforcement agents and staff, instantly making it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government.\\n* Mass deportation would exacerbate the U.S. labor shortage. In 2022, nearly 90 percent of undocumented immigrants were of working age, compared to 61.3 percent of the U.S.-born population aged between 16 and 64, making undocumented immigrants more likely to actively participate in the labor force. Losing these working-age undocumented immigrants would worsen the severe workforce challenges that many industries have already been struggling with in the past few years.\\n* Mass deportation would hurt several key U.S. industries that rely heavily on undocumented workers. The construction and agriculture industries would lose at least one in eight workers, while in hospitality, about one in 14 workers would be deported due to their undocumented status. Among those industries, certain trades would be hit even harder. Mass deportation would remove more than 30 percent of the workers in major construction trades, such as plasterers, roofers, and painters; nearly 28 percent of graders and sorters of agriculture products; and a fourth of all housekeeping cleaners.\\n* Among the deported would be 1 million undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs, who generated $27.1 billion in total business income in 2022. Losing the 157,800 undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs in neighborhood businesses would lead to disruptions to services that have become an integral part of community life and provide local jobs for Americans.**\\n* The U.S. would lose out on key contributions undocumented households make to social safety net programs annually, including $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare. As the U.S. population ages, the loss of these payments would make it increasingly challenging to keep social safety net programs solvent.**\\n* Mass deportation would deprive federal, state, and local governments of billions in local tax contributions from undocumented households. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. After taxes, they were left with $256.8 billion in spending power, money that could be spent in local communities.**\\n* Deporting undocumented immigrants would separate 4 million mixed-status families, affecting 8.5 million U.S. citizens with undocumented family members (5.1 million of whom are U.S. citizen children). It would slash the income of their households by an average of 62.7 percent ($51,200 per year).\\n* Overall, mass deportation would lead to a loss of 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent of annual U.S. GDP, or $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion in 2022 dollars. In comparison, the U.S. GDP shrunk by 4.3 percent during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009.**\\n* The negative impact would be the most significant in California, Texas, and Florida, the three states that were home to 47.2 percent of the country's undocumented immigrants in 2022 and where one in every 20 residents would be deported.","title":"How the Latino Vote Helped Propel Trump to Victory"},{"text":"Oh man.

Personally, what I think is going to happen is that Republicans in Congress are going to do everything they can to defund planned Parenthood and any other kinds of government public money that could go towards abortion, IVF, etc. Then the states can play the villain and ban abortion, knowing they are probably in safer territory in regards to elections.

The top 20% of Americans by income were projected to receive roughly 65% of the tax savings.[^(\\\\[108\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act#cite_note-110) The TPC estimated that the bottom 80% of taxpayers (income under $149,400) would receive 35% of the benefit in 2018, 34% in 2025 and none of the benefit in 2027, with some groups incurring costs.[^(\\\\[109\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act#cite_note-TPC_CC1-111) TPC also estimated 72% of taxpayers would be adversely impacted in 2019 and beyond, if the tax cuts are paid for by spending cuts separate from the legislation, as most spending cuts would impact lower- to middle-income taxpayers and outweigh the benefits from the tax cuts.[^(\\\\[110\\\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act#cite_note-Vox_PaidFor-112)I get why people voted for him, but the reality is going to be a little bit different that what you all think you voted for.","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Addresses the Nation on 2024 Election Results"},{"text":"You heard about that Iowa poll from that Selzer lady who swore Harris was gonna win Iowa?

The logistics involved in a mass deportation like Trump is talking about are extremely involved and expensive. At some point they will need to hold hundreds of thousands of people at a time while processing them. Its not much of a stretch to think that Republicans that want to privatize everything and think that Joe Arpaio did a fantastic job of running jails will turn to the private prison industry to build facilities. Since they will be maximizing profit, the conditions will be horrible and they will likely force people to perform labor for which they wont be fairly compensated for their work. This will be justified as a measure meant to keep taxpayers from being burdened with paying to house these criminals. With a huge source of exploitable labor, there wont be any incentive to streamline and speed up the deportation process. This may not end up going all the way to Nazi Death Camp but its likely to end up with work camps with inhumane conditions for a slave labor workforce which is a far cry from being sent home.","title":"Trumps election win sends private prisons stocks soaring as investors anticipate hard crackdown on migration"},{"text":"Very true!","title":"On Trump &amp; Ukraine"},{"text":"They're forever married now.

And later, get your grandparents to watch your kids.I don't understand and want to understand why you voters think he is part of your posse?Immigration?  That was on the rise before he left office?  And how is there immigration issues in the first place.  He had 4 years to build a wall and had a trifecta I government.

He's lying about everything related to mass deportation and tariffs and the outcome is close but still higher at 3% due to expected inflation being higher due to other tax policies. 2. He's going to do mass deportation and skip the tariffs, in this scenario we see the interest rate at 0% within 2 years due to a severe recession. 3. He does both and we see 0% by the end of 2025 due to a global depression spawned by a drastic reduction in trade around the world.

If the Republicans re-write and repeal laws that are here to protect, and give legal representation to, illegal immigrants (as they definitely will), tens of thousands of illegals could potentially be trapped in prisons indefinitely, where they will essentially be slaves for the AG industry.Can't afford bail, can't afford an attorney, can't afford travel out of the country?

It is about what the next administration  has proposed including House Republicans \\"if\\" they win the House (not guaranteed at this time).

Because the policy positions proposed would increase inflation by a LOT. Hence the bombout in the bond market. The stock market increased because they are expecting more favorable tax policies and a straight up destruction of the regulatory state. In either case, neither is sustainable. So inflation WILL increase. Guaranteed (IF the administration imposes those tariffs). But, hey, we can buy American, right? Well....

First, how are they going to be replaced? We are already at what is considered full employment so where are the workers coming from? So the price of housing and food is going to increase dramatically. I mean, this isn't rocket science, nor is it science fiction. These will be the results of these policies.   So let's start there.   \\n   \\n   Next... The Republicans are promising (if they win the house) to destroy the ACA. That's not an \\"if\\", that is a fact. So millions and millions of people who have no other way to procure insurance will be screwed - including those who have pre-existing conditions (unless of course, the  Republicans see fit to preserve that piece - but don't count on it). Economists have already predicted that if the next administrations policies are enacted as proposed, the economy will essentially crash. There is no other way for it to go. High inflation, record debt (as happend the last time Trump was in office) and lack of employees in those two industries I mentioned earlier will put us in a depression or at the very least a severe recession. So now, unemployment increases (slowly or quickly, it really doesn't matter) and those newly unemployed will not have the ACA to fall back on for insurance needs. End result? A lot of unemployed people. A lot of people without insurance and I haven't even gotten to the policies that could wipe out Social Security and medicaid if they were enacted. I hope that none of this comes to pass. I hope that the next administration and the Republicans realize the damage that their policies could cause the United States economy. In the meantime, I am also worried about this Supreme Court taking away gay marriage rights (how does that hurt anyone?) and the right to contraception, etc... I am worried about the loss of rights to millions of Americans who are not hurting anyone. I am particularly worried about the right of my daughters to determine, with their doctors, the best course of action for their own reproductive rights.","title":"The Fed cuts interest rates -- but Trump's election could make things trickier"},{"text":"i dont really trust poll numbers so i just have a hard time basing my opinion on that or how she was polling initially. im just going off of what the election results show. i live in a red swing state and a lot of people here actually think kamala is very progressive and a socialist, thats not an exaggeration either, ive heard people say that almost word for word. so if they think she is too progressive then my concern would be what would they think of an actual progressive im a leftist so im all for a progressive being the candidate but i have my concerns with it and electability of a real progressive","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"Tons of things about Trump that you are worried about are plain misinformation.

We had four years of Biden, and people are feeling the economy is worse than ever in their everyday lives, and people are feeling that democracy is under threat more than every in their everyday lives. They don't see four more years of the same policies as the answer to that.There are a lot of excuses as to why the Democrats couldn't do anything else than what they did. That to a degree goes out the window given that SCOTUS legalized the imperial presidency. Biden could have done literally anything, the president is no longer constrained by legality, but he was constrained by his own political imagination and a party that insists that even if their rivals don't have to play by the rules, they do.

Its a simple majority to kill it (since its a Senate rule for Gentlemen and not a Constitutional provision) my money is on it being gone by February or March.

Lock it all in while the iron is hot.We are at the mercy and grace of a Narcissist. As someone who is divorcing one as we speak, they have neither. The cold calculus will be what animates his ego most? If its adulation of the masses including from those that didnt vote for him I think his pressure to act his worst will be tempered. If he is driven by revenge, and cold hard power for his movementit wont last a quarter and it will be the first step in an Americanized version of the Enabling Act. The guardrails of this experiment really dont buttress against much. The Founders set them in place but, per their own words, never believed shameless, faithless leaders could capture the animation of the populace. As my kids now experience first hand, when the narcissist loses their supply, they turn on all secondary sources of it. Anyone who doesnt enable is discarded. He got the mandate. He has the Senate and maybe the house. He has the SCrOTUS all on bended knee. How enabling they will be is all the buttress left.","title":"McCormicks win adds to Republicans Senate majority"},{"text":"Yeah its been overrun with insufferable lunatics that literally handed the keys of the kingdom to .. checks notes ...

Democrats tried to give us a mother when America needed a father, as misogynistic as it may be to us, it doesnt matter if we dont win. When there are wars breaking out, talks of WW3, draft, and anxiety about the economy, people want a strong male hero. We need a candidate who is not above going on podcasts instead of only major media companies. We need a candidate who will make Trump look weak, old and like a loser. Trumpers DO NOT CARE that hes an evil criminal, they care that he projects strength and courage to speak out against anyone and anything. In 4 years we need a young guy. Someone revolutionary, a leader, someone whos going to make America feel like hes going to bring change. I think back to the success of Nayib Bukele in El Salvador. Even though hes a Trump supporter so hate to mention him. But we need someone like that, on our side. They will groom Vance to run in 4 years, Vance is young.

To make something that had been a federally protected right--Abortion--into one that is up to the states limits that right.  State-by-state in the south there was slavery, Jim Crow, and racist statutes that limited voting rights. That is why we took them away from the states and made them federally protected. There is legitimate concern that there could be national efforts to take that right away.  You may not agree that it should be a right, but it is being eroded and taken away.2. For lesbian women, there is legitimate concern that this new government will advance an agenda that makes gay marriage illegal. This discriminatory action would take away their rights to the same protections that heterosexual couple receive.  3. For transgender women, there are many rights that would be taken away, including the right to serve in the military among many others.

But even setting that aside, a 12.1% deficit in popular vote is an enormous gulf to explain away entirely by voters discouraged by superdelegates.

The only battleground states that he won over Clinton were Wisconsin and Michigan (Wisconsin by a lot and Michigan by a little) and we're only really regarding those states as battlegrounds in hindsight.Clinton otherwise beat him outright in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, North Carolina, and with especially decisive wins in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia.

We have to win big or it's better off losing, because none of the real needed changes to our social safety net, inequality (was improved slightly by Biden), climate change are going to be tackled with a Democratic President and slim majorities in Congress.  I don't know if it's possible, but we have to try to steal the whole working class voting block from Republicans since our more ambitious policies are much better for the working class.  Heck Republicans are ready to take a huge fucking dump on them.  The problem is the working class hates the professional class (i.e. people who get a career from an advanced education) more than the ultra-rich and right now the professional class as well as black voters are the base of the Democratic party.Both the Democratic party needs to come towards Bernie and vice-versa and then work with some of these Democrats working with the white working class on a plan that will do a better job in reaching out, but an ambitious agenda is important.While I think the main reason we lost the election is due to post-pandemic inflation, I think the main campaign mistake was fear of Trump.  It worked in 2020, maybe because we were in a national (actually global) emergency, so there was an urgency to remove Trump.  But, this fear drove a more conservative and cautious campaign strategy with non-controversial ideas and focus on Trump's threats (which are very real).

Gavin Newsom called the Legislature back to the Capitol for a special session to bolster civil liberties, reproductive rights and environmental protections.One day after Donald J. Trump declared victory in the presidential race, Gov. Gavin Newsom resurrected efforts in California to thwart the president-elect by asking state lawmakers to pre-empt potential Republican actions that could impact the Democratic-led state.California leaders have long seen themselves as a bulwark against right-wing extremism, and Mr. Newsom has positioned himself nationally as one of Mr. Trumps loudest critics. They could soon be joined in legislative efforts by other Democratic-led states such as Washington, especially given the federal power that Republicans could wield next year if they win the House in addition to the Senate and the White House.Mr. Newsom called Thursday for a legislative special session to begin in Sacramento on Dec. 2, several weeks before Mr. Trump takes office, to safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration, according to the governors office. It will initially focus on funding state litigation around Trump administration actions that might impact civil liberties, reproductive rights, immigrant protections and climate action in the state.The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack  and we wont sit idle, Mr. Newsom said in a statement. California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond.In a social media post, the governor said the state will seek to work with the incoming president  but let there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law.With nearly 39 million residents, California is the nations most populous state. Its economy is so large  dwarfing those in all but a handful of countries  that it can move markets and steer national policy. Throughout the four years that Mr. Trump was previously in office, California sued his administration more than 120 times.The session would be an initial salvo in a contingency plan that has been underway for more than a year in Sacramento, involving not only the governors office but also legislators and state regulatory bodies. Californias attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in May that he and his staff had used Mr. Trumps campaign platform to prepare legal challenges should the former president win another term.California has partnered with West Coast states in recent years on the environment and other issues. There were indications on Thursday that similar relationships could soon emerge to fight Mr. Trumps new administration.Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington noted that our state and others formed enduring alliances for progress during Trumps first term in office, adding that when Trump messed with our state we sued him 97 times  only losing two cases on the merits while he was in office. His successor, Bob Ferguson, has scheduled a news conference on Thursday with the incoming attorney general to discuss the states preparations for when Mr. Trump takes office.Unlike in 2016, when Mr. Trump won in the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, the former president is expected to arrive in Washington, D.C., emboldened with a sweeping victory.I will govern by a simple motto, Mr. Trump told supporters in Florida on Tuesday: Promises made, promises kept.In a proclamation calling for the special session in California, which is expected to extend into next year, when Mr. Trump takes office, Mr. Newsom said the state could suffer significant and immediate consequences from this weeks presidential outcome.His list of concerns included attempts by Mr. Trump to limit access to medication abortion; dismantle clean vehicle policies and longstanding environmental protections; repeal immigration policies such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; withhold disaster response funding and victim assistance as political retribution; and politicize grant programs to commandeer state and local governmental resources for federal purposes.\\nMr. Trumps stated agenda for the environment alone could threaten California climate policies that for decades have helped set the pace for the rest of the world, such as the states rules on vehicle emissions.Mr. Trump and other Republican leaders have denounced policies that underpin the social fabric in California. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would pursue mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. He also criticized California proposals and policies that provide benefits to those immigrants; the state currently provides Medicaid-level benefits to low-income residents regardless of immigration status.\\nConservatives oppose the states constitutional protections for abortion rights and contraception, and they have resented Mr. Newsoms efforts to provide reproductive services to women in states with abortion bans. Californias gun laws are among the nations toughest, and they are routinely tested through lawsuits that wend through federal courts.\\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump sided with Californias agricultural industry in the perennial tug of war over scarce water supplies in the state. In August, he suggested that he would withhold federal wildfire aid if the state did not deliver more water to farmers.Mr. Trump and Republicans also could seek to upend protections for the states transgender residents. In July, Governor Newsom signed a law that prohibited school districts from forcing educators to notify parents if their children ask to use different names or pronouns. The state has engaged in ongoing battles with conservative-led districts, and it is possible that Republican leaders could seek to intervene.\\nCalifornia is not uniformly liberal, and while Mr. Trump lost the state, he still has millions of California supporters and may have gained support in the state based on initial tallies, though millions of votes have yet to be counted.Still, Democrats have firm control of the state legislature. In statements on Thursday, legislative leaders expressed support for buttressing the states legal options.\\nVoters sent a clear message this election, and we need to lean in and listen, said Robert Rivas, the speaker of the California State Assembly. But we also must be prepared to defend California values.Mike McGuire, the leader of the State Senate, said that Mr. Trump had shown in his first term that hes petty, vindictive and will do what it takes to get his way, no matter how dangerous the policy may be. He called the focus on litigation an important first step.States have increasingly deployed lawsuits with success, particularly as political polarization has increased. According to a database maintained by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University, Republican attorneys general have so far filed about 60 lawsuits against the Biden administration, winning about 76 percent of them. During the first Trump administration, Democratic attorneys general filed about 160 lawsuits, winning about 83 percent of the time.","title":"Newsom Moves Quickly to Counter Trump in California"},{"text":"Umm what?

Why do wealth management firms often offer passport diversification services? Profit-driven firms don't offer services nobody wants.LMFAO easy - Financial risk diversification. Wealthy individuals want to build a \\"passport portfolio\\" to diversify their financial risk. This can include investing in real estate and other markets in different countries. Not because they want to escape the fucking political climate of the USA lmfao. Also, these services exist for the ULTRA WEALTHY. Not you standard college educated Data Analyst making 100k a year who myself and the original commenter were talking about.For example, why does Larry Page need a New Zealand passport?Because Larry Page wanted to invest there...same reason as Peter Thiel.

We needed rent and housing costs to come down. We needed someone to put a stop to corporate price gouging. We needed someone to really stick up for the working guy. There are many places in this country where 15$/hr is NOT ANYWHERE NEAR enough to live on. We needed more than a living wage, we needed a thriving wage. These are things people expected from the dems and the dems DID NOT deliver. Instead, they did the barefucking minimum and once again, campaigned on \\"well we're better than those guys so vote for us.\\" We will never do these things with slim margin victories to be honest.  We need to win big.  Now, inflation has stopped and some of the prices have come down or have plateaued.  Harris DID run on plans to deal with price gouging and reduced housing cost with the $15/hr minimum wage.  I don't think the minimum can be increased much more.  However, at least the class whose wages rose the most were the bottom 10 percent.
