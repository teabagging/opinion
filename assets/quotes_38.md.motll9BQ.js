Our societies are becoming better and better, more enlightened and moral, therefore what was once considered normal we are able to evaluate in a way that allows us to see how terrible these acts were.It should be assumed that the development of humanity will continue and our moral values ??will be closer and closer to the ideal. Better educated, more enlightened people from the future looking at us will be able to see our weaknesses in the same way. Certainly, we are currently doing something incredibly cruel that is comparable to slavery or even worse. We do it constantly because we are not able to see how cruel these acts are, and because they are common, they are treated as normal. According to your logic I would like to ask, how can you live with the knowledge that you are a worse person than a slave owner?Shouldn't you stop your life and thus stop unconsciously doing evil?This seems to be the only logical solution, because your flawed moral system and the fact that this cruel act is considered normal and does not allow you to see the evil that you are doing. Only future generations can do this, who, having different moral values ??than ours, will certainly look at you with disgust.Does the fact that you know l that every day you are doing terrible evil by future standards l, yet decide to live and continue doing evil not make you an even worse person? I think you should do the only right thing you can do and stop your life.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Yeah cause thats how the constitution works presidents enshrine things in it.","title":"Women demand deeds not words: Joe Biden must enshrine the ERA in the Constitution"},{"text":"So glad he will do inane stuff like this, but wont call up the national archivist to enshrine the ERA into the constitution.

However, you are on track to something I've observed as well. Music has been used as a tool of manipulation. But how? \\"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration\\".?-Nikola Tesla. Ancient Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, thought of the universe as a musical instrument and is known for developing \\"the perfect fifth\\" used in music today. He explored and defined the relationship between music and math, aka the \\"music of the spheres\\". He said, *\\"The highest goal of music is?to connect one's soul to their divine nature, not entertainment* https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pythagoras-math-reality-music-spheresA while back I came across a book of stories told by a Cold War era military code-breaker. He cryptically spoke how some think in squares (cubes) and some think in circles (spheres). Applying this concept showed me a new angle for observing the blatant symbolism. For example, what is the crucifix? Ultimately, it is the shape of an unfolded cube. A six-pointed star also appears as a cube. What religion worships a cube? If the sphere is perfection and it's impossible to square a circle, why so much cube? Does modern music facilitate the stability of this pseudostructure (cube)?Why do we draw a square around the Fibonacci (Golden Spiral)? I'm still exploring and learning these concepts and their meaning, but my gut tells me the truth is deeper than a nicely packaged 80s-esque, Satanic panic. The symbolism is not one-sided.

If we spend more than everyone else, where is the breakdown occurring exactly?* Complaining that teachers make 30% less than other masters fields is also nonsensical. Some of the more common masters degrees are MBA's or IT types of degrees. These fields also work 30% more hours. The family friendly hours and job security are the flip-side to the lower pay. I don't see a discrepancy here.* You're really kind of dodging one of the primary cited reasons for burn out - frustration / rigidity with administration. Teachers feel powerless and frustrated with disciplinary cases or other, so they want higher pay to compensate.

Even if the root cause turns out to be similar mechanisms, being gay/straight/etc doesn't have the same societal harm as people acting on their pedophilia.

I'd argue that most people who find themselves consuming such products are either sex addicts, porn addicts, or simply perverts.The reason you call them pedophiles is because you, or others, look at the character, and immediately associate them with children. But, usually, the anime art style prevents some consumers of anime and NSFW material from relating the characters to real world counterparts.If I try to word it differently, the consumers of such material are looking for sexual stimulation, possibly with characters they enjoy from other mediums. It is the sexual displays they enjoy, regardless of the characters in them. The characters just have to be designed in a way to not detract from the consumers enjoyment.So for many people, seeing a character that, in context, is a child, immediately brings up real world implications and takes them out of the material. For others, the character is just another amongst many fake people, created only to stimulate sexual thought in the consumer via the activities they engage in within the medium.It's the same as someone masturbating to porn that includes piss. They either enjoy it, are desensitized to it, or dislike it. But none of those specifically mean they want to engage in such activities with sexual partners, nor does it mean they consider such an activity to be stimulating when they see it in person.Compartmentalization is a powerful tool. It is why people can be attracted to Jacob from Twilight, but never think about how disgusting it must be when he's home and his fur gets wet.Likewise, the many of the people who attack children sexually are not pedophiles, but people who are opportunistic. So, not all child molesters are pedophiles.If a child molester, who actively engages in sexual activity with a child, can be officially labeled NOT a pedophile, then the same can be said for people consuming loli/shota, which is not even real, yes?","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"Lock her up?","title":"Sen.

Pedophilia is a sexual attraction to kids, not a desire to hurt them. Setting aside whether loli hentai and similar is a viable outlet to satiate that attraction or just a gateway drug to actually causing harm (I tend to believe the former, since there are no definitive studies either way, and colloquial arguments for the latter ring a bit too close to the whole \\"Video games cause violence\\" nonsense for my tastes), you seem to be conflating having a desire that, due to the nature of consent, would cause harm to fulfill, with having a sadistic desire to cause that harm in the first place. If that were the case, though, there'd be no anti-contact pedophiles, and the only thing keeping them from molesting kids would be fear of consequences.Long story short, the harm isn't the point. In fact, I believe a recent study showed that pedophilia is caused by a cross-wiring between the part of the brain that specifically gives you *protective* feelings for kids with the part of the brain responsible for sexual arousal, causing the latter part to activate when the former does. This tracks with the fact that a lot of actual child predators aren't, medically speaking, pedophiles, because rape tends to be about power much more than attraction, and kids just so happen to be easier for adults to abuse their power over, if they're so inclined. Whether or not one is inclined to be a rapist and whether or not one is inclined to be a pedophile have little bearing on one another.Setting all that aside, though, even for those who do have a sadistic kink specifically for the idea of harming kids, I don't think it's wrong for think it's wrong for them to have a space where they can act out their fantasies with others similarly inclined. Lots of other kinks manage it just fine, even on Reddit. Orientation play comes to mind, where men fantasize about \\"raping lesbians straight\\", to say nothing or rape fantasies in general. On the drawn side of things, there are also Subreddits for gore, snuff, etc, and as far as I'm aware, there's no trend of people on those Subreddits going on to become rapists and murderers. In fact, it's funny that you should mention banned Subreddits, since the first that comes to mind is r/ageplaypenpals. It was a r/dirtypenpals equivalent dedicated to roleplay involving characters (Not users) who were under 18. To my knowledge, there was absolutely zero proof that the Sub contributed in any way to child sexual abuse or the spread of CSAM, but some journalist with a chip on his shoulder took screenshots of posts with stuff like \\"I want to play as a dad raping his daughter\\" or whatever, publicized them while saying \\"Look at how sick these people are! Imagine what they're doing in DMs!\\", and enough people who couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality got mad that the Admins stepped in and shut it down for no good reason.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"I sure hope not.","title":"Trump vows to direct DOJ to pursue death penalty in wake of Biden clemencies"},{"text":"INFO: how many Americans died becasue of an -- at best -- bungled response to Covid-19?Isn't that considered involuntary manslaughter?","title":"Trump vows to direct DOJ to pursue death penalty in wake of Biden clemencies"},{"text":"Believe it or not, lobbying is literally just asking politicians whether they would support something.

The expansion of spacetime is an evidence-based conclusion about the observable universe, not a declaration about unobservable regions. If you assert something exists beyond spacetime, its your responsibility to provide evidencenot to insist that science disprove your speculation.I believe what were really arguing about is just that you find the premise that spacetime could be expanding into nothing so unintuitive that you refuse to even entertain it. That is understandable, as these concepts simply are unintuitive to our experience of space and time. As has been noted before, by several people, your inability to wrap your head around it doesnt mean it isnt true.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"TL;DR: \\"I'm strongly opposed to the anti-trans stuff in this bill, but not enough to actually do anything about it and veto the bill.

From the the initial instinct to try to exfiltrate Zelenskyy when the first Russian attacks began, up until today where Ukraine is still restricted in it use of medium range weapons that can hit Russian soil, the Biden Administration has been behind the curve. The American public at large has no idea how much the war in Ukraine, along with sanctions, has crippled Russia to the point where Putin could do nothing to continue to support Assad in Syria, and has had to get a modern day pathetic analogue of the Hessian army in the form of North Koreans to act as cannon fodder to avoid conscripting Russian men for the meat wave tactics their army uses.              In my view, the Putin regime was scant months away from, if not collapsing, facing huge incidents of domestic unrest.

For instance, do you believe in universal right &amp; wrong? You talk about evil, therefore you must have some baseline to define that evil. So do you believe in God, or any form of higher universal authority? If so, then its easy to say we should judge all ages by the same metrics of right &amp; wrong because they derive from God &amp; apply to all ages of humanity.However if you DO NOT believe in God, then right &amp; wrong are only defined by the earthly authorities of the age, &amp; vary between nations &amp; peoples, in which case slavery at the time &amp; places it was legal was not wrong. No one can argue universal authority if they dont make an argument for God. Without a real God, earthly men in government are your law-givers, therefore if they say slavery is good, slavery is good. You can only judge it as bad in the modern age because our law has done away with it.So to argue that slavery is always wrong is to argue that God exists &amp; His universal morality exists. Which is great. Im on that side. Im in favor of Gods law being applied to everyone equally so far as they are taught it. One cannot be held accountable, at least to the same degree, for committing a wrong that they do not know is wrong.So in that vein, I would argue no, you cant judge everyone in the past completely equally because they dont all have the same knowledge of right &amp; wrong as future generations. Even in the same age, not everyone has the same moral understanding, which is why Christians try to evangelize, so everyone can be closer on the same moral playing field at least. I do believe everyone has a conscience that naturally leans toward universal moral good if you dont habitually defy your conscience, so even not knowing a moral law, everyone SHOULD have the mental capacity to understand what FEELS wrong. People talk about what FEELS right or wrong to them all the time, so theres no disputing people have that capacity, despite a lack of knowledge of whats actually right. Therefore, though not everyone should be judged the exact same across ages &amp; continents, everyone SHOULD be judged to a degree according to their knowledge of moral law and their moral conscience.Only God can really execute that judgement, because only He truly knows what we know or understand internally &amp; when we are aligned with our conscience or not. But as far as mortal judgement goes, its okay to say  today that that was wrong and we should change it if it is still happening, but we should avoid assuming someone acted out of an evil instinct in the past just because they participated in a common, accepted practice of their age. Because the only thing you can really try to judge is whether they purposely ignored God &amp; their conscience in doing so. Because the mortal law said it was okay. So for those that didnt believe in God at the time, the earthly law of the age was their only metric to judge right and wrong by. Which made slavery a moral right for them. Christians today will judge it as always wrong because Gods law spans all of time &amp; all people, but non-Christians or folks who dont believe in universal law have no solid argument against its wrongness, therefore cannot judge the people of the past.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"No Hes talking about future cases.","title":"Trump vows to direct DOJ to pursue death penalty in wake of Biden clemencies"},{"text":"Unfortunately, some people who have been convicted of crimes will never spend a minute behind bars.

So let's take someone like Abe lincoln who said in the presidential debates that the white man will always be higher up than the black man and who said repeatedly that he's not help with blacks in the south. And let's also remember how he advocated against rights for gay people. What he did for black people he was immense. Absolutely the north winning the war led to better treatment and to the eventual civil rights movement.  But imagine if he only fought the war but didn't support the 13th amendment? Or didn't emancipate slaves? Imagine if the civil war had ended right back at the institution of slavery, the end of that institution was no guarantee, and he advocated in ways that were so very impactful. As a gay person, I could say that Lincoln WAS a homophobe, and what an awful piece of shit he was to not advocate for our rights and how could he have said that stuff against my rights. And people in the future would be right to use modern standards against me too. So - what does this accomplish? Lincoln's denial of rights for gay people is what you'd expect for his time. The point is that his views on gay people shouldn't overshadow the real impact he had on race relations. At the time, having a tolerable view of black people was a lot, a view that went further than \\"they're beneath us\\" would be revolutionary. Telling Lincoln \\"you asshole, you didn't help us gay people\\" would go nowhere, it wasn't going to be an issue he was going to advocate for. Which doesn't mean segregating gay people is right, it wasn't right. But the role he played wasn't going to extrapolate to everyone everywhere in every way. Just as you or me aren't likely to have reason to advocate for rights in some issue we're not familiar with, but people in the future might. All that said, if instead of making a big difference to black people in America and having a standard \\"gays are beneath us\\" attitude, if he had made his living by going out and rounding up the gays for someone else's execution, we *would* ask why he did that. It'd be different if someone was actively contributing to oppression, rather than having a blind spot in something they weren't directly involved in.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"How can he plead not guilty if he doesn't remember ??","title":"Former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch CEO, who is charged with sex trafficking, has dementia, lawyers say"},{"text":"Do you want to be a waiter?","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Unbourboned by what has been","title":"Teamsters president says Kamala Harris could only answer 3 of their 16 questions before arrogantly saying she was going to win with or without you."},{"text":"people knew slavery was bad, thats why they didnt want to be slaves lol","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"I hope Trump gives the cishets who voted him back into power what they voted for.

One cannot disprove a negative. Asking for evidence that time and space do not exist outside the observable universe is inherently unreasonable because it requires disproving the existence of something for which there is no evidence. This is not a failure of the Big Bang Theory (BBT); it is a failure of your argument, which presupposes the existence of time and space beyond the observable universe without evidence. Your speculation about what lies beyond observation is unfounded, and as such, the burden of proof lies on you to substantiate itnot on others to disprove it. As noted before, you could posit any fantastical thing via the same means youve repeatedly deployed here. You could say, there is no evidence that the universe was not created as a result of a truly gigantic and divine release of Gods flatulence. If physicists dismissed this premise out of hand, that would not be an act of faith on their part. It would be an adherence to the laws of logic which recognizes that things which can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Though your proposition (that spacetime predates the Big Bang) is far less silly, its just as fundamentally unfounded as the God farts. That spacetime is itself expanding *is* well founded, as Ill reiterate below. You also claim, once again, that the assertion that spacetime itself is expanding is without evidence. This is demonstrably false. There are decades of robust, empirical evidence supporting the expansion of spacetime, including redshift data from distant galaxies, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and observations of the universes accelerating expansion through supernova data. These observations do not merely suggest that matter and energy are filling in space, as you imply; they demonstrate that spacetime itself is stretching, causing the distances between galaxies to increase over time. This conclusion is not speculative; it is derived from measurable, observable phenomena and represents one of the most well-supported findings in modern cosmology.Finally, I have no trouble understanding your point. I am disagreeing with it, and I have provided both logical arguments and empirical evidence to explain why your claims are incorrect. The BBT does not speculate about unobservable regions; it describes the observable universe, and the expansion of spacetime is a conclusion grounded in evidence, not an unfounded assertion. Your argument, on the other hand, hinges on speculative claims about what exists beyond observation, shifting the burden of proof inappropriately onto others. This is why your critique does not hold up under scrutiny. Until you have grasped and understood this underlying logical error, you will not make progress in clarifying your confusion.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"Dementia and affluenza for the rich.Lifetime prison with no parole for everyone else.","title":"Former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch CEO, who is charged with sex trafficking, has dementia, lawyers say"},{"text":"Has anyone been over to r/Politics to see how they're reacting?

It still exist to this day in some places in the world, but change comes slowly or violently. Or so we thought.Now let us look at the last 100 years.... WOW!! women's suffrage, civil rights better right for the LBGQT community, hate crimes recognized as a thing, 18 years of age recognized nearly globally as the \\"age of consent\\" sexual identity, sexual harassment recognized as a crime. mental health recognized as being just as important as physical health perhaps more. I am sure I missed things as this is mostly just the warp speed social growth our society has seen mostly in the USA, I am certain I missed things others could name that happened else where. (may need to make a post about that sometime) Does all that growth villainize the \\"hero's of yesterday.No not really, it just takes the rose colored glasses we looked at them with off, does owning slaves diminish the ideals of the Constitution  of the United States, because most of the authors and signatories were slave owners. Again no, and I can hear you now Why the hell not!! good question. Those men were smart enough to realize the world was going to change and grow that the value and morals of today would be very different from the values and beliefs of tomorrow. They wrote a document about  freedom and equality, and then outlined how to change said document to make it better, to make it fall in line with present morals. Would FDR still be the man we needed to get out of the Great Depression knowing what we know about him know? Yes.Does it lessen JFK's speech \\"Ask not what your country can do for you....\\" knowing what we know about him now, does it lessen his legacy of the space race, of boldly saying  \\"We will put a man on the moon before the decade is out\\" and then putting money and people in place and giving scientist the freedom to brainstorm and think shit up to make it work? No.Do I still think Thomas Jefferson or Roosevelt or Kennedy are the great men or yore I once did, not really. But I do not believe their \\"sins\\" diminish the legacy they left of good works.  Could they  have been better, done better or even been more empathic? most assuredly What about Malcom X or Dr. King, their legacies have also been somewhat tainted by things we learned about them after their deaths. Does that lesson their legacy of civil rights leaders of the 20th century in the US? No.Judging the Historical figures of the past and villainizing them destroys everyone you could look up to and learn  \\"what is a good person, how do you be a good human?\\" from. So while most people will take this type of judgement as a chance to destroy the hero's of the past, I think instead it should allow us to realize, they were just humans, fallible and broken like  the rest of us. They did good things but they could have done better. Because no matter what historical figure you choose someone will come along with a fact about how they were not all that. Some of our hero's have some pretty gross warts, but they still did the best they could in the society they lived in at the time they lived. We look at their mistakes, and remember so we do not repeat the sins of our ancestors, and record ours so that our descendants do not repeat ours.Dr. King's dream is still worth aspiring too, even with what we now know.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Trump whining because he cant kill ppl.

Most preschool settings will have one teacher/supervisor who oversees a team of aides or childcare workers. It's not necessarily a cost savings to replace a teacher with a \\"team lead\\" level childcare worker.2) Private preschools aren't set up for disabled students or students with delays. Universal Pre-K replaces other government programs that provide those services, often in a less efficient way (ex: it's more efficient for one speech therapist to provide services to many kids in a school setting versus a therapist operating a private clinic with the associated overhead and having to bill Medicaid for one-to-one services).3) The quality of private childcare varies dramatically. Some low-quality daycares just park the kids in front of a TV all day and do no educational content. They will keep the kids safe and alive, but that's about it. Universal Pre-K has shown the biggest benefit to low-income families who can't afford a decent day care, especially in states that have few regulations. This study was done in New Haven, Connecticut with mostly middle-income families.4) Free/subsidized private childcare only works if there are private childcare facilities with open capacity. One of the major problems since 2020 has been closure of daycares and preschools, particularly sudden or unexpected closures that force a parent out of the workforce. Another problem has been limited capacity and long wait lists, with some areas experiencing shortages so severe that parents need to reserve a spot before they even get pregnant. Tying Pre-K into the existing school system makes it more reliable so parents aren't fluctuating in and out of the workforce.","title":"Parents' Earnings and the Returns to Universal Pre-Kindergarten"},{"text":"Took my liberal aunt to breakfast for Christmas and at the beginning she looks at her phone and said she got a text from Tim Walls....took me a while and I realized I've already forgotten about Tim Walz","title":"Teamsters president says Kamala Harris could only answer 3 of their 16 questions before arrogantly saying she was going to win with or without you."},{"text":"Mexico has large pockets of French, Spanish, and/or German-looking people, and I assume Panama is purely because of the financial corruption and regaining control over the Canal","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 24, 2024"},{"text":"Wouldnt this be more of a plutocracy?

Once in office they are of course indebted to the people who fund their advertisements. So in practice, policy decisions are plutocratic, even if the method of choosing who in are the policy decisions is democratic.

I have made no such claim.My only claim, which I don't understand why it's so hard to understand, is that we *don't* know the limits of space (if there are any) and that the BBT shouldn't be claiming things that we don't know, can't prove, and have no evidence of. I've yet to see you address this. In fact, you have repeatedly claimed that we do have evidence of this despite finally admitting in this comment that we don't.Science operates within the limits of what can be observed and tested; it doesnt speculate about what might exist beyond those boundaries without evidence to support such speculation.And yet you, and many scientists are.

Let's take something a bit trickier, corporal punishment for kids. It's generally viewed as morally unacceptable (or illegal even) in most Western countries today, but it was extremely common just a few decades ago.Most adults today were likely smacked as children, at least a few times, by their parents. And we're not talking about beatings here. Just light smacks as punishment.I think it's fair to accept that most adults back then thought this was an entirely reasonable way to raise children and that, ultimately, it was an effective way to regulate their behaviour and teach them. It was common to think that not punishing bad behaviour was actually negligent and somehow indulgent on parents' part - \\"spare the rod, spoil the child.\\"Are you going to say that any parent who smacked their children like this from, say, the 70s or 80s is a bad person? Equivalent to someone who smacks their children today, now that society has generally taken the view that smacking shouldn't be tolerated?Or let's take attitudes towards LGBTQ people. I think we'd agree that people are much more tolerant, positive, and understanding towards LGBTQ people today that they were 50 years ago. Is that really because we're morally \\"better\\" people than we were 50 years ago? Or is it because people today understand LGBTQ people and issues much better than in the past, are far more likely to know and have spoken to openly LGBTQ people. It's obviously the latter. So is it completely fair to judge people from the last more harshly when they haven't had the benefit of living in what's undoubtedly a more informed environment?I think that's an overly simplistic view.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Its okay to say you dont care about trans people,I disagree.

Judging the past this way makes sense IF the person youre talking to believes that they knew they were inherently wrong to do it.While I agree that people should be judged by a standard relevant to today (preferably your own perspective), I think its also important to register the basic morals and intentions of people in the past as well. Slavery was a big part of our history, but not everyone who practiced it should be condemned equally for what happened. Some respected and worked to help both the slaves themselves and organizations willing to fight for them, while at the same time owning and keeping slaves themselves. Things like these arent so much the person choosing evil, but choosing to make better out of an evil system, despite their own flaws.But as someone else pointed out: So people living in the ancient near east who believed that the earth was flat, that their children should be offered on a fiery altar to appease the angry god molech, and that the storm god baal wished for his peoples to emulate him in conquering the surrounding nations should be judged by those of us living in a post-scientific cosmology.My answer to this is YES. Somewhat. There are things that they shouldnt be judged completely for (believing in baal, moloch, etc., or that the earth was flat), or at least judged from the understanding that going against some of these beliefs were dangerous. But once you arrive at child sacrifice, objective morality kicks in, and we understand instinctively that they knew what they were doing. In these cases go all out, and if you see any exceptions to the norm of that time good for you, but we the people of today understand the same basic concepts of good and evil that the past did, and they have no excuse except for the nuance of their time (and in this case there doesnt seem to BE any nuance).All that to say that there is a time and place to hold the standard, but also that some judgements need to appreciate those trying to make a difference.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"3 of 16 is good for her.

It is important, in my opinion, to learn about motivations behind peoples actions, especially when they bring harm to other. If we simply say \\"this is evil\\", without at least trying to understand why it was done, we can't learn **why** it was evil. If we reduce harm to others into being just \\"evil\\", we wilfully ignore the fact that harm, ultimately, is subjective. Self-defence harms another person. Fighting the Nazis hurts other people. Moving on from that, I'd like to reverse this logic in order to demonstrate what I'm talking about. Imagine being a citizen of Ancient Rome, who is anti-slavery. Slavery is institutionalized to a massive degree, there are entire systems of law, enforcement, and management built around it. Everyone engages in it indirectly because the most basic services of society are performed by slaves, and many engage in it directly. You can even sell yourself into slavery to avoid poverty. And yet, you are strongly against it. It is simply against your morals. You refuse to take part in such a society, and you fight it with all your might, even though you have basically no chance of changing the system. Now imagine being a citizen of Western Europe or the US, in 2024. The society you live in has no slavery. It is considered to be a horrible, abhorrent crime, and it is recognized and fought internationally as such. Only the darkest, most vile places and people on the planet are engaged in the practice, operating under no illusions of normality, choosing, explicitly, to engage in something they know is evil out of greed, or worse. In this world and society, you are against slavery. Obviously you are. Every single person around you is. Even the people considered \\"radical elements\\" in your country are against slavery.

Which of the two is more virtuous, more just?","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Well, I did originally argue that it is entirely acceptable for people of the future to judge us, myself included.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"How many billionaires are there actively involved in politics?

This is not true. Anti-slavery uprisings, books, speeches, activists or what have you have existed probably as long as slavery has. This obviously means that for certain people (mostly slaves), it was known that slavery was a bad thing, yet it was still 'normal'. The fact is that, slave owners and those who supported slavery, made conscious choices and asserted their agency as moral agents in choosing to support slavery, knowing that it was 'bad' but justifying it in some ways.No one is re-writing history, it is simply about regarding people are fully aware and moral agents rather than mindless nobodies:I soften my condemnation of Grandfather on the basis that, given his upbringing, he is not fully responsible for his views on the subject of race. But isnt that a bit like saying that, given his upbringing, he couldnt really be expected to recognise that all races are equal? Once we have put the point in these terms, however, it begins to suggest that I am looking down on Grandfather. I am making allowances for him. I am not holding him to the standards that I would hold myself and others of my own generation to. Isnt there a suggestion in this thought that I am not treating him as a fully responsible adult? I am letting Grandfather get away with something that would be utterly outrageous in anyone younger.  \\n\\\\[...\\\\]Grandfather, we seem to be saying, cant be expected to recognise certain moral facts that we ourselves would regard as absolutely basic. But that means that we regard him as lacking in a basic moral capability. In failing to bring my condemnation home to Grandfather on the grounds that he isnt to be expected to understand, am I not being dismissive of his moral capacities? I regard him as morally unenlightened, and even irredeemably so. I dont think that he can be expected to understand certain C to us C fundamental and plain-as-day moral truths. If I dont think that he could be expected to grasp this clear moral truth then I do not really take his racist views seriously. This is not to say that I dont disapprove of his views, but rather that I no longer take him as one who has these views seriously. I dont hold him to account for them, ask him to justify them. This is because I dont ascribe him the authority to understand the relevant data in this field of awareness. I no longer understand what he thinks or says on this subject as an opinion worthy of consideration, even worthy of refutation. I dont disapprove of his views as the views of an agent like me. I no longer think of him as one with whom I should argue about this matter. If I think that he cant be expected to understand these truths, I no longer understand him as one who is responding C however badly C to the same field of moral awareness as myself.Bennett, C.

The move to add more names to Hong Kong's wanted list comes as the city strives to revive economic growth and refurbish its international reputation after a years-long crackdown on dissent that attracted global criticism. Chris Tang, the security secretary, accused the group, all based overseas in countries such as Britain and Canada, of the crimes of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The six included Britain-based commentator Chung Kim-wah, former head of a pro-independence group Tony Chung, Carmen Lau of the Hong Kong Democracy Council and Chloe Cheung from the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation. \\"(I) will not back down only because of an arrest warrant and a bounty,\\" Lau wrote on X. \\"And I hope to have every one of you standing with me in this fight for Hong Kong.\\" On Instagram, Cheung, 19, wrote, \\"Fear cannot restrain me, and suppression cannot silence me.\\" China and Hong Kong authorities have defended the clampdown under sweeping national security laws, saying stability has been restored after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019. Greg May, the U.S. Consul General to Hong Kong and Macau, said on social media platform X that Washington denounces the new bounties and the cancellation of passports, calling on Hong Kong to \\"stop using its national security laws to silence dissent.\\" Also on X, European Union foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said in a statement that the EU condemned the new round of arrest warrants against activists in exile. \\"The continued extraterritorial application of the National Security Law adds to our concerns and hurts the citys attractiveness as an international business hub.\\" Separately, British foreign minister David Lammy called on the Hong Kong authorities \\"to end their targeting of individuals in the UK and elsewhere who stand up for freedom and democracy.\\" \\"We will not tolerate any attempts by foreign Governments to coerce, intimidate, harass, or harm their critics overseas, especially in the UK,\\" he said in a statement. \\"This Government is deeply committed to supporting all members of the Hong Kong community who have relocated to the UK.\\" Tang said the six pro-democracy campaigners had engaged in activities such as speeches, social media posts and lobbying for Hong Kong officials and judges to be sanctioned by foreign governments, thus endangering national security. In a statement, China's office, opens new tab for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong said it supported the actions, as the individuals had engaged in \\"anti-China\\" and destabilising acts.

Otherwise it's the pot calling the kettle black, and an ironic finger-pointing exercise.And I think that moral superiority is (a) hard to prove, and (b) largely contextual. Since I don't live in a time where slavery is normalized, it's impossible for me to claim that I wouldn't participate. Sure, I'd like to think that I'm a better person than that. But, realistically...what if I was born into a slave-owning family? Raised to believe it was okay? Indoctrinated to believe that I was the superior species and those \\"others\\" are less than human? What if I didn't own slaves, but was complacent in consuming products made through slave labor? Although it's a **very** hard pill to swallow, it's logical to admit that I might not break out of my shell and have a moral awakening to rebel against my upbringing.As a rough modern analogy, take eating meat. I regularly eat meat, but it's hard to deny the ethical issues around it (both humanitarian and environmental). I'm nearly positive in hundreds of years people will look back on modern slaughterhouses and shake their heads at the immoral nature of the system. But it's hard for me to stop participating when I was raised in a very carnivorous world where eating meat is abundant, normalized, and the details of slaughterhouses are largely shielded from my view. If you're vegetarian, swap in any number of things: buying clothes made from outsourced labor, throwing trash into landfills to be shipped to China, using products from unethically ran companies, etc.So when people say you cannot judge historical figures by modern standards, in my opinion what they're calling out is the above. You cannot do so fairly, because it's ignorant to assume that you're somehow actually morally superior. You're likely not; and if you were raised in the social context of the past, it's a crapshoot as to whether you'd be on the \\"good side\\" or the \\"bad side.\\" Once again, that's a tough pill to swallow and most people will clutch their pearls at the idea, but it's the truth.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Every one of us is in dangerwomen, kids, POC, LGBTQanyone who isnt a wealthy, white cis man.

On the other hand, there are many false beliefs that arent obviously motivated by bad ethics. Those may lead to bad ways of interacting with the world, but we probably shouldnt judge people too harshly for not having modern science at their disposal.

We make moral judgements of contemporary actions because we are trying to make good decisions about the present. We want to use ethics and morals to inform our decision making.

You're basically playing a big game of \\"what if\\". It might make for an interesting discussion, but it doesn't serve a purpose beyond that.Examining historical figures or actions in their historical context, however, can provide insight on how major decisions are made or how people influence the world. Understanding how things like slavery were justified, excused, and normalized in the past can help us avoid similar mistakes in our own futures. Judging the past by modern moral framework also makes the mistake of putting modern frameworks on a pedestal. It implicitly leads us to view our current way of thinking as objectively better. From an *academic* point of view this is a type of bias that needs to be elminated in order to approach a subject as honestly and neutrally as possible.You have every right to personally think that Abraham Lincoln, for example, was a bad guy in the modern context because he supported the Corwin Amendment protecting slavery or, in the first emancipation proclamation (1862), he offered to let confederate states keep their slaves if they rejoined the Union before the deadline. Today this could be judged as offering slavery as a bargaining chip, which is utterly distasteful. However, in the context of the time period, I think most historians would argue that Lincoln was a key figure in moving toward the abolishment of slavery.We should look at our history and be proud of how far we've come, but we should also look at our history in the appropriate context to understand why it played out the way it did.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"You have confidence in something, while they are objectively showing everyone the opposite.","title":"President Joe Biden signs defense bill, the first federal anti-LGBTQ+ bill in decades"},{"text":"No. [This site states that only 8% of the prison population is in privately owned prisons.](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/private-prisons-in-the-united-states/)","title":"Biden commutes sentences of nearly all federal death row inmates"},{"text":"If you believe that, also believe that is fair to judge the rightness and wrongness of historical people based on modern concepts of morality, then why don't you act now as if what you do could potentially be morally wrong in the future?

What I'm about to say has been a thought in my head for a while.The argument I'd make to you is this...Oftentimes, those people had sound justifications and arguments they made that explain their policy decisions. Justifications and arguments we are completely unaware of now because we never read their writing, and could actually be debated pretty rigorously either way by two intelligent people. So much so that there's not one objectively just view in a lot of cases.Take Roman expansionism for example. One of the arguments for it was that it builds a large enough buffer zone between Rome and her enemies such that Rome may fall through a land invasion and Rome ultimately remains defended.Sure, you could debate it, but it's still a sound argument and was made by incredibly smart people of the time. It was ultimately a successful policy that achieved one of its purposes... the defense of Rome from an outside force.Apart from that, when we look back in history it's easy to see those people as less intelligent than us, or that their political theory was less advanced, or that we have made \\"progress\\". But any reading of a political book by any historical intellectual will show you the opposite.Many of the people behind those policies were smarter than both me and you. Yet it's very easy to second guess them without stopping to think WHY they believed it was important. And that's the key to it all...We always dismiss policies or practices of old without stopping to think why they existed in the first place, or what was the thinking behind it. And the thinking was usually sound because humans haven't gotten more intelligent over time. Before you outright dismiss something or judge some historical practice, first read into why it was that way from any primary source, and then make your judgement.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Im talking about rape porn vs Loli porn here as an example, The comment of yours I initially replied to specified incest and CNC, so that's what I addressed.

In the absence of that knowledge, cultural and racial prejudice was largely the only lens through which to view other humans.Also, it was not clear philosophically or theologically - or to practitioners of certain world religions at least - that the other animals experienced the world in much the same way we do, with deep pleasures and pains, inner lives, loves, etc. We take for granted our education, leisure, and knowledge of these facts, and so we view millennia of people whove treated animals as if they were mere automata or machines for work or meat as backward. But we have the luxury to know what brains are and how they work, and to measure what occurs there. The people in prior times had no such luxury, and often their faiths provided sufficient reason to ignore any of the more obvious signs of sentience.So thats a few examples of my argument. In order to act morally, one must know the moral consequences of ones actions in the world. The more we understand the world and who else has as much claim to moral consideration as we do, the more accurately our moral behavior can map onto our longstanding moral principles.In short, bare ignorance is exculpatory in many cases.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"how about don't pivot away from it like they did with calling them weird","title":"Democrats President Musk strategy wasnt subtle  but it worked: His almost comical obsession with showing everyone how strong and manly he is"},{"text":"Pinged ED-POLICY ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20ED-POLICY&amp;message=subscribe%20ED-POLICY) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20ED-POLICY&amp;message=unsubscribe%20ED-POLICY) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=ED-POLICY&amp;count=5))[Root comment link](/r/neoliberal/comments/1hldmud/parents_earnings_and_the_returns_to_universal/m3lab98/)[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Parents' Earnings and the Returns to Universal Pre-Kindergarten"},{"text":"I see youre adhering to the all people suck philosophy.

One of those lenses is a modern lens (i.e. judging history by modern standards). It is absolutely worthwhile to look at history and judge colonialism, slavery, wars of conquest, etc. as moral failings. It can help us develop and understand our own morality when we see how different actions affected different groups throughout history and the harm/evils that were inflicted. This also helps us understand how far we've come, and can hopefully help us determine where we still need to go, and maybe avoid repeating similar mistakes.But I also think it is valuable to look at history with a, for lack of a better term, \\"historical\\" lens. That is, looking at things from the point of view of the context of the time. At least, it is a useful lens if you want to actually study and understand history. You need to put yourself in the mindset of the time if you want to understand why certain actions were taken, or not taken (especially considering the power of societal norms when it comes to moral development); to understand why and how history has taken the course it has. This can also hopefully help us better critically analyze our own present (history to be).From the point of view of judging a specific historical figure as evil or good, I think it is still valuable to apply both judgements. \\"This person committed great evils, but they also weren't significantly worse than anybody else at the time\\" is a useful distinction, since \\"this person committed great evils, that were even considered evil at the time\\" also exists. As a side point: shades of gray exist throughout all points in history, and a historical figure (or society) should be taken as their whole, not neglecting the good or the bad.","title":"CMV: I see nothing wrong with judging historical figures by modern standards."},{"text":"Biden is incompetent.

These are what demonstrate that the belief there is some kind of underlying philosophical reality that causes people to be on the political left or right, simply isn't true at all.I mean, haven't you been unsatisfied with every hand-waving rationalization that attempts to explain how the political parties \\"changed sides\\" from the 1940's to today?There is no center.  There is no left.  There is no right.  There is only the superficial facade of these dichotomies, echoed and reinforced through the political conversation apparatuses.  *Any* position can be adopted by either side and rationalized accordingly.  That there are positions today that are on one side or the other is merely happenstance.  Given more time, they could shift to the other side.","title":"CMV: The most meaningful way to assess the amount 'left' or 'right' a political party is, is to place the 'center' at the present status quo"},{"text":"  but I think he'll have issues killing his own.He absolutely would not.

I don't want people to constantly demonize one another but on the other hand we must realize that people aren't intrinsically \\"good.\\"  People perform socially acceptable behaviors and \\"do good\\" to others because they want to be accepted and they want their behavior to be reciprocated.  I am hardly demonizing such people by pointing out that our most basic motivations are in fact selfish.  Further, most people have all of the same emotions and chaos happening in their hearts that the most evil criminals do but choose not to perform the same crimes for horrid motives.  Many people don't live out their fantasies of adultery, murder, etc. etc. not because they are virtuous but because they fear the conseuquences of shame, accountability, and suffering that can come as a result.

Thats judging by modern standards, the received knowledge of history.Certain things you speak to, imperialism and slavery notably, were baked into the social fabric.  They were inescapable.  So do you judge those who facilitated it by the standards of knowing how evil it is to us now or just by the milder standard of not knowing it was (as) wrong but not going against it?To judge someone by modern standards is to take what knowledge we have learned and apply it backwards.

Their party has yet to land on a clear message or a leading messenger, leaving the president-elect mostly unchallenged, even as Republicans exposed their own vulnerabilities and divisions when Trump nearly derailed a stopgap funding deal with last-minute demands. The GOP-triggered crisis, resolved just in time to avert a government shutdown Saturday, created an opportunity for Democrats, with some in the party closely watching House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), an emerging voice who isnt yet well known nationally. House Democrats are prepared to stop far-right Republicans in their tracks and deliver for the people, Jeffries wrote in a Saturday fundraising email. A largely muddled response to Trump stands in contrast with eight years ago when his surprise victory mobilized Democrats to march and fueled massive fundraising, as lawmakers and governors jockeyed to be his most vocal critic. Many in the party now are taking a more cautious approach, acknowledging they will have to work with Trump in some areas.","title":"Democrats Are Adrift as Donald Trump Prepares to Take Power"},{"text":"Look at that picture.Im telling you, despite everything that wasnt perfect and there are things that bother me for sure, Biden and his administration have played excellent politics during his administration.?There he is, doing the calm measured appropriate happy warrior thing the president is supposed to do, is required to do to effectively be President, and then he plunges the knife in deeper on the way out.I think that we will feel positive the affects of the Biden administration for decades to come.

The strategy wasnt subtle, but it worked just as intended. Speaking at Turning Point USAs AmericaFest conference in Phoenix on Sunday, Donald Trump couldnt help rebutting the claim that anyone but him is in charge. Hes not going to be president, that I can tell you, Trump said. And Im safe. You know why he cant be? He wasnt born in this country.You never need a Ph.D. in psychology to understand Trumps motives and fears; he puts them right on the surface. His almost comical obsession with showing everyone how strong and manly he is  in this case, insisting that he couldnt possibly be under the thumb of the worlds richest man  plainly derives from a terror that people will see him as weak. But just days before hes about to take power, thats exactly what he is. Look at what happened in Trumps return to legislative dealmaking. As Congress moved to avert a shutdown to begin his second term, Trump failed to get what he wanted at every step.Again and again Trumps ham-handed attempts at strength only wind up looking weak.It began with a bipartisan deal that would fund the government through March, giving the new Republican Congress time to craft tax and budget bills to its (and Trumps) liking. But after Musk posted his opposition to the deal, Trump rushed to say he, too, was opposed to it. After the deal collapsed, Trump then tried to avoid a debt ceiling increase in his first year, a move designed to limit leverage for both Democrats and anti-government members of his own party. First he called for the debt ceiling to be abolished, but when House Republicans wouldnt go for that, he pivoted to suggesting it be suspended for two years. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dutifully offered a new funding bill with that provision  and it went down to defeat as 38 Republicans voted no. When a spending bill finally passed Friday, it didnt include the debt limit suspension Trump had demanded. As NBC News reported, On Wednesday, Trump had threatened to primary Any Republican who voted for a funding bill without a debt limit extension; on Friday, 170 House Republicans did just that.This pattern  Trump makes demands, Congress says no, Trump does nothing  was precisely what characterized his legislative efforts in his first term. There wasnt a single instance in which he bent Congress to his will or negotiated his way to a win when the outcome was in doubt. His only significant legislative accomplishment was the 2017 tax cut for the wealthy  a foregone conclusion given that Republicans controlled both houses. By contrast, among his blunders was the longest government shutdown in history, which ended only when he caved and gave up his demand for funding for a border wall.  Thats not to say Trump cant exert control over his party or successfully punish those who oppose him. He often does. He has ended the careers of Republicans who stood up to him, intimidated some in the news media and  with the help of conservative Supreme Court justices  managed to evade legal accountability for all manner of misdeeds. But because he has such a simple-minded understanding of how power and politics work, again and again Trumps ham-handed attempts at strength only wind up looking weak. The problem is that madness isnt strength; its just mad.Its apparent in his standard negotiating strategy: He makes bombastic threats, then waits for everyone else to give in, never bothering to learn what theyre after or how he might persuade them. So he says hell bomb every enemy, sue every critic and destroy everyone who opposes him. One might have to take the threats seriously, because its always possible Trump will do what he says. But most of the time he doesnt.Trump has long spoken of the value of being a crazy guy in negotiations. His approach recalls Richard Nixons Madman Theory of foreign policy: Convince your enemies that you are erratic and irrational, and theyll step carefully to avoid setting you off. The problem is that madness isnt strength; its just mad. Take, for instance, the pronouncements Trump has recently made about seizing the Panama Canal, annexing Canada and taking control of Greenland: when they dont happen, he just looks like a fool. Similarly, after the 2024 election, Trump will have a governing trifecta and his first popular vote victory. But the entirely unnecessary spending showdown destroyed whatever momentum he could have had entering the White House.When a genuinely strong president sits in the Oval Office, everyone in both parties knows that when he makes either a threat or a promise, hell keep his word. No one trusts Trump on either count. For him, strength is about bluster and dominance. He will always be the loudest person in the room, and he treats every interaction, whether between people or between countries, as a zero-sum contest for supremacy in which there will always be a winner and a loser. But his recent failure to bend Congress to his will foreshadows a difficult four years for dealing with his own party, let alone the rest of Washington.In the wake of the near-shutdown, it seems that Trumps second term could look almost exactly like his first term. Republicans will pass another tax cut  much of which would extend the previous tax cut  because nothing is more important to the GOP. But after that, things could get messy. With a razor-thin House majority and dozens of Republicans ready to make trouble over spending bills, it would take a shrewd negotiator or a president of genuine strength to successfully navigate the legislative minefield. Donald Trump is not going to be that president.","title":"Democrats President Musk strategy wasnt subtle  but it worked: His almost comical obsession with showing everyone how strong and manly he is"},{"text":"subtle wouldn't have worked: it would be like showing a dog a card trick.","title":"Democrats President Musk strategy wasnt subtle  but it worked: His almost comical obsession with showing everyone how strong and manly he is"},{"text":"Those on the left reserve criticism for those they feel can be reasoned with.

Some degrees are just worth more than others. You see the same thing at the BS and doctoral levels. A BS in Engineering is worth more, on average, than a BA in fine arts. It is as if the degree level is not the defining characteristic here. It is the field and skills. A much more powerful comparison would be similar skill set compensation comparisons.I understand what you're saying, but I think it overlooks *how* worth is assigned to different degrees. There's nothing that inherently makes a degree in education more valuable than one in engineering, its a question of how we have chosen to compensate those degree holders as a society. For teachers with education degrees the situation is especially odd, as it is the state, not the market, that sets pay. I would argue that this issue isn't that education degrees are less valuable, as teachers are desperately needed, but that they're undervalued due to political pressures to limit government spending, even when not doing so inadvertently causes negative social repercussions. Social work can require advanced degrees and pay shit. Cost for degrees is not the real factor for pay.Oh trust me, as a social worker I'm well aware! I would actually argue that social work has a similar issue to education though. Its a profession where there is extremely high demand for new employees, and where there is ample evidence that social worker support is cost saving for institutions, but where there are huge issues with recruitment and retention in the profession due to systemic underpayment. Issues with state funding are similarly at the root of this problem, with artificially low pay from government agencies depressing pay rates from private employers. Demand and ability to fill job vacancies is the metric that is far more useful to determining if a job is under compensated. If you are unable to fill job openings, that is a pretty damn good indicator you are not compensating the employees enough.By this standard, teachers are critically underpaid. There is a nation shortage of educators in pretty much every specialty, and in many states this is only being resolved by lowering educational standards to become a teacher, often to the detriment of students. This shortage is especially bad for STEM educators and special education.  This assumes people don't know this going in. Teachers absolutely know the pay scales going in. The information is readily available. That makes this a conscious choice and it is hard to claim people are getting 'screwed over' when they have this information up front.As someone who paid a lot of money to enter a low salary position, I think there are two ways to see this issue. You're right, most teachers probably know the pay sucks going in. That said, I think its also fair for them to raise hell about how big a problem this is, and to advocate for wages that reflect their education and workload.","title":"CMV: Teachers in the United States are compensated enough and further complains about low pay will only alienate more taxpayers."},{"text":"Okay so make Trump do it.

The current median salary for a person with a masters degree is around $81,848. If we go by your own numbers on teacher salaries, we can see that teachers are making around 30% less than peers with similar levels of education, which is a massive gap. When you consider that the education in question is often quite expensive, this can make teaching a financially risky profession to enter. To be fair though, there are differences in a Masters in Education vs an MBA when it comes to the job market. Some degrees are just worth more than others.You see the same thing at the BS and doctoral levels. A BS in Engineering is worth more, on average, than a BA in fine arts. It is as if the degree level is not the defining characteristic here. It is the field and skills. A much more powerful comparison would be similar skill set compensation comparisons. Again, this only makes sense if we dont factor in cost of education. Making slightly higher than average salary doesnt account for the opportunity cost of spending years getting a tertiary degree instead of working, or of paying off student loansSocial work can require advanced degrees and pay shit. Cost for degrees is not the real factor for pay. Demand and ability to fill job vacancies is the metric that is far more useful to determining if a job is under compensated. If you are unable to fill job openings, that is a pretty damn good indicator you are not compensating the employees enough.The issue is, those jobs come with an expectation of intense physical labor, its part of the trade off. Getting higher level degrees is a different risk to reward strategy: you take on higher risk in the form of studying and educational debt, in return for higher pay/lighter workloads later on. Teachers get screwed because they take on the risk, but dont get the benefits.This assumes people don't know this going in. Teachers absolutely know the pay scales going in. The information is readily available.

The problem lies in misunderstanding both the nature of evidence and the burden of proof.The key issue is that its logically impossible to prove a negative. When you ask for evidence that something does not existlike space or time outside the observable universeyoure asking for something that cannot be provided. To prove a negative, you would need to exhaustively search every conceivable context or dimension to confirm the absence of the thing in question, which is obviously unachievable. Thats why the burden of proof lies with the person making the positive claim. Since youre proposing that space or time exists outside the observable frame, its on you to provide evidence for that claim.This ties directly to how scientific theories like the Big Bang Theory (BBT) work. The BBT provides an evidence-based explanation for the observable universekey word: observable. Its built on observable phenomena, measurable data, and testable predictions. Science operates within the limits of what can be observed and tested; it doesnt speculate about what might exist beyond those boundaries without evidence to support such speculation.Your reasoning flips this on its head. By insisting that others disprove your claim of space or time beyond the observable universe, youre essentially asking science to disprove an unfounded idea. But thats not how science works. Science isnt obligated to disprove every hypothetical claim. For example, we dont have to disprove that the universe is resting on the back of a giant turtle because theres no evidence suggesting thats the case in the first place. The same logic applies here. Without evidence, your claim is nothing more than speculation.The burden of proof isnt on others to disprove your ideaits on you to demonstrate why your claim should even be taken seriously in the first place. Until you provide evidence to support it, its not a meaningful challenge to the scientific consensus, nor is it something science is obligated to address.

These pressures apply to political parties just as much as politicians, meaning even the rare populist or grassroots candidate will become ensnared in the web of influence. Even if we dissolved the Presidency, Senate, and Congress and became a direct democracy, we'd still be an oligarchy.

Representative democracy was never intended to be government of the people for the people. Representative democracy has always been a capitulation to the common folk, but it's aim was still to concentrate power among the powerful. There are multiple studies that show how Congress passes legislation based on corporate interest and the rich, and public opinion is barely a concern (can link to sources if you want but should be easy to find). From the start, the founders worried about mob rule and tried to organize government in a way that there were strong checks to keep public opinion from dominating government. Direct democracy and lottocracy are governments for and of the people. Representative democracy is designed to allow for rich and powerful people to have a disproportionate control over politics. Insider trading is essentially legal for government workers, bribery is legal if not done explicitly, so many politicians get extremely lucrative executive board seats after leaving office. This isn't new, it isn't a bug, it was always the goal. Recently it has gotten more explicit with Elon bs, but this is the system working as intended.

Here's an article that provides a good review of the critiques of the study if you want to give it a read: [https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study)But to summarize the main points from this article:Researchers critiquing the paper found that middle-income Americans and rich Americans actually agree on an overwhelming majority of topics. Out of the 1,779 bills in the Gilens/Page data set, majorities of the rich and middle class agree on 1,594; there are 616 bills both groups oppose and 978 bills both groups favor. **That means the groups agree on 89.6 percent of bills.**Bashir and Branham/Soroka/Wlezien find that on these 185 bills, the rich got their preferred outcome **53 percent** of the time and the middle class got what they wanted **47 percent** of the time. **The difference between the two is not statistically significant.** ?And there are some funny examples in the list of middle-class victories. For instance, **the middle class got what they wanted on public financing of elections: in all three 1990s surveys included in the Gilens data, they opposed it, while the rich favor it. That matches up with more recent research showing that**?[**wealthy people are more supportive of public election funding**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379411000291)**.**The bolded sentence in the last blurb is my emphasis, since private funding of elections is a pretty central component of most \\"America is an oligarchy\\" discourse - but ironically, middle-class voters support the status quo on campaign finance more so than the wealthy on average.","title":"CMV: The United States is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy"},{"text":"There should be processes surrounding a democracy that need to be implemented to preserve it.

They are considerably different, because each has a group that actively engage in it.Those who create and consume loli/shota can have various reasons to do so, that do not relate to an attraction to real life minors.Those who create and consume CSAM are purposefully harming children or supporting the continued harm of children.When people bring up the harm of loli/shota, they are already taking about the outliers of society. It's ok to acknowledge that someone who is into loli/shota is weird already, but that weirdness does not translate directly into violent behavior. The average consumer of loli/shota, or most any porn, is not the average sexual criminal.And it is because they always talk about the outliers that you have to make a CMV. Because not everyone purchasing or viewing a sexual drawing of a character known to be a minor in universe is a criminal, a pedophile attracted to children, or an addict.Just as an example, following some of the implicit beliefs of others, that only pedophiles like loli/shota, there are 242,000 pedophiles following 1 twitter account that's been around since 2021. I think that statement seems a little unreasonable to make, but that's how awful CSAM is. Anything remotely adjacent to it will trigger the same vitriol. I believe that's ultimately a good thing, because we don't need to allow everything to be normalized and become ubiquitous, as that allows them to take on new meanings. Leaving this type of stuff where it is, only on the internet, only in specific gatherings, only for specific people, is what we do with anything we don't think is appropriate for people to just see when walking around outside. You can see the same behavior with sex workers once OnlyFans took off. Now, every one looking to make money is posting themselves in revealing clothing in game hobby forums. Sharing their links on every social media. Taking over other topics such as informational breastfeeding videos in order to get more money. When something becomes ubiquitous and easily accessible, it erodes boundaries. Loli/shota should never become ubiquitous, and that only remains the case if some folks are disgusted by the mere idea.TLDR; CSAM is awful. Anything slightly, even if it is not morally as bad, should be kept at an arms length away.","title":"CMV: I Think That Loli and/or Shota Pornography (And any Such Western Equivalents) are of a Considerably Different Nature and Level of Morality Than Actual CSAM"},{"text":"SPARS 2025/Project Blue Beam","title":"Wake up"},{"text":"It was never a democracy.

It's been gone twice as long as it was in place. It wasn't some massive shift in the way things were done.I dont see how you can overstate the impact it has had. For example, The way Trump publicly solicitated bribes from oil companies would have been unthinkable if CU hadnt gutted campaign finance laws. There is no democracy in which money is such a decive factor, and which is so untransparant about where the money comes from. ?Campaign spending by corporations and other outside groups increased by?900% between 2008 and 2016. n 2020, total election spending was $14.4 billion, up from $5.7 billion in 2018, and more than $1 billion in dark money was spent. The FEC has basically been completely powerless since.CU has completely changed American politics. I am not saying that on its own it changed the US from Democracy to Oligarchy but it was a big milestones on the trends that way. Having transparancy about where money comes from an limits on how much money you can spend on politicians should not be controversial in a democracy.To me Trump's first administration is a strong indication that what we have is democracy and?*not*?oligarchy. The establishment Republicans hated Trump and did everything they could to block him, but he won the primaries anyway because he appealed to the people very successfully.How? Trump is a born billionaire himself, they took direct power through him. Maybe initially there was some pushback, but that didnt last long. Thiel, Koch etc all heavily supported him. His previous cabinet was also filled with millionaires, altough not as extreme as his next one.","title":"CMV: The United States is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy"},{"text":"There are plenty of subreddits that are geared towards the MAGA crowd lol They arent some persecuted group","title":"Why is Biden doing this And right before Christmas"},{"text":"Feel like we live in the Truman Show","title":"Wake up"},{"text":"I'm not denying he gives every indication of having lost his faculties.

There are still people in prison that I helped put behind bars. I was in the room when the decisions were being made about going for the death penalty or not. Have you ever been in the room when the DA is figuring out how to prosecute a mass shooting? Cause I have.The discussion was mostly about the political impact of pursuing or not pursuing the death penalty. The felony division higher-ups didn't seem all too concerned about the defendant's life or mental state. The main issue was \\"how will this impact the DA's reelection?\\"That is the justice system I know. *It was in-part a political decision.* And that's just not okay with me. So once again, I'm telling you that the moral discussion about mob justice and the discussion about state-sponsored homicide are wholly separate things. Is a mob revenge system with no trial and due process more or less reliable than our criminal justice system with trial and due process?You're once again comparing apples to oranges. But to give you a nugget to chew on, I'll say this: The legal system is so heavily swayed by the budgets of each party to the case that I cannot accept at face value the premise that \\"trial and due process\\" is actually a reliable way to come to justice. It might be the *best system we have all else being equal* but it is far from adequate if your goal is true justice. One only needs to see examples like [Gary Plauchet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PUE8fYxjq8) getting probation for what is most certainly premeditated murder. If street justice wasn't *a form* of justice, the courts would have certainly put him behind bars for 1st degree murder. Asking me to say which is better is a moot point. Both systems are a way to achieve justice. The trial and due process system is just obviously the only system that you'd want to legitimize on a societal level. And for what its worth, I don't think anyone carrying out street justice should be absolved of their crimes in the courts. If Luigi did frag a CEO, he should go to jail for murder. But I'm not going to sit there and say he's a threat to society in the same way as a mass shooter or suicide bomber. I can acknowledge the legitimacy of the masses lashing out against their oppressors and still believe that society is better off with the courts handling matters.","title":"Why is Biden doing this And right before Christmas"},{"text":"Why is it always sysadmins that have fash-adjacent opinions?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This cop should be prosecuted for failing to provide the necessities of life.Hahaha that's not their job though.

In the UK, for instance, no right wing government has dared to dismantle the tax funded NHS system that provides care free at the point of service and medicine at a nominal price to everyone. Here I'm talking about the UK Conservative party that was in power for 14 years. Yes, you can criticise them for under investment to NHS, but at no point did they dare to challenge the ideological base of the system. And that's the right wing party in the UK. The left wing Labour is of course even more in favour of NHS and now that it's in power, it's pumping more money into it. But the crucial thing is that there is a consensus view among all parties that a universal healthcare system is a good thing. In the US, even the supposedly left wing Democratic party can't push itself to write that in their manifesto.Then the maternity leave. Yes, in the manifesto, there is a mention of 12 week paid leave for the mother. That's of course great but it's far less than in most European countries. In Nordic countries, the mothers get a year. In addition, many countries offer on top of that the mother a possibility to stay home even longer and not lose her job. And the thing completely missing in the Democrat manifesto is the paternity leave.

Basically, the foundation and top structures bound everything together, but if there was catastrophic damage half way between those, a lot of that physical connection would be lost, Immediately weakening the entire structure.

Most European left wing parties are not equality of outcome, but of opportunity. They've been in public discourse pushing their ideas for much longer than the Dems.

I played hundreds of hours of videos sticking to two rules, (1) no searching for things, only clicking recommended videos, and (2) clicking the most right-wing recommended videos.
