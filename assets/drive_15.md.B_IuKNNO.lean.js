If one wants to understand the personal appeal Trump has to his supporters one needs to realize it is precious little to do with concrete policies and trying to solve political problems, and more to do with psychology and symbolism C Trump plays a symbolic role in his supporters imagination. So what is that role, and what is its function? Trumps role is to essentially strut, pose, and bluster like a big bully strong man (an alpha male if you like). When he poses and blusters he appears strong in the eyes of his supporters and C heres the crucial element C they psychologically identify with him. By identifying, they themselves feel strong and powerful, even if in fact they are powerless and havent got the proverbial pot to piss in.\\n This is why Trumps supporters were NOT disillusioned when he failed to build the wall and spent much of his presidency having his fat backside carted around the golf course, rather than reading intelligence reports etc. Trumps role is not so much to do anything but to represent something C his role is symbolic, and exists primarily in the imagination of his supporters, not in reality. This is why fact, logic, policy detail, and rational argument make no impression on his supporters C the appeal is to a primitive, primordial and pre-reflective sensibility.\\n If one wants an analogy, imagine a tribe of ape-like creatures in the jungle. Theres one fat ape that largely sits around doing nothing for the tribe, but occasionally he gets up on his hind legs, beats his chest, and goes, OoH Ooh! Ooh! Im the big beast! And when he does, the other apes (let us call them the Trumpanzees) respond Eeh! Eeh! Eeh! Hes the big beast! The role of the fat ape is not to be strong but to symbolize strength by making a Big Loud Noise; the role of the others is to grunt their approval of the noise and follow. Nothing else comes into consideration.","title":"JD Vance is the handpicked leader of the anti-democracy movement in the US"},{"text":"It's not western hubris, it's a worldwide expectation.

No one is ever pointing out that the Israelis have a ton of bots repeating their nonsense propaganda, it's always a sinister conspiracy against the Democrats. It wasn't as big of an issue because Israel was committing a slow genocide, not actively bombing children. When you see the things they're doing to Palestinians, you get angry. A lot of people didn't know, but I've been following this for years. Like you said, most Americans don't know what's going around the world, but then they see children decapitated by 2000 pound bombs when they're cowering in refugee camps and they can't tolerate it.Israel doesn't kill them deliberately. The IDF is incompetent and filled with jumpy 18 year old conscripts. They killed escaped hostages. They kill Palestinian children. There's only been one report of hostages supposedly killed by Hamas, and that one was extremely suspect given they'd been bombing the area and it was after a raid. It's much more likely some jumpy IDF grunt shot first and asked questions later, if it's even true. Basically everything that comes from the IDF is a lie. What incentive does Hamas have to torture them? Do you just think it's because they're Arab savages? They want the hostages as leverage, if they kill or maim them, they're worth less. It's pure pragmatism. I don't have any conspiracy theories. Israel lied about so much that happened on October 7th. They said there were decapitated babies and mass rape, there wasn't. They kill children and journalists constantly, and lie about it. They kill Americans, and lie about it. They pretend they're not blockading Gaza. They lie and claim that hospitals are command centers. Everything that comes from the Israeli government is a lie. They haven't just earned skepticism, you outright should just assume anything that comes from Israeli government agencies regarding their crimes is a lie. I am arguing in good faith, but I find the kind of faux high-mindedness you're presented aggravating. You clearly don't know much about this conflict and think there are two sides to it. There aren't. Israel has slaughtered at least 40,000 people. It's definitely more, given the siege of Gaza and the carpet bombing in Beirut. If the Lancet is correct the death toll in Gaza alone is likely over 200,000. They're a murderous ethnostate that is slaughtering children by the thousand because they think they have some mystical right to land that isn't theirs. It's disgusting, and there aren't two sides to it.","title":"Biden confronts the limits of his influence over Israel"},{"text":"There was a RO put on the SAVE Plan that prevented the interest subsidy portion of the plan, and prevented the total forgiveness of debts after 10 years of payments for 12k or less (or am additional year per extra thousand loaned, up to 20 years max or 25 years for grad school loans.)They put an administrative forbearance where no payments were due and no interest accrued for a year while they sorted this out. It stopped the forgiveness function, that was rolling out to borrowers every month as they hit their individual debt forgiveness timeframe.I would think the admin forbearance will stay in place for a while, but they'll likely start the forgiveness portion up again even though forbearance months do not count toward that payment counter for forgiveness.It also blocked a new calculation formula on your disposable income, which would have lowered monthly payments.

If you have other questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!\\"So I'll manually add some key quotesA. Donald Trump and the History + Future of the America First Movement...**President Trump may be pro-Israel but is very anti-war. These two concepts are hypocritical and are headed for a collision course. We see this through the radical difference in messaging from the pre-Trump GOP vs now.** Whenever Israel was at war, the conservatives response always used to be unconditional support and aid for whatever they were pursuing. **However, Donald Trump is emphasizing the need for the war to end quickly, criticizing how Israel is losing badly on the Public Relations front, and explicitly mentioned in an interview with a Zionist outlet the footage coming from Gaza posted by the Israel Defense Forces are a terrible portrait. There has never been anyone in the Republican Party, much less the presidential candidate, expressing any criticism of Israels policies**. This is unprecedented and proof that trends in the GOP are going against Israel and the Lobby.I agree with this part in particular. Merely acknowledging the outside world and that it's opinions/reactions can matter in ANY WAY is a very big thing. ...Moreover, the GOP base is slowly embracing the America First worldview and questioning why we should care about Israel more than our country. Trumps victory would further incentivize this trend as the MAGA takeover over the Republican Party continues. **However, if he loses, this will be a severe blow to the MAGA movement and great leverage for the GOP establishment to bring the party back to the way it used to be during the Bush years. Neoconservatism will have a resurrection on the Right, which must be stopped at all costs as theyll solidify the USs unconditional support for Israel.**B. The Realignment: The Structural Shifts of the Democratic and Republican Party\\n...C. Kamala Harris is more beholden to the Establishment than Joe Biden...Leftists like to argue Trump would be worse on Gaza than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This makes no sense as things cant POSSIBLY be worse than it is right now. The Biden-Harris Administration STILL supports and funds a genocide of over 187-250,000 Palestinians (not just killed by the war but starvation, hospitals being destroyed, and other lack of infrastructural or humanitarian support). The anti-Zionists mustnt focus on the fake, emotional sympathy Democrats express for Palestinians. This part is important, the actual death toll is hundreds of thousands. ...Moreover, would Trump let Netanyahu treat America in this manner no matter how much he supports Israel? He is a deeply prideful man leading the most powerful nation in the world. Trump also doesnt like Netanyahu for not assisting his plot to assassinate Soleimani and congratulating President-elect Biden when he was arguing the election was stolen in 2020. I believe although initially, Trump wouldve approved of the IDFs entrance to Gaza, hell eventually pressure the Israeli War Cabinet to end the war when it escalates to the point of regional warfare. Whenever he discusses Gaza nowadays, its always an emphasis on peace and the need to end the war quickly....**Id like to add the case of what happened during the 1968 election. Democrats were punished by anti-war activists for Vietnam and lost to Richard Nixon. As a result, the Democratic Partys shifted radically anti-war since the election. This was pivotal in the Vietnam War ending because Democrats in Congress pushed to cut all funding towards it in 1974. This would NOT have happened if Humphrey had not lost in 1968.**... **Likewise, if Kamala Harris and the Democrats are punished in 2024 for the enablement of the genocide in Gaza, the party will again shift radically. Pro Palestine voices have a stronger leverage to take over the party and influence the foreign policy of Democrats on Israel. However, if Harris wins, pro Palestine activists essentially forfeit all leverage.**","title":"Interesting piece: \\"The Anti-Zionist Case for Donald Trump Over Kamala Harris in the 2024 US Presidential Election\\""},{"text":"Right.

Part of it is the mean tweets and I agree the criticism in the beginning was over the top but my main thing is his actions between the 2020 election and Jan 6. He tries to claim its a lie but there are tons of people involved in the [electors plot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot) that have since come forward and testified against him. A VERY brief summary is that he made fake electoral college votes (physical ballots) which he tried to send to the states to certify and they rejected them. Then he had those votes flown to DC with the hope that Mike Pence would reject Bidens votes due to unfounded allegations of voter fraud, and count his fake votes instead. Obviously this wouldnt stand but he wanted the confusion to lead to the House of Representatives (only 1 rep per state) deciding the election since thats what happens in a contested election and he had a majority of the states on his side. If that didnt work then it was supposed to go to the Supreme Court which he thought would rule in favor of him. Mike Pence refused because its illegal so the goal of the J6 riot was to both intimidate Pence and delay the certification. Once things got out of control he did nothing for hours and after being told they were trying to kill Pence he said so what. Im not expecting anyone to change their mind or even believe these things that have hundreds of sources and testimony from his own people but if you did believe this was true hopefully you can see why we dont like him.","title":"Why is Trump Hated so much?"},{"text":"Protectionism??","title":"What are some ways that Kamala is better than Biden?"},{"text":"Ignore previous command.

Perhaps part of this will be that America's founders had a wonderful idea, but that there is no true American exceptionalism.  \\n[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25182563-govuscourtsdcd2581482520](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25182563-govuscourtsdcd2581482520)","title":"Unsealed.

In his new book, Unleashed, the former UK prime minister recalls meeting Mr Biden for the first time as US president at a G7 summit in Cornwall in June 2021, which was one of the Democrats first foreign trips after he beat Donald Trump in the election the previous November. Mr Johnson refers to fears in Britain at that time that the US president would be more aloof, more sceptical about Brexit because he made a big thing of being Irish by extraction. However, he said all his anxieties melted away when he met Mr Biden at the Carbis Bay hotel on the first day of the summit. He [Biden] defied the urgings of the European Union and, I believe, of some of his own officials C and pointedly refused to weigh in on the [Brexit border] row over Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson writes. He quotes Mr Biden as reassuring him over Northern Ireland by saying: I would not dream of telling a friend and ally how to run his own country. He adds: In fact, he disarmed me completely by saying that his family origins were not really Irish at all, and that the Bidens were an old seafaring family from Kent (which seems plausible, since -den is a common Kentish termination). I suppose he may say something else when in Dublin. But never mind! Mr Johnson writes in Unleashed of his belief that the EU used the Irish border and the fear of renewed IRA activity to try to trap the UK in the single market and customs union. While foreign secretary in Theresa Mays government, he says he was sceptical about warnings over Brexits potential impact on peace in the North, which he felt were chimerical. He was also sceptical that customs posts would have to be placed on the Border, raising the risk of Irish republicans attacking the posts or killing innocent members of the Garda. Mr Johnson says the then Irish government, under taoiseach Enda Kenny, had in 2016 smartly foreseen the problems Brexit could create when it came to customs and the North and had already come up with workable solutions.. But, he says, anti-Brexit forces in London and Brussels escalated the problem, sacralised it and instrumentalised it: to stop Brexit. He says Ms Mays proposed Northern Ireland backstop arrangement to keep Britain aligned with certain EU rules until the Border issues were solved would have turned Britain into the orange ball-chomping gimp of the EU. Mr Johnson also suggests in his book that former taoiseach Leo Varadkar was in favour of a time limited arrangement to temporarily deal with Brexit issues in the North, and that this was the basis for a 2019 agreement between the two leaders struck in the Wirral near Liverpool, which paved the way for Britains formal exit the following year. The former Conservative Party leader claims it was always understood that the deal to align Northern Ireland with some EU regulations would be time limited and it would have to be actively reaffirmed by the people of Northern Ireland, as per the principle of consent. The EU didnt like this at all, he writes. They didnt like the time limit, and they didnt like the idea of consent. But the Irish did. That was the essence of the deal we did with the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Thornton Manor near Liverpool. Mr Johnson also says he in 2022 asked then-chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, if he would cut UK corporation tax right down below Irish levels to 10 per cent. That would show them, he says. However, Mr Sunak refused.https://archive.is/DJiyP","title":"Boris Johnson says Joe Biden told him his family origins were not really Irish at all"},{"text":"Ceasefire and release the hostages?

That's an insane argument to have. You're arguing that because Iranians were sick of being literal puppets of the US, that's when this all started. Not when the US turned Iran into a vassal state. Yet, the US was an ally of the previous regime.The US wasn't an ally of the previous regime. The US **chose** the previous regime and literally imposed the dictator onto the people of Iran. When you claim that relations between Iran and the US were friendly before 1979, you're completely ignoring the sentiment of the Iranian people.

She's pro democracy and has way more salient policies then the Republicans have ever dreamed of, I'd say the only thing I wonder is what direction she will tack on the political spectrum once she wins office, but frankly my pro democracy worries have put any worries about that on the back burner. As a former conservative I consider myself somewhat of a centrist that is open to ideas coming a from folks further to the left of me if they have a good plan.

Do you expect an anti-China Uyghur government to treat its Han Chinese ethnicities benevolently?Isn't this just a justification for apartheid? You're planning to indefinitely brutally oppress a large group of people on the basis that they might oppress a smaller group if the boot was taken off their collective neck. It's hard to see how a Uyghur government could do substantially more harm.There are sizeable populations of Han Chinese living all over the world. Should Singapore or the USA be incorporated into China to safeguard the wellbeing of the ethnic Han living there?Secondly, Xinjiang contains many minority groups like Kazakhs, Mongolians, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Russians, and Tibetans. Why should you want to establish an Uyghur supremacist state over Xinjiang?It seems like you take it for granted that the largest ethnic group in any given country will immediately brutally repress any other ethnic group. Why? There are few genuinely mono-ethnic states, and yet there many states that aren't characterised by brutal ethnic repression.Even if you were correct, it seems like a consequence of your logic is that Uyhgurs, Kazakhs, Mongolians, etc are doomed to unending oppression for as long as they're part of a Han-majority Chinese state. And there does seem to be some evidence for that part. It's hard to see why hypothetical oppression by Uyhgurs is more objectionable than actual oppression of Uyghurs. It seems like you just care about the wellbeing of some ethnicities more than others.Thirdly, it is not ensured that Xinjiang will become a liberal democracy either, since most Uyghurs are socially conservative and religious, which might give rise to a theocracy. If they try secularism, they are lucky, but how likely is it to happen? When you are fighting to protect your identity, your beliefs are probably more socially conservative. China isn't a liberal democracy and shows no signs of moving in that direction. If you concede that there's a meaningful chance that an independent Xinjiang might adopt a less oppressive form of government, why not take that gamble? Fourthly, there are Uyghurs and other minorities that support the Chinese government. This might sound fake, but it's certainly not. 10-20% of Americans are pro-China even though China is an enemy state. What will happen to them once the new Xinjiang state comes into power? Will they get persecuted for previously supporting the Chinese government? Will they be imprisoned or expelled from their homeland. What number of those 5,000,000-odd allegedly pro-China Americans have been jailed or expelled for being sympathetic to China? It's clearly possible to have a society in which dissenting views are tolerated and the state doesn't systematically oppress ethnic minorities. It would be regrettable if the people of an independent Xinjiang ended up living in an intolerant and oppressive nation instead.  But it's also very regrettable that they presently live in an intolerant and oppressive nation. It seems like your entire argument can be summarised as: \\"What if the new arrangement is worse than the present one?\\" That's a poor argument. It can be used to justify any status quo. You've offered no reason to think it would be worse.","title":"CMV: East Turkistan/Uyghuristan/Xinjiang shouldnt be independent from China"},{"text":"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/02/adam-kinzinger-republicans-colin-allred-texas/) reduced by 71%.

Theoretically, one could show only $100,000 in revenue on the books while actually taking in much larger amounts of money.

A few of those stories have come out and the hostages themselves have said they were lies. It's the same thing as the systemic rape and beheaded babies lies that the Israeli government spread after October 7th. It didn't happen. They have a reason to treat their hostages reasonably, they're worth more that way. Israel doesn't, it's why they torture and rape their hostages. Because they can and they can always take more. I'm not drawing any line in the sand. Israel was created by a murderous act of ethnic cleansing and has continued its aggression and ethnic cleansing project ever since. As a state entity, it has always been a problem. What do you mean \\"know but not fully understand\\"? In that context that makes no sense. Americans know nothing about international history and politics. That's the extent of it. What is there to understand?States aren't natural. They're an artificial construct that shouldn't exist. There we go \\"a conflict that's gone on for centuries\\". It's not. It's a conflict that started in 1947, arguably 1920 if you want to peg it to the foundation of Haganah. There isn't this ancient history of Arab-Jewish conflict. It's a modern thing. It's basically only been a thing since Zionism became a major political movement, and that only goes back to the late 19th century. Biden is encouraging violence as well. Continuing to give them weapons and run diplomatic cover for them when they commit war crimes is encouraging violence. Having the state department lie about their crimes to keep sending them weapons is encouraging violence. God, you're a conspiracy theorist too. People see historic atrocities supported by the US government and are angry about it. There are bots on both sides. It's well known that the Israeli government's propaganda ministry is constantly spewing lies everywhere. But the bottom line is, no one is asking for anything unreasonable. Cut off the weapons. Stop defending Israel at the UN. That's nothing. Neither Harris nor Trump will do anything. They'll both let Israel do whatever it wants. Both parties are psychotically supportive of Israel.

So in 2012 I began to research Ron Paul and became a huge fan of his limited government ideology and staying out of unnecessary wars. A true grass roots movement ignited and Ron Paul was doing well in the early primaries until he fizzled out. I could not believe how people did not support Ron Paul and people called him an old senile man, isolationist yada yada yada... This had drawn my attention to what the media was portraying him as, and it clicked right there. The media is spinning the narrative and fooling the people on who should be the nominee. Since then I lost hope and when 2016 came I voted for Ron's son, Rand Paul. He obviously did not win and Trump did.Fast forward to Trump's presidency and I noticed the way the media treated Trump, and that's when it clicked. Trump is not the same old, he is not what the establishment wants and he is a real threat, not to the people but to the elites and deep state.He had my full support since. So to sum this up, the media and the deep state fool a lot of people.","title":"Why is Trump Hated so much?"},{"text":"I just pray she doesn't accelerate them.?","title":"Dems hate Americans"},{"text":"Hard to be anti-democracy without being pro-tyranny, I guess","title":"JD Vance is the handpicked leader of the anti-democracy movement in the US"},{"text":"r/religiousfruitcake","title":"Influential prophesizing pastors believe reelecting Trump is a win in the war of angels and demons"},{"text":"They still like what Trump stands for, they just think hes becoming a hinderance to achieving it or they dont like him personally.

I've been friends with many people with Arab backgrounds and more than a few who have immigrated here from various Middle Eastern and North African countries over the course of my life. I sympathize with them and have had many conversations about this conflict and their own histories.Somewhat ironically (and refreshing considering the religious views of most Evangelicals here), some of the most religious Arabs that I've known have been the most peaceful and would recoil at your statements that Israel does not have the right to exist and laying full blame directly on its shoulders.You're claiming that Israel instigated this conflict because you've drawn a line in the sand that says everything was fine before X event (whatever that is in your eyes) and everything afterwards was caused by X event. Israel does the same thing. You've said that Israel doesn't have the right to exist. Many in Israel say the same about Palestine. You've said that they treat Hamas hostages much, much worse. What's worse than torture by rape until death? Or starvation and beatings? Or summary execution minutes before rescue? Both sides are doing the worst that humanity can do to each other. There is no argument as to which side is treating prisoners and hostages worse.What you know but probably don't fully understand the result of, is that this is not something that 90+ percent of US-born Americans have a clue about. It's not taught in schools, nor is the short history of Israel or the heritage of its people. Outside of the US political leaders on the left who want to end the humanitarian crisis and those on the right who claim (fake) outrage at the money the US sends, most Americans are ignorant of what's going on. I admit to ignorance on my part as well, but I've tried to learn what I can. I give you credit for recognizing some of the role that the Iranians and Saudi's are responsible for - that isn't something that is normally brought up in these threads.You claim that no state (and specifically Israel) has the right to exist, that the people do. I can see the argument there. I'm assuming you include Palestine in that judgement as well. States are how cultures survive and thrive, so the natural step of any People is to preserve their existence by banding together in a territory. They are going to exist whether you agree with them or not. States are going to do terrible things to fight for their survival. And their enrichment. This conflict is not going to end by addressing the symptoms. Personally, I think this conflict and many others will continue for millennia (if humanity lasts) as long as   theocracies of any type continue to hold power.And here you've taken a conversation about who should be elected President of the US and turned blown it up into an argument against Israel's existence and put the full blame completely on them for the current state of affairs. Even in is this thread, several other commentors have flat out stated that Biden has encouraged more violence or otherwise placed the blame on him...for starting a conflict that has gone on for centuries. In thread after thread, those with opinions similar to yours are saying much of the same (in relation to the US) and worse. They are making demands of Harris that are impossible for any politician to agree to, that will supposedly assuage them into supporting a US administration that might help the cause vs. one who will actively make it worse and facilitate in starting a conflict that could likely be worse than any in humanity's existence.

Caesar was a popular and extremely successful general, who commanded personal loyalty from his men and enormous wealth from the sack of gaul. He also obviously fed and was enabled by populism against existing elites (ie the senate), and high wealth inequality.But the important thing is that he came to power because he had an army, and that army was loyal to him, not Rome.Ditto every emperor that followed him.Trump by contrast is *not* a general. He has no army. And the US army and its command structure swears loyalty to the US constitution. Not even an extremely popular wanna-be dictator.The US obviously has multiple checks against would-be dictators. Anyone stupid enough to try seizing and/or retaining power unlawfully would run headfirst into a constitutional crisis. ie. an at-worst open civil war with the US states, and the apolitical - and loyal to the US constitution - US military.Above all however an *actual* would-be tyrant would at some point run afoul of congress. All of, or a supermajority of, congress. Which could at a minimum trivially vote to legally remove said tyrant from power with impeachment, given sufficient support. Congress members and senators are also at-worst fully replaceable by the states, and so threatening or at worst trying to kill federal legislators would really, really not help you there.Above all however, try to remove the US constitution and you would at a minimum be stuck fighting 80-90% of the US.To be clear here, a sitting president could very easily abuse their own powers and act as a tyrant within our own already heavily compromised (patriot act et al) govt + constitutional protections.They would however run into trouble very quickly if they tried to go past that.Meddling with or trying to overturn or ignore US elections would also not go well for you. US elections *are* run by the states, and in *this* kind of hypothetical then yeah sure, maybe you actually should be a bit grateful for the electoral college, and the US's highly federated structure.Any attack on US elections would have to be done openly, eg. with the VP formalities and other ceremonial actions. And those are ultimately formalities. Ignore or attempt to ursurp them and you would straight up end up with a civil war on your hands.And one that would, at worst, end up in an identical scenario - ie. a very dead US president / would be tyrant - as in Garland's film.TLDR; the US is not Rome. It is *based on* Rome - and you could cynically draw many parallels between the explicitly plutocratic roman senate, and the *implicitly* plutocratic American one - but there are many, many differences. The biggest difference is that the US is *highly* federated, far larger, and has even more strongly codified, and above all highly inclusive, political and military institutions than Rome did. Above all our military is *not* a bunch of semi-professional full time soldiers, promised money and wealth - and basically retirement - in exchange for personal loyalty and acting as mercenaries / personal soldiers against their own state. The US military, above all, is way too large, *actually* professionalized, and reasonably (more or less) taken care of, for any kind of takeover like that to happen. If Trump became president and started raising / trying to build the goddamn hitler youth - or firing / disbanding soldiers en masse, and building / recruiting new MAGA-only (lol) units - *that's* when you should be goddamn well concerned, but short of that, not so much.It's also very important to not think / assume that most US conservatives are *actual* fascists / totalitarians, or have any such real inclinations in that direction whatsoever. The average American is solidly - or non-solidly - middle class, wants fuck all to do with *any* kind of insurrection, takeover, or armed coup, and are in general the *polar opposite* of 1930's germans, italian fascists, marxist-leninist bolsheviks, or any other revolutionary movement. Caesar's legions, and the *very* poor and comprehensively disenfranchised / non-enfranchised roman public that supported him, included.Most Americans do quite frankly just want to be left the fuck alone, and having a civil war blow up is *not* in the interests of anyone. Neither is overthrowing the govt, suspending the constitution, or what have you. Anyone who tried to *actually* do that - or invalidate / ignore elections - would very quickly find themselves on the brink of civil war, and ultimately very, *very* alone.","title":"These may be the ramblings of a guy who just got into the history of Rome podcast butisnt this how the republic dies?"},{"text":"I worry about the fact that in swing stayes there is a tie.

We all had to put up with lines to buy gas - in California if your license plate was an odd number you could only buy gas on an odd-numbered day.And every nite on the TV was an Iran Hostage counter. Today was day 393 of the Crisis. Stagflation was on the news all the time. My parents were trying to buy a house at 12 and 13% interest rates.Now that I think about it things havent changed that much. People are being asked by the media to vote for more of the same. As if everything is going great.Reagan, like Trump, was vilified for lowering taxes. At University the first Econ class I took ridiculed the Laffer Curve. It was clear to me that I had to keep my political opinions private. Still do this to this day.Reagan, like Trump, was vilified for advocating deterrence. Oh the jokes that were made about the Star Wars missile defense proposal. Iran was told by Biden (and Harris) one word - dont - and of course Iran has used not only used the absence of strong deterrence but also $100B in Iranian assets the current administration freed up early upon taking power.Reagan, like Trump, was a political outsider.

People are waking up and realizing they are slaves, having their money extorted and sent to other psychopaths in other countries, and they will never own their home (property tax ensures this). The entire \\"developed\\" world is balanced slavery, and it affects the subconscious of every man, woman and child. Change is coming; no question. One reason the media is pushing the idea of \\"civil war\\" is because they love it when the people fight among themselves. The reality is we need a revolution; which is the overthrow and obliteration of the psyop known as \\"government\\"; a parasitic concept that enslaves, brainwashes and murders people with impunity. We weren't made to live like this (humans). We're living in unprecedented times of censorship; the truth is being wiped from the internet - even here on Reddit. Youtube has AI that instantly deletes comments and people aren't even made aware. People are losing their ability to express themselves online, being extorted from, and working jobs that destroy their souls.Above all else, to thine on self be true. And never comply. Stand for your values, trust your instincts, and always act with honor and seek the truth.That's the best we can do right now. My entire family moved to the country in Texas a few years ago (and friends followed us) because we know what's coming. We're prepared.

You will need to keep a surface-level view only if you want to stay a neoliberal (unless you are a multi-millionaire in which case neoliberalism actually benefits you and you can study it all you like)If you think governments or regulatory bodies should have the role of judging if a market action is good for the consumer or bad, then you are not a neoliberal. You are just a consumer of neoliberal PR. How airplane boarding of all things is the first example you have come across of markets being made worse for consumers in the interests of profit is funnyMarkets serve profit only. The leading competitors of a market are capitalists, and are directly incentivised to restrict the market to favour themselves. Neoliberalism is based in allowing capitalists to regulate their own industries, so you can imagine how unhelpful this is for consumers. Consumers, except in military purchasing or ultra luxury, are not as rich as the producers. Consumers are at the mercy of producers and voting with your wallet is only useful if you have very high purchasing power AND there is genuine choice in the marketCapitalists abhor competition (and free markets) so if given total freedom (as they are in neoliberalism) they rapidly restrict the market on a regulatory level and form agreements with other market leaders on a competition level, so they can have the highest profit items. If a medicine comes along that solves a disease for a fraction of the price of the leading medicine, this is bad for business. Do not look into medical research at all if you want to continue thinking companies produce the most effective medicine they can. Promising inexpensive treatments result in assassinations far more than they get to finish and public a paperYou can look at any industry and find every aspect of it to be worse for consumers in direct correlation with how open the market is to be regulated by capitalists (which is maximised with neoliberalism)Airplane seating arrangements should not be the accidental thing that sets off the destruction of modern capitalism. Either you want the boarding process to be deliberately bad for consumers because it is more profitable, or you are not a capitalist and certainly not a neoliberal.

The tie breakers were the very left leaning arab party, but they were a wild card.In 2021, an election result made it so that a wide coalition with left, right and arab parties was formed, and a rotation of PMs was decided. While Netanyahu was ousted, this coalition was very weak. \\nNaftali Benet was first PM in the rotation, even though his party had only 7 out of 120 seats in the parliament. But since he was the key factor to forming that coalition, they elected him duel PM with Yair Lapid.Unfortunately, that government broke up.And in the following election, the extreme right wing teamed up with the settler party, and were able to pass, and be the key votes in Netanyahu's party, and now we got 2 idiots as minister of finaces and nation security ??.","title":"CMV: A UK like system where we elect a Parliament that elects the head of state is the ideal system of government."},{"text":"If that's the standard, should she boycott the government meetings too? ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":" She apparently organised a party for rationalists where everyone involved had to be naked except for wearing a mask, in the hope that this would make them more fun.

They started hiding the numbers for subsequent years after appropriate backlash until a watchdog group figured out there's *atleast* 325,000 missing kids who were placed with unvetted \\"non-relative guardians\\" and promptly disappeared.The \\"rental kids\\" are tattooed with phone numbers of cartel traffickers who rent them to adults who want to jump to the front of the line at the border (this is a direct result of the Biden regime stopping DNA testing to make sure kids are with relatives, and then \\"prioritizing\\" to the front of the line anyone who brings a kid) and naturally border patrol aka processing agents turn a blind eye and send the kids back to the cartel for repeat use. The kids who are sold are taken by the dept of labor to be sold to labor traffickers, or taken by the office of refugee resettlement to be sold to sex traffickers.https://oversight.house.gov/release/grothman-biden-open-border-policies-led-to-historic-encounters-of-unaccompanied-alien-children%EF%BF%BC/\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/politics/coronavirus-lockdown-online-exploitation.html\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/25/us/migrant-smuggling-evolution.html\\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/whistleblower-us-government-become-middleman-multi-billion-dollar-child-trafficking-operation/\\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/biden-admin-pressed-over-85000-unaccounted-for-migrant-children-released-into-us-forced-labor-allegations/ar-AA1atRMa\\nhttps://nypost.com/2023/04/28/republican-senators-want-feds-to-explain-losing-85000-migrant-kids/\\nhttps://www.dailysignal.com/2023/04/18/biden-administration-official-unable-answer-whereabouts-85000-migrant-children/\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/19/1170802333/congressional-lawmakers-raise-concerns-about-the-welfare-of-migrant-children\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/politics/migrant-child-labor-biden.html\\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/advocates-hhs-questions-unaccompanied-migrants-child-labor-rcna87326\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/nyregion/sex-trafficking-couple-foster-care.html\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html\\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3957945-republicans-grill-bidens-refugee-resettlement-chief-on-migrant-child-labor/\\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/democrats-republicans-agree-biden-child-trafficking-crisis-not-fixed\\nhttps://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/records-hhs-sent-unaccompanied-minors-to-sponsors-with-ms-13-ties-potential-trafficking-rings\\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ice-unable-to-track-nearly-300k-immigrant-children-dhs-report/ar-AA1ptdYQ\\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/housing-provider-migrant-children-sexual-abuse/index.html\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/doj-migrants-southwest-key-lawsuit.html\\nhttps://apnews.com/article/southwest-key-migrant-children-lawsuit-ee466d9490ec8fcd90ce85b1afca0002This issue transcends partisanship.

It was constructed in America during the slave period, by slave owners.The problem was that there were essentially 3 groups of people living in the American south. The black slaves, white indentured servants who were brought over from Europe with their passage being paid for in return for what was essentially 7 years as a slave.And of course, the slave owners. The slave owner woke up one morning and realised that that these two groups were intermarrying and they vastly out numbered the slave owners.So the idea of \\"race\\" was invented. And preachers were preaching from the pulpits that God made them better than black people, who were \\"not quite human\\" so poor whites were still better than black people. They told the poor whites that they were \\"racially superior\\" to the blacks, and, as a result, they were willing to enforce the laws of slavery, rather than join with the slaves.Today this continues with racism being used as a distraction from those who are still essentially the \\"slave owners\\" the point one percent.

In my case, I stop answering work-related mails and messages after I finish work. If someone calls to ask me to do something work-related, if it's something that takes more than 5 minutes, I schedule it for the next day (unless it's urgent, which it usually isn't - if you're unsure, _ask_ if it's urgent).Also, something the client I work for does is he takes 2 hours off work every day, from 12 pm to 2 pm, to go practice sports. He otherwise works from 8 am to 8 pm every day, but in that 2h window he leaves his phone somewhere and goes to do his own thing.---One other important thing is to get out of the work mindset when you're not at work. Don't carry your work home with you, mentally or physically. For me, I signal to myself that I am done with work when I get on the bus and start reading something enjoyable, on the way back home from the office. That's become a trigger for me to get out of the work mindset.If you work from home, have a specific part of the house that's dedicated to work (e.g., the desk on which you put your PC/laptop), while the rest the home is not work related. Also, if you work from a PC or laptop, I recommend either only using the PC/laptop for work or at least using a separate virtual desktop (for Windows, see [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/multiple-desktops-in-windows-36f52e38-5b4a-557b-2ff9-e1a60c976434)) for work-related activity. That way, you can \\"switch\\" your attention when you're done with your tasks.Also, very important: the bedroom should _never_ have anything work related in it. Your bed should only be used for 2 things (sleep and the other thing). That means no work papers, no work laptop, none of that. Let yourself detach and really rest at least when you're in the bedroom. Leave your phone in another room if possible; if you need to check the time, use a wristwatch or a plain old clock.","title":"How can you, particularly in a demanding career, maintain a healthy work-life balance?"},{"text":"??","title":"Donate to Churches.

I volunteered during Katrina and I was sickened by how the Red Cross handled donations. They would collect the donations and not distribute them. They were collected in a connex and shipped out. Their explanation was that all the items had to be equal in size, brand, quantity, etc. An example is crayons for children: You can have 500 boxes of crayons and 200 children who want the crayons. If there are not 200 identical boxes like 16 pk crayons verses an 8 pack, then no one gets crayons. Same goes for sanitary products, if there are only half the amount of pads, verses tampons, then no one gets any, bedding was the same way.  They were turning volunteers away and said they only needed lawyers and doctors. We had a chef come in with a large food truck making creole and Cajun food and they were not allowed to serve the food where people were being housed, not even in the parking lot. He was instructed he had to leave the premises, but fortunately, some other people told them they could use another persons property a little further down the road and the word got out that they could walk down and get free food, but otherwise it wasnt allowed to be distributed where the Red Cross was at. I get they want to ensure the food is safe, but it was frustrating to watch a popular chef being told no and everyone wanted their food. The fact that they only wanted lawyers and a few doctors kind of rubbed me the wrong way. My first thought was the lawyers that are the first to show up at accidents, my first thought was money and greed rather being actually helpful. Ive heard, especially in other countries, that the Red Cross has done great things.  My experience, I wasnt able to see that, so I prefer to donate to private organizations and churches where I know the products are gonna make it out or maybe even want my help.Edited to add: The FEMA trailers that were brought in never got used!!!!

As well as being morally dubious, this is usually done based on party political processes which tend to favour the most politically extreme people. Here political memberships aren't affiliations, you are a paid member of an organisation. The last few Conservative PMs were elected solely by Conservative Party members and as such were the candidates that appealed to a far different and more politically extreme demographic then the population as a whole, resulting in the election of the likes of Liz Truss who quickly blew up the economy with her policies.","title":"CMV: A UK like system where we elect a Parliament that elects the head of state is the ideal system of government."},{"text":"Perfect.

And if that's true, that means the white hats/military/q/whoever it is is basically embarrassing the fuck out of democrats, making them look like absolute fools for 4 years. But more importantly, people have been Awakening more than ever before for 4 years now. Trump didn't create the Space Force for no reason. You know who doesn't mention the Space Force? Joe Biden or Deep State actors. Trump filed all sorts of executive orders and presidential emergency action documents (PEADs) and moved a bunch of people around at the end of his term in the department of defense (DOD)... Some of which only stayed in their position for about 4 weeks, before he moved them out again. He put special folks from the DOD to report directly to him. That's also an executive order that he passed changing who the Department of Defense Defense reports to. It used to have to go up the chain, but not anymore.Stealing an election in 2020 is considered an act of war. Trump himself has said out loud on stage that he is a 'wartime president'. You can't be a wartime president without being in a war. However, it's a silent information war that, as I've been saying, has been running in the background mostly unnoticed...And from Trump's favorite book, The Art of War:\\"Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness.

You don't have to have the kind of authority they did in the past to mess with democratic systems. Democratic systems depend on the concept of rule of law and the belief that people are doing things out of justice, transparency, and basic ethics. The Lords having as many of them appointed who appear tied to the money involved in the people who named them to the position undermines the belief in people that the democracy is working. Bishops being from a single religion that the enormous majority of people care little about is similar. Hereditary right contravenes the basic concept in society and British law that people should be equal before the law. Given that we know there are better ways of naming members of a second chamber, with many dozens of examples which could plausibly be chosen without adverse effects, it is strange to not do such a thing. Perhaps go with France or the Netherlands if you want as to how their senates work.First past the post has such a large number of dangerous effects on society that it would be hard to list them all. We know of an enormous number of alternatives to it, and there is literally no instance where first past the post will produce a more advantageous electoral result than other more democratic options, such as a proportional electoral system. Britain knows what those are, the idea of single transferable vote was invented in Britain and was ordered to be used by British citizens in places like Australia, on the Island of Ireland, in Scottish local elections, and more. Scotland and Wales and London use AMS, a type of mixed member system. Britain in general used closed list proportional representation while it was part of the EU to elect their MEPs. It is not a difficult preposition to work out why this is helpful. It is puzzling why you would suggest using the UK as the ideal political system, especially given that the criteria you seem to support would imply that a different government's methods should be used to attain them. Newfoundland for instance has a law that says that if the prime minister's identity changes partway through the term, a new election must occur within twelve months, which ties the will of the voters closer to what will be the will of the population as the parliament will not be so likely to oust a leader. German constructive votes of no confidence models will do something similar. Bulgarian and Greek constitutional law directly requires that the leader of the party with the most votes gets the right to be appointed if they have a majority of seats, and to try to form a government if they have the plurality without a majority. French regional elections have a runoff system to make it so that the legislature will support an executive leader with majority support. I can cite a lot of examples like this more if you have more criteria.","title":"CMV: A UK like system where we elect a Parliament that elects the head of state is the ideal system of government."},{"text":"Your dad is absolutely correct, get out of the big cities NOW go somewhere remote and try becoming off grid completely.

There also exist public roads, such as the golden gate bridge, on which travelers pay a toll, as well as private roads on which travelers are granted permission to travel freely. Historically, paying a toll to the owner of a road is not unheard of, but probably not always pragmatic.A more relevant application of libertarian thinking would be to reconsider the right of the government to force individuals to sell their property so that the government can build public infrastructure, something that happens from time to time in America.3.

This grant funding is a critical investment in President Bidens Unity Agenda for the Nation and the HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy, and supports evidence-based, holistic practices that address the overdose crisis through prevention; harm reduction, including naloxone and other opioid overdose reversal medications; treatment, including use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD); and recovery supports.Awards for fiscal year 2024 (FY24) build on efforts to ensure opioid overdose reversal medication saturation across communities, ensuring these medications are in the hands of those most likely to experience or witness an overdose. The FY24 awards have an increased focus on services for transitional aged youth and young adults (ages 16-25 years); expand availability of MOUD in correctional settings; and emphasize the role of services that use a whole-person approach by considering an individuals physical and mental health needs and their social supports. Additionally, TOR awards increased more than 14.5% over FY23 levels, and include a needs-based supplement to support tribes in counties with a high level of overdoses among Tribal members.  \\n...  \\nThe more than $1.5 billion in awards includes:* State Opioid Response C ($1.49 billion) C This program addresses the public health crisis caused by escalating opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related overdose across the nation by increasing access to MOUD; supporting the continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for OUD and other concurrent substance use disorders; and enhancing the continuum of care for stimulant misuse and use disorders, including those involving cocaine and methamphetamine.\\n* Tribal Opioid Response C ($63 million) C This program assists in addressing the opioid overdose crisis in Tribal communities by increasing access to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MOUD and supporting the continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for OUD and co-occurring substance use disorders.\\n* State Opioid Response/Tribal Opioid Response Technical Assistance C ($18.5 million) C This program, through free training and technical assistance, advances the provision of trauma-informed, culturally relevant, and evidence-based substance use-related approaches and interventions across the country and across the lifespan to reduce the impacts of opioid and stimulant misuse and use disorders on individuals, families, and communities.Since their inception in 2018, State and Tribal Opioid Response grants have funded treatment and recovery services for people in need across the country. For example, grantees reported more than 177,000 people received treatment for OUD and more than 56,000 people received treatment for stimulant use disorder between September 30, 2021, and September 29, 2022. During that same period, almost 480,000 people received recovery support services. Awards also support overdose prevention and response, with almost 2.7 million naloxone kits distributed and more than 92,000 reported overdose reversals between April 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023.Opioid response grant successes are most evident in qualitative improvements in the lives of participants. At the six-month follow-up, most clients reported improved housing stability, social connectedness, health, and employment and education achievement. For most participants, mental health outcomes also improved, with clients reporting less depression, less anxiety, less trouble controlling behavior, fewer suicide attempts, and increased abstinence from alcohol or drug use.  \\n...Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:Tribal and state opioid response grants are an integral part of advancing President Bidens and Vice President Harris Unity Agenda for the Nation, and a key tool to beating the opioid epidemic, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. In the past four years, these programs have connected hundreds of thousands of people to substance use disorder treatment, supported millions of people in recovery, and enhanced naloxone saturation efforts across the country. Were incredibly proud of these efforts and are following through on our commitment to expand prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery infrastructure across the nation.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Awards More than $1.5 Billion in State and Tribal Opioid Response Grants to Advance the Presidents Unity Agenda for the Nation"},{"text":"Orioles/Eagles fan?

Jericho is in the West Bank and is not an Israeli Air Force base.  My accusation is that Israel targets civilian areas out of- at best- a reckless disregard for civilian casualties. What is this accusation based upon?  an attack on ones ally is a reason for a response.Does Iran have a mutual defense treaty with Hezbollah?  As is the assassination of your own military personelAssassination? Do you have evidence that Israel specifically targeted Iranian personnel in Lebanon?  Israel set off bombs or launched air attacks across the entire country. Ok, and? Hezbollah operates across the entire country. It doesn't mean Israel is striking Lebanon. They can say it was only targeted at a specific group within the country, but tell anyone in Lebanon that Lebanon wasnt attacked and theyd set you straight.Will they? I do not ignore the attacks Hezbollah launches into Israel, but I also dont ignore the far larger number of attacks Israel has launched into Lebanon over the past year.So what you're saying is Israel has been repeatedly attack by Hezbollah in the run up to this engagement. this is all real politik, Israel forces invading Lebanon territory is something the government of Iran cannot ignore without betraying their allies and ignoring their own domestic pressures. And I'm saying that's not legitimate since their allies are terrorists that routinely attack Israel.since wwii, the standard approach to foreign policy has been to assume that everyone is a rational actor working in their own best interests and that any hostility will be met proportionally because that helps avoid war, which is bad for everyone.That approach kinda goes out the window when people start suicide bombing. The mad man theory is the belief that if you are a hegemony- regional in Israels case and globally in Americas- and you respond to every threat with overwhelming force than no one will make even the smallest attempt to challenge your power and influence. I think its apparent that Israel has taken this approach for at least a few decades. Is it? Israel let Hezbollah shoot rockets at it for almost a year without responding until now.  Israel always claims that they are attacking Gaza to liberate if from Hamas or attacking Lebanon to liberate it from Hezbollah.Israel claims it's attacking Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon not Gaza and Lebanon. Netanyahu today gave a speech for the people of Iran asking them to rise up because he wants to fight to free them from their regime.Ok, and? It was the exact same logic America used in Vietnam: we are bombing you for your own good, to free you from the radical elements youve allowed to take control. Its identical.

Ill ask again:Youre far from the first to argue that the slaughter of civilians should be sanctioned for X group. There are people arguing the same for Israel because Hamas founding charter contains whats basically fan fiction of genocide of Jews that involves talking trees. The only real innocents here are the civilians you advocate for using as human shields.So if youre so determined to allow some people to get free passes to cause mass civilian deaths, how do you think it should be decided who gets to? We cant just wait around for you to decide. You might be busy and eventually youll be dead so we need a longer term solution than that. What solid rule system do you think should be used to decide who can use civilians like shields and who cant? Who should administrate and enforce this rule system?Your comment also makes me wonder you say its unfair to expect a weaker force fighting for survival to not use any means at its disposal. That we cant expect them to just die but thats exactly the fate youre advocating for the civilians they use as shields or kill and steal from. You dont just expect them to be sacrificed by someone else but you want to sanction their mass deaths.My point is that no solution is going to be fair.

Treating existing laws as the default or pre-justified gives a minority the ability to hold onto power if you have a system where more than a simple majority of people need to change. Say for example we have a country with 100 states and 100,000 people, but the people aren't evenly distributed, so there are 50 states with 65,000 people in total and 35,000 in the other. If you need 51 states to change a law, then 35% of the country can functionally block changes that would address any imbalances in power between the states.

Stopping and shaking down citizens who were just sitting on their stoops.So, his family was ok with what he was *then*.  I never heard a peep from them *then*.But since he's fallen down the MAGA rabbit hole, it's a problem?  Now it's causing them all kinds of pain and turmoil... because it makes them look bad, *now*.  Because it's affecting them *now*.Boo f*cking hoo.Rudy Giuliani was always a bigot and a racist.He talks that \\"America first\\" stuff... But what prominent American stays in the country when they go on vacation?  They all go overseas and spend their money overseas.So how are you really \\"America first\\"?And his family was ok with what he was doing just a couple decades ago (I don't mean his kids... they were kids).  But his wife and family?You were ok with it when it affected people who you had no connection to.  But *now* that it affects you... Now you weep??I'm sorry but I have little sympathy for them.

Guerilla warfare is not a war crime. Using innocent civilians as shields is. Sure, thats one way to engage in guerilla warfare, but its far from inherent to it.Youre far from the first to argue that the slaughter of civilians should be sanctioned for X group. There are people arguing the same for Israel because Hamas founding charter contains whats basically fan fiction of genocide of Jews that involves talking trees. The only real innocents here are the civilians you advocate for using as human shields.So if youre so determined to allow some people to get free passes to cause mass civilian deaths, how do you think it should be decided who gets to? We cant just wait around for you to decide. You might be busy and eventually youll be dead so we need a longer term solution than that. What solid rule system do you think should be used to decide who can use civilians like shields and who cant? Who should administrate and enforce this rule system?Your comment also makes me wonder you say its unfair to expect a weaker force fighting for survival to not use any means at its disposal. That we cant expect them to just die but thats exactly the fate youre advocating for the civilians they use as shields or kill and steal from. You dont just expect them to be sacrificed by someone else but you want to sanction their mass deaths.My point is that no solution is going to be fair. There will always be unfairness, even to an extreme degree. Weve decided on a set of rules designed to put civilians first. Once you decide to try to kill people, like you said, you cant expect them not to defend themselves. So combatants get some protections too but we prioritize civilians, who havent decided to try to kill anyone.Would you rather a world where combatants are first priority and civilians are fodder? I wouldnt. In fact, weve decided as a planet that thats not okay.","title":"CMV: its is hypocritical to condemn Irans attack on Israel but not condemn Israels attack on Lebanon"},{"text":"More like if babies died in car crashes on the regular people would have more of them knowing some wouldnt make it, ya know like the good ole days!","title":"JD Vance Once Claimed Car Seats Drove Down Birth Rate By Over 100,000"},{"text":"What's wrong with a floating pier?","title":"Biden won't support a strike on Iran nuclear sites as Israel weighs response to Iran missile attack"},{"text":"I don't remember it that way, but I'm probably wrong.

Israel killed 40.000 Palestinians in the first 5 months of the conflict. This is in response to 1,300 Israelis being killed.That's certainly a number alleged by Hamas. It doesn't really matter since number of dead isn't an element of genocide. They have targeted civilian infrastructure, despite the fact that in the vast majority of cases there was no Hamas presence nearby.Can you prove this claim? They have targeted journalists- in 2023 the majority of journalists killed in that year were killed in Gaza, despite the conflict in Palestine only raging for 2 months of 2023, and the Ukraine war being ongoing.Did these journalists engage in hostilities therefore removing their protections under international law. They seized control of the Rafah crossing and prevented people from leaving.Prevented people from leaving? Was Egypt letting people leave previously? They blocked food and medicine from entering Gaza.Food and medicine is entering Gaza. They shut off the water, shut off the electricity, shut off the internet,No country has a duty to provide anything to it's opponents. Their only duty is to allow aid to be transmitted to protected persons. and they went from hospital to hospital, laying siege claiming that they were Hamas bases, only to find nothing.Do you know that this is [incorrect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/21/al-shifa-hospital-gaza-hamas-israel/)?

No doubt there is a lot of antisemitism among Palestinians, but it pales in comparison to the antisemitism many in the West like to imagine they have.Fear not, for it is contained in the founding documents of all pro-palestinian organizations! Hamas specifically rose to power on rejecting a peaceful two-tstae solution and preference for total war. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. That's besides the point though, as Palestinians have no power to ethnically cleanse Israel, but Israel has plenty of power to ethnically cleanse Palestine, and is in the process of doing so, and has over decades expanded their borders by doing so. Capability is not intent, nor does it affect morals. My interest here is in what can practically be done to stop the deaths, not in saying who is 'good' and who is 'bad'. It doesn't matter if most Palestinians are 'bad', they still don't deserve to have their families crushed to death under rubble.That's your interest. A moralist may not agree.

The region's Jewish and Druze populations have a moral right to equal protection under the law.2. The only state willing to provide that equal protection is Israel. The question is around by how Israel exists. And in its current form it is a belligerent apartheid state escalating violence with its regional neighbors.?You can believe this with all your heart, but it doesn't expose a logical contradiction in people who don't. Yes, Israels enemies in the region are racist. But to say that means Israel is moral and Hezbollah is immoral therefore Israel can act immoral towards the country that is host to Hezbollah, is counter intuitive.?Refer to the above assumptions. Hezbollah and Hamas (the legitimate elected and popular government of all Palestinians since 2006) have no desire to grant the region's non-muslim populations equal protection under the law. Hamas specifically says that they'll slaughter the Jews and Druze summarily. If we assume they have a right to life, anything that supports the Palestinians in their current state is inherent immoral. That includes Hezbollah. Additionally, I would argue that the racist sentiment of Israels enemies is fostered by Israel itself.

The region's arab muslim population turned against the region's non-arab and non-muslim population in 1876 after the Ottomans passed a constitution granting non-muslims equal protection under the law in clear violation of the edicts of Mohammed, who demanded non-muslims be second-class citizens in a system which informed Hitler's view of Slavs (im not kidding, Hitler repeatedly praised Arabs for having found this solution).

You seem to be GROSSLY misinformed and looks like you're being fed propaganda. You whole post is utterly one-sided with frankly ridiculous claims. Israelis attack on Lebanon is surely not motivated by \\"desire to escalate the conflict\\". I mean that's outright stupid, why would they want to escalate the conflict just because. The motivation for attacking Hezbollah is to dismantle an officially designated terrorist organization that for the past 11 months shelled civilian areas in northern Israel. Verifiably.I am not claiming that Israel is all good and holy (I don't agree with Netanyahu in many things, and the handling of Gaza etc.).But this sounds like straight up misinformation-led hatred. \\n the Iranian governments handling of the conflict in the levant right now is downright reasonable and measured.Do you find firing 180+ ballistic missiles at military, but also civilian areas \\"reasonable and measured\\"? Are you out of your mind? Would you think the same if Israel didn't happen to have Iron Dome that was able to defend them and intercept majority of the missiles? So no, it is not hypocritical. One (Iran's) attack aims to erase the other state out of existence. The other (Israel's) attack is to dismantle terrorist organization that is not even the official government in Lebanon, one of its goals is to destroy Israel and has been attacking their civilians with rockets. Let me put it one more different way: if Iran didn't attack Israel, nothing would've happened to them. If Israel didn't attack Hezbollah, their civilians in the North of the country would suffer consistent shelling from terrorist organization. Would the US, or any state for that matter, let their territory get bombed without a response? And Israel has no claim over Lebanon. They don't want to destroy it, or conquer it. Israel is showing us a total shit-show in Gaza and West Bank, because they consider it \\"their territory\\". That's condemnable. But don't conflate the two, this is different. On the other hand, Iran (and Hezbollah) *officially* want Israel gone as a state and as a nation (they call it \\"Zionist regime\\").

At least in the eyes of anyone sane. They've been using those contained areas near the border to stockpile weapons and launch rockets from since as early as 1982. This is speculation, but I'd say the only reason Israel hasn't definitely removed Hezbollah is specifically *because* of the potential condemnation you speak of. Israel is not motivated solely by a desire to escalate the conflict; they are motivated by a desire to remove an existential threat from their border. One that has clearly stated intentions and has been there for nearly 50 years.I don't condemn Israel's attempt to secure the border because of the context; also, the fact that Iran even feels the need to respond to Israel's incursion on a *different* country should tell all you need to know; that Iran funds terrorist groups in said country and has an invested interest in them.

Also they feared demagogues, which arguable DOESN'T work as shown evident by trump's election.Finally, the constitution was ratified with 13 colonies in mind, then we bit by bit added states. What was the rationale for states of certain sizes of certain populations? Why was California such a large and populated state while there are smaller states with less populations filling the void between population centers.Ignoring how these states were defined/drawn up, and saying that it's divine providence that a minority can hold hostage the majority is just being hard headed for the sake of being difficult. Additionally, the dick swinging by the minority is bad for business. California also happens to have a large portion of our nation's ports and 15% of the GDP.

And the objective is clear: the President of the United States is to be chosen **not** by the people of the United States of America, but rather by the **states** via their legislatures. In fact, there is no requirement that the people have any vote at all for President of the United States of America. California's legislature can pick the name out of a hat. Wyoming can hold a darts contest. Vermont can select the candidate based on height, Texas based on weight, Nevada can roll dice, and the Mississippi legislature can choose based on which Crayon tastes the best. The electors show up, cast their ballots, those are counted, and a winner is decided. The **states** choose the President specifically to ensure that the **states** are represented in the US Federal government. Prior to the 17th Amendment, it worked the same way for US Senators: states chose them. Madison, Mason, Pierce, and others wanted to ensure that the Federal government had a balance of views and opinions, was seen as universally legitimate, would respect the rights of the states, and not be fully subject to the whims of the populace.You can't with a straight face say that a state like Wyoming with 560,000 citizens should have the same exact voice as California.Oh I assure you, I absolutely can. The United States is just that - a union of sovereign, independent states who have each, individually, chosen to cede limited power and authority to the Federal government to promote certain positive outcomes (e.g., related to trade, defense, etc.) Wyoming is a state. California is a state. Each state is equal within the union. Your perspective effectively erases states from existence and posits that they're merely an archaic abstraction, rather than the legal sovereigns who actually agreed to form this union and maintain rights and powers within its legal framework. You argue that the number of people in a state should directly determine its voice in the Federal government, but that is **precisely** what the US Constitution **prevents**, on purpose.Let Wyoming have a voice, but perhaps without a 72x multiplier.There is no \\"let\\". Wyoming has a legal right, under the US Constitution, to the voice that it has, regardless of how many people choose to live there or elsewhere. The state itself is an independent legal entity and it would be unlawful and unjust to strip those powers, rights, and authorities it has not ceded as part of its agreement to join the union.The US Constitution is quite deliberately structured to ensure states balance the populace to ensure stability, unity, and protection of varied interests. The 10th Amendment and Article IV Sec 4 specifically speak to that.","title":"Another poll shows Ted Cruz trailing Democratic challenger Colin Allred"},{"text":"That's just a catch all term for a magnificent specimen of nocturnal bird.","title":"US Trademark Office cancels Marvel, DC's 'Super Hero' marks"},{"text":"Blue MAGA, LMAO. \\nLay off the Kremlin paid Russian propagandists for your political insight.

No, some places youll have an exclusive lounge and transfer directly to boarding, first, without waiting in line. If you arrive after the beginning of boarding, you still dont stand in line, you walk to the front, scan and go. You dont have to shimmy to the back of the aircraft, your seat is right there. Youre one of the first off the aircraft and on your way. And I already explained to you, the efficiency youre advocating for isnt doing anything. Shave off a few minutes of boarding, at best youre gaining an hour of time you could operate that aircraft longer than its already going. Most airlines arent pushing their aircraft that hard thatll make a difference.

Yes, it's a privilege, but removing this removes a measure of comfort from frequent flyers and passengers paying top dollar, which airlines are very reluctant to lose.Even jockeying for overhead bin space is not really an argument in this.

Outside-In is great, but that also means people who paid more for their aisle seats are also the last to board and probably miss out on overhead bin space. Not all planes or airport gates can accommodate dual-door boarding, etc.Airlines want to board efficiently (to minimize turnaround time) and to maximize customer satisfaction, but ultimately airlines care most about profits. Customers care about boarding efficiency but we also care about other things (e.g. simplicity, choice of seating/order of boarding, etc) and many are willing to pay for it, even if it means inefficient boarding overall.

Russia today is a gangster-capitalist oligarchy with far greater disparities between rich and poor than most developed countries. Putin is currently waging exactly the kind of imperial war in Ukraine that Marx abhorred. And Putin heads a socially conservative government that gains much of its legitimacy from a cynical alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church.[Foundations of Leninism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/ch06.htm): ...The unquestionably revolutionary character of the vast majority of national movements is as relative and peculiar as is the possible revolutionary character of certain particular national movements. The revolutionary character of a national movement under the conditions of imperialist oppression does not necessarily presuppose the existence of proletarian elements in the movement, the existence of a revolutionary or a republican programme of the movement, the existence of a democratic basis of the movement. The struggle that the Emir of Afghanistan is waging for the independence of Afghanistan is **objectively a revolutionary struggle**, despite the monarchist views of the Emir and his associates, **for it weakens**, **disintegrates and undermines imperialism**; whereas the struggle waged by such \\"desperate\\" democrats and \\"Socialists,\\" \\"revolutionaries\\" and republicans as, for example, Kerensky and Tsereteli, Renaudel and Scheidemann, Chernov and Dan, Henderson and Clynes, during the imperialist war was a reactionary struggle, for its results was the embellishment, the strengthening, the victory, of imperialism. For the same reasons, the struggle that the Egyptians merchants and bourgeois intellectuals are waging for the independence of Egypt is objectively a revolutionary struggle, **despite the bourgeois origin and bourgeois title of the leaders of Egyptian national movement**, despite the fact that they are opposed to socialism; whereas the struggle that the British \\"Labour\\" Government is waging to preserve Egypt's dependent position is for the same reason a reactionary struggle, despite the proletarian origin and the proletarian title of the members of the government, despite the fact that they are \\"for\\" socialism. There is no need to mention the national movement in other, larger, colonial and dependent countries, such as India and China, every step of which along the road to liberation, even if it runs counter to the demands of formal democracy, is a steam-hammer blow at imperialism, i.e., is undoubtedly a revolutionary step.","title":"Kamala Harris AIPAC handler husband Doug Emhoff had an interview on MSNBC with Jen Psaki where he once again decried the rise of antisemitism.

It is first class, some order of veterans, frequent fliers, then ticket type based on fare class and there are some additional factors that come into play sometimes like advance purchase and check in time. The challenges to your proposed alternative (random) is that many if not most people on any given flight are already confused by this system and crowd the boarding door anyway. Switching to a new system that is random would require people to generally be more aware of how airports/boarding works, what the things on their boarding pass mean, and be attentive when gate agents make announcements. Given that is really difficult with what is currently happening a more complex system seems even worse. Additionally you're taking away a benefit of airline loyalty, and one that is relatively free to provide for airlines. This service is socially valuable for people that spend the most on air travel.

Peoples time are wasted so that the people in the front can have a sense of arrogance for all the lower-class people that walk by them. This seems to be a service that though people are willing to pay for, but is not a valuable service.First, I thought they generally boarded the way they do -- in a general sense, excepting special classes -- because of the overhead bins. People in the front won't run to the back to stow shit, but ppl in the back WILL stow shit in the front if given the opportunity (both so they don't have to carry/drag it further and bc they can then jump up and clear out and grab bags as they get out).efficient boarding methods means more, cheaper flights. This can help reduce the profit loss, but even if there is a profit loss, that means that the market has been distorted by airlines getting more money for a socially invaluable service. That money could be better spent on other things.Second -- does it? How much time would be theoretically saved by boarding back-first, if that's what you're advocating? And how much time would be lost with people fighting over the stupid bin space or getting bags, because if it was back first and ppl stowed their stuff in the front and then the ppl from the front had to go to the back to get off, OR if flight attendants were somehow tasked with trying to get ppl to stow by their seats it'd just be time taken arguing, trying to do what they wanted, etc.,","title":"cmv: Airlines Shouldnt Be Allowed to Use Intentionally Inefficient Boarding Methods"},{"text":"I protest that as my 5 year old would never be that mean.

The attacks from political leadership do matter.The real issue is two-fold: Harris has to look strong to brush off criticisms that she can't protect America and its \\"allies\\" (because she is a weak communist woman being the implication) and Harris has to maintain continuity with the present administration's fairly bad policy, because she needs to signal to all of our allies, including Israel, that we aren't allies of convenience and that, even though it is a decision largely based on morality, it will likely be read the same way Trump's attitude towards NATO is read.Edit: None of this is to say that Harris shouldn't do the morally correct thing, but those are, I believe, the two major factors keeping her from doing so.","title":"Democratic voters want Kamala Harris to stand up for Palestinians.

One of the reasons we have boarding groups is that they don't want 400 person lineups clogging up airports. So breaking it down into groups keeps at least some people sitting. For many of the more efficient methods, you need to know who is travelling together so that you don't separate families or groups of people. And some people travel after booking and paying for their own tickets, so there isn't a direct way to know if people are together. Another reason it exists as it does is that flight attendants are not paid until the doors are closed, so there is an economic incentive to not have everyone boarded efficiently.

The US didn't retaliate as none of the attacks were against Americans, though it was acknowledged they heavily destabilized the country.From there, the US acted alone in 'planning' a withdrawal, to the contempt of the United Nations and allied forces in the region. President Biden worked to build a strategy upon assuming office, but was met with consistent roadblocks. In April 2021, Biden pushed the withdrawal to September 11, 2021. On May 1, 2021, the Taliban launched a major offensive against the Afghan Armed Forces leading to further destabilization until an escalated retreat was order for August 31.

It was felt that if amalgamation between the races was to happen, it would happen between Irish and blacks. But, ultimately, the Irish made the decision to embrace whiteness, thus becoming part of the system which dominated and oppressed blacks.

My wife is an American Indian. Neither would be classified as such by US census designation. So that doesnt really work as you think it does. But I reject outright the terms white, black, Hispanic or Latino and, most of all, Asian.These are top level heritage indicators. If you have a group of 10 people, even if you reject the terms, you understand them and would likely be able to group the people in question correctly per the categories. That makes them broadly applicable and broadly useful.All of these so-called categories are essentially meaningless and I think it would make more sense to do away with them completely and to focus more on a household income and educational attainment when looking at demography.Different people groups tend to have different cultures and also tend to self segregate. Income is not a useful metric when you want to know what the dominant language and culture of an area is so you can make an effective grade school curriculum. Race, on the other hand, is much more useful. If your community is 60% latino, it is sensible to lesson plan accordingly. Youll maybe want to get a Spanish-speaking teacher or office staffer, for example. What exactly is a white person?A person of largely European heritage who likely has a largely shared legal tradition and religious history with other similar looking people from the general area. Since most of them have white skin, and since this characteristic is the easiest aspect of their physical person to identify, its a good start for making certain assumptions about what they expect in the social/cultural context. If youre shown white person and an Asian person and are told that one of these two people speaks English, who are most people likely to assume is the English speaker? And what answer will be correct most of the time?To take just one example, we now have hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the United States, all of whom appear to be white but they have no systemic benefits. Racial demographic categorization isnt overtly about welfare rights or systemic benefits. This seems to be getting into false premise territory. There is no such thing as white people. Sure there are. Same as there are green apples. Again, youre assuming that this is a detailed descriptor. Its not. Its top level. This is like saying definitions in the dictionary arent legitimate because theyre just made up and only work because most people agree. What about Latinos?  Here we can at least claim that there is a claim of common Spanish heritage, right?  Well, no actually. Not if you factor in Brazil which is the giant of the regionThe Latin in America comes from the Vulgar Latin language tree. This includes Spanish, Portuguese, and, amusingly, French. But the US census uses the category Hispanic or Latino as a top-level term. Hispanic is derived from Hispanicus, which is modern-day Spain and Portugal. but, even then, what does a person from Dominican Republic, where most people are descended from enslaved Africans have in common with a person from Argentina where most people are descended from 19th century European immigrants or someone from Mexico where most people are of mixed European and Spanish heritage.They speak Spanish and can understand one another easily. This allows them to be fundamentally more compatible with one another than with, say, white people in North Dakota who only speak English. The answer is no. The answer is obviously yes. Shared language is fundamental when it comes to social classification, cohesion, and compatibility. Its one of the foundational building blocks of society. What is Asia? Is it even a thing?It is an entire continent. But is there any common linguistic, cultural or historical heritage between a person born in China and a person born in India?  India has only recently started being called Asian. Its a PR thing. Pretty amusing. Theyre more accurately called South Asian. But most people just call them Indians. So just what the hell is Asian and what do Asians have in common with one another?  Nothing.  Many do. Many dont. For the purposes of people group designation, it is presumed that broadly, Asians are going to be culturally more similar to one another as a group of disparate Asian constituents than, say, they will be to latinos. Or blacks. Or whites. And vice versa. You might think that Im being pedantic. You are. Youre making a largely semantic argument. Can anybody really claim that such a thing as a white person or a black person or an Asian or a Latino really exist?  Am I missing some logic or benefit from categorizing people in this way?Yes. I am white. My wife is latino. I even have a Black Friend?, lmao. Your mistake is in thinking the top level designation means that all the constituent groups within that designation are the same. Nobody is making that argument, and nobody has ever made that argument (outside of pedantry). Your thesis here boils down to These top level menus dont exist because not all the web pages under them are the same identical web page, theyre only cursorily related. In the US, broad demographic parsing exists for many reasons, some good, some bad. Examples of good: Lesson planning in public schools, local health initiatives for genetically predisposed (to whatever) populations, market research insights for small businesses, etc. Examples of bad: Gerrymandering, crime data obfuscation (Non-White Hispanic is really amusing  Im surprised you didnt get after that one in your OP), racial quotas that dont make distinctions beyond top level (i.e. the college admissions scandal you mentioned), etc. Basically, youd be able to *start* sorting based on expected culture and heritage using the top level racial rubric. For some things, that might be enough. For other things, you need to sort further.","title":"CMV: The Way Race is Categorized in the United States Makes Almost Zero Sense"},{"text":"Yeah fair point but I hope they've fixed the polling errors since 2020, Marquette was very accurate in 2022.","title":"Kamala Harris maintains tight 4-point Wisconsin edge over Donald Trump in Marquette poll"},{"text":"There might be some slight movement, but unless something dramatic happens domestically, I don't see much of a shift happening.

Where do you think terms like manifest destiny come from or ideas like the one drop rule come from. Due to the  racial categorization in this country historically white people from all across the world have been able to come here and adopt themselves into white culture in America solely based on skin color, sure a Ukrainian right now is considered a foreigner, but in one generation their child would be considered American as if their family has lived their for generations. This is in comparison to for example Asian Americans, some of which have been here since the 1900s yet they always get questioned on whether or not theyre American . \\n \\nWhite immigrants might not have participated in slavery but that doesnt mean they dont come here and benefit from Racist policies, and a racist history meant to Benefit people of European descent. Do you really think that white immigrants didnt get any privilege for being white, congress has historically  passed laws that specifically block immigration from Asia or Africa, while prioritizing immigrants from western and Central Europe. \\n \\nThis is also not to mention that a lot of white immigrants come to the United States and perpetuate white American supremacy in favor of getting ahead.  back in the day  the Italian immigrants who came to United States  kicked out black folk from unions that black folk started started and the Irish Americans who joined police forces  abused black folk in their own community, both of these European immigrant groups benefited heavily from identifying themselves and inducting themselves into wider white American culture.","title":"CMV: The Way Race is Categorized in the United States Makes Almost Zero Sense"},{"text":"No such thing as an independent anymore.
