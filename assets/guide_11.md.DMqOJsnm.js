Woke has also been used as shorthand for some ideas of the American Left involving identity politics and social justice, such as white privilege and reparations for slavery in the United States.The phrase stay woke was uttered in recordings from the mid-20th century by Lead Belly and, post-millennium, by Erykah Badu. The term woke gained further popularity in the 2010s. Over time, it became increasingly connected to matters beyond race such as gender and identities perceived as marginalized. During the 2014 Ferguson protests, the phrase was popularized by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists seeking to raise awareness about police shootings of African Americans. After the term was used on Black Twitter, woke was increasingly used by white people, who often used it to signal their support for BLM. The term became popular with millennials and members of Generation Z. As its use spread internationally, woke was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017.Since most people dont even know what it references or means, Im genuinely curious as to why woke is a bad thing?  I agree that people and businesses using social issues for making money or virtue signal while not actually believing it is bad and over the top, but overall its a good thing.  Like it or not, the world is changing and the ideals of promoting acceptance for all kinds of folks is not going anywhere, nor will culture war battles and political intervention stop it.  The world is connected like never before and everybody deserves to be on the same level.  Once again its just a buzzword that people get mad at, but dont understand the full picture.  Its like when people scream socialism without actually looking at what its in reference to.  Hardly anybody, no matter how left leaning is advocating for a communist utopia, just certain benefits, like healthcare for everybody.  Given the recent events, its pretty clear an overwhelming majority want things fixed.  As far as woke everybody wants to not be ridiculed and bullied for who they are.  Thats not too much to ask.  Nobody is forcing you to change or live any differently.   Everybody just wants to be happy and live their life in peace.  Until that happens, clearly marginalized people are going to fight back.  4 years will go quick all this culture war nonsense helps nobody, just the 1% holding the rest of us down.  Hate and fear do nothing, but hurt the people pushing it, and us fighting each other.

They have defined a policy framework that has no impact on your ability to identify however you wish.  But in order to implement these policy objectives you have to be able to define terms.  And in order to define terms that effectively lay the groundwork for effective enforcement, you have to lay out two distinct categories for division.  You can dress how you want.  Call yourself whatever you want.  Live however you want.  You just don't get to be a male rapist with women locked in a cage with you every night.  And you don't get to beat the hell out of women in contact sports.  You will have to be recognized by your biological gender for policy purposes when division of genders is necessary.  That does not restrict your rights **at all.**","title":"The Science President: Trump Vows to Make Two Genders the Official Policy of the United States ??"},{"text":"Don't forget Iran.

Not many countries are going to abandon the US because they hold US treasures on their balance sheet, and they export their products to the largest and wealthiest consumer market in the world.  If you don't sell to US buyers, there's nowhere in the world a country could go to replace them.  A country would tank their own economy. Look at Russia in Ukraine.

At the same time, though, they want a white man in office who validates their thoughts and feelings by saying, this is a problem! So they can feel supported and seen.

Balls, galas, dinners, events, travel, etc.  this stuff is expensive and the government isnt paying for any of it.  Trump raised significantly more than any other prior president for their inauguration in his first term, than should have ever been needed, especially since he held less events, over fewer days and had much fewer attendees than all of his modern predecessors.  What typically occurs is that the money that is raised is used with very little left over.  Trump basically had $50 million or more left over, which was concerning.  Previous presidents have donated any leftover money for minor renovations of the White House, vp residence or other events that the president may have an interest in (Easter egg hunt, Thanksgiving turkey event, 4th of July stuff, etc).  Those funds should not be used for personal use, as the inauguration fund is orchestrated through a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.  I believe that leftover money has also been donated to charities in the past as well, which is permitted.  The most concerning thing to me is that foreign nationals are not permitted to contribute to any inauguration fund (federal law), so Im not sure how a foreign corporation is permitted to donate funds.","title":"Toyota is donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"So I can return to campus without being hurled anti-Semitic shouts that would make the Nazis proud?

Yes, the USA has a \\"better\\" economy but that better economy is built upon exploiting workers even more and lowers the standard of the living for most.

Canada and USA are usually way closer.For the US itself it also won't play out favorably. If the US forcully annexes Canada or Greenland that almost certainly means war with NATO.

Sure after the war there might be a \\"miracle recovery\\" but if the resources spent on that war would be focused on improving the life of the citizens, everyone would be better off.Even if a war is somehow prevented, which is likely in case of annexing Panama, there would be still a shit ton of economic and political sanctions placed on the US. Which will hurt the wellbeing of american citizen more than anything they would gain from annexing Panama, Greenland, or even Canada. Especially since the USA will have to pour significant resources into that area to actually make use of it. Canadians won't just simply say \\"welp\\" and continue on with their life. At the very least there would be countless protests. Worst case scenario (for the USA) there would be a full blown resistance that sabotages US industries that open up.It also makes the US more vulnerable against other enemies. Europe and Canada are the closest allies the US have. There are way more threatening countries out there.

Im speculating but the tea party was born specifically out of reactions to legislation passed by the democrats. I dont know if you were voting age or politically engaged in 2008 and 2010 (not that it would invalidate your opinion). I was and had just finished a masters in public policy, so will readily admit my take may be heavily influenced by being in that bubble at that time. However, I remember that CNBC reporter going off on the idea of helping distressed homeowners right after we had bailed out the banks and that really igniting the tea party fuse. As far as Trump goes, my point is premised on his policies hurting average consumers with tariffs and deportations. Trump barely accomplished anything in his first term legislatively. He talked a lot of shit and his hardcore base thought he did so much but objectively he passed a big corporate tax cut and thats about it. If he is successful and putting in across the board tariffs and mass deportations its going to cause worse inflation than we just experienced. I say this because he will almost certainly get another tax cut through and balloon the deficit. This will lead to more inflation. Its going to come down hardest in areas that have the largest proportion of people that voted for him.So, while you may not agree with my take and of course I could be wrong, Im not pulling it out of thin air.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"You really are missing the point completely. Moderates aren't dictating the party. They are not the only group Dems have to negotiate with. They have to do so with progressives too.  It's how politics works. The reason I keep pointing out why progressive ideas are unpopular is to illustrate exactly why we have to compromise. It's because progressives make up a fringe minority that struggle to get elected outside deep blue areas. If Progressives were winning the overwhelming majority of elections, you wouldn't have to do this.The problem is, their success is mostly confined to deep blue states.YOU CAN'T PASS LEGISLATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE SENATORS. That is the whole point I am making. And if your ideas are unpopular, YOU WONT WIN ELECTIONS. That is the whole reason I bring up it is unpopular. We wouldn't have had a senate majority without Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, John Fetterman, and Jon Tester. You sort of have a point with Sinema, but with a lot of these people, we would never have had dems in those seats without them. They are responsible to their constituents, not progressives living in deep blue states. They would lose re-election if they voted like Bernie.Has it not occurred to you that progressives do exactly what you accuse moderates of doing? Holding the party hostage and try to dictate what Dems do? Seriously, in every single election since 2016 the Bernie bro mob has thrown a fit because Dems don't want to risk embracing a platform that isn't even popular among themselves just to pander to people who will vote for Trump or abstain if they don't get what they want. Moderate voters have genuine concerns, they are not ideologues and can be reasoned with, and they give more votes. That's why the dems put more effort in there.Has it not occurred to you that people like Cori Bush represent a laughably small amount of people. You do not seem understand the fact that there are over 300 million people in this country, progressives are in the minority and you have to compromise when you are in the political minority. Especially when you are the minority among your party. It doesn't all revolve around you, EVERYBODY has to compromise in politics. You guys aren't special. And then what gets me is the fact you are okay with FORCING it on the rest of the party that doesn't want it, and the rest of the country. It really amazes me people don't see the problem like this.?When a party has the opportunity to institute programs that actually benefit Americans, they ought to do that and not hide behind opinion polling.That is the whole basis of their whole argument. Bernie would have won because polling shows he would have. People like M4A because a poll says 99% of Americans responded yes when asked if they want free shit. I only bring up polling in response to people using this as \\"evidence\\" your ideas are popular.Progressives are not sabotaged. They are doing the sabotaging. Cori Bush was primaried because of her filthy remarks about October 7th. She is in a deep blue district that is 80% Democrat. Her challenger was successful because of her extremism and it didn't hurt the party. It means an already democratic district has a congressperson that isn't dragging down the whole party. It would hurt the party to primary Joe Manchin with someone more progressive, lose the Senate seat, and give the whole Senate to Mitch McConnel.Do you not remember RGB's passing and the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett right before an election, the exact opposite of what the GOP claimed should happen just a few years prior?You are really out of touch with reality if you think Dems haven't been doing it too. They haven't been as bad, but they still do this. And it amazes me you don't see the problem with this. Abandoning the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court are things that would change our democratic system permanently and that will be exploited by the Republicans as soon as they get into power. This is literally how democracies die is by throwing institutional norms down the trash just to push. their own policy goals. Do Republicans do it? Yes. Will it make society better if we have two authoritarian anti-democratic populists movements competing to force their agenda on the public?No. It just means there is no democratic option to vote for, and it means that we will end up being a hybrid regime much sooner. And I find it absurd you accuse me of \\"defending behavior\\" like I should abandon any skepticism of the idiotic views progressives promote and just jump on board with zero skepticism to the largest expansion of government power in U.S. history.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"Since you mentioned comments about annexing Canada (which will never happen and are just typical Trumpian bluster, but let's pretend for the sake of argument this was a serious proposal), could you sketch out how my country (a first-world nation that regularly tops happiness indices, and which is consistently one of the world's 10 largest enconomies by GDP) would be improved by being forced to become part of the U.S.?","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"The maratimes and Newfoundland have long been neglected by the Canadian government.

The actual natives of the land number so few that there's no large internal squabbling in the USA. But take other countries, like in Turkey there are the Kurds. Kurds used to have their own country, but now their population is split into three countries. Turkey tries very hard to keep this setup, because the Kurds, in reality, would like to be in their own country. And the Kurd population is LARGE. It would not be unthinkable to destabilize Turkey simply by arming their Kurdish minority and helping them get their own country violently.It's difficult to do that with the USA because the natives are simply not a large enough percent of the population, nor are they centered in one area, nor are they even one people; they come from many tribes. Point being, if the USA starts conquering new areas, the new areas are not going to consider themselves American. They'll consider themselves, for instance, Mexican, under the occupation of America.This is what slowly killed empires like the Roman Empire. They had to constantly put down rebellions as the groups of conquered people often hated the Roman Empire and gladly joined rebellions. Rome was in a constant state of internal civil war.If I'm not mistaken this was a part of the logic behind the Monroe Doctrine. Everybody is better off if we remain in our groups that we actually want to be a part of while helping each other. You can see how well the USA's attempts at getting an ally in the Middle East has gone. We spent 20 years and billions of dollars trying to give Afghanistan a stable democracy and good education systems only for it to all fall apart in a week. You simply cannot force your way of life on other people long term. It has always lead to collapse in the long run.The USA may well conquer Canada and Mexico. Heck, it may conquer all of the Americas with its incredible military might. But that will just lead to a dozen different civil wars which need to be violently silenced. And all that effort on internal squabbles makes the USA weak to Russia or China. We'd slowly lose our ability to help overseas allies and fight proxy wars until we had no global hegemony at all.I mean, also, the moral implications are obvious. But even geopolitically it seems like a terrible idea.","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"I disagree with your assessment of what passing his policies will do to Trump, at least somewhat because I disagree with your assessment of why 2010 was so red.I don't think 2010 was red because Obama passed his policies, especially since he failed to pass universal healthcare, the big promise of the Democratic Party. The 2010 midterm is anomolously red. Looking at the popular vote swing from the 2008 Presidential one to the SHAVE'd 2010 House one (12.34 points), it's a major outlier, only possibly matched or passed by the anti-Clinton swing in 1992-1994. A major source of complaints I heard about Democrats knowledgeable about that time was that Obama, unlike Clinton or even Biden, was just massively lazy and didn't help downballot Dems much, which combined with his ambitious platform being watered down just caused his base to completely dry up and the decently competent GOP to handle the rest.I think Trump actually *does* need to pass as much of his big planks as he can, through EO's or Congress, to do good in the 2026 midterms. His more low propensity supporters backed him because they see the nation as broken and no one doing anything, and as such want action. As long as a second Great Depression doesn't happen beneath him, no matter what he does, there's people in this country who will be satisfied to just see him doing *something*. Luckily, his house majority is so narrow and the Senate has enough possible dissenters that I think it's likely not much gets done and it's a decently generic midterm like 2018 or 2022.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"Guessing he won't be able to show but no refunds will be allowed","title":"At Trumps Inauguration, Reports of a Pay-to-Pray: You can pray with Trump and Melania.

Under the current system, it is marginally possible for a third party to displace and become one of the top two parties, but its not possible for three major parties to coexist.In the last two hundred years, there have been two separate occasions when a third party did actually become large enough to challenge one of the major two: the Republicans just before the civil war, and the Constitution party in the 1960s. The first time, the Republicans completely replaced the existing Whig party within two elections. The second time, the Constitution party was not successful at the same thing, and disappeared after two elections.So thats your time frame. You can be highly disruptive for two elections, but if you havent dismantled one of the existing parties by then, youre done.","title":"CMV: Republicans will hold a permanent Senate majority for the foreseeable future"},{"text":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/s/HnUZD6kHyghttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/L7x0LoAGsfhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2021/04/03/inside-the-30-million-gaetz-family-fortune/https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/wgYOO7teyS","title":"Ethics Report Finds Matt Gaetz, Trump's First AG Pick, Paid for Sex With a Minor | \\"Keep in mind that Donald Trump believed that Gaetz was the most qualified person in America to be the chief law enforcement official in the United States,\\" said one attorney."},{"text":"And to distract from his money stealing schemes.","title":"Russians respond to Donald Trump's Greenland proposal"},{"text":"Grifters gonna grift.?

That can be good and bad of course as we have just seen. I think the odd part here will be how well the democrats do will likely a factor of how successful Trump is in enacting his promises but not in the way that it would seem. The red wave in 2010 was in response to how successful Obama was at enacting many of his campaign promises. In the long run it was beneficial, but people were fucking pissed. In this case, I think if Trump is successful he will send us into a deep deep recession and likely spark some major international incident.That will piss people off and can result in unpredictable results in red states. However, if he ends up failing a lot of government function will just keep puttering on and there wont be the same level of blowback.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"Something to do with the drones that are pretending to look for something. they will look back and claim 'we tried to stop it but' It's not aliens.","title":"Wake up"},{"text":"And he was Obama's mistake.

No details about where the event will occur or who will be involved were specified in the prospectus.The morning of Trumps first inauguration in 2017, the president-elect sat for a prayer service at St. Johns Episcopal Church, a historic location across Lafayette Square from the White House. The church, often referred to as the Church of the Presidents, later became known as the site where Trump posed with a Bible during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations on June 1, 2020.Among the racial justice demonstrators forcibly removed from Lafayette Square and the surrounding area just before Trumps Bible photo op were a seminarian and an Episcopal priest who, at the behest of the local Episcopal diocese, were handing out water to protesters from St. Johns patio. At the time, the incident prompted outrage from the Rt. Rev. Marianne Budde, who oversees the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, telling Religion News Service she was horrified by the events of the day.A representative for St. Johns declined to confirm whether they plan to host another inaugural service for Trump. Texas Pastor Robert Jeffress, a longtime Trump supporter who preached the sermon titled When God Chooses a Leader during Trumps 2017 inaugural service, told RNS last month he had not yet been asked to do the same this go-round, though he noted he is very enthusiastic about his election.Trump may well hear from Budde again this year, this time in a worship service at the Washington National Cathedral, which traditionally holds an inaugural prayer service, usually in close partnership with whichever presidential candidate won the election. In 2017, Trump sat for a 70-minute service at the cathedral that featured Budde, as well as a Catholic archbishop of Washington and a local imam, among other religious leaders.The decision to host the event in 2017 drew criticism from Episcopalians, including the Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedrals former dean, who said Trump violates any possible norm of Christian faith and practice.The Cathedral announced earlier this year it would be holding a Service for the Nation on Jan. 21 and that Budde will be preaching, irrespective of who won.This will not be a service for a new administration, the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the Cathedrals current dean, said in a statement released in October. Rather, whichever party wins, this will be a service for all Americans, for the well-being of our nation, for our democracy and the importance of the core values that must undergird our democracy.The Trump transition team did not respond to repeated requests regarding the president-elects plans for the service or whether he plans to attend.Meanwhile, other groups are preparing their own worship services. Last week Sean Feucht, an evangelical Christian musician and conservative activist who has advocated for Christian nationalism, revealed in a promotional video plans to host a Revive in 25 worship service, in which Feucht said worship is going to pave the way for Trumps inauguration.But soon after announcing the services location at St. Josephs, a historic Catholic Church on Capitol Hill, the churchs priest, the Rev. William H. Gurnee, wrote to RNS in an email that he had not granted permission for the use of the church. While I was asked to host the event, I informed the organizer that I needed more information and it was mistakenly reported that final permission was granted, Gurnee wrote.Gurnee added, It is my feeling that this event would be better hosted at another location.Feucht seemed to acknowledge the mixup in an X post on Thursday, lamenting warfare he insisted was coming against him and his team to host the event. In a separate post published Friday, Feucht said the service was still happening but noted in an attached video that the location was TBD.","title":"At Trumps Inauguration, Reports of a Pay-to-Pray: You can pray with Trump and Melania.

Its true that races in places like Montana have gone national, with the primary issues for these intermountain west being the southern border and culture war nonsense, but thermostatic opinion is the second most powerful force in American politics. With those issues addressed, mucked up, or replaced with new issues then the equations governing all this could change. \\nI will close by saying that political parties would prefer to win actually.

Im of the opinion that in a 2-party state it *doesnt* matter if you vote when you dont wholeheartedly agree with your candidate, *because* at some point the other party will win (If that wasnt the case, itd be a 1-party state). The only way to express my disappointment with my own party is to simply not show up. I understand your opinion, I also understand the other point of view. The problem of course is that instead of working to get the people in the second group back on board, they are being blamed for the loss. This is a dynamic unique to a 2-party state. In multiparty systems people would move from (for example) the liberal party to the socialist party to express their displeasure with economic policies, but being satisfied with social changes. Or move from that same liberal party to the christian democrats if they thought social reforms went too far. There would be options with a direct impact on government styles. We in the USA have none of that. We get to choose scorched earth or bad. I dont blame people for choosing the first option, though it certainly wasnt my choice.

It's a Federal RepublicRepublic is just another term for representative democracy, and federalism just means multiple layers of government. None of that in any way excuses the continued use of the electoral college. Maybe it made some sort of sense to the founding fathers but it doesn't anymore. Half the countries on the earth are some sort of republic, and yet none of them outside of the US have such a ridiculous system of elections as the US. It means the bigger states can't trample the smaller states.Federalism in the US doesn't depend on the EC, that's all baked into the constitution otherwise. Also the EC encourages most of the states not to matter except for a handful of swing states, and bigger states are more important to keep on your side because bigger states have larger EC total. It means we're not 51 wolves and 49 sheep voting on what's for dinner.Yeah again that has nothing to do with the EC and everything to do with the rights guaranteed in the constitution (which SCOTUS is slowly eroding but that's a different debate). There's nothing preventing a few states from deciding the agenda of the nation under the EC.

Those things dont happen in a system controlled by billionaires.The real issue is disengagement. When people stop participating, wealthy interests gain more influence. Calling it an oligarchy dismisses the power we still have to demand change.","title":"CMV: The United States is an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy"},{"text":"Wow on Christmas Eve no less.

I think its very strange to say that medical professionals are culpable for private insurance companies denying claims considering the fact that these are *necessary* careers, we cant just have no doctors because no one wants to be culpable for private insurance companies being predatory. And on the patients side too, thats a very strange take. Most people cannot afford to pay for medical treatments out of pocket. Youre saying that people are culpable for the exact same thing that theyre victims of because we live in a society thats structured this way at no fault of our own.And I dont think its a leap, its the same as calling someone culpable of child slavery because they have to use a company computer at work and that company has been accused of using materials that were produced from child labor.

It's only a fallacy when point A leads to B which then leads to C, and as such A will *inevitably* lead to C, therefore A is either good or bad, depending on the specific argument. Using the phrase slippery slope in and of itself s not a fallacy, nor is consideration or concern about an potential possibility.Want to talk about what actually happened? Okay.Some kid who is an heir of a *very* wealthy and prominent family in the DC area who made their fortune in real estate and healthcare, whose grandfather built up his estate through connections with a Baltimore mayor who just so happened to be Nancy Pelosi's father, shot in the back and killed the CEO of a company who was under investigation for insider trading, who was the son of a farmer, went to a state school and worked his way up through the company over about 20 years to the position of CEO. That's your A.Immediately afterwards, we now have people not only framing this privileged trust fund kid as some hero of the downtrodden without actually having any proof other than the killers alleged words. And what are they celebrating? Him literally shooting someone in the back on the sidewalk in the largest American city. There were people actually insisting that even sharing his photo was faux pas because they didn't want him to get caught. We have people talking about how evil healthcare is and how the CEO deserved it and all manner of talk in that vein. That's your B.And now we have not only healthcare executives, but those in other industries as well being assaulted and harassed, including a potential copycat stabbing, again with thousands or millions vicariously cheering on these acts from the safety of social media.A slippery slope? Yes. A **fallacy**? Not in the least. And it logically follows that if celebration of this escalating violence towards executives continues, it will lead to more attacks on executives, maybe board members, maybe major shareholders, there's a lot of leeway between *CEO* and *guy who works in the mailroom*. It's not at all unreasonable to reason that people will seek the next best target down the hierarchy.The actual fallacious slippery slope is thinking that killing a random CEO (again, your A) will lead to some great change in healthcare (your C), which does not stand up in the least to any critical thought.","title":"CMV: Luigi Mangione should not be celebrated"},{"text":"I think McCarthyism is one of the primary reasons leftism was stamped out in the US.","title":"\\"They let him walk\\": Merrick Garland's DOJ under fire after damning Matt Gaetz report released"},{"text":"Ever notice how the only time Republicans rise to the occasion is if the alternative will hurt their party, not merely the country?!

And I thing this especially necessitates further scrutiny depending on the possible reasons laid out further below. First of all - there is not and has never been any mystery or potential misinterpretation of Trump regarding his stance on Israel and the Middle\\nEast. Looking back thru media leading up to election - every article or media snippet demonstrating Trumps opinion or those he works with/surrounds himself with on the Middle East easily leads to a conclusion that he would be far worse for Muslims than any other choice. Going further back to look at his actions during presidency - the move of US embassy to Jerusalem (a city holding its own contentious issues with regard to religious views) says nothing if it doesnt say that Trump was in full support of Israeli apartheid state and right wing government. Trump consistently promotes hard line right wing figures. Trump, the one who attempted to enforce and promoted a Muslim ban in first term. There is absolutely no way anyone could look at past behavior and information presented publicly and conclude yah, this is our guy and our chance for bettering the lives of Muslims My problem is this:\\n1) because of the above, this entire fiasco is absolutely false and fictional (non zero but unlikely)\\n2) the public / private conversations on topic are entirely in opposition re their message (very unlikely)\\n3) individuals have manipulated the Muslim community for their own benefit (not sure how but money + politics manages to create plenty of enrichment opportunity (most probable explanation as far as I can understand)Certainly lean to point 3 but this furthers my desire for further scrutiny. Neither the Middle East nor the Muslim faith are a monolith - so it is likely bad actors may take advantage of others for personal gain. But it also makes me wonder what other explanations are there? Conclusions I would say are absurd are those I see where the individuals affected are considered sub human or sub intelligent. I staunchly disagree with either of those takes as an explanation. Where can we look to understand what the fuck happened here? Weve heard lot of stories about folks voting against their own self interest but this scenario is slightly different in that the guy who effectively has shown zero concern for Palestine or the Muslim faith was somehow held up as the best hope for the cause?

I went through her policies and even the ones I disagreed with were not particularly deal breakers. Even considering the things I disagreed with Kamala on She is still way way better than Trump by several miles. Trump literally tried to over throw the US government. **THAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE MADE ANY REASONABLE PERSON VOTE FOR KAMALA**. So you naming policies you dislike isn't going to change my mind on whether it was **unreasonable or not to vote**. The question I posed to you was to **determine the extent of your knowledge of her proposed agenda**. Many people who didn't vote probably couldn't name any of her policy proposals and if they did there is a possibility they mischaracterized her policies. This would allow us to talk about how they may have misinterpreted them. The problem is that the DNC big tent that is often applauded in this sub causes a constant flood in pandering to different groups instead of sound policy that actually propels every American forward regardless of their opinion.A constant flood in pandering to different groups and sound policy are not mutually exclusive you can have both. Regardless though, even if Kamala didn't move us forward at all and was complete status quo it is still far better than trump regressing the country 100 years. People like yourself forget that even if Kamala were to pander and not make any long lasting policy she would still at least be able to appoint 200 lifetime progressive judges over the course of her term. Trump will now do that and regress the country further. He will have appointed 400 lifetime judges or more, total by the end of his next term probably all maga extremists who do not understand the law or are heavily biased. All working to make the maga ideology harder to purge from the system. That will put us back 25-50 years at best 50-100 years at worst (imagine all young judges making terrible decisions for the duration of their life tenure (50-70 years) that have long lasting consequences that is not easily undone.

The long term impact is that you create industries that are not competitive globally because they benefit from their privileged market position domestically, and so you keep falling behind technology wise.This is already starting to happen. E.g. The auto manufacturers don't have a response to the Chinese evs flooding markets right now (other than Tesla). Normally, this would be a critical threat to the auto manufacturers and they would be in a \\"innovate or die\\" situation, but the Biden administration deuced to protect them by imposing tarrifs of 60% (?) on the Chinese evs. So the urgency is not there anymore. You've removed the competitive forces that make free markets work. The long term consequences of this: the US auto industry can no longer compete without tariffs, therefore you can never remove them. US auto manufacturers are locked out of the global market altogether as they don't have a globally competitive product, so your TAM drops significantly. The lack of innovation means you also start to forgo other tech advances that would have come out of the competitive forces e.g. through the mass manufacturing of batteries for EVs, Chinese firms unlock extremely cheap battery tech which allows them to sell batteries to households as a standalone energy storage product separately.","title":"Trump's tariffs will shrink the economy and reduce investment, CBO says"},{"text":"Dudes never read a book without pictures in his life.","title":"Bill aims to let Donald Trump bypass local rules to build presidential library in Florida"},{"text":"Just wait till 2029!  2017 - 2021 will seem tame!!\\nHere is a [list](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-complete-listing-atrocities-1-1-056) list from the past.","title":"Republicans knew about Matt Gaetz allegations - so why did Trump still pick him?"},{"text":"John Stewart has done more for them than Trump","title":"FAFO Trump doesnt care about any of you!!!!"},{"text":"Luigi Mangione didn't kill any United Healthcare workersThe CEO is an employee, so yes, he did.

The consequences of agriculture tended to cause an obsession with inheritance rights, and if the law is that you inherit property from parents, then you *have* to know who the parents are. There's no two ways around it. And knowing who's the father is a bit trickier than knowing who's the mother, and so all these gender roles were placed to ensure women were monogamous and chaste until marriage. Hunter-gatherer societies own everything communally anyways, so the emphasis on inheritance rights isn't as strong. It exists in some tribes, sometimes paternal or maternal or both, but property is still owned communally for the most part and so you don't really develop a patriarchy nor a matriarchy, you get societies that are maybe matrilineal or matrilocal (in some cases both matrilineal and patrilineal) but where men and women don't have different rights or expectations, at least not to the same degree as a patriarchy. Simply put, agriculture-based societies will tend to favor patrilineal inheritance if not outright patriarchy. It's not about what's more logical, it's about the forces of material conditions at work. It isn't some magical coincidence that agricultural societies are overwhelmingly patriarchal and hunter-gatherer societies almost never are.Keep in mind that Jews are a patriarchal culture where descent is determined matrilineally, so what I'm talking about isn't even absolute. In Hispanic culture, kids take the surname of both parents, the mother is usually the head of the household, but we still describe Hispanic culture as patriarchal (and it mostly is). In Iceland, kids can take the surname of either parent and their society was both matrilineal and patrilineal to a degree, but it was still obviously a patriarchal society for most of its history. Patriarchy is ultimately about where power lies systemically and the gender roles that come from that.","title":"Donald Trump tells rightwing group that hell end womens boxing very quickly"},{"text":"Are they stupid?","title":"Trump's pro-Israel Cabinet Picks Upset Muslims Who Voted for Him"},{"text":"Trump is the Emperor now...","title":"Trumps FCC chair sends ominous letter to Disney CEO"},{"text":"Trumplers are so stupid, lol.

Reminder: Hamas took hostages, and that plus the mass rocket attacks kicked off the conflict. Among those hostages were several US citizens. The US has an incentive to bring those people home. As of a few weeks ago, there were still US citizens held by Hamas. The goal of the US government has been to free those hostages and bring the US citizens home. A cessation in hostilities has been predicated on Hamas freeing those hostages. Biden has been supporting Israel partly to force Hamas to the negotiation table. Israel has added other conditions that have bogged down the peace process.Part of the problem is that the US response is actually split. What Biden has wanted vs what Congress has wanted. Congress passes aid packages and Biden is required to deliver them. Technically, Biden could not, but I haven't seen him do anything like that in his Presidency.","title":"How Trump and the GOP Plan to Dismantle the U.S. pro-Palestinian Movement"},{"text":"I wish I knew why he wants it in the first place.
