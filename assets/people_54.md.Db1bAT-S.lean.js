Uncle Joe should have dropped out before the primary and given the voters a chance to pick their candidate, I sincerely doubt it would have been Harris. 2. The blue wall is an uneasy coalition and ALOT of it is based on typically white blue collar workers...Joe Biden was able to tap into that zeitgeist being older, catholic and white.  And frankly, he delivered for that group, but Harris had to distance herself from his policies (due to dissatisfaction, deserved or not) which puts her in a difficult position.  In any case, trump taps into that extremely easily....and Harris couldn't  bring together the coalition easily.  3.  I really don't know what to make of the Latinx voting patterns.   By all rights, Donald trump messaging is hostile, but is there a strong undercurrent of social conservatism that is more powerful?   Looking specifically at Latinx votes in the blue wall are staggeringly different....or maybe it all comes down to inflation?

A rapid and unanticipated rise in rhetoric and threats stemming from disinformation about the purpose of the event and its proximity to Election Day contributed to the decision to postpone.Out of an abundance of caution and because a number of government agencies are unable to participate, we made this difficult decision so that we can deliver a high-quality and meaningful event, with deep and rich engagement across industry, government and academia, and full participation by all stakeholders. We apologize for the inconvenience and are exploring options to reschedule the event. We will reach out directly to all participants with details, including information about transferring existing exhibits, registrations and sponsorships. Updates also will be shared on the AFCEA-Atlanta chapters event website, on FBCs website, via email and on social media.","title":"Tonights results make me wonder if in fact the 2020 election was stolen"},{"text":"Thats because he didnt even know he was saying it.","title":"How attacks on Republican voters became the third rail of partisan politics"},{"text":"So its over. and the margin in NC was slimmer than PENN &amp; GA.","title":"Donald Trump wins North Carolina, picks up coveted Southern swing state"},{"text":"that's always the biggest takeaway.","title":"Donald Trump wins North Carolina, picks up coveted Southern swing state"},{"text":"Do you trust the election process?","title":"Decision Desk - Trump WINS in GA"},{"text":"This aged like milk","title":"\\"Bottom has started to fall out\\": Trump campaign aides fret as Election Day \\"confidence has shifted\\""},{"text":"Yeah we're looking at a Russia situation - decades of basically fake elections going forward, until... someone gets bored I guess?

Not the political junkies, not an informed public, but a smaller section of Americans, often in battleground states, and sometimes relatively dispassionate or less assured, who aren't paying much attention, who aren't concerned about the details, whose political worldview is informed by superficial narratives, black and white thinking, empty talking points, and as the election draws closer, whatever partisan propaganda, typically fearmongering in nature, reaches their social media feeds.People who don't understand why \\"Democrats caused inflation,\\" is utterly lacking in nuance and depth. People who don't think to question whether Kamala Harris really is a communist, people who might not question whether immigrants are flooding our country to murder our citizens, steal our jobs, raid our homes and neighborhoods, bringing massive amounts of drugs over the border and maybe even eating our pets, people who are taken in by demagogues who masquerade as strongmen, when in reality, they're anything but strong, weak in fact, insecure and fragile.People who don't take unconstitutional threats seriously, who see someone like Trump as benign, and rendered benign by his own absurdity and idiocy, which is, in the eyes of these low propensity voters, obviously an image crafted by the media!And in some cases, I'm talking about people who see a candidate's gender as a reason not to vote for them.There's also voters who memory hole the past and who fail to understand what *really* causes national issues or foreign wars. They understand that if a democrat is president, every problem in their lives must be the fault of Democrats. Every war must have been started by democrats. When in reality, there are a multitude of factors that contribute to things like inflation and decades old foreign conflicts, many of which have roots that extend back years, and unfortunately, past the last four years that these voters are only capable of remembering.Since inflation and the economy is such a big issue for voters this election, for many, it's come down to, \\"economy better under Trump, bad under Biden, Trump must be better for the economy.\\" But anyone with an understanding of Trump's last presidency, the economy he inherited, the mess he left when he mishandled COVID, his trillion dollar tax cuts, his pressure to the Fed to keep interest rates low, his trade war with China, the Natl debt ballooning by nearly 40% under his admin, among other things, anyone who understands how these things exacerbated issues for the next admin, knows that such a sentiment is woefully uninformed, lacking in context, and reinforced by a barrage of propaganda and misinformation on social media.Walter Lippman called the general public an \\"irrational force\\" nearly a century ago. I may not agree with him on how he proposed to fix this problem, but it sure as hell rings true today. That being said, what kind of democracy are we living in when a low informed, minority of the electorate has such a substantially heavier sway on the outcomes of our elections.","title":"US Election: Donald Trump is projected to win Georgia"},{"text":"Gender matters.","title":"Trump wins North Carolina, holding a key state for Republicans"},{"text":"They can't even say his name over there","title":"NYT needle now leans TRUMP"},{"text":"Or polls for that matter, apparently.","title":"Donald Trump wins North Carolina, picks up coveted Southern swing state"},{"text":"We will help load the trains ??","title":"All hail God Emperor Trump and his Most Excellent Apprentice Lord Musk of the Martian Realm!

Economic policies aimed at reducing wealth inequality and reigning in corporate power would have faced fierce opposition from Republicans and establishment Democrats, likely resulting in legislative gridlock or intense political battles. Internationally, Sanders' non-interventionist approach and focus on human rights could have reshaped U.S. foreign policy, impacting relationships with allies and adversaries alike.

Let's be fair it's not that simple. Plenty of states are still unfairly mapped. Not horrendous gerrymandering but still unfair at the least, more likely just bad.Second, The Electoral College favors Republicans. Its not even that it's outdated, it's just a sham to begin with.Third, Voter suppression by republicans is actually horrendous.Fourth, First Past the Post voting has created, perpetuated and maintains a two party system. Technically it's not, in practice its a two party system with potential spoiler parties. In this and the electoral college, dems share some of the blame. It makes sense to support a systsm that ensures your party always holds minority or majority power. Looking at the state of politicking in our countery, I'd say maintaining that kind of power isn't worth the price. Which is in part...Fifth, FPTP and a two party system predictably leads to a highly polarized electorate filled with fear and mistrust. Now that the gloves are off, Republicans are able to play at identity politics because they can't win on issues alone. FPTP is a system of voting that predates the US by centuries. It has to go. The worst part of a highly polarized electorate where identity poltics has become normalized is that it predictably leads to... Sixth, a portion of the electorate embraces right wing extremism. We're seeing more and more of this with attacks on women, people of color and other vulnerable groups being scapegoats for whatever is convenient to blame on them. The only thing we are missing is the violence, which is also a very predictable outcome of a large minority that embraces right wing extremism. We are already seeing the threat of violence more and more. I mean politically motivated threats of violence. It will not take much for us to be push to that, the next milestone on the way to authoritarianism and evangelical extremism. Its coming. The news today is basically reality TV of a nation in decline. Its happening right before our eyes. I know folks are not going to want to hear this. It's so much easier to believe that voting is going to solve our problems, despite history teaching us otherwise. With that said, we must get back to our tradition of grassroots organization and pressuring the state from without. Our communities need to be organized. Widespread social change of a significant size that changes the lives of all of us for the better, it is almost always won when we are organized and force concessions from the State. Im not saying people shouldn't vote. I'm saying that our voting system is broken by design. Its not beneficial for our modern society. It must be changed. A Trump victory will delay violence within society but massively increase State repression if they successfully implement even a fraction of what they have planned. A Harris win delays that outcome but it doesn't settle the matter and it will increase violence within society. Obviously, the latter is the better outcome but we'd be foolish to expect our representatives to be able to quell the right wing extremism that is a festering wound within the society.Edit: sorry, got way off track there.","title":"In latest projection NYT says Trump has a 68% chance of victory"},{"text":"it's really over isn't it.the felon stands at 230 no way harris can overcome that odd.so depressing","title":"Donald Trump wins North Carolina"},{"text":"Estimates are around 45% women voting for Trump.

You risk going the other way. Its not just one cycle.Those who sat out in 2016 because they were displeased with a centrist democrat candidate like Hillary, and preferred Bernie, will live with a majority Republican Supreme Court instead, potentially for the rest of their lives.That was what you did with your voting power.
