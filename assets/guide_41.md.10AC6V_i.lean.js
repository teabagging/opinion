Marx invented \\"capitalism\\" as term/concept. His criticisms of capitalism and call to arms against it account for 100% of Marx' potency. Even in The Manifesto, there isn't much about what communism is or how it should work. Enmity to capitalism is what Marxism is/was. Ayn Rand , Hayek and other Lenin critics went down the same path. Dagny Taggart, Howard Roark... they are heroic &amp; strong characters with ethos. But... they are characterized by what they are not. They are not the world around them. They are looters. They are not Grimma Wormtongue. BTW... I believe it *was* this group who were first known as r/neoliberals. Libertarians as we know (and love?) is a later denomination... as an economic right concept. Meanwhile... the feistiest socialists *love* fascism. They'll seek it out. Sometimes even invent or imagine it.  Why? One reason is dichotomy. Radical socialism (and fascism) grow best within a socialist-fascist dichotomy. Fascism was born reactionary, an anticommunism. Antifascism born directly following it. Both thrived within the dichotomy... actively (and ironically) defending it.The second reason is the democracy paradigm. \\"*After Hitler, Us*!\\" is a famous communist slogan of Interwar Germany... as Hitler rises. The idea is that Nazism represented the right \\"paradigm.\\" An ideological, revolutionary party wins an election and therefore has a mandate to break institution, remodel and reconstitute society. Exactly what *they* (KPD) wanted to do. So yeah... Lets just remember that Objectivism is a philosophy that claims to have fully solved epistemic truth, morality, history, social science, economics and everything else. It's even *more* expansive and absolute in its perspective than marxist communism. Meanwhile, 100% of its potency comes from contrasting itself with its favorite enemies. We see this playing out in the temporally short lived \\"ideologies\\" of 2024 meme politics too. Woke/Antiwoke. To me, what makes r/neoliberal (the 1990s variety) valuable is rejection of this game.

You're only focusing on the gender aspect of it.Here's the thing, women have been winning in smaller elections and have not won the highest office in the land. They can speak to smaller groups of constituents, sure, but they do not have broad appeal, especially democratic women. Democratic women in the House are winning in already heavily democratic districts. Democratic women who are winning in non-democratic districts are *not* running progressive campaigns. Look at Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington State's 3rd district (I think she is a better example than Jayapal). She ran against Joe Kent, a MAGA Republican, and won for a second time in a red district. She ran an extremely moderate campaign and her track record in congress shows it: she voted against the student debt relief bill, opposes any kind of firearms ban, supports Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, and has voted against Democrats and with Republicans quite a number of times. This to me sounds more conservative than anything Harris has campaigned on or has done in her time in DC.When you speak about the genocide happening in Palestine and Harris, what makes it interesting is how she has called for a ceasefire as opposed to her opponent. Could she have done more? Definitely. I think she should have campaigned with Ruwa Romman to show solidarity with Palestine and Palestinian Americans and to show she was committed to ending the war and the genocide. She definitely should have distanced herself from Biden in that regard. But I don't think she was *enthusiastically* supporting genocide. I think she was stuck in the administration she was in. (But also, let's not make it seem like Biden is totally heartless. He did reinstate sending humanitarian and economic aid to Palestine in 2021 when he entered office after Trump cut it off). Though her using words like \\"lethal military\\" doesn't help progressives.But again, her campaign strategists believed she needed to appeal to white working class rural Americans in PA, WI, and MI, not the progressives in LA or NYC. Sure there are progressives in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, Detroit, and Atlanta she could and should have tapped into, but I think we're also misjudging how left of the spectrum Americans truly are. College students were protesting against genocide, but at the same time there were many Americans who were either supporting Israel or just indifferent to what is happening. Mind you, Pew Research released a study in March and found that 58% of Americans thought \\"Israel had valid reasons for fighting Hamas.\\" (Edit: Which is freaking wild to me)It all boils down to how we think about it. I'm sure you're a progressive (as am I) and we do not judge people based off their gender or race, but on their policies and the rhetoric they speak. So you could say, \\"Hey, I don't like her policies and that's why I find it hard to vote for her because she's really leaning into conservatism and I want her to lean into her 2020 campaign more.\\" However, most Americans have shown that in the back of their minds that they still judge based off gender and race. I know it's a bit anecdotal, but there were many times I have heard people say, \\"I don't know if she can be president...she doesn't seem to have enough experience\\" or \\"I mean, she was pretty emotional in that Fox Interview\\" or \\"Why was she getting so angry in her speech?\\" or \\"Why does she laugh so much?\\" These are all subtle judgments people have made in relation to her race/gender and that did have (however large or small) an impact on their decision to vote against her.","title":"CMV: Misogyny did play a role in loss of both Clinton and Harris."},{"text":"T-rexes use speech recognition to write 'cause of their little arms.

Trans rights specifically and LGBTQ rights broadly, freedom of choice, guns, healthcare, government spending, etc. Nobody wants predatory men entering women's safe spaces, but trans women are no more predatory than cys men. Just because two penises or two vaginas are involved doesn't make a relationship less valuable, filled with love and joy, and healthy than if there were one of each body part. Nobody wants tons of abortions to happen, but they can be necessary. How we limit them isn't by vilifying women or sex. People have sex and women are people. As the only way to perpetuate the species there's a strong drive to do it. And no, sexual reproduction doesn't require intercourse, rather just the combination of two cells. Shoot, the yeast that makes our bread can reproduce through sex. And everything that can reproduce through sex tries to all the time. Birth control and proper sex ed are both integral to limiting abortions. Trust the science, right?Guns and mental health problems do, together, kill people. A person who shoots another person over a black friday sale or because they turn around in the \\"wrong\\" driveway is certainly not mentally well. A person who kills 60 and wounds hundreds of others at a concert from a hotel room is not mentally well. There should absolutely be laws in place to try and keep these people from getting guns. If you aren't shooting people on the regular nobody is taking your guns. Nobody wants insane public spending. But if we need a bridge, or an appendectomy that should be attainable. Should a hammer cost $400? No. Should the wealthiest people gain the bulk of the benefits of all spending because they are best positioned to guide that spending? Also no.

He did sign the checks to provide weapons, but European countries were going to rally behind Ukraine anyway, and of course all the actual fighting was done by the Ukrainians.?If anything his policy has been muddled and weak, dithering and delaying about providing long range missiles, then giving in, and having no real plan to achieve victory or end the war.??Unified and eventually facilitated the expansion of NATOThis has almost nothing to do with Biden at all. Its amazing how much he talks about NATO as if he owns it, while in reality Sweden and Finland joining was down to Sweden and Finland not Biden.??This is before we even start on the progress made in the pacific, namely Taiwan, the Philippines and The Quad, towards curbing Chinese ambitions of expansion and influenceThis is also mostly empty rhetoric. Bongbong Marcos becoming president of the Philippines (and thus changing from Dutertes policy) was not down to Biden, and he has done very little to actually improve protections for Taiwan, or Hong Kong, or really achieve any positive change in the region at all.?Merely talking about Standing strong against China! is the kind of meaningless posing American presidents do when they want to look tough to uninformed domestic voters.??Now were seeing Assad be overthrown while hes still in office.Also nothing to do with Biden. Indeed, Bidens administration put sanctions on HTS, the group that overthrew Assad, and a huge bounty on its leader, and were taken thoroughly by surprise when Assad fell.??Israel is just one foreign policy area, and frankly not remotely the most important to American interestsThis is like saying the Iraq war was just one policy area for George W Bush.?Biden sent billions of US taxpayer dollars in money and weapons (which could have been used for, e.g. Ukraine or indeed to save lives in Gaza) to Israel, and **directly** made repeated decisions to enable the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people, the displacement of millions, and the mass destruction of Gaza, south Lebanon and now Syria.?Unlike NATO enlargement, the fall of Assad or the Philippines election he made a huge difference here for the worse, dramatically increasing the death toll and carnage by giving unconditional support to Netenyahu, preventing an end to the war by blocking international pressure on Israel, destroying the reputation of the US and all the credibility it gained by supporting the rules based international order over Ukraine, and leading to the deaths of US citizens.??supporting Israel was the pragmatic thing to do, even if domestically unpopular, see conditions for above events in Syria, and our shared interest in Hezbollah and Iran being neutralizedAgain, this is the problem with blinkered thinking. Instead of just stating shared interests, try to think about what those interests actually are. First, I would strongly argue that supporting war crimes and genocide is **NOT** in the interests of the US, or US values.?\\nSecond, the main shared interest people cite as to why the US should pay for a horrific war (and war crimes) against Hezbollah and Iran by Israel is  to help and protect Israel.?In other words people like Biden seriously claim that the US should subordinate its foreign policy to support Israel in order to  just support Israel. Its pure circular reasoning.?**TL;DR - the things Biden wants to claim credit for (Ukraine defying Putin, NATO enlargment, Assads fall, Taiwan not being invaded) had very little to do with him.?Conversely the places he did make a big personal impact (the withdrawal from Afghanistan, helping to perpetrate horrific war crimes and possible genocide in Gaza, enabling Israels military expansionism were almost unmitigated disasters and a horrific moral stain on his legacy.**","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"Bad troll.

They can also set policy for businesses. As such, Doug Ford would be able to set policy for the province of Ontario that would make exporting energy nonviable.The other provinces would not have to go along with this though. Also, there are some avenues that the federal government could take to override Doug Ford's policies. However, the constitutionality of those procedures might be questionable, and subject to review by the Supreme Court if Doug Ford challenges them. In most cases, I think our Supreme Court would probably side with the province over the federal government, unless the policies are a national security risk or causing some sort of emergency.","title":"Ontario premier: US energy exports will be cut off if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on Canada"},{"text":"Mend relationship?

You can't really kick out shortwave, given it propagates all around the world, though you can certainly jam it.  It's been jammed by Chinese Firedrake jammers on and off over time. Very simple method they use: broadcast on the same frequency using much higher power. Your radio will tune into whatever signal is strongest, or you'll get a muddy mixture two stations at the same time. Typically this isn't an issue because countries (and the ITU) regulate the airwaves in such a manner as to not interfere with other countries' fair use of the airwaves, but if you are a rogue state trying to block what you view as your adversaries' pro-democracy radio propaganda, such conventions won't bother you too much.I was once trying to pick up VOA on a US frequency, here in NS, which should have been an easy task, given the VOA transmitter site's proximity to me (straight across the ocean from North Carolina) but could not, as VOA's signal was overwhelmed by the strength of the Chinese patriotic music broadcast.

The problem with supporting Ukraine is that historically Ukraine switched sides, and there is a risk that when Ukraine sees that there is no longer any benefit for them to be on the side of the West they will switch over to Russia and continue with Russia further west.Trump's goal is not to deal with Russia through sanctions, but to end this war through getting Zelensky to capitulate. Zelensky is no longer a democratically elected president because he cancelled elections. It is funny that we are still calling it a fight for democracy, lol. By supporting Zelensky we are supporting an unelected war criminal who is sending his men to the slaughter against a nuclear military superpower. Ukraine can't win this war, it can only prolong it by feeding Russia some meat to grind. Now Zelensky along with the Biden regime want to lower the draft age to 18 because the war demands more lambs to the slaughter.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

This was a domestic terrorist attack, and it started because of Trump, and there are **zero consequences for Trump at all.** Trump was the cause of a domestic terrorist attack **and apparently that's fine.** It means nothing.

We formed NATO by act of Congress, and only an act of Congress can leave NATO, a President cannot undo an act of Congress; they are powerless to do so.So the threats are empty, there is no chance of this happening, dead solid zero.So what is the value of the threat?I will just speak to the risk vs reward involved, and if you dont mind let me use a local example.Lets say you and me live where I do in rural Texas, and we agree to look out for each other if we are attacked. (In some world where an attack is possible or likely, obviously we wouldnt agree to come to arms as things stand)So Im a rural Texan, licensed to carry a gun as long as it has been legal here, and I have more guns than my Carey pistol. I have extras for my family and yours it you needed them. If you needed me, I would be prepared to come and fight.So what if you signed this agreement, giving me the risk of coming to your aid, but you then decided you didnt believe in guns, and couldnt come help me?What would I get out of that agreement? In the most literal sense, how would I gain any value relative to the risk? At that point am I just paying for your defense and my own?So NATO. The USA has the logistics and power projection to send horse anywhere in the world. Anywhere.Any NATO country that is attacked an expect the USA to be able to respond with military force greater than that countries own military power.What NATO country can project power to the USA to defend us here? None of them. And that is ok, the USA will be ok, but is it too much to expect European nations to be able to defend themselves? At one point under Trump 1.0 Germany complained about their national security when Trump was pulling 12,000 US troops out of Germany.World power Germany, UN Security Council member Germany, a nation 800 miles from the closest enemythat is the state European defense was at.Im not asking that Europe be able to project power to help us here at home in the USA, but the reality is that Trump threats have changed how Europe looks at their own defense, and that isnt a bad thing.

The US is not in a position of destabilizing Russia as a whole. It's also unrealistic to think that there won't be any concessions met they're wanting to broker peace deals there are going to be some parts that were annexed that Russia is going to get to keep. That fact is very evident with how they're going to approach this. Trump not going harder with actions against Russia is Is the right move. The whole reason that Russia decided to invade Ukraine to begin with is because they wanted to be the sole energy provider for the European nation. They're large oil and gas provisions are the reason why the US is constantly going after Syria and surrounding area so they can establish a pipeline.Continuing sanctions also means that the chances of gas and crude oil going back to affordable prices for the rest of the world is zero. We're not just talking about Ukraine as a whole we're talking about how Russia it's control over European energy as well as not trying to exclude somebody to move towards other countries not aligned with US interests.

It is simple, really. I don't know what country you are from, but in the United States of America when we apply for our driver's licenses, we are asked if we would like to be an organ donor. Obviously, both men and women get to make this decision. That is because we, as corpses, have Bodily Autonomy. Men don't usually realize this, because bodily autonomy isn't something they have to confront in their day to day lives. States and religiouso whackadoos trying to put restrictions on a women's body robs her of bodily autonomy, which even a dead person has the right and dignity to.Your state can't just come in if you die in a car wreck and scoop any viable organs for people waiting on a donor list. We can't even technically sell our organs while we are alive because that would open up like four different cans of worms.Ohio won't let a 10 year old child adopt a baby, for obvious reasons, but Ohio will happily force a 10 year old child rped by an adult to carry that pregnancy to term and delivery. The same state that has no legal authority to go in and steal perfectly good hearts, lungs, kidneys and livers and retinas... They know that bodily autonomy counts for corpses-- they do not want living women to have bodily autonomy.If you look at this entire thread, I'd say 9 out of 10 of the people immediately bashing OP are men, not women, and their bodily autonomy is NEVER threatened by the state. So, men are clearly comfortable and thinking they will never be FORCED into getting biotech (implants), because they have not been desensitized to losing bodily autonomy yet.Our government regulates everything and anything and even things it has no reason to regulate. The people who don't think our future government could force brain chips on us like lobotomies were forced on the public for well over a decade.

Let's say, in the future, you signed up to get an implanted device that would help you neurologically balance a mood disorder. You opt in to certain things to allow for the functionality of the device. In this example, let's say you are living in a time with laws that allow certain decisions to be made for you, without your consent. There is a grey area where the biotech could be used to pacify you if you get out of control. For example, if you demonstrate psychosis and are deemed a threat to society. It would be the equivalent of having someone force hospitalize you without your conset.Of course, this is an extreme example.

Trump Is an Isolationist x2**Proof that Trump is an isolationist lies in how he's spent the past decade talking about NATO. Trump often talks about how NATO is ripping off the US (in fact, Trump's idea that the world is ripping the US off has been the logic behind a lot of his previous foreign policy decisions). Specifically, Trump points to the 2% GDP requirements that most European nations aren't upholding.Trump's attacks on NATO have not been because he wants to feed them to Russia but because these countries are weak and are relying on American tax dollars to defend their borders. And it's worse than you might think.In 2018, the *LA Times* wrote a pretty damning article about Germany's armed forces and their capacity to actually defend Germany. Germany had, in 2018, so few working military helicopters, it had to lease civilian helicopters to train its pilots.While the war in Ukraine has forced most European countries to increase their military spending, they're still extremely reliant on American forces to protect their borders. Trump's demand that they increase their military spending was not unreasonable during his first term. His contemplation about leaving the alliance after it failed to increase said spending to the required minimum levels after 8 years doesn't seem illogical either.Trump's general disdain for other countries he perceives as ripping the US off and isolationist policies date as far back as 1988 when he talked about this exact type of policy in an Oprah interview (though the focus was on Japan).I'm going to leave this argument a bit shorter mostly because my fingers are getting tired but, yeah.ConclusionOverall, if Trump were to broach a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine or pull support from Ukraine in general, those policies come from a place of IR logic that is comprehensible and logical (though most likely a bit immoral) even though it lacks universal adoption.

A Weakened / Destabilized Russia Will Decrease European Stability, Not Increase It**The biggest misconception (and one \\"positive\\" I didn't make in point 2) that people have is that bleeding Russia is good. It's not. A drained Russia becomes more volatile and dangerous.Namely, Russia has a metric crap load of nukes. This ongoing war has drastically increased the likelihood that they get used. This usage isn't just by Russia (though Putin has threatened to use nukes and honestly, it backed into a corner, I'm 100% sure he will) but by whatever comes next.There are two real and likely scenarios for Russia, even if they win this war.First, Russia is cornered and losing, or at least losing enough resources/men to worry about their nation's integrity. A cornered dictator will often use any means necessary to retain control - look at Assad using chemical weapons in Syria. If Putin genuinely fears that his regime is threatened, he will use nukes.Putin has been saying he'll use nukes for awhile now and, while many current US officials say that's BS in the immediate term, he's laying the foundation to justify their use if he finds himself cornered. A world in which nuclear weapons are used by a weakened Russia is not a world anyone wants to live in.Second, Russia collapses. When/if it does, what happens to the thousands of nukes it has? The world was extremely lucky that, when the USSR fell, none of the nuclear weapons fell into the wrong hands and the transition of power was done peacefully between all nations involved. The likelihood that a collapsed Russia would form into either one or multiple stable governments without bloodshed is unlikely.If this were to happen, current Russian military leaders with access to tactical nukes would be engaged in internal warfare and bloodshed. These military leaders would have access to nukes and it's very likely that at least one of them would use said weapons. Again, a world in which nuclear weapons are used by a weakened Russia is not a world anyone wants to live in.**4. Trump Is an Isolationist and a Decrease in Support for Ukraine is an Isolationist Policy**This point is pretty self-explanatory but Trump is an isolationist. He always has been. He wants America to stand on its own and be as uninvolved in global events as possible. Leaving the war in Ukraine, preferably via a peace deal, is consistent with how Trump has handled and talked about foreign policy for almost a decade now. It makes logical sense that he sees this conflict as one that does not benefit the US and increases American involvement in the world as a whole.As noted later, Trump has been a vocal isolationist since at least 1988.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

Suing for a White Peace or a Peace** **~~with Slight Concessions from Ukraine~~** **is Favorable for Everyone**Peace with Russia is preferable to no peace at all - as long as that peace is a white peace (no changes) or a peace that favors Ukraine (I also think a Ukrainian cession of the Donbas region to Russia for payment is actually ideal, but I won't argue that here lol).Peace with Russia will have significant benefits to everyone involved - specifically Europe, the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia. The only heavily involved actors who might not benefit are Iran and North Korea as Russia will no longer need to pay them for their support (in the form of rockets and soldiers), losing them access to a valuable stream of income.As mentioned above, Europe will see a decrease in oil prices and a stabilization of their economy. Furthermore, having a war anywhere close to your country is inherently destabilizing and one of the reasons Europe reacted so violently to a Russian invasion of Ukraine.Countries bordering Ukraine, especially Poland, will also see a decrease in migration from Ukraine. These large numbers of migrants have put a strain on some of these European nations, leading to a rightward political shift and protests. Both of these things lead to an increase in instability and a decrease in liberal values/democracy. While it is not the sole reason Europe is currently undergoing a rightward political shift, the influx of Ukrainian refugees has played a crucial role in some of this shift.For the U.S. peace means a safer Europe which means less military spending (hopefully), less need for high a alert, and a decreased risk for a hot war with Russia. Furthermore, it decreases Europe's reliance on American oil helping to lower the price of goods in the US as well. This all ties in to Trump's isolationist world vision (see point 4) as well.For Ukraine, the obvious benefit is that they are at peace. They can focus on rebuilding and will most certainly get heaps of money from Europe and the US to do so. Prior to the war, Ukraine had some pretty bad infrastructure including roads, bridges, hospitals, etc. It was still a relatively weak democracy and was in the process of developing. A peace with Russia would allow this once poor and forgotten nation to have the funds and support necessary to build back better.Also, it wouldn't be at war which is a huge perk lol. Especially since Ukraine is facing massive manpower shortages and could collapse/fall to Russia in its entirety sooner than later - essentially, unless the US and/or Europe start sending in troops to fight against Russia in Ukraine, Ukraine is edging towards collapse with no real way to win, regardless of how much money, ammunition, or weapons the US/Europe gives them. They'll have no one to fight.For Russia, peace means increased stability (which is good for everyone as described in point 3) and (potentially) access back into global/western-dominated markets.Edit: Slashed section of head is a hold-over from previous iteration of my argument.","title":"CMV: The US under Trump should have every incentive to aid the continued weakening of Putin.

These are the combined Russian sanctions/Ukraine war support and leaving NATO.Note that I'll be arguing the soundness of the logic behind these policy decisions, not directly whether Trump is compromised by Russia. This is because, if you can agree that the policy foundations are sound and reasonable, at least to a perceived audience, then it proves that Trump's policy could likely be coming from a place of reason and not just Russia control.I'll also loosely number the arguments so it's easier for us to debate based on each point.Russian Sanctions/Removal of Ukraine War Support**1. Easing Sanctions for Peace Is a Sound Policy Decision**I think any easing of sanctions on Russia will and should come as a part of a wider peace deal in Ukraine. Trump is not going to give Russia a free easing of sanctions - that policy will have to come as a trade-off for something that Russia does (in this case, reaching a peace deal with Ukraine). Given that the numerous sanctions were levied against Russia to serve as a disincentive/punishment for continuing the war. Sanctions were also put onto Russia in an attempt to limit their wartime economy and weaken their ability to fight.Therefore, easing or lifting the sanctions implemented to attempt to dissuade or punish Russia from continuing its war in Ukraine is a reasonable policy.Additionally, an easing of sanctions for peace would also increase wider European prosperity and stability. Europe as a region is still heavily reliant on oil to fuel its economy. Prior to the invasion, a vast majority of this oil came from Russia. Immediately after the bans, Europe began to run out of fuel, leading to increased costs of living. One of the only reasons this hasn't been a constant problem is because Europe has had some pretty mild winters recently. Easing sanctions on Russia for peace would enable Europe to regain access to Russian oil while they (hopefully) speed up their development of non-oil energy sources.Finally, the sanctions put on Russia have forced them to increase and warm their relations with other autocratic nations including North Korea, Russia, and Iran. This reliance on these foreign powers increasingly ties them together in a coalition against Western interests and has the potential to make Russia a Chinese pawn. This could have major implications for the balance of power in the Pacific and serves as a major threat to US interests in the region.\\\\[continued in comments - there are 3 comments lol.

That deal was signed by a previous generation under different understandings. Back then it was clear Europe was willing to match us. That has changed.Europe is the reason we got into WW1. Their failure to listen to Wilson about going easy on Germany led directly to WW2, which we got involved in. Wet got involved in Vietnam because of French imperialism. We got involved in the middle east because of French and British imperialism. Remember: it was the UK that split off Kuwait from Iraq because they wanted to keep the most oil rich part. That led to Iraq 1 and 2, and 9/11 (Osama was mad we put troops in Saudi in the 1990s so he did 9/11).Given what we know, and how much Europe's selfishness has drawn us into wars costing us trillions of dollars and lives lost, why should we double down?

His statement was a perfect example of bureaucratic deference. Ive decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down, Wray said. He wants to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work. But is something else going on? By stepping down now, as the conservative writer Erick Erickson observed, Wray has created a legal obstacle to Trump trying to bypass the Senate confirmation process. Heres why. According to the Vacancies Reform Act, if a vacancy occurs in a Senate-confirmed position, the president can temporarily replace that appointee (such as the F.B.I. director) only with a person who has already received Senate confirmation or with a person whos served in a senior capacity in the agency (at the GS-15 pay scale) for at least 90 days in the year before the resignation. Kash Patel, Donald Trumps chosen successor at the F.B.I., meets neither of these criteria. Hes not in a Senate-confirmed position, and hes not been a senior federal employee in the Department of Justice in the last year. That means he cant walk into the job on Day 1. Trump will have to select someone else to lead the F.B.I. immediately, or the position will default to the first assistant to the office. In this case, that means the position would default to Paul Abbate, who has been the deputy director of the F.B.I. since 2021, unless Trump chooses someone else, and that someone else cannot be Patel, at least not right away. The bottom line is that the Senate has to do its job. Wray is foreclosing a presidential appointment under the Vacancies Reform Act, and  as I wrote in a column last month  the Supreme Court has most likely foreclosed the use of a recess appointment to bypass the Senate. So a resignation that at first blush looks like a capitulation (why didnt he wait to be fired?) is actually an act of defiance. It narrows Trumps options, and it places the Senate at center stage. In Federalist No. 76, Alexander Hamilton wrote that the advice and consent power was designed to be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the president, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters. Patel is just such an unfit character, and now its senators responsibility to protect the American republic from his malign influence  if, that is, they have the courage to do their jobs.","title":"FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign before Trump takes office"},{"text":"Yes, exactly.

It's a complete nothing burger. Some of those authors, like Rothbard, even argued against Intellectual Property, so who cares, aside from his opponents desperately trying to find something.  \\nUnless you name-drop Friedman every time you use the pen example, or Bastiat when you mention the broken window fallacy?  \\nIt's one thing to attribute other people's merits to oneself by writing fraudulent academic articles, it's another to use classical authors to argue in favour of an opinion without name-dropping them when the format of an opinion article really isn't the place for that.The Plagiarism accusations for his books are more serious, but frankly it's been 4 years, and I haven't seen anything come out of it despite all the talks of suing him. So I guess those accusations weren't well founded enough.And yes, Milei was most likely a bad professor, extremely neurotic and completely lacking in pedagogy (and his aggressive teaching style was just a small part of it). That being said, that doesn't make him a culture warrior, nor do we have any indication that this aggressive teaching style was targeted at any specific demographic.

Most countries have governments who directly negotiate with drug providers to set low prices. Drugs are cheap to manufacture, so the high costs associated with them are due to the necessity to recoup the cost of R&amp;D, the regulatory approval process, and most notably, the risks associated with both.The US market effectively subsidizes both the cheap drugs foreign consumers enjoy, as well as medical R&amp;D from all pharmaceutical firms across the world. How do you think Novo Nordisk recouped the cost of creating Ozempic while providing it at low prices in Denmark? Off of the backs of the US consumer. If the US implemented price controls like every other nation, then the cost of R&amp;D would skyrocket and innovation for new life saving drugs would plummet. A better solution would be socialize the cost of developing drugs internationally by forcing everyone else to pay their fair share.

There is something wrong with the felon's brain. Something beyond the general consensus of neurologists who have commented on his bizarre verbal output. Different from and prior to their opinion of \\"fronto-temporal dementia beh. var.\\". Let me explain. There are various types of lies and lairs, and if you live long enough you'll meet them all. It was only in 2015 when Trump signalled his entry into the 'higher form of crime' that I gave the matter any serious thought even though I'd seen more than enough examples of all types. LIES: Type one - what usually comes to mind when the word is mentioned ? This is the 'ordinary lie'. The speaker is intentionally deceitful in order to serve his or her self interest. There may be various levels of 'self deception' involved. This gradually melds into 'liar type two' - someone who believes their own bullshit. This isn't a rare event because there are immense advantages in convincing yourself of your own falsehood. Advantages in terms of both personal emotions and **also** utility in deceiving one's victims (or listeners in less morally charged situations), It's very common, and, in the case of crooked businessmen like Trump (and his father and grandfather) pretty well universal. It will often be difficult to say how much a chronically deceptive person \\"believes their own bullshit\\" and how much they have failed to develop a conscience - the psychopath. It's my opinion, and it's *only* an opinion, that self deception is more common than bone-deep evil, but perhaps I'm too optimistic. But then it's onward and downward. Liar level three - the bullshitter. If you haven't met this type you just haven't lived long enough. This is a person who is neurologically incapable of distinguishing true from false. I suspect that's because the *importance* of 'truth-testing' is at best a minor concern - or no concern at all - to them. This deficit isn't global; they rarely die by stepping into traffic after all. In my experience most bullshitters are harmless. Their purpose isn't to convey information but rather to 'tell a good story', and the greatest 'advantage' that comes their way is nothing but attention. They have less of a victim and more of an audience.  The bullshitter is a person whom most people roll their eyes at when they begin their rambles. They gain a reputation of bringing forth a falsehood whenever they open their mouths, and because the goal is entertainment it doesn't matter what they say - as long as it doesn't go on too long. Bullshitters are less common than liars types one and two, and there is one type which is, mercifully, rarer still. Trump's type. The bullshitter whose lies are concocted for self advantage rather than simple harmless entertainment. These liars make excellent used car salesmen and demagogues, and on one level Trump is actually aware of his tactics of deception, but not in the sense that an ordinary liar is. The bullshitter's goal is to produce an emotional effect, whatever that effect may be, and actual information, truth or falsity, just doesn't matter. It's easy for this kind of liar to present a lie here and now that is totally opposite to a lie put forth ten minutes ago. Checking statements against reality is utterly unimportant and an actual nuisance that interferes with the showmanship. So there's the problem with Trump's brain that predates any frayed neural connections. Did this happen because he lived decades as liar type 2, and believing his own bullshit became set in neural concrete ? Or was he born with this cognitive defect ? I don't know.","title":"Trump Reneges on Promise That His Tariffs Wont Raise Costs for Consumers"},{"text":"People do grow that much blonde hair though?","title":"Why do we have so much info on Luigi Mangione, and so little info on the 3 people who tried to kill the president?"},{"text":"Never forget.

Usually all you'll hear are the loudest politically-motivated voices parroting an idealization of whatever their view is *supposed* to be, and an exaggerated demonization of the other sides to make them look as bad as possible.Abortion is a perfect example.To hear a democrat pundit/influencer describe it, their side wants to make sure that women have complete bodily autonomy and characterizes tiniest notion of any restrictions on abortion as wanting to turn women into sex slave breeding machines.To hear a republican pundit/influencer describe it, their side wants to protect every unborn children and characterize those anyone who is against abortion restrictions as celebrating the wanton murder of babies.Then the wider politically inclined population adopts the talking points of these voices to fit in or to appear intelligent because they don't actually formulate their own opinions, since it's so much easier when you have one premade for them.And while there are examples of all of these extremes on both sides, they don't represent the majority, but both sides will hold up these extremes not because they believe in them, but because they think it will make themselves look virtuous and reasonable while making the other side seem evil and irrational. You can see this everywhere on social media.Realistically, though, most Democrats believe in *some* restriction on abortion, generally late term should be in place, and Republicans believe that *some* elective abortions should be allowed, generally early on in the pregnancy as well as more specifically, exemptions for abuse and medical reasons, but running on these more reasonable middle grounds doesn't emotionally charge people to vote and isn't effective campaign messaging to emotionally charge people to vote.So what do you trust? Well, you can trust that none of these extremes will ever happen because of the very nature of how our government is set up with checks and balances and the shifting back and forth of voters. You can trust that some steps will be taken towards the idealizations, but must do so with the knowledge that at some point, the population will eventually put a stop to it because, again, for almost every idealized characterization of a political extreme, there's an equally easy demonization to make, and as you near it, more people will begin to feel negatively about it.I think you're just having trouble separating campaign messaging and propaganda with the reality of policymaking and just how slow of a process it is.","title":"CMV: Both political camps in the US are disingenuous with their positions on healthcare and education"},{"text":"Art of the Hustle","title":"Trumps Latest Ridiculous Proposal Is a Huge Gift to Billionaires"},{"text":"His diet","title":"Prosecutors Are Fighting to Make Sure Trump Remains a Convicted Felon"},{"text":"Yup, all these experts are only experts when it comes to people actually abiding the law.. when there is no law you are no longer an expert.","title":"Experts pour cold water on Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship  but issue a stark warning"},{"text":"Jesus-fucking-Christ!

I don't think it deserves any major praise if you have the most basic standards. I'm not talking about better than Trump because that's essentially meaningless; I mean actually admirable in some notable way. It was the only logical thing to do for a country with anti-Russia interests C once things expand to Poland or another EU country, NATO countries have an obligation to intervene. Sure, he did the right thing, and he can have credit for that. That being said, obviously it's better to try to nip it in the bud if you want to avoid WWIIIA) turned Russia from a near peer threat to a non-issueRussia is anything but a non-issue. The EU is gearing up for a likely imminent spread of aggression to within its borders.?B) Unified and eventually facilitated the expansion of NATOBiden did not singlehandedly do this by any means. Like I said he picked up the pieces that Trump left behind, and that's good. But he didn't champion any massive changes here.C) Maintained the existence of a free and democratic nationnot sure if you're referring to the US or Ukraine here, but that means either the bar is in hell or see my response to A, respectively.progress made in the pacificyes, this is important, but also not really Biden's policy. It's a strategy that predates him to constrain China's influence. Once again, he did the right thingNow were seeing Assad be overthrown while hes still in officeand? First and foremost, this isn't necessarily the good news it sounds like, considering the story we have seen time and again when there is a power vacuum, plus Assad was granted asylum in Russia. It's also not even directly attributable to US intervention (probably precisely planned so because of the US's long history of \\"saving\\" countries from a dictatorship, only to have it blow up in their face)theres a good argument supporting Israel was the pragmatic thing to do, even if domestically unpopularI don't think there's a good argument for it being pragmatic, precisely because it was domestically incredibly unpopular. That was a big contributor to Trump winning, and that's going to have much bigger and immediate domestic ramifications than conflicts in the Middle East, which could have still been kept below a boiling point (from the US perspective) for awhile. The uncommitted movement showed that a significant share of Democratic voters were very much against the support of the genocide. If even a small share of the people who voted uncommitted in the primaries decided not to vote, that cost Harris the election. ofc she's also to blame for that, but this brings back my initial point about his refusal to resign from running for reelection. If she had run that same platform C basically identical to Biden's C in a normal nomination process with competitors, she almost definitely wouldn't have gotten the candidacy to begin with.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"America is a one party state","title":"Manchin and Sinema Screw Biden Yet Again, Give Trump Control of Labor Board"},{"text":"I wish I knew.

Clinton was deeply unpopular and her campaign could not have been any worse than it was. She campaigned on the idea of \\"it's my turn\\" and never connected with the American people. She was not rejected because she was a woman, she was rejected because she sucked. Harris being rejected by the Latino community especially was not a byproduct of sexism (Clinton won the same demographic handily). Finding cherry picked examples of voters who said \\"a woman could never be president\\" is akin to looking for that one random black person who unironically says \\"kill all white people\\" and saying the white genocide is real. No: the issue was that Harris let Trump define the terms on the issues that resonated the most with the Latino community. The border should have been a slam dunk for Harris. \\"There was a bipartisan bill to stop what you are complaining about at the border and you made Republicans in congress vote it down so you could have an issue to campaign on\\" was a weak tactic because it made Harris and Biden look weak when they held institutional power. What she should've said was \\"Hey, asshole, the majority of fentanyl smugglings are done by US citizens and that's not me speaking that's XYZ institutions and studies saying that. So if you wanna talk about fentanyl smugglings lets do that.\\" But she had to let Trump define the terms of the issue so that she could go for her weak as fuck dunk, which didn't resonate. Bc all it did was make her look like a diet republican. And Latino's skew culturally conservative. So if the option is between \\"racist who doesn't reflect my cultural beliefs\\" and \\"racist who reflects my cultural beliefs\\", what do you think they're gonna do? For the arab community I have nothing for them. Shame them, they genuinely deserve it. But their vote wasn't enough to steal the win from Harris alone.

When asked to elaborate on what he meant, Ford played coy, saying hell wait to see what will happen moving forward.We'll use every tool in our toolbox, including cutting them off energy that we're sending down there, he added.Folks, this is coming, it's not, if it is, it's coming and it's coming January 20th or 21st.

We need to stand united as Canadians and work hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with our colleagues across the country and, and we're ready to do it.Speaking about the meeting, the premier said it was constructive and the federal government presented a plan that addressed border issues -- something Trump cited as one of the reasons why he plans to impose the 25 per cent tariff.They have a plan but there's one thing to have a plan, then we have to implement it, Ford said.Further readings:https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/insider-says-justin-trudeau-has-a-1b-border-plan-designed-to-counter-trumps-tariff-threat/article_96a83c3e-b707-11ef-85ec-c73fa7655a7f.htmlhttps://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/doug-ford-warns-of-cutting-off-their-energy-to-retaliate-against-tariffs-by-donald-trump/article_24ea8674-b7cf-11ef-b789-e33b2e047156.htmlhttps://globalnews.ca/news/10907757/quebec-legault-trump-tariffs-border-control/https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/elon-musk-calls-trudeau-insufferable-tool-in-new-social-media-post-1.7142131https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-will-have-to-kiss-the-ring-to-achieve-smoother-bilateral-relations-with-trump-john-bolton-1.7142103https://vancouversun.com/news/bc-premier-david-eby-trump-tariffs-interprovincial-tradehttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-bc-premier-david-eby-vows-to-seek-out-new-export-opportunities-in-wake/https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-meeting-premiers-trump-tariffs-border-1.7407922https://www.ft.com/content/b343a6db-7cb7-4256-9370-e1042b5385ed [Bank of Canada warns Donald Trumps tariffs will dramatically hit growth]https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/canadian-industries-and-provinces-most-exposed-to-u-s-tariff-threat/https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-premiers-urge-strong-response-trump-tariff-threat-minister-says-2024-12-12/!ping Can&amp;Containers","title":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatens to cut off energy to U.S. in response to Trump's tariffs"},{"text":"Just shows how fundamentally Donald does not understand the regulatory regime.

Speaking as a substitute teacher who over the past three years has subbed at over a dozen elementary schools in high, medium, and low income neighborhoods, with student bodies of varying racial compositions (ranging from ~20%-90% white; the Twin Cities area is still badly segregated), the students born in 2015 and 2016 are noticeably 'stunted' compared to both the students born in the early 2010s and students born in the late 2010s.Of course within any classroom some students will struggle more than others, but in general, the 2015 &amp; 2016 kids have noticeably less-developed social skills, have greater difficulty understanding and following instructions, and struggle much more with improving their reading and math abilities.For the most part, I do not believe COVID lockdowns were especially excessive. If anything, the high number of both infections and deaths per-capita in America suggests that they needed to be slightly stricter (especially in GOP-dominated states like Florida).

Thay is the thing that matters here, european governments want good healthcare to be abailable to all.It is only a monopsony if you look at each country as a separate market. But the reality is that it is a global market with many different buyers. Companies want to sell to the most people possible to maximise revenue. And european countries use that to their advantage by buying on that global market as one entity. Contracts are often negotiated per country as is because if you have to do all the paperwork, you might as well try to sell to everyone in that country. It mainly seems to be that the US is just very fractured in negotiating prices.For your second point, i did a 20-minute google search and just looked at how much \\"groundbreaking\\" innovations came for the eu or us.

Unless were supposed to believe Oswald acted completely alone, which is laughable at this pointThis is also why I think Trump will be offd for saying some of the anti war things hes said or somehow removed or something. Who knows. Its a lot harder to plot a killing of the president and get away with it today than it was in the 60s. Its obvious to me that the establishment doesnt want him there though.Im not some deranged maga guy either. I disagree with lots of his policies, most of them actually. but its just true looking at the evidence and the sheer amount of profit for these companies in war whether its proxy or direct they arent looking out for americas working peoples interests which is firmly anti war.","title":"Mississippi communities scarred by ICE raids fear future under Trump"},{"text":"Yeah, I deleted it for being both too doom-and-gloom and unrealistic.You are absolutely right.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 11, 2024"},{"text":"He's just waiting for the promised payments from foreign interests.","title":"Trump still owes a $454 million civil fraud judgment to New York, state attorney general says"},{"text":"Or just leave the name and blame how shit it really became lying about it.","title":"Republican Support for Obamacare Hits 12 Year High"},{"text":"How did people get so stupid so fast?
