Clinton won the popular vote in 2016. Biden just barely won in 2020. In fact, if a few tens of thousands of votes had gone the other way in a couple of the swing states in 2020, Trump would have taken it. Trump did as well as he did in 2020 in the face of a pandemic and a near-complete economic collapse. Everybody was celebrating Biden's victory in 2020 like he was FDR and had some kind of mandate, when the reality is that -- absent Covid -- Trump would have crushed Biden. Harris lost for the simple reason that she was too far left, she was a bad candidate, and she was part of an unpopular administration. It had nothing to do with her gender per se.The Left often forgets that Sarah Palin was effectively Trump-before-Trump back in 2008. People filled stadiums to see her -- not the actual candidate, John McCain. So the idea that people in the political center and right-of-center are going to reject someone on the basis of gender alone is silly. (And for the record, Clinton got 63% of the Latino male vote in 2016). Almost certainly, what will happen is this: some Republican woman is going to become President in the next decade, and the mainstream media will have very little to say about it, because unless the individual is \\"their kind of woman\\" or \\"their kind of African-American\\" or \\"their kind of LGBT\\" candidate, they don't care. A good example of this is the fact that, currently, a black woman -- born in Nigeria -- is head of the right-wing Conservative party in Britain. She'll probably become PM in a few years. The liberal American media absolutely do not care. I haven't seen a single article about her. No profiles -- nothing.So the liberal media confuses discrimination on the basis of ideology with discrimination on the basis of gender. The American people are completely willing to vote for a woman as president and have been for at least 20 years. They just a want a woman who believes what they believe. Clinton basically had it in the bag -- she just made strategic errors in the swing states and was trying to follow eight years of Democratic governance.","title":"Letters: Americans should admit that we rejected Kamala Harris because she's a woman"},{"text":"Or a troll.

If the number of evil mouthpiece are reduced, and they bear legal liability for what they publish, that changes - AND consumers would be less likely to get totally sucked in as they are now, because social media engages, inflames, and consumes people more than published media does.

The average person is intrinsically drawn to fairness and the average person doesn't see fairness where Lia Thomas or Laurel Hubbard (for example) are concerned.

We may all be different people but ultimately we want the same thing, and that's to convert our ff points into upgrades. Unfortunately, thanks to fringe cases we don't see the boring trans women in the media. We see Lia Thomas. And that sticks. It primes people to think poorly of trans women generally. It also ensures that the left is at a disadvantage when it champions the rights of trans people. Remember, a significant portion of the electorate voted for change because they're struggling with increased costs and decreased wages. They're not weighing the pros and cons of macroeconomic policy on future inflation. They're looking at their grocery bill and wondering what they can cut back on. These people aren't going to debate the nuances of trans representation in sports vs. the impact of a foreign policy that preserves the status quo. Optics matter. And I'm not sure your actions in a previous career of any relevance when it comes to mocking women's sports. If you can't make your case without demonizing women's sports, then you don't have a case to make. As someone who's taken a lot of shit as a female athlete and supporter of female athletes over the years, I don't think very much of your strategy.

I can barely make ends meet, and this is where my tax dollars are going? I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way people thought. My mom bought into it. Part of the reason why she voted for Trump is because she didn't want her tax dollars funding inmate sex changes. As a whole, the majority of Americans support the LGBTQ community. 80% of Americans supported same sex couples rights. When it comes to transgender rights, however. 52% of Americans support transgender bathroom bans. 62% oppose transgender women participation in youth sports. 65% oppose transgender women in college and professional sports. 66% felt that transgender women should not be allowed to participate in high school sports. Asked whether issues related to transgender people were a distraction from more pressing matters. 77% of Americans felt that it was. The Republican party has done a good job of demonizing the transgender community, and the Democratic party did a horrible job of speaking of standing up for the transgender community.

Only aligning mutual interests. Neither does it require close coordination, or merging of groups.This whole thing sounds a lot like what some neoliberal Destructocrat *imagines* how such a scenario would go down and that it would occur purely around social issues.At least you hope it will.If you think neocons are greasy, slicked-back and smiling used car salesmen that try to trick you into acting against your own best interests, then you haven't seen shit, because neolibs are FAR more dangerous to the cause in that regard.You're doing it right now in fact, with this effort to poison the well of potential cooperation, by attempting to sow discord and distrust among your enemies, for whom trust is not necessary to operate as loose, erstwhile allies in concert against you.It's funny how you touched on those mutual interests briefly as a way to blow right past them to talk about the divisions and \\"how can you trust them?!\\" pearl-clutching that is designed to prevent any such cooperation.Those \\"kitchen table issues\\", as you so quaintly refer to them are exclusively about improving the material conditions of workers lives, which is *the* driving concern of the actual left and literally what being on the left is all about.So yeah. I imagine it alarms you a great deal that the right has come around to the left's way of thinking on a lot of those matters, since Destructocrat neolibs have worked so hard to prevent any progress in that arena and to thwart the left most specifically.Because we might actually get something effective done while cooperating in the arena of those issues of people's material conditions. The Destructocrats fear that so much, they created and sustained Trumplestiltskin just to prevent it from happening.But if it is trust you require, that's no problem at all.

Something was keeping Bibi from decimating Palestine and once that something was gone, he no longer cared. What changed? Economy - Trump is a great con man.

I blame the party for not coming down harder on him instead of propping him up. Under circumstances Harris did the best she could.

Historic England said the findings of the dig at King Arthur's Hall, on Bodmin Moor, were the first to confirm the site dated back to prehistoric times. The monument was previously listed as dating back to the medieval period but it is now believed to date back 4,000 years earlier to the Neolithic period by a group of specialists from UK universities. Dr Tim Kinnaird, from the University of St Andrews, said the findings were a \\"major revelation\\". He said archaeologists would \\"now have to re-appraise our understanding of the prehistoric landscape of Bodmin Moor\\". \\"It's extremely exciting that we've finally been able to date construction of this enigmatic monument, previously grounded in myths and legends,\\" he said. Archaeologists from UK universities were joined by local volunteers for the dig Historic England said there had been speculation the site dated back to pre-historic times because of its standing stones, but the new survey was the first to confirm this. Researchers working on behalf of the Cornwall Archaeological Unit (CAU) were joined by volunteers for the dig, which began in 2022. Samples taken from the monument, including pollen, insects and parasite eggs, were radiocarbon dated, Historic England said. The results were combined with other dating techniques, such as Optically Stimulated Luminescence, to give a date of between 5,500 and 5,000 years ago. **'Unique monument'** Geological examination of the standing stones suggested they came \\"from within 250m (820 feet) of the site and were possibly dug out from the interior rather than from a distant tor\\", Historic England said. James Gossip, from the CAU, said the site had been used and upgraded at various times in its history, up to the medieval period. \\"Knowing when King Arthur's Hall was built will help us understand this unique monument form better, how it might have originally been used and how it could have been used over time,\\" he said. He said the findings would help answer questions such as whether the stones were \\"placed there at the time of building or later in prehistory\\" and if the site was used \\"as an animal pound or reservoir\\". **Erosion risk** Dr Rob Batchelor, director of Quest, an archaeological unit from the University of Reading, said: \\"The wild, remote landscape of Bodmin Moor has inspired centuries of legends, but this extraordinary new finding shows how science can help deliver stories that are just as intriguing. \\"Further analysis of these sediment cores may yet reveal more about what our Cornish ancestors were doing there and their impact on the local environment.\\" Historic England said visitors to the site should be careful not to disturb the monument as it was at risk of erosion. The site is on the body's At Risk Register because of overgrown vegetation and the risk of erosion from visitors and livestock.!ping HISTORY&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You're right, let's push for it, just as a goof!

Why would he even pick her although she always was on him during the debates?It is precisely _because_ she was so good at the Democratic primary debates that he added her as his Vice President. She's a great debater, and she did great on her recent debate against Trump. Unfortunately that wasn't enough for her to win. Even though she had been appointed as what America calls \\"Border CzarrHer role was to work on boarder relations through _diplomacy_. Biden dispatched Harris on a diplomatic mission to work with Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. In other words, it was an effort to slow migration at America's southern border by encouraging people to stay in their home countries. I have not followed whether or not she actually went to the border with Mexico, but that would not have been important for her role in this. Joe Biden had been forced out by the Democratic party and quickly replaced with Harris without a proper Primary election.A primary did happen with Biden on the ticket with Kamala as his vice president. When it became clear that Biden was not up for running second term, since the primary had already happened, she was the _only_ possible alternatives since she was already on the presidential ticket. In other words, the fact that she became the nominee not only was not wrong, but it was the most ethical decision possible. She wasn't clear on her identityShe has always identified as mixed race. This is just some sort of weird Republican talking point claiming that you can't identify as both Indian and black, even though she always has. I recommend checking out some different news sources because this one was just pure propaganda. She had very clearly changed her accent depending on the location of her rallies.

Also, she does not run the finances for her campaign herself. Her past as a prosecutor was incompetentThat's false. As a prosecutor, Harris launched a criminal justice open data initiative that aimed at increasing transparency to strengthen trust, enhance government accountability and inform public policy. She was part of a legal investigation into fossil fuel companies about whether they had defrauded the public by giving them false information. She won a billion dollar against private colleges committing fraud as well. Etc. She was for prosecuting guns from 2nd amendment citizen users, and then she had said on camera that she had a \\"Glock.\\"Yes, because she believes in the right to bear arms, which is guaranteed in the Constitution, but does not believe in _unregulated_ arm ownership.

As both ministers announced in a joint press statement, Germany and Croatia have agreed on a new Ringtausch deal, which enables the delivery of 30 M-84A4 MBTs and 30 M-80 IFVs from Croatia to Ukraine. While Ukraine has been using the M-80 in its own army since mid-2022 thanks to a delivery from Slovenia, the M-84A4 is still unknown to the Ukrainian army, although the operation of these vehicles should not be a problem as it is based on the T-72, which is widely used in Ukraine. However, the M-84A4 has received some modernisations that set it apart from its Soviet original. The tanks have received a new day/night sight, a modern ballistic computer and improved elevation and traverse sensors, as well as a more powerful engine and a more modern communication system. As Anu?i? announced, the delivery will already take place before the end of this year and will include a comprehensive spare parts package as well as ammunition for the main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. This means Ukraine will be supplied with additional important military equipment within the next approximately eight weeks, which is urgently needed in the ongoing fight against the Russian aggression. According to the press statements, Croatia is carrying out a fundamental modernisation of its own army and is planning to procure up to 50 German-made Leopard 2A8 MBTs.\\nLeopard 2A8Image: KNDS DeutschlandA Leopard 2A8 MBT during a presentation In return for the delivery of the 60 armoured vehicles from Croatian army stocks, Germany will compensate them with a significant amount of money. As a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defence told me, Germany is paying 144 million for these vehicles. Croatia will use these funds to cover part of the procurement costs for the up to 50 Leopard 2A8s, whose delivery is expected to start already in 2026. Based on the details we have on the procurement of 123 Leopard 2A8 MBTs for the German Bundeswehr, the costs for Croatia would have to exceed 1 billion. Regarding the now agreed Ringtausch, it is also important to mention that the press statements of the German and Croatian defence ministries both indicate that there will probably be additional deliveries to Ukraine in the future, as both mention the delivery now made public will be the first tranche. According to the local media outlet Jutarnji, Croatia currently operates around 70 M-84 MBTs, which, according to their information, are in good condition and have been regularly maintained. The Ringtausch now concluded with Croatia is already the second Ringtausch that has been concluded in 2024. At the end of July, an agreement was reached to deliver 14 Leopard 2A4 MBTs with spare parts and ammunition as well as a Bergepanzer 3 ARV to the Czech Republic in return for deliveries to Ukraine. Croatia has now become the sixth country with which Germany has concluded a Ringtausch agreement, after the Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, and Slovenia.!ping EUROPE&amp;UKRAINE&amp;MATERIEL","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Aint gonna happen","title":"White House urges Senate Democrats to approve new judges before term ends"},{"text":"If your goal is minimizing suffering, rejecting life and offing yourself would be the optimal choice.

There are countless people in the background who are funding, researching, and coordinating all of these causes C Project 2025 provided undeniable proof that this is not a conspiracy theory; it's a true conspiracy. Trump has shown that an incompetent figurehead is essentially a hack to have people forgive/discount/infantilize everything you do. It's classic misdirection C essentially, it's the tactic magicians use of using one hand to distract while the other performs the trick. Not long ago, everyone was talking about how Ron DeSantis was the competent version of Trump. He lost miserably, because he can't hide his evil behind a clown mask.A clear example of meme-ified actions with extremely serious implications was his meme-ification of the sanctions on Iran with the Game of Thrones \\"Sanctions are Coming\\" meme. Memes essentially hijack critical thinking C they encourage quick processing of information without deliberation. The Republicans know this and use it very effectively.

Why would he even pick her although she always was on him during the debates?She was not *only* a woman of color, she was a competent career woman of color. Out of a number of competent candidates, Biden chose a woman of color, why should that be a problem?She never went to the Mexico US border, and when asked about it she said \\"And I never went to Europe either, what's your point?\\" Even though she had been appointed as what America calls \\"Border Czarr\\" by Joe Biden on camera during a conference meeting. You would expect a babysitter to see the baby they are sitting, correct?What I've read is that there never was a Border Czar, it was a term used by right-wing media to attack her. But that she did have a job to address border issues - by traveling to the countries where the immigrants originate and negotiating there, and she did that. Do you have sources that this was a thing beyond that?Adding to that, she had very bad ratings when VP. (I literally never heard any news about her during her time, but I'm a foreigner so what do I know.)What are your sources about ratings? And what were they compared to VPs historically?She wasn't clear on her identity, I find it very weird that a country is confused about the ethnicity of their own leader. (She had ran as an Indian woman of color back during the 2020. And now she ran as a black woman.)Right-wing pretended to be confused because they used it as an attack. It has always been possible to be mixed race. Do you have sources about confusion outside the right-wing media?She had very clearly changed her accent depending on the location of her rallies. (If you don't believe me go watch on YouTube.)Everybody does that, it's called code switching. Do you speak exactly the same way to your grandmother, your little brother, your boss, and your friends?She ended her 1 billion and 20 million dollar campaign fund in debt after the failed election, I do not believe that this would be a good economic leader at all.Source?Her past as a prosecutor was incompetent, and she laughed when asked if she herself had smoked marijuana.What do you mean by incompetent? Based on what? I don't see the relevance of laughing there.She was for prosecuting guns from 2nd amendment citizen users, and then she had said on camera that she had a \\"Glock.\\"Prosecutor's job is to enforce law, regardless of her own opinions.

They resented the world isnt as they wish it were and they arent willing to put the work in.

The ship is sinking, why would I focus on how the hull got a hole in it?What I am trying to say is that the current approach isnt working. It hasnt been working. Look at where we find ourselves. Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen, few in pursuit of the goal.This is the failure of the left.It is only by confronting our failures and adapting our tactics that we can actually accomplish the goals that we have.

Society does it, sometimes to a nonsensical degree, but also out of practicality.For example, laws. We have laws because they benefit people and civilization as a whole. Personal morals are subjective, yes, but there has to be practical lines or else there would be chaos.Guilt tripping people to follow specific moral hierarchies is pretty common. Sometimes it's justified as I've said, but often times it can be done out of groupthink and mass hysteria.We also generally encourage people to follow ethical frameworks. Although they are more collective than personal, yet still subjective nonetheless.Also, yes, all morals are biased and shaped by specific conditions and experiences.

If you tell a kid \\"daddy will be killed by bad guys if you tell anyone\\" that kid isn't going to tell. It's already hard enough getting kids to come forward about abuse in their family, and families already try to cover this stuff up. Is it fair to the child to put the guilt of getting someone killed on their shoulders, even though they were the victim? Second, it will lead to a lot more dead kids. If a pedo is getting the death penalty anyway, there's more risk leaving the child alive to tell. It's the same reason there's no death penalty for rape - because the punishment won't discourage rape, it just discourages leaving the victim alive to identify you.

Hitler was successful in becoming a dictator because he took advantage of the Reichstag Fire Decree due to the fire that destroyed the Reichstag capitol. It was supposedly caused by a \\"communist\\", but no one knows for sure who did it even to this day. When the Reichstag Decree was declared it made him dictator for a short period of time, it gave him the legal right to suspend civil liberties and arrest political opponents particularly \\"Communists\\" and \\"leftists\\". Now understand this was legal. It wasn't illegal. It was part of the Weimar Republic's Constitution. Then he wanted to pass the Enabling Act of 1933 which essentially made him a dictator for life. He needed a 2/3rds vote from Parlaiment. The courts didn't help him become a dictator perse it was more of the chaos in the country that existed at the time and the constant threats he made to politicians to get them to support him. Germany at the time was in horrible shape, they just lost a major war and have literally become indebted to their enemies. On top of that, Unemployment rate was at near 20% and inflation was sky high. Much different time. Now take note, there is nothing in the United States Constitution that gives any sitting president the legal right to go after political opponents. Literally nothing in law. The issue with Germany in the 1930s, is that there were loopholes in its legal document that allowed you to commit what we would consider unlawful acts, but to them it was lawful.   \\nNow granted he could attempt to declare martial law, but he needs a damn good reason to do it and even then, it doesn't make the president a dictator by any means nor give him the legal right to pursue a political opponent.","title":"CMV: Republicans don't have a serious plan to enact the reforms they want"},{"text":"They havent been effective since the ACA.

They needed someone they thought could actually give them a fighting chance against Trump in this election cycle.It's bizarre how Joe literally looks way happier and sounds coherent now. I think Joe tweeted that he's putting Kamala in himself as his replacement as a last 'F U' to his puppet masters because he knew that they did not want Kamala in and that she clearly wouldn't be able to win against Trump.Tell me, why would the 'powers that be' go through all this effort to try to defeat Trump from 3x assassination attempts, the impeachment, inditements and all the other BS... and then throw the election so deliberately by putting Kamala in as Biden's replacement? They were trying SO hard this whole time to get rid of Trump, it just doesn't make sense for them to do that.Biden's decision to throw Kamala in was definitely to mess up their plans, hence why hes so happy now, and why he 'accidentally' wore a Trump MAGA hat once.

Not always was it such a bad problem, and at times it has been even worse, like right before the Great Recession 17 years ago. The economy is doing well, but workers arent. Expensive healthcare is part of the reason. Wages not keeping up with cost of living is also a problem. For their part, health care coverage for their employees is so expensive that a lot of midsize companies and small businesses cant really afford to do both: provide both adequate healthcare and high wages, that is. Bigger companies could afford to pay more but most of their money ends up going to shareholders and executives. The only people doing really well in this booming economy are the upper income brackets, and the higher up they are the better things are going. That reflects several different problems. One is that most of the wealth of these people is tied up in stocks. But the bottom half of the population in terms of wealth doesnt own any stock, or very little. This means the economic gains in the stock market mean nothing to most of these people, and see none of that wealth themselves. Unfortunately, a large portion of those people mistakenly believed that Trump would somehow fix that for them, and make their lives better, not realizing hes probably the last guy who will help make these poor blue collar workers get rich.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"Honestly, it's probably time for a rewrite.

They still have to make sacrifices to provide for their families. They may be living under the shadow of debt or be one or two paychecks away from losing their homes, just like any blue collar family. It's right wing media that's turned the poor against the middle class. It's an easy target because they actually have to live alongside one another, and people resent the neighbors who live only slightly better than themselves while they have no inkling how the truly rich people live. And it's especially unfortunate because many of the professional class are the children of working class families who struggled to give them a better education, then called them brainwashed when they actually came home from college educated.

AOC in this scenario is an awful person who thrives off people who are in bad environments. For those who aren't in NYC let me give you a synopsis.Essentially, she tries to maintain her neighrborhoods who vote for her by destroying opportunities for other neighrbodhoods which harbor middle class people or individuals who have helped their local area/zipcodes go up in value. She does this by banning or stopping projects which promise a large number of jobs and tax dollars for the city like Amazon. Her reasoning is always she wants to protect her people from being displaced. But what she doesn't say loud is the fact that she wants to perpetually keep her constituents in poor conditions because if they have their own wit and finance to stand on, then she has no job. Her job isn't to maintain the level of income and harbor a large amount of transitioning illegal migrants, it is the serve her constituents and provide opportunities working with the city. During her time she has done absolutely nothing of substance, no community outreach, no programs for her low income constituency to achieve higher education, no lessening of crime under her. All she has done is stopped areas from moving up in the income bracket to ensure her constituents remain in dingy, illegal migrant infested and crime ridden neighborhoods because the very next election cycle she will promise the same things which is \\"I won't abandon you\\". My question is, what happens when she is gone? This people will be displaced harder than ever, more than that completely underprepared because they were abandoned by their leader who refused to provide them any help to climb the financial ladder of our society. All because she wanted to cyclically farm votes. She has made her constituents abandon the American dream and sold them a version of salvation she is offering while forsakening the working class nearby. She is a disease which infects my city, and there are many more like her. The sooner we get her out the better we will be and we will enable these low income neighborhoods to climb the income ladder and find their own properties to live in, not income assisted housing or projects which are both proved by neumerous studies to only keep low income people in low income brackets because they fear being kicked out and their kids are surrounded by gang violence which inevitibly influences many. We will fix this city in time, and if we don't then sh*t I don't plan to stick around and find out if things get any worse ?","title":"Liberals Enraged At Border Czar Vowing To Secure The Border"},{"text":"Thats because he isnt a threat.

Those metrics have been the same throughout the year. People have heard how good the economy was and THAT is the problem. Why? Grocery prices didn't go down. There wasn't a tangible indication that things were going well.Good delivery? Up. Grocery prices? Up. Drinks and food at bars? Up.The news sends mixed signals but we on Reddit tend to be high information voters. The rest of the electorate is not. 150 million people votes but not all 150 million are here to be as informed as we are. Their sources are closer to the kitchen table and they are complaining about the same thing as their viewers which reinforces the feelings over facts.Disengaging from their media ecosystem will only cause the divide to widen. But engagement will also mean opening ourselves up to criticism and bringing ourselves to earth that even if unemployment is low, it's because the jobs are that are being created are minimum wage jobs which are $7.25 for a majority of the country; stock market is reaching new highs which makes their bosses wealthier and raises the median wage for the senior leadership but that isn't trickling down; and all of the things the Democrats take pride in passing (sans the insulin cap) are long-term projects with no immediate payoff to make people feel like we are on the right track.This is where Bernie and AOC get it right in saying the Democrats have become the party of elites because not everyone has a 401k, not everyone has stocks, and not everyone cares that bridges are being rebuilt or that manufacturing is returning because when they walk in the grocery store, prices are up 30% at the least and their pay hasn't gone up to match it. Companies aren't handing out raises, unions are going on strike while companies return record profits.The Democratic party has to become the party of faster change. It can still be deliberate but it has to move faster to get to the people if they want to win over a low information electorate because this is the Netflix generation.

This year, with COVID almost entirely out of the picture politically, the margins in Clark are still collapsing.Theres not really enough signs to tell just yet, but I think that it is most broadly a result of the pro-Trump realignment among uneducated voters and Latinos hitting Nevada hard. Nevada is actually the least educated of the swing states and the second most Latino, so a sort of Machismo bro vote coalition couldve ultimately cost Harris the state along with traditionally red areas and demographics.The key to Nevada in the future imo is to quadruple down on Latino, Minority, and working class outreach. Suburban outreach helps in the blue wall and the south, but theres not really a strong base of moderate, white educated suburbanites here to swing the entire state.

But so is China, a much, much bigger threat, and pretty much anyone else, be they other countries, corporations, or individuals, who think they have something to gain by dividing the American people.  But an even bigger source of division is the ideological/philosophical divide of the American people, most readily seen in the political realm.

They hate the founders of the country, the culture they came from, their philosophy, and they way they structured our government.

He livestreams, he podcasts, he trades barbs with political enemies with acidic bluster. But for those who have closely followed his legislative career, the Florida lawmaker represents a sharp break from the corporate-friendly orthodoxy of the modern Republican Party. Indeed, Gaetzs elevation will provide sprawling prosecutorial powers for continuing his push against special interest influence and corporate malfeasance.\\nHis record speaks for itself. From his perch on the House Judiciary Committee, Gaetz has promoted a surprisingly consumer-friendly agenda, routinely breaking with his GOP colleagues on crucial votes. He previously supported legislative measures to break up Silicon Valley monopolies, sharply regulate the online data broker industry, ban noncompete employment contracts, and an end to the practice of forced arbitration, among other corporate accountability votes. He has also taken maverick positions on reducing FBI surveillance powers, cutting certain arms supplies to Saudi Arabia and legalising marijuana....In an era of severe political polarisation, the Florida representative has found opportunities to support actions of the Biden administration. In August, Gaetz wrote a letter to Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai, urging him to adhere fully to the antitrust ruling against the company secured by the current Department of Justice. He has called on Trump to continue a corporate law enforcement pattern started by the Biden administration. I would hope that whoever is the next FTC chair would continue many of the cases that Chair Khan has brought against predatory businesses, Gaetz told the Wall Street Journal.Gaetzs dealings with the populist Left do not end there. Not only did he push for a crackdown on the influence industry in Washington, he teamed up with Leftist firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a demand to end congressional stock trading over concerns that lawmakers have enriched themselves using insider knowledge. AOC is wrong a lot, Gaetz said, explaining the bipartisan push. But shes not corrupt. And I will work with anyone and everyone to ensure that Congress is not so compromised....As the Republican Party becomes more working class, were less captive to the neolibertarian view that everything big business does to people is OK, he once told reporters. That means, he added, the party cant be whores for big business and be the voice of the working class at the same time.","title":"Lee Fang: \\"The Left should welcome Matt Gaetz as attorney general\\""},{"text":"From your link: The last 4 years have been shit economically.

I've always been drawn to liberal ideasindividual freedom, protecting the vulnerable, questioning authority, and the fundamental belief that consenting adults should be free to live their lives however they choose as long as they're not harming others. These aren't political positions to me; they're basic human principles. But the game of politics itself repulses me. What I'm about to share isn't about politics; it's about our shared reality and how we've lost touch with it.The MindvirusWhat's truly mind-numbing to me is how people don't see what's happening right in front of them. The media has devolved into nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for the establishment, programming people to react rather than think. I've experienced this firsthand: When I drew historical comparisons between vaccine mandates and 1933 Germany's early authoritarian policies, I was instantly labeled an extremist and cancelled by my NYC community. Yet now, these same people casually call everyone at Trump's MSG rally Nazis. The irony would be funny if it weren't so tragic.My Liberal FoundationI still believe deeply in core liberal principles:* Genuine free speech, not the controlled corporate version we see today\\n* Standing against establishment overreach\\n* Opposing unchecked corporate power\\n* Fighting against unnecessary wars\\n* Complete bodily autonomy - your body, your choice, in ALL contexts\\n* Defending individual rights consistently, not selectivelyThese aren't just political positionsthey're principles about human dignity and freedom.The Democratic Party's TransformationThe Democratic Party's drift from these values didn't happen overnight. Many of us, exhausted by Bush's brutal wars, lies about weapons of mass destruction, and the Patriot Act's assault on civil liberties, invested our hopes in Obama's promise of change. But instead of the transformation we sought, we got what felt like Bush's third and fourth terms.Under Obama, we watched as corporate influence grew stronger, not weaker. The Snowden revelations exposed massive surveillance programs. The housing crisis devastated ordinary Americans while Wall Street got bailouts. Rather than challenging institutional power, the Democratic establishment became increasingly entangled with it.The betrayal of liberal values became even clearer with Bernie Sanders. Like Trump, Bernie tapped into something reala deep frustration with a system that had left ordinary Americans behind. Both men, from vastly different perspectives, recognized that working people were suffering while elites prospered. But the Democratic establishment couldn't allow an actual progressive challenger. They used every trick in the bookfrom media manipulation to primary shenanigansto block him from the nomination. Most disappointing was watching Bernie himself bend the knee to the same establishment he had railed against, leaving millions of supporters feeling betrayed and politically homeless.When Hillary Clinton emerged as the nominee, we were told rejecting her meant rejecting women's leadership. But we weren't rejecting female leadershipwe were rejecting warmongering and corporate cronyism. What we needed was a leader embodying the feminine divine: qualities of compassion, understanding, nurturing wisdom, and the ability to truly listen. Instead, we got another hawk in the corporate establishment's pocket. And when that failed, they doubled down on cynical identity politics with Harris.Today, the situation relating to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. perfectly exemplifies how far the party has fallen. Here was a lifelong Democrat, a member of the party's most popular family, who wanted to challenge these corrupting influencesand they wouldn't even let him on the debate stage. I firmly believe that had they given him the opportunity, he could have united the country and beaten Trump. But that reveals the truth: this was never about beating Trump. It was about ensuring they maintained control by installing another establishment stooge who wouldn't challenge their power structure. His departure from the party isn't just about one candidate; it's the culmination of a long betrayal of liberal principles....","title":"We Didn't Change, The Democratic Party Did"},{"text":"Why are you posting this. 218 is locked.

However, I understand that the Biden administration did mostly the right things given the situation and the historic crises. There were several times in the past few years when I would see \\"The economy is great!\\" while I'm doing an MS in engineering and struggling to find work that isn't at an Amazon warehouse, and became very very bitter, almost to the point of voting Trump just to \\"burn it down\\". I have very little to no stock market investments and therefore to me it doesn't matter if it's at 30% returns or 1% returns. In the end my reasonable side prevailed, but I can understand why for some people it may not have, and they may have chosen to burn it down. More realistic messaging such as \\"The economy is doing better and recovering, but it still isn't where it needs to be and Biden/Harris will continue to improve it\\" would have been more effective I think.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"What an evil bunch they are","title":"The ugly truth"},{"text":"Is that 214?

I remember how viciously extreme Sanders was accused of being because a public option polled 10 points better than M4A (although a majority of voters in swing states like both policies).It kind of seems like corporate media doesn't actually care at all about the popularity of positions only what lobbyists and the wealthy want?  \\nWe can argue over made up words or terms like progressive, moderate, far left. None of it really matters because those words are now used simply to gauge how loyal to lobbyists and the wealthy a politician is.
