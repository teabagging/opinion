They are actively simplifying it in their heads to them vs. us, because the world has shifted in a way that conservative ideal and standard are no longer as favored (like LGBT rights, desire for a better healthcare system, wealth inequality, womens appearance and sexual independence, etc.s). Basically, they feel threatened by social changes in the world, so any more progress has become such scary idea to them that they willingly put blinders on for Trump and other objectively awful conservative lawmaker to prevent it.","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"The part where you strawman someone not believing you into  Seems like you're for veterans and military dying.That's part of the problem.

This really should have progressed for the last 8 years already and it is shameful that it hasn't. Everything else we can deal with in due course but starting in two week's time we cannot be certain that Trump will ever honour America's Article 5 obligations (my educated guess, [based on his own words](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/how-trump-destabilised-montenegro-with-a-few-words), would be that he won't). Other than that, I suppose the best we can do is try and keep the United States at a bare minimum arms-length distance to ensure the continuation of bilateral trade, staying polite but firm. The European Union (being in a much stronger position than the UK) should also pursue a clear retaliatory stance of reciprocal tariffs whenever Trump gets a bit trigger-happy, up to and including tariffs on American LNG that Trump is pushing so heavily. We also need to keep an eye on any changes to American vaccination rules. If there are any indications of vaccination rates dropping below a certain threshold, we should put entry bans in place for any unvaccinated American travellers. Having said all of that, I have a feeling what will happen instead is that European leaders will fall over each other to see who can kiss Trump's arse the hardest.

People are not going to spend bitcoin at the supermarket, that use case is void.Thoughout history there were 2 stores of value, gold and silver.  In the 1880s it was a major issue in the presidential race on which would be more important, gold won.  In the early 1900s the fed was created. As governments grew a 3rd was created, sovereign government bonds.  After the banking crises in the 1930s the government outlawed owning gold and silver.  Owning more than 5 ozs was felony. In the early 1970s the price of gold was fixed at $35 an oz.  There was so much gold being demanded that nixon had to make a choice. Let the price of gold rise or stop the conversion of dollars to gold.  He chose to close the gold window.  The govt did not want gold to be seen as good investment.There have been so many deals over the last 50 years to keep the world using dollars and buying treasury bonds. In the early 1970s with the saudiss for oil or china for manufactured goods. Countries that tried to move to gold had a tendency to be invaded by the US.The US did everything it could to keep people out of gold and silver and in bonds. My 401k has 200 options, 100 stock, 100 bond, but not 1 bitcoin or precious metals. They also keep the price volatile to dispel the store of value claim. Gold continues a huge secret in most countries.  Examples, lack of US gold audits, secret swiss bank laws or china secretly buying world gold.  Fyi china owns so much more gold than the US regardless of what the published numbers say.Flash forward to 2014.  China who had been playing the treasury bonds game, changed to buying gold and selling bonds.   bitcoin arrived and now the treasury has a 4th competitor.  All 3 have been sky rocketing,  their gains have been outpaced the stock market. The challenge for the governments is the treasurys of the world are starting to buckle under intrest payment loads.  At current prices each day about 20 billion of govt bonds are created, $400 million of gold and silver and $90 million of bitcoin.  A small shift from bonds to the others will send prices much higher. The govt needs you to buy bonds, not the other 3.  Mean while the central banks of the world have stated buying gold themselves. Do what they do, not what they say. Even Blackrock is now playing in Bitcoin and i am not sure what that means yet. As for supply of these stored of value. The amout of silver produced is falling by a 1% each year.  Gold production should peak around 2026. Bitcoin production gets cut in 1/2 every 4 years but government bond needs countinue to grow. Supporting crypto is a massive change and a real stupid move by trump.  As much as the gold bugs hate it bitcoin is now digital gold, ethereum is digital silver and the rest are slot machine pulls manipulated by powerfull hedge funds and hidden groups.Protect yourself and get some of your wealth in these 3 stores of value, gold, silver and bitcoin.","title":"As red flags go there can be few more glaring than Trumps crypto plans"},{"text":"That's how they always wish to work.  ??","title":"Itll FOR SURE be the Republicans who lose their minds Monday when their candidate isnt certified.

David McCormick. Daughter seems to whisper \\"I voted for you\\""},{"text":"Let me try and clarify because I think I'm not making it super obvious what I'm saying. So first objectivity and subjectivity have very strict definitions in philosophy, but they're not completely different to the definitions you've listed here. When we talk about the objectivity of a statement, we are talking about whether the truth of that statement depends on the mind or not. So an objective fact, is a fact which would be true regardless of our thoughts or opinions on the topic. An example of this is physical facts about the world, like the shape of the Earth, it doesn't matter what we think because it's true that the Earth is sphere, even if there were no humans around to observe it. A subjective fact is one which is true because of our thoughts and opinions on a topic. An example could be whether you think ice cream tastes good. I might think ice cream tastes good but you might not think it tastes good so the truth of the statement \\"Ice cream tastes good\\" depends on who is saying it, there is no universal truth about how good ice cream tastes. The definitions you've given here are the dictionary definitions which we might colloquially describe how someone is acting or thinking, \\"He's thinking objectively\\" or \\"He's thinking subjectively.\\" They are getting at the same concept but they're not very strict, which we need to be when trying to think about this topic. The discussion we need to have is whether morality is the kind of thing that falls into the first category, there is truth regardless of what our thoughts are on the topic, or whether it falls into the second category, the truth of moral claims depends on the person making the claim. You've pointed out that morality is the result of our feelings and views on a given situation, and because of this, it must be subjective. My argument is saying that this isn't enough to show that morality is subjective. The reason I'm saying this because in the case that morality comes from our feelings or opinions, it could still be true that morality is objective or subjective. How we come to moral claims doesn't say anything about whether morality is dependent on us.It is possible that we are wrong about moral claims because of this possibility. Think about this analogy with science. Imagine we lived in a world that was the same as this one but everyone was born blind, deaf and lacked sensation. It would be almost impossible for us to conduct science or have observations about the world, is it still true that Earth is a sphere? Of course, because the the shape of the earth doesn't depend on what we think. Using this idea with morality, imagine that there was an objective moral code, there are very specific universal moral facts like \\"murder is wrong.\\" In this hypothetical world, these facts would be objective because they don't depend on us, similarly to physical facts about the Earth. In this world, we are morally \\"blind\\" instead, meaning we don't have any way of telling which moral claims are true or false, we just have our own opinions about them. In this case, we are in a world in which morality in our society operates just like you say it does, we tie moral claims to emotions and it might vary from person to person. But the issue is that in this case, morality is objective, we just have no way of verifying whether our claims are true or false. What this analogy is meant to demonstrate is that the way that morality comes about in our world doesn't tell us anything about it's objectivity or subjectivity because it's possible that morality is objective in a world in which we get our morals from emotions and we can't verify them. You say that morality is a human concept, but every concept is a human concept by definition. Science is a human concept, language is a human concept, maths and logic are human concepts. We would say that logical and mathematical facts are objective, things like non-contradiction, X and the opposite of X cannot be true at the same time, or 2+2=4. But unlike scientific truths, these are also things we cannot physically test. You can't go into the world and find the fact 2+2=4 because it's not a physical fact, it's a fact derived from some fundamental principles we agree on, but they are universal. Morality could exist in this way and be objective, it could be that there are fundamental truths like saying murder is wrong, and we derive further moral truths from these fundamental ones. You suggest repeatedly that morality is based on our emotions, and it can be, but if I have a moral code and think about situations with that code in mind, I'm not coming to an emotional conclusion, I'm coming to a logical one which is based on that code. You're right in saying that this is difficult to imagine, and it's difficult to prove that morality is objective, but the same is true to prove that morality is subjective. If you are religious, your objective moral truth comes from God, and if Christianity is true, for example, then there would be an objective moral code in the bible which you can use. Objective morality on Atheism becomes more difficult to imagine but still not impossible, there are ways to argue for it.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"Stupid won.","title":"As Trump's election is certified, Americans should declare war on stupidity | Opinion"},{"text":"Then stop your unions from blanket support of trump.","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?","title":"Trumps Propaganda Victory - The Rewriting Of Jan. 6: You can believe your own eyes or Donald Trump's words  and many Americans are choosing to believe him"},{"text":" At least one officer diedFour (five?) more committed suicide in the months after the attack.","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"Do they go along or are they forced by editors and bosses to give it attention because it drives clicks and ratings?

This approach could streamline negotiations and demonstrate effective governance by delivering a timely win for the Trump administration. It also has the potential to unify Republicans around shared goals, providing a cohesive vision for moving forward. However, combining diverse policies into one bill poses challenges, particularly when it comes to satisfying fiscal conservatives who demand deeper spending cuts and moderates who might resist aggressive border security measures. The question remains whether party leaders can navigate these internal divisions and build enough consensus to ensure the bills passage.For me, a key factor in the strategy's success is whether Trump is willing to compromise on contentious issues like border security to bring different factions together. While this could strengthen party unity and bolster public support, it risks alienating his core supporters, who view such compromises as a retreat from campaign promises. The reconciliation bills complexity and the high stakes of meeting the budget deadline raise important questions: Can party leaders balance ideological differences without losing momentum? Will this strategy set a precedent for tackling future legislative challenges? And, most importantly, can a single package effectively address the nations diverse needs without sacrificing accountability and transparency?","title":"Johnson tells House Republicans Trump wants 1 reconciliation package: Sources"},{"text":"I thought the donors told Congress what to do.","title":"Johnson tells House Republicans Trump wants 1 reconciliation package: Sources"},{"text":"Oh ok, well it all sounded a bit convoluted, so yeah, well maybe your brain did not register those as important enough to remember?","title":"No thoughts about birthday parties in my past"},{"text":"Talking heads","title":"Trump 2.0 Is About Punishing the Vulnerable and Enriching the Mega Wealthy"},{"text":"There's no cure for stupid.

Unlike children growing up in the South in the 1940s and 1950s, for whom the Civil War was generations in the past, Trumps followers and allies are rejecting readily available evidence of contemporary violence.All you need is the images and the videos from that day, his own words, and what you saw with your own eyes, and it was clear that he had crossed some bright lines, he said. All of that should have been disqualifying, and it wasnt.Trumps transition team did not respond to HuffPost queries. Even since his win in November, Trump has continued to lie about the 2020 election having been stolen from him and has described those who have been prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6 as political prisoners.These people have been treated really, really badly, he told Time magazine last month. Theyve suffered greatly, and in many cases they should not have suffered.Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican political consultant in Florida, said he remembers as a child reading a plaque honoring dead Confederate soldiers in his town square. Thats the way we grew up. Thats what we knew, he said.That Trump was able to revise his own history so quickly is a noteworthy achievement, he added.It is a tribute to Trump and his posses ability to convince half the country, Stipanovich said. And it is a telling indictment of the intelligence of that half of the country.

The fact that only Russia and China stayed in Iran gave them additional advantages such as cheaper energy for 25 years to China and additional drones and shells for Russia. Further entanglements with European economy might have provided Europe with additional pressure for Ukraine, by pressuring them to stop sending weapons to Russia - one third of the shells used by Russia are Iranian, and the drones were mostly developped in Iran.Unfortunately, it would require EU members to drop their veto powers on diplomacy - which might be easily done when they will understand that the alternative is China.","title":"Europe is deluded if it thinks it can manage Donald Trump"},{"text":"I have been so awake since 2015 one could call me woke!","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"The Classical Learning Test is the \\"Christian\\" alternative to traditional college entrance exams...https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/06/us/florida-classic-learning-test-quiz.html\\nThe Classic Learning Test, founded in 2015, is used primarily by private schools and home-schooling families and is rooted in the classical education model, which focuses on the centrality of the Western tradition.The founder of the company, Jeremy Tate, said the test is meant to be an alternative to the College Board-administered SAT exam, which he says has become increasingly ideological in part because it has censored the entire Christian-Catholic intellectual tradition and other thinkers in the history of Western thought.","title":"Classical education thrives in DeSantis Florida"},{"text":"Im in Uk.

From Rusi and The Guardian but keep living in denial. **Far-Right Extremism Steals the Show in 2020**  \\n*Throughout a year defined by the global pandemic, racial inequality movements and political polarisation, the US has been in the spotlight as the epicentre of social upheaval and amplification of far-right extremism.**Far-right extremism is not a new phenomenon. However, it has been given a renewed voice and expanded its influence and impact in 2020. The far-right encompasses a wide range of ideologies, including white supremacy, ultra-nationalism and xenophobia and it is also known by many names, including right-wing extremism. However, across the many facets of its nebulous nature, it has found a new level of amplification this year due to global events. While this amplification has echoes around the word, the US has often been at the centre of the conversation.**Resisting the Pandemic Response**The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent government measures to contain the virus have given the far-right a new voice and platform. Far-right extremist sentiment has quickly adapted to this crisis, repurposing existing narratives to feed the environment of conspiracy and suspicion which has emerged through the pandemic. This flow of extremist content online, coupled with the increased amount of time people are spending on the internet due to lockdowns, has allowed extreme right-wing content to seep further and further into the mainstream. For example, as social media coverage of conspiracy theories has increased so has their presence in mainstream media. Even when fact-checking, media coverage can amplify the impact of conspiracies.**However, far-right operations have not been limited to the virtual world. Anti-lockdown protests have taken place globally, often hosting an underlying array of anti-government, racial and other extremist narratives. In the US this has been particularly prominent, with these protests largely targeting states with Democrat or more liberal governors who impose stricter pandemic responses. There have also been surges in gun sales across the US and even armed individuals or groups staking out or storming government buildings, apparently in an effort to intimidate and coerce government officials into changing policies. This culminated in October with the foiled plot of a far-right self-proclaimed militia group to kidnap Michigans governor Gretchen Whitmer and potentially also Virginias governor Ralph Northram.**Beyond the immediate danger of plots and other threats of armed violence, there is a quieter but perhaps more sinister threat running beneath the surface. These types of groups often seek to appeal to and recruit from police and military circles. Many consider themselves as militias, allowed under the Second Amendment of US constitution, even though the phrase well regulated Militia refers to forces controlled by  state governors (for example, the National Guard). Often local police and law enforcement, such as the Michigan sheriff who defended the group planning to kidnap the governor, are unsure of their authority or unwilling to denounce these groups C potentially giving them further reach and ability to influence the political process. In the US, the FBI has flagged this issue, concerned about investigations being jeopardised and trust in police undermined. However, this is a global phenomenon. For example, a fresh debate has begun in Germany regarding extreme far-right infiltration of security forces.**Standing Against Social Inequality Movements**The US has also featured prominently this year with social upheaval around racism in policing. Protests, largely occurring under the banner of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, swept across the country. The death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in May sparked months of protests, which subsequently spread to other countries. This tragic event and multiple similar cases highlight the systemic racism which exists not only in the American social fabric, but in most societies. Protests over racial inequality have drawn a response from the far-right, with violent exchanges  linked to extremist actors resulting in injuries and deaths.*","title":"Weve been at this rodeo before: gun-safety groups prepare for second Trump term"},{"text":"Bringing a pen to a nuclear war.","title":"Harris to oversee electoral count, restoring norm that Trump shattered"},{"text":"So people are forgetting how broke Trump always is??

Trumps inflammatory rhetoric, his lies, his denial, his fruitless legal battles, his violence inciting language, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that fateful day.\\nAnd this is just one aspect of the January 6th investigations findings.\\nThe investigation showed that many Trump supporters did indeed bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers in place prevented hundreds from bringing those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters werent here to hurt him, and that they should take the fucking mags away, he continued, let my people in, they can march to the capital from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.The investigation also revealed Trumps inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.\\nDuring this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump could have stopped the violence but chose not to.\\nBefore I continue, lets address the right wing narrative that accuses Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for the violence.As per the article:\\nIndeed, the only thing we know for certain from this report is that Trump is blameless for anything bad that may or may not have happened that day. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi is largely at fault, with an assist from the Pentagon, which failed to send troops to rectify Pelosis personal failure to prepare for whatever untoward events may have occurred.The report conveniently blames Nancy Pelosi for what transpired.\\nNevermind the fact that those truly responsible are the people who incited the violence, and facilitated the Capitol riot, as well as those that took action that day to clash with police and storm the Capitol.These claims that accuse Nancy Pelosi of being responsible for January 6th are not supported by the facts. Indeed, Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.\\nIn fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement has continued to scapegoat Democrats and radical leftist groups, while whitewashing and downplaying the events of that day, and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories.\\nFox contributor Monica Crowley posted on social media last January, 3 years ago today, the System manufactured a riot at the Capitol to crush the powerful America First movement, frame President @realDonaldTrump and prevent him from winning again.\\nInstead of holding Trump accountable, the report targets members of the January 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular:\\nWhat caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA?What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and bolster conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting false conspiracy theories.In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.\\nThe report also claims that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.\\nTrump called Hutchinson a total phony and leaker because she spoke out against him. The entirety of their case against Hutchinson is based purely on Republicans simply not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following:?\\t?Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to defraud the United States and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.?\\t?He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results.?\\t?Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.?\\t?Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.?\\t?He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.And at the risk of repeating myself, Trump and his defenders often focus on a couple of lines delivered by Trump on January 6th during his rally outside the Capitol. They claim that moments taken from this one speech absolve Trump of all wrongdoing. But this is disingenuous and absurd.Months leading up to the election, Donald Trump made multiple speeches, posted several diatribes on social media, and repeated over and over again false claims about a stolen election. His rhetoric was incendiary, he spread countless lies and droves of misinformation, he promoted propaganda and conspiracies, and invited his supporters to the Capitol. All of these actions and more incited his supporters to violence, mobilized organized extremist groups, and set the stage for January 6th. To think otherwise is beyond ignorant .\\nAnd to have the audacity to place blame at the feet of anyone else, can only be contributed to fanatical behavior and extreme narrow-mindedness.Before the Capitol had even been secured, Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, was asserting on Twitter that the events had all the hallmarks of Antifa provocation. Hours later, the Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham was telling viewers that there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd. And by morning, Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, was claiming on the House floor that some rioters were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact were members of the violent terrorist group antifa. (Mr. Gaetz would become President-elect Trumps first choice for attorney general before being derailed by scandal.)","title":"Former Capitol Police officers call Trumps vows to pardon Jan. 6 rioters a betrayal"},{"text":"Thats alright.

Banks literally create money out of thin air through the act of lending. This constant influx of capital into the economy is what we call inflation, and its why your money is worth less year on year. When the banks need bailing out or the economy needs to be stimulated a government can literally just add more money into circulation, or remove it. The economy is a balancing act that needs to be controlled and regulated. But since we came off the gold standard fiat money is just as divorced from any physical store of worth as Crypto currencies are. A  cant be traded in for a pound of gold anymore. The metals in the physical coins are practically worthless. Its a token with ascribed and entirely fabricated worth, as are all forms of currency.The difference between crypto and fiat currencies isnt that one is real and one isnt, because theyre both the same thing in that regard. The difference is that crypto is self-regulating without the involvement of a trusted third party, so you can cut out the banks and the fees and the restrictions, and the government or banks cant even see your personal trade if you dont want them to. And because a currency like Bitcoin is limited, its completely inflation proof. Once all the bitcoins are mined there can never be any more, so the value of your money cant be diluted by more money constantly flowing into the economy.In reality, Bitcoin is a lot closer to the traditional money system we had in the west prior to coming off the gold standard than modern money is.","title":"As red flags go there can be few more glaring than Trumps crypto plans"},{"text":"Democrats: able to rig 2020 and create new diseases that spread globally, but couldn't rig 2024?","title":"BREAKING NEWS: The right have dimension traveling technology, allowing them to live in a timeline where Trump was not president at the start of Covid"},{"text":"Dude, post it on Reddit.","title":"Washington Post cartoonist quits after drawing of Bezos, other billionaires with Trump rejected"},{"text":"What about his burning desire to annex Botswana?","title":"Trump's Greenland and Panama Canal ambitions face Republican skepticism"},{"text":"This is total conjecture.

Morality being tied to emotions doesn't inherently make it subjective, it only reflects how we feel about moral claims being made. The key question is whether moral claims are true or false independently of our thoughts. If they are, morality could be objective, even if everyone disagrees about it. If they aren't, then morality is subjective. Deciding between these two possibilities is what we're really trying to get at.We can distinguish between morality and science because of what they *refer* to. Science is an investigation into the nature of the physical world whereas morality is something outside of the realm of the physical world. If it is objective, it would be more akin to things like logical or mathematical truths. Because we generally agree that there is a physical world which exists outside of our minds, we also generally agree that science is the investigation into something objective. But when you suggest that our perception about moral claims might differ because of our emotions, that's true, but we could simply just be wrong about certain moral claims and there still exist some objective fact of the matter. This is the core of the discussion and you need to be able to flesh out the argument further to suggest that our difference in moral opinion give us evidence to think it's subjective and specifically because it gives us cause to rule out the possibility that we could be wrong about moral claims and there still exist some objective fact about morality.This is a bit of a meta-point, but even if we can essentially all agree that there is an objective fact of the matter regarding physical claims, as much as we'd like to think otherwise, the pursuit of science can equally be influenced by our own convictions and still be objective. The very determination of what each person decides to research is a value judgement. Even the way we classify certain things in science is done based on what we think will have a value. The only reason an atom is \\"distinct\\" from a cell is because we have decided that it is a useful distinction to make in our scientific process. These are value judgements and we change these regularly based on what we think is most useful. You could think about morality in the most logical way possible, as you might with science, where emotion doesn't come into it at all and it would be a similar kind of investigation.To speak about why I excluded \\"people with certain conditions\\" in that example, it's for the same reason that we might exclude the observations of someone who suffers from intense hallucinations. What is a hallucination other than a determination that we have made, that the thing the person is experiencing does not align with reality? The only reason we make this determination is that most people who have \\"reliable\\" sense perception would not experience things in the way that this person does, which leads us to believe their perceptions are not real. Essentially, because most people would disagree with them. If you think agreement is a good metric to evidence the objectivity of a certain perception in this case, you can use the same reasoning for agreement on some pretty basic moral claims like \\"Murder is wrong.\\" My point on moral agreement here is essentially just a refutation of the idea that there *is* such widespread moral disagreement in these cases but I still don't think it's a good metric to assess the objectivity of a topic.You mention that murder during peace and murder during war is different but I would disagree with that characterisation. Killing in war wouldn't be classified as murder because it's said to be justified in defense of your country etc, where murder here is specifically the intentional, unjustified killing of another human being. If there were unjustified killings in a war, we would still classify this as murder and we do have designations already for this such the targetting of non-combatants. Yes, killing can be good or bad but not all killings are murder, killing a person in self-defense would widely not be considered murder but this doesn't mean we have different principles or standards, just that the context matters to decide whether something *is* murder or not.I completely agree that *everyone* could agree with a worldview and it still be subjective. But our thoughts on the worldview itself don't speak to it's objectivity or subjectivity, that's something we need to argue for separately.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"Hungarian here.

If you mean the people who run the open source repo, that's not true, because the people using Bitcoin can reject their changes and continue to run older versions.But they won't if that means cutting themselves off from the brand, or from the people who own most of the mining and tokens. Regarding the second point, he already mentioned he's distinguishing Bitcoin from other cryptos. Clones of Bitcoin aren't Bitcoin.Which is a false dichotomy. What distinguishes it? The brand. Functionally, a fork of it is the same, and all that gives it value is belief in the brand.In theory, you're correct. In practice, all of this is the product of a social consensus in a group where huge inequalities exist. The people who own most of it will control the future of it. You can fork your own, but no one will care about it if the big fish all pick the fork that serves their interests best.This is the reason why the ideological rationale behind these tokens is IMHO flawed. Even if the technology actually worked and adoption somehow happened on a large enough scale to become a viable currency, the people who already have power in the current system (governments, corporations, banks, ...) would simply leverage that power to also control the new system by shaping the social consensus in their favour. And even if they somehow fail, then all you'd do is swap one elite for another. There is no meaningful decentralization of power there.You see this even in the one are where it did succeed, namely as something to gamble on. The most convenient vehicles to do that are funds that track the tokens, set up by established financial institutions. Why?

That is the fucking difference. Clinton was negligent, Trump was willful. The accusation against clinton, verbatim from James Comey is:Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a persons actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.They didn't bring a case because she did not willfully mishandle the documents. Full stop, end of discussion. She was negligent, but as odd it seems, negligence is not a crime when it comes to classified material for civilians.This is not true of Trump. Trump was charged because he **willfully withheld** the documents. We literally had to send FBI agents **into his fucking house** to get them out of an unlocked storage room on his property.In criminal law there is an aspect called mens rea. The guilty mind.

But forget that, fine dont charge Biden with obstruction, he still willfully retained classified documents. So charge him with that, no obstruction.No he did not. Please think through this logically.They find a document at biden's old office. What does he do? He *immediately allows them to search everywhere*. He doesn't hide anything, they find other documents. Does that sound willful? Does it sound like he's trying to keep the US government from having those documents? Or does it sound like, at worst, he was negligent?But the hypocrisy didnt start there. Youre putting a lot of emphasis on subpoenas and ignoring them.Hillary received a subpoena. Did she ignore it? Oblige? What did she do with it?Thats right, she deleted subpoenad evidence then paid to acid wash or bleach her server so even FBI technicians couldnt recover anything. Did she stop there? Nope she used hammers to destroy her electronics.I addressed this in another post, but 'Hillary' didn't delete them. Clinton left office in 2013. At that time she had her staff archive her work related e-mails, deleted them, then sent her server away to Platte River Networks and asked them to effectively wipe the server (as would be normal). The staff there didn't do it in Dec 2014 as was requested. On March 2nd clinton was subpoena'd by the house. One of her staffers e-mailed PRN mentioning their request. The staffer at PRN then panicked because he hadn't wiped the server, and wiped the server. 'She' didn't do anything. She followed normal procedures for dealing with an e-mail server (you wipe it because otherwise weirdos start thinking your pizza orders are part of a pedo cabal) and someone didn't do their job when they were supposed to.This has been public information for a decade at this point.

I am not so critical of the fact that they appease the rich because the system is built around itWe're approaching an interesting and historically ignorant precipice. The Democratic Party has the only people in Congress who understand that a robust middle class saved the US from communist revolution or fascist coups. Marx was not wrong that material conditions for the working class deteriorate under pressure from the owners of capital, and revolution is a inevitable result of that deterioration should it continue unabated. What Marx didn't see coming was the government actually siding with workers and creating protections that would ensure a strong, politically powerful middle class. Since FDR, the rich have had to cater their messaging to the needs of this middle class.The Democratic Party and Republican Party both partook in the erosion of the middle class, but those were the old guard and their remnants aging out of life. Currently, the rising stars of both parties are the reactions to the erosion of the middle class. Socialism has become more palpable on the left, and fascism on the right. But the answer is already staring us in the face: help workers and achieve a moderate liberal government and you don't have to have a communist revolution, and the fascists will be fought by the status quo. Simply put, either the power elite who own our politicians capitulate to the demands of the working class, or we're going end up Bolshevik or Nazi.

You obviously forgot the pandemic happened. Trump supporters say that you can't blame him for that, but he mismanaged it right from the start. Trump actively downplayed the danger (saying that it would just blow over) and undermined the advice from medical experts during their press conferences. He had been explicitly warned of the predictions of a pandemic emanating from Asia during the handover from the Obama administration, and yet the first thing he did was disband the group that was supposed to plan for a pandemic response. This resulted in the impact being worse than it could have been. But hey, we can't blame Trump rightHowever, Trump supporters have no problems at all in blaming Biden for the economic aftermath of the pandemic on top of the worldwide inflation in energy prices that happened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He had to restart the economy and fix the massive unemployment. The US did much better at this compared to pretty much all other countries in the world (although I think a lot of that is because the economy dropped harder during the pandemic than other countries so it had to bounce back further to get back to normal).

Its most recent appraisal puts it at $33 million. Trump valued it at $426-612 million.The reason why it is worth so little is because back in 1995 Trump  signed a deed of conservation and a preservation easment. He ceded the right to use the property for anything other than a social club. If you look at the other properties deed and restricted in such a fashion in Palm Beach, all are valued in the same manner.The thing is, Trump **agreed** with the lower valuation in 2020, because it is the correct valuation. Trump's absurd (and illegal) 400+ million numbers were based on what the property could be worth if he here to subdivide it up for construction. He **cannot legally do that** so valuing it as if he can is fraud. It's just fraud.Bank testified that they agreed with the valuation and were paid the loan back in full plus interest and would do business with them again.For a guy who was 'totally' a democrat you sure speak pretty much entirely in republican talking points.Just to be clear, this doesn't matter. If I lie on a bank form to get them to give me money and I pay back the loan, its still fraud.This is important because one of the reasons we criminalize fraud is that it hurts everyone who does things fairly. If you and I both go to get the same mortgage and I lie on the applicaiton while you don't, I'm hurting you by lying even if the bank is made whole in the end.Also, just to be clear, when I said trump's tax fraud case I actually meant the [tax fraud ](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html)case.

Did he go rouge against Biden, or were these specific charges only brought so the Dems could parade around see, no bias in charging people here in order to undermine claims of a two tiered justice system? Clearly Biden knew that even if the sweetheart plea deal fell through due to a pesky judge, that he could always pardon him on the backend regardless.Because he didn't?Hunter was investigated by Weiss, the AG of Delaware appointed by Trump specifically to target Hunter. Weiss was kept on by Biden (when typically all AG's are canned in each admin) and later given Special Counsel status by Garland after republican whinging.Weiss has repeatedly stated that he had total prosecutorial discression in the case and answered to no one in the biden administration before or after he was nominated SC.And to be clear, the 'sweetheart plea deal' fell through well before that.What actually happened was that Biden made a deal with AG Weiss' office to please guilty to one specific charge. The office agreed to defer prosecution on the remaining investigations. Republicans found out about this, and started with the aformentioned whinging, including threatening to bring AG Weiss before congress to answer questions.Then they got two 'whistleblowers' who claimed that no actually, the whole investigation was being controlled by Merrick Garland. These whistleblowers flatly lied about Weiss (claiming he had asked for and been refused SC status).As a result of political pressure, Weiss reneged on his deferred prosecution agreement, but did not make that clear before they got to court. So Biden went in thinking \\"I have an agreement for X,Y,Z\\" and the prosecution believed it was only for \\"X\\". As a result the judge had to trash the agreement because you can't approve a plea agreement where the two sides don't agree on what the plea deal actually means.Oh &amp; in the DOJ investigation report it clearly states that it was found that Hunter acted as an unregistered foreign agent, which is a FARA violation, yet no charges were brought against him for a clear violation of federal law. If its the political witch hunt you claim it is, then why not? Who could that possibly implicate? Hmmm I wonder.Can you link me to this 'DOJ report'? To my knowledge no such report exists, nor would it make sense for one to exist. DOJ policy is not to accuse someone of crimes that they are not charged with (a policy they broke with Clinton, of course) because that would deny the person the right to face the accusation in court.You may be mistaking it for the [House Oversight Report](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Joint-Report.pdf), but I find that particularly low quality toilet paper entirely unconvincing given the numerous factual errors riddled throughout it up to and including the fact that it references 'witnesses' who have since been arrested for lying to the government about Hunter Biden.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"They threw out absentee ballots.

Some of the hypocrisy almost made my head explode.People giving speeches at the Democrat convention saying If trump wins hell weaponize the justice system to go after political opponents while quite literally supporting the weaponization of the justice system to go after Trump.So I saw in your post history that you don't think that the classified documents case was a big deal and I'd like to change your mind on it.It seemed to me that your main issue with the classified documents stuff was the difference in treatment between Trump and Biden, so I'm going to hit that. Here is a quick breakdown:**Biden:**Classified documents were found at the Penn Biden center while lawyers were cleaning out the office. They alerted NARA who got the DOJ involved. Biden immediately consented to searches of all his properties. During these searches a few other documents were found.Biden sat and gave depositions regarding the documents and allowed full access to anyone in his inner circle for the purposes of the investigation. In the end the issue boiled down to two things, the loose docs, and Biden's journals.The loose documents were 100% negligent. If Biden were in the military, this would have been a violation of the UCMJ and he'd have gone to jail. However, the civilian laws on state secrets basically don't criminalize negligence. One of them makes mention of gross negligence, but if you dig into the history, it is like the logan act, it never gets charged and probably isn't constitutional. As such, all the loose documents are a wash. You need to *intend* to withhold them, and Biden clearly didn't.The journals are a different matter. Biden knew he had them (he mentioned 'all the classified stuff is downstairs' to his autobiographer) and intended to keep them. But the critical thing here is that there is a precedent dating back to Reagan saying that things like private journals can be kept by the office holder after leaving office, even if they may contain classified material. It has never been tested for the VP, but it is reasonable to believe that Biden believed he had authorization to have those documents. No intent, no crime.**Trump**:Trump took a bunch of documents home from the white house. These included dozens of classified documents. This is not in dispute.NARA noticed a bunch of presidential records were missing, such as the letter Trump got from Kim Jong Un and demanded them back. Trump dicked around for a year and then finally returned documents he was legally required to return. During their review of these boxes, NARA found classified documents. They freaked out and called the DOJ. The FBI opened an investigation.The DOJ demanded trump immediately return all classified material as he was not authorized to have it. He dicked around for a couple of months and refused to authorize a search (the way biden did). The DOJ brought together a grand jury and received a subpoena **legally requiring** Trump to turn over all documents marked with classification markings. This means even if he psychically declassified them (which he did not) it doens't matter, the subpoena is for documents with classified markings.Trump did not respond to the subpoena for nearly a month. Eventually he convened with his lawyers and talked about how they should just hide the documents and say they had none. His lawyers adivsed against this. As trump was asking for advice on how to do a crime, this breached the attorney client privilege, which is how we know about this.Trump has his stooge Walt Nauta move the documents to his residence. Trump took some of them and sent the rest back. Trump then sent his lawyer to 'get the documents' and returned a small envelope (double wrapped because they were classified, again defeating the 'I totally declassified them' argument) full of documents to the government.The government knew that Trump had not abided by the subpoena and conducted a search of Mar-a-Lago seizing more than a hundred additional documents.So what is the difference? Intent. Trump had classified material, he did not return it, even in face of a subpoena. He obstructed justice in order to illegally retain documents he was not allowed to have (including nuclear secrets that are covered by statute which he could not have declassified).With Trump the intent is crystal clear. That is why he was charged and Biden was not. Because the charge is **willful retention** not **being a messy fuck**.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"Because it was a partisan bill and the bill Op is discussing was bipartisan.","title":"CMV: Conservatives should be mad at Trump for killing the border bill."},{"text":"Its only been 9 years.

He got more votes, but there was no one else to get any.  you seem to be misinformed- there were other people in those primaries. millions of votes went to those other people. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Results     Lying about his mental state and propping him up as a candidate is subterfuge. Would you be annoyed if you voted for a candidate and later found out they were unfit for the job? Especially after any time their fitness was questioned you were labeled a fascist?  again, what on earth does this have to do with democracy? lying is not antidemocratic. biden's old age was readily apparent. he's the president, it's not like nobody ever saw him. people gave their opinions that his old age, as everyone could freely perceive, wasn't a big deal. you can believe that they were being genuine in those opinions or not (you don't have any evidence that they weren't), but it's not antidemocratic to lie about your opinion regarding observable facts.  \\nalso, i don't think anyone called anyone a fascist for questioning his fitness unless you did so as to argue for Trump as an alternative. and if you did that then yeah, you are a fascist. not antidemocratic to say that (nor would be false accusations of fascism).   The party always appoints the candidate. Thats how the primaries work. Voters pick some delegates and theres some superdelegates but the nominee is chosen by the party at the convention.  yes, if we're going to that level of analysis, that's true. it's also true about every single primary ever, so it's a complete moot point.   Lying about the wellness of a candidate to hand their delegates to someone else at the convention isnt necessarily democratic.  \\nwhat are you even alleging here, exactly? the point of \\"\\"lying\\"\\" about his wellness was to get him elected, not Harris.    It doesnt matter who Biden wants in his place, the people vote. He doesnt get to choose his successor.  uh, yeah, he does and he did. i'm not sure if the delegates were required to listen to him, but he made his views known and they listened. what more democratic way to decide the successor other than to listen to the man chosen by the voters to be their representative? i'm guessing you'll say \\"have another primary\\", but there was absolutely no time. either that or \\"open convention where the delegates vote freely\\", which would be less democratic, nobody voted for the delegates as their representative, they voted for Joe Biden as their representative.   You are oblivious if you dont know Trump is going to focus on illegal immigration and the border, that hes looking to get rid of bureaucrats in the DOGE initiative, and hes going to take a more US-centric foreign policy especially toward conflicts in Ukraine or Israel.  those aren't policies. the fact that that's as specific as you can get proves my point.   Your last paragraphs are exactly what makes the democrats look bad. They cant point to their own records. Its all histrionics about Trump being trillions of times worse and other nonsense.

Poverty stricken African American trying to make a buck? Sorry, dirty drug addict, 30 years in a cage, no parole.Joe Bidens son, smoking 100s of thousand worth of crack, breaking federal law by lying on a gun form and evading millions in taxes? 11 year blanket pardon! No repercussion, he just fell victim to addiction, dont you have a family member with addiction problems? Cmon give the kid a break.Do you think it might be possible that Joe Biden had a change of heart in the three decades since that bill? [In 2020](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/521326-biden-says-1994-crime-bill-was-a-mistake-during-abc-town-hall/) he admitted as much, saying that the crime bill was a mistake.Isn't this exactly what you'd want to see a person do? They get information that a policy they supported is bad and they revise their stance on said policy?As for the specifics of Hunter Biden, keep in mind some important facts.1. Hunter didn't evade taxes, he failed to report and pay them. This sounds the same, but it isn't. Evasion is when you attempt to hide income. What Hunter did was be a crackhead who didn't pay his taxes. Then, when confronted, he paid his taxes. This is almost never punishable, as seen by Steve Bannon doing the same thing and not even facing charges.2. No one is ever arrested for videos of them smoking crack. The crime is possession, and by the time the videos were leaked about Biden he was already in rehab. 3. The gun charge in question is *never* charged by itself. It is only ever charged in connection with violent felonies. Something like 20 million americans have violated that exact same law.With all three in mind it is easy to see that the charges against Hunter Biden were political in nature, Republicans tried to hurt biden politically by harassing his sone through the legal system. That is fucked up and the exact reason the pardon exists.Issue with point 1: Ill caveat with if I was in Bidens position, theres no scenario in the universe where Im not getting my son out of prison time if I have the power and ability to do so. But they couldnt even do this right. Had they just been honest from the start, sure partisan right wingers would bitch moan but deep down wed know they understand. But lying for months that there is no pardon, we respect the justice system and sending out all the messengers, congressmen/senators, news anchors to harp on the fact oh look at this, such a contrast between Biden and Trump, Biden respects the rule of law All these news anchors look like absolute fools twisting themselves into pretzels to justify lying for months.For what it is worth, I genuinely believed that Biden meant it when he said it in June, because I think he assumed that America had moral decency and wouldn't re-elect trump.The simple reality is that Biden is staring down the barrel of leaving this world with his last remaining son in the crosshairs of a sociopath. Trump et al have bene explicit that they intended to target Hunter for further charges when they come into office as retribution for charges against Trump. When Biden said \\"I will not pardon my son\\" I think he meant it. But seeing a man literally threatening your son? Nah.And the kicker, the party of democracy, threw out 14 million primary votes and appointed there candidate by having Nancy pelosi and a few rich donors decide in a back room behind closed doors. No open primary, no voice for us democrats primary voters, essentially shut up, youll vote for who we tell you who to vote for, what are you gonna do, vote for trump?!You realize that by the point Biden dropped out the mechanism for replacing him was to hold an internal party vote. You can't rerun a massive primary weeks away from the convention, so your options are to hold a vote on the convention floor, or hold one in advance.They did the latter. The democratic party delegates voted for Kamala Harris, which is exactly what would have happened at the convention weeks later. It just would have wasted a lot of time that she could have been campaigning.Literally the same thing would have happened had Biden been struck by lightening.

I say this because you went from Hillary and Bernie to Trump, so its a bit confusing. Nevertheless, I do want to address some of your points here because I think you might be a little biased as a recent Trump supporter. With regards to your first point that no ones above the law, This is not limited to a Democratic talking point. This was also a major GOP talking point up until the 2024 election when they had to pull it back for obvious reasons. If you remember, this was a major Republican talking point back in 2016 when the GOP tried to convince everyone that Hillary had broken the law with the storing of her emails and should be prosecuted. Of course we know that these accusations vanished after she lost the election, and President Trump and Republicans did not even bother try to pass an actual law that would have made storing classified emails on a private server a crime moving forward. With regards to the pardon of Bidens son, I agree with you that there shouldve been more transparency there. However, it wasnt until this summer that Biden would have known whether or not he needed to pardon his son. Remember, most people arent prosecuted on the gun charges that were brought against Hunter Biden, and of those who are, they dont typically get prison time. Similar for the tax issues. In fact, there was a plea deal for the tax issues that was overturned because the Republicans cried foul. (Lets not forget that Trump has now been convicted on tax fraud. And hell likely get away with it.) I truly believe that if Hunter Biden was not going to get prison time, his father would not have pardoned him. However, given the fact that he has been prosecuted in an attempt to hurt his father, I do think Biden had to pardon him. Obviously, when this decision was made this summer, Biden could not share his plans without her ruining the Democrats chances in the election. I think its disingenuous to say that the Republicans wouldve just moaned and grounded, but would eventually understand. They wouldve started a circus and tried to impeach Biden and wasted taxpayer dollars in an effort to paint him as a crook.Your point number two is more concerning to me. The United States is supposed to be a democracy. It shouldnt just be one party who is the party of democracy. So, if you believe that the Democrats are supposed to be the party of democracy then why would you support the Republicans at all? At the time Biden dropped out of the election. There was not enough time to have another primary so what would your solution be? Kamala was on the ticket that won the primary. No other candidate would have been. Additionally, RFK is not a Democrat. Hes a libertarian, which is closer on the political spectrum to the Republican Party.  Its disingenuous to say that RFK was locked out of the democratic primary. Neither he or your other mentioned candidate would have won. The only people complaining about the switch are Republicans who have no dog in this fight.","title":"CMV: The actions of the democrats over the last 4-6 years, up against the rhetoric makes me question if I can ever vote/support a democrat again."},{"text":"exactly, he hasnt even been subtle about it, all of his favorite world leaders are in BRICS and his efficiency department is called DOGE sooo yeah","title":"As red flags go there can be few more glaring than Trumps crypto plans"},{"text":"Should levy huge import tax on Honduran cigars to the US","title":"Honduras suggests ending US military cooperation over Trump mass deportation threat"},{"text":"George Washington had his troops inoculated against smallpox, so Jenner must clearly be made part of the curriculum!","title":"Classical education thrives in DeSantis Florida"},{"text":"Didnt they endorse Trump?","title":"CMV: Conservatives should be mad at Trump for killing the border bill."},{"text":"What far left policies terrify you?   \\n  \\nIt's going to get thrown out because he was elected President.

Biden pardoning his son is understandable given the circumstances and I think everyone understands that on some human level. It doesnt make the entire party not believe that no one is above the law. Similarly Joe Biden dropping out when he did necessitated a quick search for a new presidential candidate in an unprecedented way. The logistical impossibility of holding another primary before the convention, the lack of challengers who emerged (both then and during the primary) is pretty typical political maneuvering. Of course ideally there would have been more input before the convention but the fact is Kamala Harris was the natural choice as a successor candidate. In the primaries Dean Philips and RFK barely made a mark in Bidens numbers and Harris as VP was on the ticket as well so arguably democratic voters chose her as well.The summary of your complaints is that Biden, not the democrats, failed. It was Biden that undermined his previous commitments on pardoning his son, it was Biden who refused to step aside when he should have and only did so at the last minute when it was apparent that hed almost certainly lose the election.

I can easily change your view, Or rather argument against it. Too begin with. viewing things as white country or non white is dumb as it does not adhere to any real concept. I dont know about the rest of the world, but North America, Europe and South America all have had different forms of racism to begin with.  And today's racism is a product of our history of colonization, that also makes racism very diverse and different across the board. Here in the south for example, racism served to establish social class and what you could do/achieve in your existence, it was broad and had several different classes for all types, including whites, which is why, once independence came, the hate for anything to do with monarchy, turned racism into a political binary of \\"in favor or against\\" european monarchy rather than skin color, so it became more about discriminating classes or really anyone from this continent, as less than anyone from europe. And as years pass by, today, really the only racism you see is out of cringe or ignorance, desires to be superior or stupidity, but no real actual cultural racism, except maybe in remote places where anything can happen. What we have truly is class discrimination, still in the same \\"less than\\". Now, the fact you establish things as white - non white, already speaks volumes as to how different racism is in the north. And the reason for that is that in your colonization history, racism was always used politically to drive opinion and diversion. Racism is ultimately a symptom of discrimination and not really a thing on its own, usually used by powers to drive purpose, culture, war etc.  \\nAnd that is why racism falls in logic rather quickly. It is used to rule, and the biggest pusher of the racism you speak of is nothing more but the fault of the same one calling racism. Its the north Americans and its ruling class that keep pouring money to influence racism into your culture while at the same time mixing all of you. Its all about control. If your media, politicians, etc, today,.. stop making everything about race. racism will die with that generation. But there is no sign of that ever happening.

These traits are adaptations that promote social cohesion and survival, but calling them moral is where Id push back. What we call morality is a human construction layered on top of these instinctsan interpretive framework we create to make sense of and organize our behavior and values.Babies displaying preferences for helpers over hinderers or chimps sharing food illustrate innate social tendencies, but interpreting those tendencies as moral requires a framework we impose as humans. While these behaviors are natural, they do not inherently carry moral weight until we assign it to them. Morality, as humans understand and debate it, involves reasoning, justification, and norms that are culturally, historically, and contextually shaped.The variations in moral systems across cultures dont just elaborate on deep moral foundations; they reflect the ways societies construct values and rules based on their unique circumstances. While basic instincts like harm aversion or fairness might be shared, the principles and systems we build around themwhether religious commandments, philosophical ethics, or legal codesare inventions. These constructions give meaning and structure to our instincts, but they are not the instincts themselves.Your point about laws reinforces my position. Laws do formalize certain instincts, but they also regulate behaviors in ways instincts alone never could. Laws are a deliberate construction to resolve conflicts and ensure cooperation at scales far beyond what instinctual behaviors evolved to handle. Similarly, moral systems are tools humans have created to address the complexities of life in large, interconnected societies.In summary, morality is rooted in human nature but not reducible to it. Its a construct that evolves and adapts to serve our social and psychological needs, building on, but distinct from, our biological foundations.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"I mean, you can find verses that support the exact opposite sentiment: Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.

I see it every day in this sub.??There is often a sense that our current politics is deeply unique while often looking back can get us to better understand our current era and see how maybe it isnt too unique.I mean, it is also possible for this to be true. I cant think of a single political/party implosion like this in Canadian political history. No pundit, analyst, journalist or political scientist Ive seen on CBC or CTV have been able to either. Here are some reasons why this is so unprecedented:?1. As I said in another comment, Chretiens approval rating was at -3 before he resigned. Harper was at -4 eight weeks before he lost the 2015 Election. Trudeau is at **-52.** I cant reasonably think of a more unpopular leader in Canadian history. For reference, his approval rating is 19% lower than George W. Bush in the 2008 Election.?2. It looks like the Liberal National Caucus is about to demand the immediate resignation of Justin Trudeau. That would require the party arrange for the Governor General to appoint an interim leader of the LPC to become the Prime Minister. That has never once happened before. Leaders always stay on in a caretaker role and allow a proper leadership race to replace them. If that doesnt happen, it will be a first in Canadian history.?3. AFAIK, if the LPC do not elect to hold a leadership race and appoint someone else, it will also be the first time they appoint a permanent leader without a proper convention/race.?4. The 2019 and 2021 Elections featured the Liberals making history for the wrong reasons. In 2019, the Liberals became the first ever party to lose the popular vote and win the subsequent election following a first-term majority. If they had lost the election outright, they would be the second party to lose following a first-term majority since RB Bennett failed to intervene in the Great Depression. In 2021, the Liberal Party set a record by forming a minority government with the lowest share of the popular vote in Canadian history.?5. There have been three elections in Canadian history where the governing party did not even achieve 35% of the national vote. Macdonald in 1867, Trudeau in 2019, and Trudeau in 2021.?6. The Liberals are currently poised to finish 3rd. Like you said, this happened in 2011. But it **only** happened in 2011. The second time isnt exactly a trend, its still an anomaly.?","title":"Freeland, Carney seen as best Liberal to deal with Trump"},{"text":"I get this dipshit is deranged but there's like, no way this seed wasn't planted by some oil exec right?

Many have speculated the slumdog scene was a self reference to that film.The thing about western filmmaking is that they generally dont approach filmmaking with a social agenda in mind. Usually a director will find an existing story theyre interested in, like a novel and get the rights to adopt that movie for film. And Slumdog Millionaire was based on a novel written by an Indian.Also, western filmmakers like to explore the darker aspects of humanity. They pioneered the gangster genre, which offended many Italians back in the day. Even a very uplifting movie like Rocky shows the real poverty that existed in Philadelphia in the 1970s. Theyll also turn the lens on their own sins, showing how badly they treated minorities within their America, or overseas (like in their war movies). Watch movies like Mississippi Burning or Full Metal Jacket.Finally, western audiences arent opposed to watching positive films about India if done well.

They thought he was strong, and smart, and that Harris was corrupt and stupid. Because when Trump showed them corruption, they didn't understand it. When Trump said stupid things, they ignored it.

The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report are all based on the writings of Philip K. Dick (1928-1982). So is the television series The Man in the High Castle (about America if the Nazis had won the war). There's been very strong interest in Philip Dick's writings for decades among Gnostic Christians, the spiritual and doctrinal descendants of the early gnostics who were very numerous by the early 100's CE. One can search Philip Dick at the massive website www.gnosis.org or just do a Google search for something like \\"Philip K. Dick gnostic\\". Dick was also interested in gnosticism, and he felt a strong connection to people of that time. [Here](https://www.scribd.com/document/132970427/Notes-Gnostic) is something very brief that Dick wrote about his understanding of 2nd century Christian gnosticism. Gnosis.org has a better, very brief summary of gnosticism [here](http://www.gnosis.org/gnintro.htm).  The bullet points in the last section on [this page](http://www.gnosis.org/whatisgnostic.htm) are also a very quick summary of gnosticism. This sort of thing fascinated Philip K. Dick. The gnostics were absolutely anathema to those who came to call themselves the right-thinkers (orthodox).","title":"How close is the USA to civil war?"},{"text":"Rest in pieces.

But Theres a Problem."},{"text":"The nature of morality is a huge debate in philosophy, you could dedicate your life to reasearching the topic and never reach the end of the literature. Most of the responses here come from a scientific or biological view of how morality can arise, and how that might be a basis for its objectivity. In my opinion, these don't really get to the heart of the philosophical issue because it doesn't actually address the objectivity of morality, but of course it depends on what you mean by objective. In philosophy, the difference in objectivity and subjectivity is generally defined in relation to the dependence on the mind for the truth value of the statement. If I'm questioning the objectivity of the statement \\"The earth is an oblate spheroid\\", I'm asking whether that statement is true regardless of the beliefs of the individual. Now we have scientific processes and principles which help us to gather evidence to support our belief in this claim, but the actual fact of the matter doesn't rely on what we actually think, it's either the case that the earth is an oblate spheroid, it is some other shape, or maybe it doesn't exist at all, so the nature of this fact about the earth is mind-independent and objective (give me some flexibility on the analogy, assume that we all know what we mean when we use that shape and the earth actually is this shape, it's meant more to demonstrate the principle). Now we ask the same question about morality, is the statement \\"Murder is wrong\\" objective? Well the nature of this claim is much more difficult to evaluate, because it's very different to the kinds of physical facts we are happy with calling objective (actually the basis of one of the more famous arguments used against objective morality), that statement is not something we can really investigate in the world because it doesn't refer to some physical fact. If there were no humans in the universe and the statement \\"Murder is wrong\\" is true, then it's objective, that's the question we are asking, is it similar to other non-physical principles, like the fact that 2+2 will always equal 4 regardless of our thoughts. People often make the mistake of using biology to prove that morality is objective because in reality, the nature of biology doesn't say anything about it's objectivity or subjectivity, but it can give us some evidence to support our beliefs in that direction, or even against it.Keeping this in mind, I'll give you a couple of basic rebuttals to the argument you presented here from a philosophical standpoint. \\nYou've suggest that morality is subjective and \\"created\\" by humanity because it seems that each person's morality is different. In essence, we fundamentally disagree on some moral stances and therefore there is no objective fact of the matter, it's entirely subjective. A common response to this argument is to think about how the argument actually works. If you were to generalise, because we are suggesting this argument is effective in telling you about the nature of morality, could it potentially tell you about the nature of other things as well? The generalised argument could be written as follows. Disagreement about X implies that the nature of X is subjective. There is disagreement about X, therefore X is subjective. Does this also work when applied to science, because there is a lot of disagreement in science over the minutiae, even if we agree on some fundamental principles. Some even disagree about those fundamental principles. Does this give us pause to suggest that the facts of the matter about the physical world, such as the shape of the earth, are subjective? I think most people would be right to disagree with that sentiment, and suggest that, even if we have it wrong, there is some underlying truth about the shape of the earth that would be true regardless of what people think. \\nThat is one way to respond to your argument. Another, simpler, way used by some relates to questioning how much we actually disagree on. Outside of people with certain conditions like antisocial personality disorder, I think you would be very hard pressed to find someone who thinks that murder is not wrong, and I'm talking very specifically about murder being defined as the \\"intentional, unjustified killing of another human being\\". People might disagree by what is justified or intentional, but I think the vast majority of people would agree with that principle. Now there are key differences in what we might think is justified, and this is another question about morality but if the vast majority of people agree that \\"murder is wrong\\", can we say that this is evidence for the principle being objective? These two responses kind of negate eachother a bit, but not entirely.This is a pretty long article on moral realism but goes into more detail about the arguments I've mentioned here. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/ \\nIt's long and dense, so it might be a bit of a challenge to get through but the section on moral disagreement is relevant and they have good articles in general on terms you might not have come across before. \\nThere are arguments in favour of objective morality but I think these two suffice to respond to your post, at least helping you build out the argument a bit further.","title":"CMV: morality is really subjective and \\"artificially\\" created by humanity."},{"text":"And to inflict pain on people they deem as undesireable.","title":"There is no morality right now: Former Rep.

Such as our intense dislike of Jews. We have at least 3 different derogatory terms for Italiens. We very nearly hated Irish and Scots. The founder of American Conservatism, Orestes Brownson, argued that we should replace our slaves. Be making the dirty Irish, Scots, and Germans wage slaves. They wouldn't be slaves. They would just have to work for so little that they would not be able to do anything else or escape from that requirement. We certainly disliked Germans and the Polish, which we determined all eastern Europeans to be. As much as race and ethnicity, religion also plays as much a driver of a person's hatred of someone else. After all, the current Supreme Court is in the legalizing phase of institutionalizing fascism and a theocratic state. I don't  know  one else that is any more racist than us in the United States. As we are currently under the thumb of Conservatives, who are so racist that they are returning the country back to the Jim Crow era. Other than native North American Indians. The only ones that I know hate each other. Are the Cheyenne and Arapaho. I know very few  people who are not racist. Whether it's based on actual race or ethnicity.","title":"CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries"},{"text":"But they do need the appearance of legitimacy.

Yes, in one day we saw more than double the early in-person turnout from the start of the day.That only happens if lots of people are volunteering and getting the word out that people need to vote early, not on Tuesday.  So thank you all!Overall, we've seen 8,416 early in-person voters, and 4,592 mail ballots have been accepted, for 13,008 votes to date.  More mail ballots could arrive (there are 7,220 outstanding), and under Virginia law they can arrive as late as Friday and be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day.  At this point I'd go drop your ballot off in person (instructions are on the absentee ballot, or go to your county Registrar's office).

While there are many agnostics who call themselves atheist and do fit your claim,  there are also plenty of strong atheists who absolutely make the claim that there is no god. Dawkins discussed this when going over his scale: **Strong theist:** 100% probability of God**De facto theist:** Very high probability, but short of 100%**Leaning towards theism:** Higher than 50%, but not very high**Completely impartial:** Exactly 50%**Leaning towards atheism:** Lower than 50%, but not very low**De facto atheist:** Very low probability, but short of zero**Strong atheist:** \\"I know there is no God\\"The only reason I don't like his scale is because he appropriates agnosticism into atheism when agnosticism was specifically designed to contrast with both atheism and theism as specifically the category of  non-belief. Dawkins considers himself a de-facto atheist. Which should let you know that the term atheist is supposed to be the belief that God doesn't exist and not merely the lack of belief. You should perhaps read Huxley's (the creator of agnosticism) own words on why he made agnosticism to distinguish himself from atheists:The Atheist asserts that there is no God, whereas the Agnostic maintains only that he does not know.This isn't something I'm conjuring out of thin air. I support agnosticism as scientific and non-religious. I don't support classical atheism as such. Modern atheism just groups everyone together, and some absolutely do make the claim that God doesn't exist while others are just agnostics swallowed up by the term. But when both Dawkins and Huxley address the faith issue of claiming there is no God, you've got to at least see I'm coming at this from an academic standpoint.","title":"Outraged Republicans blame Tim Walz for satanic display at state Capitol"},{"text":"You bring up a good point.

I saw enough of the debate to say that even if he had the flu, as claimed, at the very minimum it says that I wouldnt bet on 4 more years.For standard gaffes, every person who spends as much time in front of cameras as our modern national politicians does can be made to look insane because everyone misspeaks occasionally. With enough talking you can cut things together to look terrible. So those things didnt bother me too much.The question was where he is between the two.From what I gather, his issues seem to be consistent with primarily age related decline. Trumps possibly more cognitive issues showing up in different ways.Sweet thats your opinion which some may agree with some may not. My point is that if hes clearly in cognitive decline than he shouldnt be President of the United States. However saying Trumps possibly (has) more cognitive issues showing in different ways is tangibly not true, and this statement is a nothing-burger anyway since my original point has nothing to do with Trump. I am in no way saying Trump good, Biden bad or agreeing with Trumps policy, Im saying its rather odd that most people would agree that Biden is not fit to be President, which is why he chose not to run again. Your argument is that he is fit right now to be president, but he wont be in a few years, which is why he stepped down my argument is he is not fit right now, which is why he didnt run again, and its rather odd that he is still president given how unfit he is mentally for the job. We have different opinions/perspective on his current capabilities, so we can agree to disagree on this. Then you said:Drones arent illegal just for flying around. If they are in restricted air space they would be. The military and/or law enforcement arent going to just go shooting down drones just for flying around. What goes up must come down, and you can imagine the repercussions of a big drone comes down or the ordinance comes down and ends up killing people or destroying homes, etc etc.For the ones in Europe that were violating airspace around US airbases, amp that up tenfold given how much damage the US has done to their reputation over the last decade.Given that so many of the video clips people have posted claiming to be drones turn out to be  planes, or sometimes just stars, it is pretty clear that a lot of it is overblown. You know that a lot of it is that some drone owners saw reports about people freaking out about drones and thought it would be fun to do a bit of night flying for their neighbors.Could there be some nefarious reason for people to be flying drones around with the intent of being seen?  Sure. But as they havent appeared to do anything, flying with all their lights on is a poor way to do anything like spying or gathering intel. So possibly some group trying to rile up the rubes.I have no idea who Steve Greer is, but showing off by blatantly flying drones around random areas seems like the opposite of what some secretive shadow government would want to do.Just out of curiosity, what makes this obviously a government project, and what would be the purpose?If you actually think that the drones flying around in New Jersey, spraying the air, shooting the ground, are just random drones which the government doesnt know where they came from but knows they arent a threat then I dont really know how to have a conversation about this subject, because I dont even know how to comprehend how someone could think like that, meaning I dont even know how to put myself in your shoes. Its insanely obvious the government knows what these drones are, they just arent telling the public. Like you cant honestly think they would just allow unknown drones invade New Jersey, spray the air with an unknown substance, and practice shooting drills? If you honestly think these drones are random and not government/deep-state related than I dont even know how to have a conversation about this subject because I cant put myself in the mindset of someone who would (without lying) come to that conclusion, and if you are lying than I dont know what your purpose is, to try to steer the subject in a certain direction? Anyways my bad if I sound condescending or rude but If you think these drones are random peoples drones when they are massive and spraying chemicals/doing shooting drills and the government is just looking the other way like we dont know what they are spraying or what they are shooting but we know its friendly Im sorry but you obviously have a way different perspective of what the government is compared to me so we are just on a completely different page. As far as what would be the purpose of the government drones there could be a million different purposes they could be testing out new technology, they could be using it as a scare tactic to pass new oppressive drone legislation, they could be practicing for future attacks, they could be spraying bio-weapons to start the next pandemic (I.E. toxic fog). Theres a million reasons for why they are doing what theyre doing. Governments have their own esoteric agendas, I.E. HAARP, cloud seeding, MK Ultra, operation sea-spray, DUMBs, etc.","title":"Due to Bidens age and mental decline, he was unfit to run for president.

It baffles me too.Its a finite resource, literally a non-renewable resource, and yet everyone expects the price to always stay the same or go down. Simple supply and demand economics would dictate that the price should always go up, not even accounting for inflation. By market manipulation and sheer luck, gasoline is one of the few fuels that has enjoyed a relatively stable and affordable price over the past 40 years.With climate change becoming a greater and nearer threat than ever before, gas prices *should* be going up. We, as a society and a world, should be discouraging fossil fuel demand and encouraging the adoption of public transportation and EVs. If anything, most people should be unhappy that gasoline is still relatively affordable. We should be discouraging unnecessary travel, and environmental pollution. In the same vein, we should be giving tax credits to companies who *create* WFH jobs; not giving them tax credits for filling buildings with people who dont even need to be there every day.Voting for anyone or anything to bring down gas prices is like voting for someone to bring back the telegraph or the horse and buggy. Its time has passed, and we should be looking forward to solutions for the future.","title":"Fatal Mistake: Democrats Blame DOJ As Trump Escapes Accountability For Jan. 6 - Merrick Garland wasted a year, Rep.

When I brought up traditional agnosticism, I was distinguishing between the group that claims \\"there is no god\\" vs the group that says \\"I don't believe in God because I haven't seen evidence of god.\\" The former is making a claim that exposes them to the burden of proof requirement while the latter does not. It's why I'm so bothered by atheism trying to include agnosticism.

Problem is, he absolutely did not have the presentational skills to educate the public on it, and break through with selling his agenda/accomplishments. They also didnt build Harris up to be that person, when they absolutely could have throughout those 4 years. Ultimately, I think Bidens hubris is to blame for our loss in 2024, despite being a fan of his job execution. Its a tough pill to swallow.","title":"Kamala Harris swears in Republican Sen.

Trump and Musk have been talking about the Gilded Age recently. The Gilded Age is relevant, but not for the poorly articulated reasons they state. The bloody \\"Gilded Age\\" is relevant now as a new era of robber barons has emerged.Trump's base is aware of Musk's motives and that Musk's a mook and a stooge for Xi Jinping. They're aware that Musk's new grift makes Trump's campaign promises (like jobs and a better standard of living) impossible. House Republicans are already breaking ranks. 38 Republicans voted against the final Continuing Resolution (CR) which passed the House on December 2024 with Democrat support.This in not Musk's show. American labor has lived through earlier cons which resulted in lower pay and a lower standard of living. Remember the?[Homestead Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike). Musk's not as smart or cunning as an Andrew Carnegie, and robber baron era antics have left ugly scars on the collective consciousness of American labor. The brutal lessons learned by labor protect it from lesser iterations on the same theme, like Musk.Elon Musk is peddling the narrative that H-1B visas are a vehicle to attract the best talent from across the globe to work in the United States. We need not listen to Musk's falsehoods we can look to his actions which prove?[Musk has abused the H-1B visa system](https://electrek.co/2024/12/30/tesla-replaced-laid-off-us-workers-with-foreign-workers-using-h-1b-visas-that-musk-want-to-increase/). Tesla workers have said that many employees let go in 2024 layoffs were more senior engineers with higher compensation and they have been replaced with junior engineers from foreign countries at lower pay.

That said, Im not sure if the point youre making is as positive for the Liberals as you suggest.?As an aside, the LPC is as old as Confederation. In the past 100 years, theyve governed for 75. Only **three** elected party leaders have not gone on to become Prime Minister. Two of them are Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff. If the Liberals are in fact due for a walloping at the ballot on a regular basis now, it is a reflection of Harper and Mackays successful attempt to create a right-wing movement that can regularly challenge the Liberals. Its not that the LPC wont eventually get back into power, its that theyre potentially going to be more vulnerable to the CPC on a regular basis than they were in the 20th Century.?The Liberals didnt just fall in 2011 and bounce back in 2015. They were in the wilderness from 2006 to the mere weeks leading up to November 2015.?In 2011, the Liberals fell to 3rd place amidst a shaky CPC majority that was already a 5 year incumbent. Harper didnt even increase his vote share in 2011 by 2%. He got his majority amidst both the Bloc and Liberals totally imploding in a simultaneous phenomenon. They also ran a disastrous candidate with a bad campaign, up against a Harper campaign that was extremely competent and effective against Ignatieff. The Liberals nowadays will have to first displace the Bloc in Quebec in the next 4 years before they can even be a federal contender for government.The Liberals are going into 2025 with Poilievre in supermajority territory of 232 seats. The CPC is polling at 47% according to the latest Nanos poll, which is an absurd number considering Harpers majority of 39%. Its even more outrageous when you consider Mulroney only hit 50%+ of the vote when there were only three viable federal parties. First term majorities also dont lose the subsequent election.Politicians are very aware of that trend. In the months leading up to and following the 2015 Election, senior Conservative politicians all stepped away from federal politics. They knew Mulcair or Trudeau would be around for a while. It took the CPC a long time before they reorganized behind a stable party leader. If Carney wants in, hes looking at 6 years in Opposition if were going off political norms. And 4 of those years will likely not even be in Official Opposition, lacking all the political perks that come with it. Im not sure if thats something he will sign on to.?Its way too early to tell who the next Liberal PM will be.

Because they don't know either way for sure. It's why I support agnosticism as the science based non-religious methodology. I believe Dawkins was considering this when he came up with his own hierarchy of belief that differentiated between the person who claims to know there is no god vs the person who doesn't know for sure but lives as though there is not one. They're not identical,  but taking a firm position in the absence of enough information is indeed faith based. He just called them de facto atheists instead of agnostics.

Every accusation is a confession, every investigation is a \\"witch Hunt,\\" every piece of negative coverage is \\"fake news,\\" every effort to indict or impeach Trump amounts to the \\"weaponization of the justice system,\\" every election loss is \\"rigged,\\" every criticism is unfair, every attempt to hold Trump accountable equates to \\"persecution.\\"Trump is *always* the victim, and *always* the winner, no matter the circumstances.The party of personal responsibility can't seem to take responsibility for a damn thing.There's a demonstrative double standard at play here. You may or may not be surprised to know how often Trump, his allies and co-conspirators have lied or attempted to obstruct justice during investigations over the last eight years.Donald Trump has been evading justice and threatening to sue his critics throughout his entire life. He's continuously exploited his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system and avoid being incriminated. In January 2023, a federal judge fined Trump and his attorney nearly $1 million, characterizing him as \\"a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries\\"This has always been Trump's M.O. He continuously threatens to jail his political opponents, and is, even now, currently issuing threats to multiple media outlets and reporters.Then there's this: In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) commissioned a report to highlight Trump's excess litigation, entitled \\"Donald J. Trump is a Libel Bully but also a Libel Loser\\", but initially declined to publish it fearing being sued by TrumpIt also might not surprise you to know that Donald Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which included financial crimes, multi-million dollar real estate disputes, tax and state law violations, dishonest business practices and defamation suits. Showcasing his penchant for corruption, fraud and vindictiveness.He is a serial fraud and cheater. He cheats on his wives, on his taxes, he cheats at golf and constantly lies about his wealth.He has persistently screwed over small businesses, patrons, staff, and financial partners who have had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor, often leveraging their money to make bankruptcy and unsustainable debts work for *him*.Don't forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.And don't forget the time Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes. It was later forced to shutter its doors under court supervision.Then there's Trump University.In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University.Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.There was also a class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims failed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against a student who made her experiences at the \\"university\\" public. Trump was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and costs. He was found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.Trump equates accountability with persecution because he's spent his entire life exploiting his own wealth and privilege to evade being held responsible for his crimes.On more than one occasion, Trump has eluded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a DOJ and Supreme Court that he packed with kowtowing loyalists.Don't forget the indictments related to his negligent and nefarious mishandling of classified documents after misleading the National Archives and the DOJ for over a year.Or the fact that he's been accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women, including one of his own ex wives.Or how he has indicated that he will disregard the constitution to achieve his goals.And of course, there's his most recent indictments related to his efforts to conspire to overturn the last election. Including his attempts to defraud the country, disenfranchise millions of Americans, install loyalists into DOJ positions to help *him* steal the election, and his efforts to intimidate election officials into manipulating the vote for him. Not to mention the dozens of empty lawsuits filed by Trump's team that were meant to disrupt the transfer of power.For Donald Trump, life is a zero sum game and he is always the winner.Which is why every investigation, indictment, impeachment or conviction is an act of injustice.Yet, the MAGA crowd remains silent about this hypocrisy or they drum up whatever rationalization imaginable to defend this corruption. What's worse, they then try desperately to make the criminals out to be the victims.But God have mercy if Joe Biden, or any Democrat for that matter, is even rumored to have erred. Republicans expect to be handed a hall pass. They demand immunities, empowered by the fact that so much of their misconduct has become practically legitimized as of late.And more and more, Republicans are saying the quiet part out loud, that only *they* are entitled to the god given rights and freedoms afforded to them, that only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities.So of course Trump and his supporters cry often and loudly that Democrats are persecuting *them*, that Democrats are \\"weaponizing the justice system\\" against *them*.But in reality, Republicans have been the ones targeting their opponents with needless, politically motivated investigations. It's Republicans, and especially Trump, who continuously threaten vengeance against their political opponents.Think about the general tenor of this last election. The bar for Trump and his MAGA allies remained and still remains shockingly low in comparison to the high standards that Americans expect of Democrats.The media and the general public have played a hand in normalizing and sane-washing Trump's criminal behavior and misconduct. His absurdity has magically rendered him benign. He's made so many unconstitutional, unhinged remarks and anti-democratic threats, that many Americans stopped taking him seriously. But Trump is not benign, he's an idiot, yes, but a useful one. And his incompetence, his narcissism, his mental instability and his authoritarian impulses will go unchecked come next term. While his coalition of MAGA loyalists won't hesitate to take advantage of him in order to push their far right agendas and consolidate power for the foreseeable future.","title":"Donald Trump calls for Judge Juan Merchan to be disbarred"},{"text":"The first of many lawyers being disbarred.","title":"Trump calls for New York judge to be disbarred after hush money conviction advances"},{"text":"I personally will never forget, but the people who can do something about it?

TLDR: Were fucked, not doomed imo. Basically, the best that can happen is 1.) They do one big thing that isnt even implemented to the fullest for hot takes on FoxNews. Think the deportations like the Muslim ban. Its going to be literally impossible to deport everyone. Most they can do with a budget and their current staff is put the 1+ million immigrants who were told to go back to their country of origin in detention centers if they cant go back.Thats easy to do legally. Theres too much red tape to do anything beyond it. And yes, they dont follow laws, but they dont follow laws that are loosely defined. 2.) They do tax cuts to the rich. Thing is, they wont get rid of what they want to get rid of because non-MAGA republicans know that if you take everything away from people, bad shit happens. So, theyll do tax cuts by increasing ours and probably slashing budgets to federal agencies and social programs\\n3.) Theres going to be so much infighting, a lot of the bad shit wont happen. Republicans in the government are now witnessing how much power President Musk has and that Trump wont listen to them, he will listen to the oligarchs. Theyre now disposable to him. Why is this good? They may vote against him because they want their paychecks and gifts and their ability to break any law that makes them rich. \\nNow, this is not taking away from anxiety and the destruction of what theyre going to do. But its not over, yet. Lets make a blue wave like after Bush got wrecked.Edit: I will say that this is the almost perfect scenario for all of the worst things to happen.

Toyota themselves doesn't tell them what to do, but the founding members make sure the PAC leadership is aligned with Toyota's general political goals. But that unified block is extremely potent.You can also have unaffiliated spending for your own political causes, and companies CAN spend money on that, as long as its not for a campaign. Like if your company thinks tariffs are bad, you could publish as many commercials as you want, spending billions, about why tariffs are bad, as long as you aren't coordinating with any campaign. (Though, the FEC has not really prosecuted anybody on coordination, it's difficult to prove.)Nothing stops citizens from doing the same thing.

The Indiana GOP has submitted House Bill 1029 to eliminate the open primary system in the state and establish a closed primary system. According to the bill a voter must register with their county clerk their party affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Libertarian) by December 31 of the year before the primary. If a voter has not registered party affiliation by that date, then they are ineligible to cast a ballot in the primary election. This will certainly dampen voter turnout for primary elections, which is already abysmal in Indiana, as voters are used to declaring party affiliation when they receive their ballot on Election Day. Of other concern is the possible discrimination that could occur against voters who affiliate as a Democrat, since the GOP will have public access to party affiliation.House Bill 1029 was introduced in backlash to a push by IN Dems last May in which the IN Dems pushed Democrats and Independents to vote against Mike Braun in the GOP gubernatorial primary. The push was ultimately futile, but attracted the attention of now Gov Braun (R) who has openly vowed to eliminate the open primary system in the state, &amp; has the support in the House leadership to do so.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 4, 2025"},{"text":"Recently, on January 2, 2025, Tesla shares fell 6.2%, the biggest decline on S&amp;P and Nasdaq, after the electric vehicle maker's 2024 vehicle deliveries fell from a year earlier with Q4 figures missing Wall Street's forecasts.

The Supreme Court DID NOT rule that Trump wasn't an Insurrectionist. The Colorado Supreme Court ruling that Trump was an Insurrectionist is still the highest law of the land, Supreme Court did not rule on that.In the same way, nothing prevents a 30 year old for running for President and winning the EC, but it is up to Congress to enforce the 35 Year old age limit for President. The 14th Amendment is no different.Trump was disqualified before the General Election, him running anyways doesn't change that.Letting Trump run anyways was a failure of the Republican National Committee to screen a disqualified candidate, but each party can pick their Candidate however they choose (even flipping a coin to pick the party candidate is legal by Federal Law). If the party picks a disqualified candidate, it is up to Federal Law to correct that.","title":"14th Amendment NOW!! Donald J.

Sure there are some outliers, but that's always the case. These incoming congress and senate members are worse off than years past. But, I'm pulling back my side hobby of news reading and discussions because it's exhausting. There's no getting through some of the people who are saturated with propaganda (my own parents for example). When you ask them or tell them about specific bills passed by the Biden admin, they will either admit that it sounds like good policy, roll their eyes and complain, or both. I just want more people to pay attention for real. But Facebook, tiktok, Instagram, and YouTube are all more \\"real\\" than anything else. We lost the information war and have an ill-educated public. The next few years will be rough as we watch the oligarchical class buy out the US.
