Hand-waving away bad polls is exactly what the Biden campaign did for weeks before he dropped out. Unlike then, though, the polls are largely trending in Harris favor but that amounts to nothing if people dont VOTE. Get out there like Trump is 10 points ahead.","title":"Donald Trump Leading Kamala Harris in Five of Seven Swing States: Poll"},{"text":"https://i.redd.it/079e2wgelsrd1.gif","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"You forgot the /s","title":"Kamala Harris for President | The Vice-President has displayed the basic values and political skills that would enable her to help end, once and for all, a poisonous era defined by Donald Trump."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/6ce43rwblsrd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ca65aba0ad3d54d31afff03d71797f5f2e2eca","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"Yep, that's polarization for you.**Edit:** and also the electoral college","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"And, by all accounts, intends to keep running and owning the company as President, if elected.

Or $37.2 billion in non-weapon support.[How Much U.S. Aid Is Going to Ukraine? | Nine charts illustrate the extraordinary level of support the United States has provided Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders.](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine) ([LB/H/HC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/))A large share of the money in the aid bills is spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. weapons stocks the Pentagon has drawn on during the war. One analysis, by the American Enterprise Institute, found that Ukraine aid is funding defense manufacturing in more than seventy U.S. cities.In other words, of that recently allocated $8 billion to Ukraine the vast majority of it is going back to the US for operations and paying US manufacturing to replace the cash equivalent of the weapons donated. Similarly, the money sent to Israel is typically a loan for Israel to spend on US manufactured weapons, sending that money right back to the states again.However, both of those are drops in the bucket on how much domestic spending was allocated through the bills passed by Democrats:The [America Rescue Plan Act of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021) contained $1.9 trillion in domestic spending. The [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act) added $550 billion in domestic spending. The [Inflation Reduction Act of 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act) added $891 billion in domestic spending. The [CHIPS and Science Act of 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act) added $280 billion in domestic spending specifically for expanding semiconductor manufacturing. According to [Invest.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) $910 billion in private spending has so far been secured for domestic infrastructure.The priority seems overwhelmingly in favor of domestic spending.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $92 Million from the Presidents Investing in America Agenda to Restore and Protect Rivers and Other Aquatic Habitats"},{"text":"Maybe Carter was seen as politically toxic because his presidency was so unpopular and Clinton/Obama didn't want to risk losing support and Carter took that as a slight?","title":"\\"You've been a good friend\\": Biden honors Jimmy Carter ahead of 100th birthday"},{"text":"And the election is still, somehow, a toss up.?","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"Gavin Newsom and Josh Shapiro in shambles too.

A large portion of whom dont integrate. The  italian elections with meloni, french elections, german elections where the afd almost won scholzs hometown by a razor thin margin, swedens recent policy changes toward migrants, and how germany is now enforcing all its borders irrespective of shengen, Austrian elections, the push behind brexit (control migrant flows across the english channel. I know the governments are addicted to cheap labor and this actually got worse. But it played a large part in swaying the public away from the eu.) the weaponizing of migrants on the eastern european border by russia and belarus. The riots in ireland. The relentless and record illegal immigrant crossings at the US border alongside the neverending push by democrats to simply legalize them and keep the flows going. The fact of the matter is the cost of living and ability to own a home in all western countries has been becoming increasingly out of reach for the majority of its own citizens for decades whilst they often see foreigners arriving and immediately receive handouts and help from their own governments whilst they struggle to make ends meet. \\nCitizens have become disenfranchised over their existing governments and believe they no longer serve the public but instead are completely beholden to big corporations and feel they are being replaced by desperate people willing to work for less. And so far right parties are being voted in because its the only option they see of having their voices heard on the issue.

Then you look at the moves where he switched around some people and put them in their positions for about 4 weeks in the Department of defense, before moving them out again... Chris Miller, Ezra cohen Watnick, Kash Patel, etc...I for one was convinced that Trump was going to do something and come back early since the election was stolen.. but he fooled everybody and did NOTHING. Or at least it appears that way...In reality, I'm convinced that the white hats/military who have been working with Trump (he could definitely NEVER do all this on his own), have been acting as \\"The Hidden Hand\\" behind the scenes for over 4 years now. To start, they forced Biden to choose a running mate of one of the most corrupt politicians in American history. And who does he choose for his vp? The person who literally had the worst presidential run in history! The person who is the first to drop out because she got ZERO votes... Somebody who is dumber than Biden is. (How is that even possible?) So they have these two awful candidates running, and oh look, they won against Trump. So then what happens? Against all odds, Biden STAYS in office for his ENTIRE term... Which says a lot in itself. Then the military/white hats force Biden to be the prime candidate to run for president for the democrats in 2024... After all the absolute embarrassing horseshit we saw!?  They put HIM forward! ?? Unbelievable.So then Biden has a debate with Trump, and a look, only after the debate, Biden drops out.. who do they install , when it could've chosen ANYONE...? They install Kamala Harris of all people! They could have had Hillary clinton, Michelle obama, Gavin newsome.. literally anybody but her. And to top it all off, who does she pick for VP? Tim Walz!! Who is that? Nobody knew until she chose him! I find it fascinating that she could have chosen an evil person who people have actually heard of before.. someone who is popular. But they didn't! They 'chose' somebody who's evil, crazy, AND that nobody's ever heard of! ?? How many coincidences before it's statistically impossible? I know Democrats are experts at making the wrong decisions, but even they could NOT have done it this bad if they tried!I'm 100% convinced that their hand is being forced by the military/white hats. ?And do you know what Trump is not saying this time around while he's running for president? He's NOT saying that the election is going to be stolen from him. He said that hundreds of times leading up to it last time.. and what happened? The election got stolen! He's not saying this this time.. Trump knows how this is going to end. I personally think that the military/white hat/space force is going to be watching the election very closely, just like they did in 2020, and 2018... So if they know how many real votes there were and how many were stolen, they shouldn't have any trouble stopping the (digital)  steal this time. And did we really think that Trump is going to create a fifth branch of the military without using it!? Of course not.

Recently the HHS has celebrated a milestone for the organization:[New Data Show Highest Number of Health Center Patients in Nearly 60 Year History of the Program](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/05/new-data-show-highest-number-health-center-patients-nearly-60-year-history-program.html)HRSA-funded health centers are required to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay, and in 2023 more than 90 percent of health center patients had incomes less than 200 percent of the 2023 Federal Poverty Guidelines. Health centers are now serving one in eight children across the country, more than 9.7 million patients in rural areas, over 6.4 million patients who live in or near public housing, and over 1.4 million people experiencing homelessness. Health centers have also expanded their preventive services, screening hundreds of thousands more people for cancer and infectious diseases and caring for patients with substance use disorders.The Biden-Harris Administration has been quietly, but *aggressively*, expanding this organization over the last couple of years because they likely believe this organization offers a path towards free healthcare in the US.

Funding will launch new opioid treatment and recovery services in rural communities, strengthen maternal health care in the South, and help rural hospitals stay open. HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson attended an event yesterday in Wilson, North Carolina, where she discussed the impact of this investment in rural health care.The Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous actions to support rural communities health including by investing in training physicians in rural communities, providing loan repayment to primary care providers in return for practicing in high need rural areas, and supporting health care delivery through rural community health centers.Today, the Administration is taking another series of vital steps to strengthen health care services in rural communities, with an emphasis on key priorities like maternal health, behavioral health, and expanding access to services.  \\n...   \\nMany rural communities face challenges accessing essential health care services. Smaller populations, longer travel distances, and other barriers can make health care services difficult for rural residents to access and hard for facilities like rural hospitals to remain viable.HRSA is the home of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP), which prioritizes improving access to health care for the 61 million people who live in rural communities.Todays announcement includes the following HRSA investments:* **Launching and expanding substance use disorder treatment, recovery, and social support services in rural communities:** HRSA is awarding nearly $54 million over four years to 18 organizations to create new or expand existing access points for treatment and recovery services, support the behavioral health workforce, and collaborate with social services to ensure coordinated care and sustainable impact in rural communities.\\n* **Expanding access to maternal health services in the South:** HRSA is awarding nearly $9 million over four years to five organizations in the Delta region of the South to expand access to and coordinate health care services before, during, and after pregnancy.\\n* **Supporting the viability of rural hospitals:** HRSA is providing nearly $12 million over three years to fund technical assistance to rural hospitals to help them add or expand health care services to meet community need, keep care close to home for their patients, and ultimately improve financial sustainability for these facilities so they can stay open.A link to the list of recipients for this latest round of funding can be found at the end of the press release. Statement from HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra:The Biden-Harris Administration believes health care should be available to everyone regardless of where they live. Thats why we are investing heavily in rural communities, which have historically lacked resources and access to health services said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. The awards announced today support rural hospitals and address acute challenges related to substance use and maternal health.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $75 Million Investment in Rural Health Care | New funding will launch rural substance use disorder treatment services, expand access to maternal health care in the South, help rural hospitals stay open"},{"text":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Israel In?Israel,?marriage?can be performed only under the auspices of the?religious community?to which couples belong, and?inter-faith marriages?performed within the country are not legally recognized.Im happy to see, in your case, this obviously not being 100% enforced.

Wealth is the goal, and so wealth is used (invested) to generate more wealth, ad infinitum.\\nOnce you put this idea at the centre of your definition, the rest of capitalism makes sense: everything is just an investment thats supposed to return more wealth for the investor. Free markets are only good for capitalism until a capitalist can capture a monopoly. A strong economy is irrelevant for capitalism as long as a capitalists stock values are strong.

As the storm continues to track north, President Biden and Vice President Harris remain focused on life-saving and life-sustaining response efforts throughout the Southeast. The President and Vice President are closely monitoring these efforts and are receiving regular briefings, including today, from senior Administration officials, including Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell.Administration officials have been in contact with state and local officials before and during the storm and will continue to coordinate together during recovery efforts. At the Presidents direction, FEMA Administrator Criswell is traveling to Florida this afternoon to assess the damage alongside other state and local officials. Administrator Criswell will also travel to Georgia and North Carolina in the coming days.President Biden and Vice President Harris are praying for those who lost loved ones and for everyone impacted by this storm. Although the storm has weakened, the situation remains extremely dangerous, and the Administration continues to urge residents to heed the warnings of local officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so, as flooding and other hazards may still affect the region.Consistent with the Presidents direction for a robust and well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration has taken swift action to support Hurricane Helene preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Specific actions taken include:*Approved Emergency Declarations Before Landfall** Before Helene made landfall, the Governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina submitted emergency declaration requests that President Biden swiftly approved. These declarations authorized FEMA to provide assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, public health and safety, and fund other emergency response measures. The Federal government proactively pre-positioned personnel and resources across the region before Hurricane Helene made landfall, including power restoration teams for temporary emergency power, search and rescue equipment, meals, water, generators, and equipment to assist communities and states with impacts from the storm.\\n* The Administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services, declared a Public Health Emergency for the states of Florida and Georgia. This gives the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.*Supporting Ongoing Emergency Response Efforts** At the Presidents direction, before Helene made landfall, 1,500 Federal personnel were deployed to the region.\\n* Urban Search and Rescue has deployed a total of 14 teams (940 personnel) to affected states. In Florida, eight teams are positioned to respond, and all are equipped with Swift Water Rescue Capabilities. In Georgia, two teams with water capability have been deployed to support rescue operations. In North Carolina, four teams all equipped with Swift Water Rescue Capabilities are in place. \\n* The U.S. Coast Guard crews will continue to respond with vessels and aircraft to assist search and rescue activities. Approximately 8,000 personnel are working on the Coast Guard response. They will continue to respond to urgent distress calls to save lives and assist those impacted by the storm.\\n* The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has two teams prepositioned to provide temporary emergency power, with additional personnel deployed and other are prepared to deploy if needed. In addition to temporary emergency power, personnel will assist the states with infrastructure assessments, debris management and temporary roofing assistance as needed. They have activated six emergency operation centers in the region to coordinate operations.\\n* The Department of Health and Human Services deployed two Health and Medical Task Forces to assist hospitals and other critical care facilities with any impacts as a result of the storm.\\n* FEMAs Surge Capacity Force is activated, which enables the deployment of additional disaster staff within the Department of Homeland Security and across the Federal interagency to assist in the areas impacted by the hurricane.\\n* The Federal government pre-staged more than 2.7 million meals, 1.6 million liters of water, 50,000 tarps, 10,000 cots, and 20,000 blankets in the region to support sheltering needs in impacted communities.\\n* FEMA pre-positioned tanker trucks with 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 40,000 gallons of gasoline to surge to impacted communities once the storm has passed to help alleviate any fuel shortages.\\n* Prior to the storm, FEMA also helped source hundreds of ambulances to assist with the movement of any patients out of impacted hospitals or other facilities.*Supporting Communities and Infrastructure Following the Storms Impact** The Department of Energys Energy Response Organization is activated and closely monitoring impacts and restoration efforts related to Helene, including power, fuel, and supply chain interruptions.  Via the Electricity Sub-Sector Coordinating Council, the Department also works continuously with electric utilities across the country to strengthen post-storm power restoration efforts.\\n* The Environmental Protection Agency is working closely with Federal, state, local, and Tribal partners to help protect water systems, prepare for debris management, and ensure facilities, including Superfund sites, maintain critical public health and environmental protections. EPA stands ready to mobilize additional staff after the storm passes and as clean up and recovery efforts begin. \\n* The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made information available from the HHS emPOWER program, a partnership between the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, to support public health emergency planning and response activities. The program provides valuable information on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain health care services, such as dialysis, oxygen tanks, or home health care, to help anticipate, plan for, and respond to the needs of at-risk residents in areas impacted by the storm. \\n* The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notified Public Housing Authorities, multifamily, and healthcare facility owners to implement all appropriate protocols to prepare for the storm and ensure the safety of their residents. HUD is and will continue to work with the Public Housing Authorities, multifamily, and healthcare owners and homelessness assistance partners to determine damage impact and resident displacement. HUD will also be developing vacancy lists of HUD-assisted projects that can be used to provide temporary and/or permanent housing to disaster survivors.\\n* The U.S. Department of Agricultures Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services request to provide operational flexibilities in all of the states school lunch programs C which will enhance flexibilities for meal service during unanticipated school closures.\\n* The Department of Commerces National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aerial teams are being deployed to provide valuable observations of impacted communities to understand the scope of the storm damage and to support disaster response by Federal partners. To ensure navigational safety, NOAA experts work around-the-clock after a storm acquiring and processing data to speed the reopening of ports and waterways by verifying water depth and identifying dangers to navigation.\\n* Additional personnel from the Department of Commerces National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human Services are deployed to assist with response and recovery efforts.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administrations Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Response Efforts to Hurricane Helene"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/hueeuyn3csrd1.jpeg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9008fa3055b10a09f6dc852505fcffa0668a298When you get a new iPhone do you just start taking pictures of random shit","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"A twisted uncivil prick who has no idea what proper discourse consists of.","title":"Hateful and harmful: Trump blasted for calling Kamala Harris mentally disabled"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|lq4ZwdXew7fznx4MRZ|downsized)","title":"Jeff Flake Endorses Kamala Harris &amp; Tim Walz"},{"text":"She gave a toddler lever definition of inflation when asked how she was going to combat it.

I wanted to just scream at this person that a) he's poor, b) doesn't own a home (therefore, yes, the 25k would most definitely apply), and c) lives in a state where Democrats are protecting his wife from being arrested should something bad happen with this upcoming ill-advised pregnancy. These people are too stupid to vote FOR their self-interest. I'm long past trying to have rational conversations with them, and I'm just there to play volleyball.

For women, who often survive suicide attempts, these support systems I place have a lot more time to work. For men on the other hand, where they use more final methods, beyond perhaps preventing the first attempt, they can't do anything to help the men who end up succeeding. That's why focusing on the issues that cause men to attempt suicide in the first place is such an important strategy. Since men and women face different issues and struggles in society, a blanket approach is not necessarily the best one.

What comes to mind when I think of specialities of Australia is mostly export. We export education, tourism, physical resources and produces and there isn't much else that I think we particularly excel in.  \\nPerhaps we are famous for medical research? But I don't think that we have a large enough population and excess capital for most to appreciate that fact, or it isn't the technological innovation that is of interest (which might make more money  'what a waste of money')  \\nIt probably feels like to most that it feels like an incredible waste of money because there aren't many obvious, visible results. Also I see no harm in receiving a proportionate amount of international students, as we lack talents and economic flow and spending, the problem is persuading them to stay and settle thus increasing viable amount of talents or encourage talents manpower and (perhaps competition within?) Instead of just cashing in on their education then  students returning back to their country.I feel, that at the heart of this, Australia lacks economic independence and maturity, and despite resources available we cannot digest it internally, and the degree of export to maintaining a balance is mostly the issue. To convince that R&amp;D spending is not a waste of time or disdainful, it would be incredible to see some results; and I think a little arts and culture would be the magic it needs to happen. Why not divert some of that attention on exports? Or do some proper marketing for what we currently have? I don't mean just maintaining pure stats on exporting and shipping off goods according to an agreement. But it also does not need to be entirely new, just packaged nicely with a satin ribbon and shipped off.If you ask most, little is known about Australia's wine except Penfold's. Why not figure some interesting method for others? Things with labels attached work better. Have you ever heard of Hanwoo? It's Korean beef which is on par with some wagyu, but wagyu is simply more famous, and more well documented on than Hanwoo is. Agriculture R&amp;D with nice packaging for Australia would work nicely; the next level for export is usually culture as an added bonus via premium pricing. I think pure STEM is more like the internal workings, and a mix of both generally work better. It doesn't translate well purely STEM focused to public.There's a reason why sparkies make a lot of money. \\"You're a genius! my lights work!\\" Apologies, I don't mean to demean the trade. I just mean that physical examples are much easier to appreciate, which in this case is capital return.Jokes aside, probably a mix and match of these and and a general lack of manpower in each industry to make it happen often enough for innovation. But I don't truly understand academia and I have absolutely zilch to back my point, so this is mostly word vomit of thoughts here. Hope it made sense and maybe helps if just a little.","title":"CMV: A nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem."},{"text":"Dude is a perv.","title":"I help oversee federal elections.

And are also more likely to pay more in child support than the mother would have to.\\nViolent crime against men by women is taken less seriously in the justice system and women often times get lesser sentences than men do for the same crimeI am sympathetic to the title of your post. It is concerning that a recent poll (sorry, I can't find it again) found support for Democrats was lower in early 20s males than late 20s males. This could forbode challenges in the years ahead.However, I find that a common thread among the issues you're concerned about is that they are issues that historically or currently are larger issues for women than men. For example, women are vuctims of intimate partner violence more frequently than men, although both are affected. It's important to advocate for men, who indeed might sometimes be erased from these conversations. However, if you are campaigning to represent all Americans, I think when discussing some of these issues, you would still mention women first and not center men.My theory of why young men are turning against Democrats is that they have economic anxiety. It seems harder and harder to find a job that can sustain the high cost of living without draining everything from you with long, unpredictable hours. As to why men are more anxious about this than women, it could be because heterosexual men perceive their romantic prospects as tied to their professional success. If I were Kamala Harris, I would try to appeal to young men by emphasizing economic policies, such as student loan forgiveness, that would help secure their future. I would tout court reform, which protects your rights as a worker against your corporate employer. I would be wearing a hard hat at a union meeting.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is likely to win the presidential race, but to solidify her chances and beat Trump decisively, she should also focus on issues that resonate with young, white men."},{"text":"sadly true.

If all Jewish people are in control, wheres mine then, why do I have nothing, why does my family have the same and our extended family, if we rule the world, than I want my piece. But I dont have it now nor will I ever, because its not true and one more way for people like yourself to point the blame at instead of the real culprit. Anyways, Im sure you get this anytime you say this weird shit to anyone outside of conspiracy circles and church. You know how people will react to this, it shouldnt be surprising given how balls deep you are in it. Its a creative concept, but its just not true.And every single thing you think are part of some equation that = you are correct, is just not there. And your sources that you link are to the depths of hell themself and nothing near resembling a crumble of anything legitimate.Thats why no one looks at your sources, because they are worse than you when you do this shit.You can keep blaming everyone and thing for the rest of your life as to why evil shit happens, and connect invisible dots, or you can be critical of your own thoughts and feelings and beliefs and when something sounds absolutely bananas with zero fucking proof, you can admit that, adjust your approach, adapt to survive, and actually find out the truth.Im sorry if this sounds rude. I dont want to sound like this. But you sound clinically insane in your post and the dozens of responses after. And I dont normally feel this way, but this is Just not the one you wanna fight for bro. Also, people are fact checking cause so many lies about political topics and not conspiracies are posted here every 5 fucking minutes, and people just straight up dont like being lied to in such a fake bad faith misinformation disrespectful to human brains kind of way.","title":"Know who you're dealing with, Diddy is just the tip of the iceberg!

I think that where possible, that would be theoretically logical: the price you pay for a product should include the costs it imposes on others (and on future generations, though that's very hard to measure).

Or how do you handle the fallout of honest (or otherwise) production of something that -- we find out later -- had enormous costs on vast number of people (and where there may be a significant social cost-benefit debate). Talc? Industrial fertilizers? Use of highly productive GM corn in areas where it contaminates less-productive but more adapted and varied native species (in Mexico, say)?

Only citizens/permanent residents(so no threat of deportation) are allowed to sell.IMO minimum age should be above the standard 18 as well(maybe 21 since that's already also used in the US for alcohol right?). Could have other limits on who can be a sex worker(income? mental illness? IQ?) if you want. And of course information like criminal record etc about buyers would need to be made accessible to sellers.Buying sex outside this system - harsh punishment no matter what.Selling sex outside this system - no punishment for the sex workers themselves, life sentence/execution for others(i.e. helping organize it, like running a brothel for example).Buying sex from unfree/forced(or foreign) sex worker - harsh punishment depending on how obvious it is(but always some punishment). Even if there was no reason to suspect the prostitute was forced you'd get punished(probably with a fine), but would scale to a much higher if you have reason to believe they were. Willingly buying the services of someone it can be proved you know were forced to do it - life imprisonment always.Forcing people to engage in sex work should always be punished to the maximum extent(life sentence/execution).Other stuff: Funding for law enforcement regarding this should be increased.Obviously child prostitution - always execute/life sentence for everyone, except the victim, involved.Rewards for reporting cases of sexual slavery and such.Sex workers are to be immune from discrimination law, a prostitute not accepting certain sexes, ages or even races/ethnicities can never be prosecuted.Probably a lot more details can be added to this, especially how to deal with e.g. physical locations(clubs, brothels or whatever) and the safety and such of people working there.

There are a lot of differences in practice, but a democracy builds support by promoting social, political and economic equality whereas a dictatorship does so by privileging some groups at the expense of others. When a democracy fails to rein in inequality, it will fail. When a dictatorship fails to protect the privileged group either because it can't keep the rest of the population suppressed or because it fails economically, it also falls apart.People implicitly understand this, which is why many people, in the face of authoritarianism, think that it won't impact them because they'll be part of the privileged group. This is especially prevalent among people who already belong to the socioeconomic elite, parts of the middle class, those not part of a minority that might get persecuted by said dictatorship, ... Similarly, being selfish, self-centered or lacking empathy is probably the primary factor that contributes to this sense of exceptionalism.That doesn't mean they agree with someone like Trump taking over, let alone fully on board with the violent rhetoric. It's just that they don't see it as the imminent threat that it definitely is to those who will be targeted. They won't particularly care until it happens to them personally. They may not be reactionaries, but they can live with a reactionary social hierarchy as long as they're not the ones who end up at the bottom of it. To them, authoritarianism is not trying to unravel society or destroy the social contract, but reconstruct it and rewrite it, possibly to their advantage and at the expense of others. Whether people dread, accept or support such a regime, and to what extent, depends on how they stand on that issue. Hence why authoritarian regimes will always have a narrative centered on a continuous fight for survival, because that makes this zero sum game more acceptable, if not heroic.","title":"Will Trump try to end democracy?

Having the upper hand and then winning wars is kind of the story of humanity, as much as it is pessimistic. Islam had the upper hand 1500 years ago when it conquered Judea and Samaria and exiled the Jews. But I don't think discussions about 1500 years ago a really valid in a conflict of today.You can also say that Israel could have conquered even more land, but retreated and gave it back to Egypt, Lebanon, the Palestinians in Gaza/West Bank. So Israel was actually holding back and making concessions. But then again, the being displaced, having family members killed and a new government set up outside of your control is in itself wrong, and the establishment of Israel could have been done is so many better ways.","title":"cmv: There is pretty equal evidence for either side in the Israel/Palestine conflict, from what I have seen, and so 'picking a side' largely comes down to values: Western or Islamic."},{"text":"Anyone heard from Mitt Romney , George W.

My name is Ashley and I work at the Chrysler plant. Like many auto workers, I am deeply concerned about the future of our industry. With many jobs being outsourced as we speak, what action will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?\\nDONALD TRUMP: So, pretty much as weve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to  Look, your business  Years ago in this area, I was honored as the man of the year. It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.\\nIt did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.\\nAnd lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.\\nAnd you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.\\nYou cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?\\nI saw Marsha the other day. Why doesnt she, why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.\\nBut I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.\\nSo were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.\\nAnd it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.\\nAnd you dont worry about it. Heres what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long, go to a job you love, and get a lot of money at the end of the week. You know what the thing is? Vote for Trump. If you vote for Trump, everythings gonna be perfect.\\nSource: https://youtu.be/a1ZsgB1p50E?t=129&amp;si=O2NxdHBjvWhg3uMz","title":"Ex-Obama adviser taunts Trump over Harris mentally disabled comments"},{"text":"Yet if she insults him back, how dare the dems raise the rhetoric.

This allows for optimal allocation of resources at a macro level. After the NEPB skims off what's needed for the collective good (determined by our top economists, of course), the remaining funds are redistributed as personal dividends.But before you cry \\"socialism\\", fear not, for every citizen receives regular rebates and reimbursements, ensuring that you get back every single dollar you deserve, based on your rational lifestyle choices, calculated based on a complex algorithm considering factors such as:* Efficient Consumer Choices: Did you opt for the energy-efficient lightbulb? That's a rebate! Chose public transportation over a private vehicle? That's a rebate!\\n* Land Value and Urbanization: The more densely populated your neighborhood, the bigger your rebate. Live in a 50-story micro-apartment complex? Living in a high-density urban area? Congratulations, you're a friend to efficiency and the environment and not burdening our infrastructure! Enjoy your rebate! Insist on that sprawling suburban mansion? Well, prepare to see your bank account dwindle, you filthy rent-seeker.\\n* Investment Choices: Invested in broad-market index funds instead of unproductive land? Here's a hefty rebate to reward economic growth!.\\n* Carbon Footprint: Ditched your car for a bicycle? Here's a hefty rebate. The smaller your carbon footprint, the bigger your rebate. It's that simple!\\n* Public Services Allocation: Efficiency Auditors ensures that public services like transportation are funded based on the most efficient per capita usage. Live in a walkable neighborhood with high public transit use? Expect top-notch services. Chose to live 50 miles from the nearest town? Well, hope you enjoy long drives over potholes!\\n* Incentivized Innovation: The more efficient and innovative you are, the larger your dividend!This system perfectly balances collective needs with individual incentives. By pooling all resources and then redistributing based on efficiency, we ensure that every citizen has skin in the game of national optimization.And once you receive your dividend, you're free to spend it as you see fit. Whether it's on basic necessities or entrepreneurship, the choice is yours! Choose a less efficient lifestyle? No problem! You're still free to do so, but your dividend will reflect the increased burden on our collective resources.To help citizens maximize their Dividend, a National Lifestyle Optimizer? app would be available. It gamifies your daily choices, offering real-time feedback on how each decision impacts your potential rebates. Watch your \\"Efficiency Score\\" soar as you make approved choices!The beauty of this system is that anyone can be rich... in theory. Sure, you might not be able to buy that yacht or sprawling mansion, but the numbers don't lie C your quality of life is increasing exponentially! The QoL Index proves that you're actually richer than ever!

Since God is of infinite value, one would only satisfy God for that sin if one made a repayment to God of an infinite valueplus a little more for all the trouble. Since descendants of Adam are only finite, they have nothing of infinite value to offer as repayment. Nonetheless, it must be a member of Adams family that offers the repayment; otherwise, humans would not be reconciled directly to God but would rather be beholden to the intermediary who made payment. It is here that the incarnation of Jesus as God comes in. God is the only one of infinite value, so God must Godself make the repayment. But since man (i.e. humans of Adams lineage) owes the repayment, this God must also be a man (i.e. human). Since Jesus is God, his crucifixion constituted an infinite offense committed against him. It was only fair that God granted Jesus an infinite favor in return. Since Jesus is himself God, however, he needed nothing of this favor. Instead, he makes the infinite value of this favor he is owed available to the rest of his family so that they can make repayment for their own sins. Likewise, the devil owes an infinite debt to God due to his sin. But since the devil is not infinite, he would have nothing with which to repay his debt. For his debt to be paid, there would need to be a God-angel. Not only is there no God-angel, but the existence of one would not help anyway. Since angels are not related to each other in a familial way, any God-angel that purportedly offered satisfaction would not be of the same family as the devil. The devil would not be directly reconciled to God since this God-angel would be an intermediary of a different family. Thus the theory goes there is no atonement available to the devil to make forgiveness possible.","title":"Know who you're dealing with, Diddy is just the tip of the iceberg!

But when you look at it, it doesnt make sense for Harris to lean into those issues without setting herself up for failure. The office of the President of the United States is a federal office leading the executive branch. The issues youve called out are state-level issues, court issues etc, and not things that the President really has any authority to unilaterally fix.Custody laws arent federal. Each state has its own laws. Some states have laws that are more favorable to women and others have laws that are geared more towards equality. You also have to take into account that local and state judges often have a decent amount of flexibility when deciding such things. No President can fix that, only local campaigns. Violent crime being taken less seriously is also A) not a federal issue and B) not an executive issue. Its a court issue. Additionally, in many cases its more of a police issue. These are not things that Harris or any candidate can actually address unless you actually want a dictator vs separation of powers. Education is a tricky one. The federal government could possibly have a role there, but its a complex issue that Id argue is more cultural than systemic.

If you study the bible, you discover that this is his main method of operation, to deceive and impersonate Christ, because he wants to sit on Christ's throne and be god. The bible calls Satan Lucifer, or bright morning star in Isaiah 14 in irony, mocking him. Christ is the true Morning Star, as documented in Revelation 22 and also Numbers 24. If you can not discern between the true light and the false light, then you are in bad shape spiritually and need to spend some time learning spiritual truth.","title":"Know who you're dealing with, Diddy is just the tip of the iceberg!

Yes  but these scholars claim he can't pull it off"},{"text":"Sorry, but I disagree with this take.  Elections almost always come down to swing states and undecided or middle of the road voters who aren't really attached to either side.Ignoring those voters in an effort not to potentially upset your base, those potential supporters are either going to not vote at all or vote for/support the other candidate if they show them attention or address issues that matter to those potential voters.Most voters who already have their minds made up are generally already going to be firmly set in who they are going to vote for, it's more about just making sure they get out to vote at this point.Left leaning Democrats aren't going to suddenly decide to support Trump and MAGA Republicans aren't going to suddenly show support for Harris, regardless of what happens from now until election day.  Their minds are made up, it's really more about making sure they just go out and vote at this point.But unlike most other elections in the past, I don't believe this is as much of an issue as it generally would be for the Democratic party, due to the extreme polarization of Trump.  Most Democrats view Trump as an existential threat and will vote against him regardless of how they feel about Harris as a candidate.  For many people it's less about electing Kamala Harris but more important to simply keep Trump from getting elected again.Those undecided voters represent a significant portion of the voting base and are who will most likely ultimately decide the election.It would be foolish to simply ignore them because you put too much focus on catering to your base that already firmly supports you.  If Trump caters to these voters and shows interest or concern in the issues they care about, even if they don't like or care for him, they are more likely to end up voting for him, even if they don't personally support him.  Simply because those are the issues that matter to them and at least he addressed and showed interest in those specific issues.I think this is exactly the problem that Hillary had in 2016 and why she ultimately lost.  She essentially ignored a huge block of potential voters in order to focus on a base that she already had massive support from.  Those undecided voters felt left out and eventually turned to the candidate that they might not have been a fan or supporter of, but they at least felt he showed interest or concern for the issues that mattered to them.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is likely to win the presidential race, but to solidify her chances and beat Trump decisively, she should also focus on issues that resonate with young, white men."},{"text":"Something be swinging...back and forth back and forth.

I agree that one of them is extremely significant and should be addressed: there is indeed an education gap between young men vs women.The other issues you list are worth paying attention to, absolutely -- but not at the presidential level, because they're dwarfed by other, related issues. For example: men tend to pay more in child support and are less likely to receive custody, sure. But there's a reason for that: women overwhelmingly tend to spend much more time on childcare. Of course, there are cases of a father who spends much more time on childcare yet doesn't receive custody, but statistically that's not the most common reason.Likewise, there aren't scholarships targeting white men... because white men aren't a historically disadvantaged group! Whereas even today, young black people are vastly underrepresented at top schools, etc.I do agree that Kamala Harris could mention these issues to try to curry favor with white male voters, even if they're not critical priorities for her. There are tradeoffs to doing that sort of thing: 1. Pushing them while campaigning leads to a risk of backlash if she doesn't actually prioritize them once in office.2. Pushing them while campaigning sends a signal to progressives that she thinks they're critical, perhaps more critical than the other issues I mentioned. This could lose her support from those most likely to support her.3. She has a very limited time to craft her message and get it across to voters (she only just started campaigning!), and topics like this present a political minefield (see #1 and #2). It may not be worth it to her to spend the time figuring out how to push them, rather than spending that time in other ways.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is likely to win the presidential race, but to solidify her chances and beat Trump decisively, she should also focus on issues that resonate with young, white men."},{"text":"Vote blue stop the stupidity.","title":"Will Trump try to end democracy?

After nearly a decade of litigation, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled a federal law prevented the state from requiring proof of citizenship to vote for president and other federal offices.To comply, the state adopted a unique, dual-registration system. Those who provide citizenship documents receive full ballots that include local, state and federal races. Those who do not receive ballots with only races for federal offices.This month, Maricopa County officials discovered a longtime legal resident who is not a citizen had been improperly shown in electronic systems as having provided citizenship documents. He had not voted, but his appearance on the voter rolls sent election officials scrambling for answers. Fontess office found tens of thousands of others had been marked as eligible to receive full ballots even though there was no record of them having provided citizenship documents.Now the three Democrats discussed what to do. State law didnt allow the state to provide these voters with full ballots but federal law bars states from making wholesale changes to their voter registration lists fewer than 90 days before an election, Fontes said on the call.","title":"On private call, Arizonas top Democrats debated a dire ballot dilemma"},{"text":"No, I still think it would be beneficial for harris to campaign on young mens rights.

Trump *mostly* attacks illegal immigrants (though the recent Haiti stuff shows he does also attack legal immigrants). The idea is probably that they assume Trump will only try to deport the illegal immigrants, and that the legal immigrants who can vote will be fine. Also some of these Latino voters (a large chunk of them, really) aren't immigrants at all, so it can be easier for them to hold anti immigrant views. Also a decent amount of them are Cuban or Venezuelan, and tend to be pretty anti communist/socialist, and might have a weird complex where they assume that the more recent Cuban/Venezuelan refugees are folks who contributed to the rise of socialism and are only leaving now that it has become a total disaster, and thus they should be kept out while they themselves (the ones who came earlier) are the ones who deserve to stick aroundNone of these are particularly good reasons to be anti immigrant or pro Trump but it makes more sense than them actually consciously assuming they will be deported. And to be clear it's far from certain that the GOP do want to get rid of all immigrants or all Latinos/Hispanics. One of the things with the modern right wing is that they are actually more racially diverse than ever before, which still isn't that racially diverse but there has been a rise in it, largely because they've become more accepting of anyone who hates feminism, trans people/LGBT, and illegal immigrants, even if they are nonwhite, at least as long as they aren't an asylum seeker","title":"Poll: Democrats' advantage with Latino voters continues to shrink"},{"text":"But why is that the case.

I don't expect the average American to be capable of picking crops and we don't have much vocational training for other aspects of working a farm that pay better. By and large we need training programs for some jobs and not large numbers of low to semi skilled individuals and their families. Many high schools don't even have woodshop or light construction training. If we're short on construction workers then bring that back as well as paid training for others willing to transition. There is a shortage across the board in the trades, there's a massive shortage of skilled laborFor the last 5-10 years the line has been learn to code and get a six figure job in tech. Prior to that there was a huge push to go to college. Now we're seeing a shift back to encouraging people to learn a trade. That shortage will likely be filled over the next 5-10 years. It's also worth noting that many trades in the US require knowledge of codes and standards. Foreign workers coming in have to learn those as well so immigration doesn't fix the trade shortage.   \\nit's laughable actually, \\"conservative\\" policies as you say of cutting of migration will lead to nothing but stagnation and endless recession as economic growth slows to a trickleThis is only true if we believe everyone who can work is working and working at a job that pays them the most. Targeted immigration that brings in people to offset the workforce or take on certain sectors like crop picking helps to boost the economy. Bringing in large numbers of immigrants without considering where and if they'll work does not boost the economy. Also allowing things like unaccompanied minors and pregnant women doesn't boost the economy.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"All of that would be nice if Georgia was actually blue.

They have skills that we need that we don't have. That's the entire point of the program. You're literally describing a skill issue.This is untrue. I've known people who have trained their replacement who it turned out was an H1B worker or who would immigrate on an H1B in the next few years. The intent of the program isn't how the visas are largely used, especially in tech. Do you really think creating apis using Java is a specialized skill? It's not but we have H1B workers who do that as their job. I can tell you that in my experience and the experience of many others, a lot of H1B workers aren't more skilled than natives and it's not uncommon to find people on an H1B who have no specialized skills.The main exception I've seen is when someone came from an offshore team where a competency had moved there. For example, a company I worked for hired a guy because 10 years prior another company had moved all positions related to a piece of software off shore. So in that case there was a lack of native talent.And we don't really have to take care of their children like we do native citizens, unless they're born here, which would make them native citizens.This is only partially true. All kids in the US, regardless of immigration status, have a right to attend public schools and they have a right to be seen at any public hospital. I'm not calling that a bad thing but it does have a cost. They also qualify for poverty programs that aren't seen as \\"welfare\\". On the school front, especially in some areas, one huge complaint has been the additional resources for ESL and additional programs for large immigrant populations who are behind. Not saying it's bad, but when you have limited resources giving more to one group often means taking from another.It's not like we're stealing people from these developing countries is and it's not like those countries are going to become thriving economic powerhouses should we start restricting immigration.?This is untrue. I can dig for it if you really need, but there are examples of how restricting the flow of immigrants to the US an instead investing in their communities helps. I'll also mention that while now we see tons of immigrants from Central America, there was a point where we had large numbers of Mexican immigrants. The economy in Mexico has improved and many people who would have previously done whatever to come to the US stay there. While some are fleeing crime, violence...many when interviewed by journalist list wanting a better life economically. So if you improve the economy in their home countries then there is less reason for them to leave. And if you care about people then what do you say to the least of us? What do you say to people who feel they're losing their jobs, homes...? What do you say to parents who feel their kids are getting less help at school? Do you really just say those are Trump talking points? Do you show them stats about the country as a whole with no regard for their local area? I'm all about being compassionate which is why I think developed countries need immigration policies that focus more on temporary workers and upskilling natives than freedom of movement from the less developed world.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"Candace Owens is the one who really did a number on her though.","title":"Why Republican attacks on Kamala Harris family keep falling flat - Democrats are defending true family values"},{"text":"US politicsIts like a Laurel &amp; Hardy sketch equally chaotic but not even remotely as funny","title":"I help oversee federal elections.

In principle, patents are meant to have a time limit in most cases. In the pharmaceutical industry for example, which you raised, a drug formula is only rendered protected from replication for a limited number of years. Once that time frame elapses, other companies can produce the same chemical formula and sell it under a generic brand name, driving down the cost over time the patent only exists to guarantee a certain amount of profit to the developer so as to encourage the expenditures in research and development.Copyright and trademark however function differently. They include things like the actual product name or the specific product or design itself. It's comparable to the ability of an author to profit from their book and not have another publisher steal and publish it without paying for it. In that regard, I think one could argue that copyright protections should sunset in some manner with regard to the original works. No one owns the publishing rights to Homer or Shakespeare after all to my knowledge, and I could see an argument for books and the like eventually becoming free to reproduce. Where there might still be a question is in regard to new editions or derivative works from other authors, which might need a separate treatment.With trademarks by comparison, I think there would have to be more stringent restrictions. You can't have someone imitating your logo or the like too closely while you're using it. That said, if a logo or the like falls out of use for an extended period or the company closes down, I think the trademark should lapse after enough time has passed since it was used.","title":"CMV: Nintendo's patent lawsuit against PocketPair (developer of Palworld) proves that patents are a net detrimental to human creativity."},{"text":"They just vote R no matter what.

One of the ways they do it is by buying reinsurance from their own out of state affiliates, once the money is moved out of state, they're like oops, we got no money to pay for your storm damage and shut down business, despite having made huge profits in the years prior when there were no storms. You can read about it in this excellent piece from the Tampa Bay Times.https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/The federal government should be the one selling reinsurance(thus spreading out the risk nationally) to stop this kind of nonsense.One in 1,000 year storms? Florida is battered by hurricanes every year and of the 10 most intense hurricanes in the states historyHe's clearly speaking in hyperbole, but when scientists talk about 100 year(or whatever) recurrence, they're talking about a specific event in a specific area and the likelihood of it occurring again based on probability.  You can have a 100 year storm in one town or county and another in the next town or county in the same year, because they're each independent events. Unfortunately scientists are also working with limited data, because we haven't kept detailed records for 100s and 1000s of years, so much of that is guesswork. And even with accurate data, you can still just end up unlucky with two of these events occurring short times apart.If you want to read about probability of these events and why it seems to confuse y'all, there's a great article by the USGS;https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/100-year-floodEdit; Just to add, I do think we shouldn't allow people to build new homes on beaches and barrier islands and if someone still decides to, it should be at their own risk and self insured. The ideal would be to slowly move people out. Insure them until a storm hits, then pay insurance only if they're willing to not rebuild in the same area.

As for child support, while the system in general could use reforms, I don't really see how you can show that a mother would inherently have to pay less in hypothetical situations.Violent crime against men by women is taken less seriously in the justice system and women often times get lesser sentences than men do for the same crime.While I understand that justice reform is important, is this actually something that you find to be a pressing issue for white men in such a way that it should be highlighted over other issues?There are many scholarships afforded to minority groups and not young, white menThis isn't a government issue.Ultimately, though, this just seems like a generic MRA list of grievances that don't actually seem to have proposed solutions that you're demanding be implemented. I also question how much *young men* (especially men so young that this is literally the first time they've ever been able to vote) are concerning themselves with child support and the idea that in the hypothetical scenario where a woman hits them she is likely to receive less of a punishment than if a man had hit them.It also feels a bit silly that these are the core issues white men apparently need to have highlighted to feel heard when they're put up against women losing the right to healthcare or LGBT people being labeled pedophiles and losing protections for housing and work.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is likely to win the presidential race, but to solidify her chances and beat Trump decisively, she should also focus on issues that resonate with young, white men."},{"text":"No because he's about to get his ass spanked in the election.

But his policies will hurt so many people that even folks in the MAGA movement, they believe, will start to defect. His autocratic efforts will ultimately fail as tens of millions of people protest in the streets every month.

[English Cipher is default](https://gematrinator.com/calculator) - they standardised the English language on a global scale via education, and the Gregorian (12 month/52 week) calendar was created by Jesuits and they now use both combined using Gematria.I can provide a [Youtube link](https://youtube.com/@gematriaeffectnews1983?si=IGSBUu2ZMmNcY1DB) to a channel explaining how and why they code numbers into words, dates, people, exposing them and when you actually realise they almost have the population brainwashed into thinking these rituals are only coincidences when called out, you just got to look it up and realise the amount is statistically impossible to be random as many believe, but I feel that's because they haven't taken the time to investigate the historical important of numbers/letters to the Jesuit Order (and many other) religion/societies (cults..)I'll add lastly its probably why 2001 (numerically equalling 201) was chosen as the year, and 9/11 being due to Genesis 11:9 was the last part about the tower of babel falling [putting the 'script' into the word scripture.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011%3A1-9&amp;version=NIV). \\nThe Holy Bible = 201.  Vatican = 119.  The rabbit hole only gets deeper from here so if you read this with an open mind, you'll see it can only be a so called coincidence so many times before it becomes a pattern.

I say this because there are plenty of people who know nothing about the conflict but have very strong feelings and views about it. Also, in theory, someone could be an enormous expert on the conflict, with years of personal involvement, but not care at all.I write \\"in theory\\" because I believe you're right: In practice, nobody can be \\"neutral\\" about this conflict after learning about it.But maybe neutrality means anti-israel and anti-palestineFunny. I always saw neutrality as \\"Pro\\" both: wanting an outcome that satisfies as many people as possible both in Palestine and in Israel.(which I guess would be anti-hamas because you can't really be anti-civilian)There's not just Hamas. There's the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, the Lion's Den, and about 20 other terror organizations within Palestine. And then Israel has the violent settler movements.But, sorry to fudge the lines more... But civilians ARE very involved in this conflict, and always have been.I mean, in the early days, the first attacks were Arab civilians against Jewish immigrants. Neither were organized into military or even militia groups back then.Today, Hamas uses a lot of civilian support, and even a lot of the kidnappings and killings, rapes and even torture that happened on the 7th of October were from about [two thousand Palestinian civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel) that crossed into Israel. Palestinian civilians also [express their support](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/poll-shows-palestinians-back-oct-7-attack-israel-support-hamas-rises-2023-12-14/) for the 7th of October attack. As for Israel, the IDF is mainly made out of civilian reservists. Everyday Israelis, mainly Jews but also Arabs, that fight when needed to. Most Israelis serve in the IDF during their lives, and there is overwhelming support for the IDF among Israeli civilians.I think in the West we like to pretend things are black and white, and tell ourselves things like \\"this war is strictly the IDF against Hamas\\". The reality almost always is far more complicated.Just in case it's not clear, I'm not advocating for targeting civilians within a conflict, ever.

What they are fighting for is rule by a Palestinian tyrant.  That's what they really seem to want.  When they say Palestine shall be free, that's what they mean.And so it's hard to pick.  I think we need to give the Palestinian negotiators access to American military control systems for the duration of the negotiation, so both sides have access to real military strength while they negotiate.

I spend almost every free moment I have playing/creating music and/or studying theory.But, music is subjective. It comes down to culture, and the emotions you feel from a song come from what is common in your culture.Lets take a minor key, if played to a western audience, it will illicit a sad emotion, but if played to an eastern audience, it may not elicit the same emotion and definitely not to the same degree. Blues scales played in western music elicit downtrodden emotions, but thats because everyone in the western world associates the typical blues sounds with that emotion. The eastern world would hear it differently. If we play an eastern scale in the western world, we dont really hear the same emotions coming from the scale, it mostly just sounds like exotic, non-western music. Go listen to some Ravi Shankar and tell me if you experience intense emotions, or if every song just sounds fast paced or mystical/exotic.Theres more than 7 notes in your typical eastern scales, while most western music sticks to the standard 7 notes in a given key. An interval that sounds dissonant and evil to western ears might sound lovely and harmonious to eastern ears. Music is not universal, its cultural.Really, the only constant that helps western and eastern cultures decipher the intended emotion in each others songs is tempo. In essence, slower songs tend to be sad, and faster songs tend to be happy.Part of understanding and knowing how to make good music is knowing your audience and knowing which scales/modes and chords will help you essentially manipulate your audiences *learned* understanding of music to get them to feel the emotions you want to convey.So, if you want to say theres an objectively best song, youd have to first specify between western and eastern listeners.But, even then, theres so many different genres and emotions within western music. Is jazz the best, or is it rock, blues, funk, disco, country, rap, etc.? And even within those genres, is the best song a happy song, or is it a sad, emotional song? Or, is it experimental? I could sit here and argue that happy funk songs are the best because thats one of my favorite genres, its fun to play, and it just hits my dopamine in a way no other genre does. I could also argue slow, sad blues songs are better because they make you *feel* so much emotion, and *thats* what music is about. But, at the same time, the musician in me would say something more experimental would *actually* be the best. Being able to go beyond the confines of western music to make something truly unique and enjoyable is something *every* musician should aspire to. But, in sum, theyre all great. It all depends on the listeners mood and what theyre needing/wanting in the moment. Its subjective. My favorite song changes from day to day. If I cant even determine a best song *for myself*, how can we expect a universal, or even cultural, consensus?","title":"CMV: Music is objective."},{"text":"Exactly.

Lamed, the same symbol for Saturn without the line, and it is the only letter that ascends beyond that top line. If you observe the shape of the letter ?, it has a line above it, like a tower. The part that projects above the line is called the Tower in the Air.

The two sides simply don't work with each other.  \\nIn some cases, this comes down to who you want to trust more and why. For instance, whereas pro-Israelis see the IDF approximation for dead Hamas militants fairly reliable, and give reasons to why it is the case, pro-Palestinians often think that the IDF is lying and it's better to trust Hamas for these figures. and then you arrive at completely different evidence sets. Now these things tend to bootstrap themselves, where one report uses one set of numbers as their evidence, and then another report cites the first etc.In the end, it's not only about values, it's about the quality of the information. Here, I tend to agree that Israel should be trusted more. It's a democracy, and as a democracy it has certain things that the Palestinians simply don't, such as free press, or people that openly oppose the government. To me, this adds a lot of credibility to some of their claims, as if they were lying, they would have to hide it from an entire country that's used to do such checks. It doesn't mean that they are fully reliable, simply that they are more reliable. It's not only about \\"values of democracy\\" it's about methodologies of a democracy.

I think it would have been pretty justified if it was seen as a viable way to end the violence (my own opinions aside).What really happens is that Israel is a very divided country.For sure there are right wing elements in Israeli society and politics that follow Jabotinsky's approach, and would like to see the West Bank and Gaza under Israeli control. But the truth is that these are a minority. For example there has never, ever, in Israeli history, been a government in power that wasn't a coalition.In the ground in Israel you see how varying the opinions are.Overall, people online usually comment on \\"what Israel wants\\" or \\"what Palestine wants\\", and they are already wrong before they start typing: Both Israelis and Palestinians are divided.

The far left and the far right aren't aligned at all. They've literally killed each other time and time again over the course of history. Socialism is incompatible with fascism, and with every form of conservative ideology.

Many leftists are certainly against the American government as it now exists, but they by and large don't want to destroy America. I can't say the same of the far-right, who want to commit genocide against American minorities and institute an oligarchic dictatorship.I get where you're coming from - a lot of people look at politics based on vibes, and on just the general jist of a lot of stuff. But if you just take a look beyond vibes, you'll see that the far left and the far right are radically different, and that horseshoe theory just doesn't work. The left is concerned with the abolition of class-based oppression and the exploitation of the masses, while the right wants to enshrine hierarchies of oppression.","title":"Former Republican US senator endorses Kamala Harris, says election offers 'stark choice'"},{"text":"So you never got to the concert?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/30rp3ktvtord1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f0db9fcbeb6e5c28dc1ad5d3d10e7c01f378a18","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Its plausible","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And so much of the Internet, especially places like TikTok, are populated by people who have no memory of 2006-08.

That doesn't guarantee innovation happens, because not all paths are winners, but I would argue that in aggregate across an economy, those factors mostly cover it.?\\n?Australia just doesn't have the first two components anymore, because we don't make anything. There's no driving need for innovation, because the vast majority of our economy is not actually competing in a way that requires it. Additionally, because we no longer make things, we're losing the kind of expertise that is required to innovate, because there's nothing here for those people. You aren't going to bootstrap innovation by throwing money at grads if they don't also have access to good mentors and resources.\\nI think this is the lesson of China that most people have missed. The reason they're outcompeting the West in many areas now isn't because they're better or smarter or their labor is cheaper (at least, not directly). It's because their government prioritized the development of key industries. Having a critical mass of expertise in an area allows for better mentoring of a county's best and brightest, which has a snowball effect over time. If you want to build better chips, yeah you need access to someone who knows a thing or two about quantum physics, but that's pretty easy. The harder thing to get access to is people who know how to build chips at scale because they've done it everyday for decades, and by the way, the guy over there is taking a new junction design through to production, and over there is a guy who applied some interesting math to optimizing chip layouts that you could probably build on.\\nBecause we don't make anything, there's no critical mass of expertise that pushes innovation along, because there's only so much innovation you can really do in, say, accounting. Even if we did accidentally produce someone with that kind of expertise, the pointy end of the spear just isn't in Australia, so why would they stay here? I think it's important to remember that for areas where Australia still does have those components in place, like mining and agriculture, we're unquestionably world class. Our defense sector is also fairly strong, and is entirely comprised of local talent for security reasons, though it is suffering for the lack of a wider ecosystem. For the other stuff, it's just that if there's no ecosystem for the people who would innovate to exist in, they'll either go elsewhere, or find something else to do.","title":"CMV: A nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem."},{"text":"The Economist election forcast increased Harris's chances of winning to 60% from 50% a few weeks ago.","title":"Kamala Harris' Chances Surge in Major Election Forecast"},{"text":"Preserving our natural resources should never be a red or blue thing.

This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual appropriations implemented by the Bureau of Reclamation will be awarded to projects in California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington for the study, design and construction of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects that will improve the health of fish, wildlife and aquatic ecosystems.  \\n...  \\nAt a time when tackling the climate crisis could not be more critical, President Bidens Investing in America agenda is a major investment in the conservation and stewardship of Americas public lands that will lead to better outdoor spaces and habitats for people and wildlife for generations to come. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law builds on proven, nature-based projects, programs, and partnerships to protect cherished wildlife and nature resources while creating good-paying union jobs to strengthen communities. Projects announced today build on comprehensive investments being implemented throughout the Department to restore rivers, streams and wetlands and safeguard aquatic habitats, including a $200 million investment for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Fish Passage Program.  Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Reclamation is investing a total of $8.3 billion over five years for water infrastructure projects, including rural water, water storage, conservation and conveyance, nature-based solutions, dam safety, water purification and reuse, and desalination. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed in November 2021, Reclamation has announced more than $4.2 billion for an ever-growing list of 586 projects.  These projects also advance President Bidens Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.Today's investments are part of a total $1 billion provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the WaterSMART program.A link to the list of projects is at the end of the press release. Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:Through President Bidens Investing in America agenda, the Interior Department continues to advance water solutions that are environmentally and economically sound for the American West, said Secretary Deb Haaland.

Anti slave states rightfully said no you are arguing in court that enslaved people are not people, why should they count for congressional apportionment?  The end result was giving slave states 3/5 more people to count towards representatives in the House. Less than the full count they wanted, but more than what abolitionists wanted by a good margin.

Clinton was the second most unlikable candidate in modern American history. While Trump was #1, he was seen as an outsider who would break from the DC *status quo* that people had grown frustrated with. Meanwhile, Harris has a net favorably rating while Trump has a net negative favorably rating, and now he is a known quantity, and Democratic leaning voters who sat out 2016 probably aren't going to sit out 2024. Demographic shifts also continue in the 'burbs throughout the country, something that Clinton didn't notice or capitalize on. Trump is going to need *massive* rural turnout while hoping for depressed turnout in the major metro areas while also hoping that the 'burbs haven't moved further left (there are no signs of them stopping that trend). Harris is a much better candidate than Clinton and is running a much better campaign. Could she still lose? Sure. But, imo, the only way that happens is if Democratic leaning voters stay home like they did in 2016, and even then, Trump only won by around 77,000 votes, and without the Comey letter Clinton probably wins. It is a turnout game now, and Harris has the better ground game while Trump has outsourced that aspect of his campaign to PACs that have never run a GOTV operation.","title":"The Democrats Secret Weapon in the Sun Belt States: Unions"},{"text":"Yeah we are all pro not illegally crossing the border, not legal immigration","title":"Kamala Harris &amp; The Border in a few photos."},{"text":"I've always dreamed of becoming an astronaut so I can hopefully one day explore Uranus.","title":"Symbols Of An Ancient Sky (Documentary)"},{"text":"You mean the one that would have allowed 5K illegal crossings EVERY DAY, or 1.825 million per year, and would have given DOJ the ability to just blanket any illegal crossers with amnesty?","title":"Trump: Kamala Harris 'Can Never Be Forgiven' on Border"},{"text":"That's not even counting the 2008 Iowa Caucus when bus loads of Chicago residents, many of them homeless, were hauled into Iowa specifically to vote for Obama and steal Iowa away from Hillary.","title":"Just a reminder: Obama won his very first election by charging his opponents with election fraud.

Immigration can help ease the demographic issue of low birth rates but it doesn't solve it. South Korea and Japan are not seriously considering large scale immigration. Their existing cultures are not compatible with large scale immigration, they would rather focus on technological solutions and/or take the hit to material living standards. Especially in Korea's case where they'd need to bring in half the population each generation, it would destroy any society. If the problem is how to get low skill labor to support social nets, the effective answer would be foreign workers who do not have a path to permanent residency. If executed poorly it can be exploitative, but that could be minimized and ethical concerns are the only downside.The costs and benefits of immigration differ greatly depending primarily on education level. The US and UK have successful immigration because their institutions and cultures are built to take advantage of it, and because they (especially America) disproportionately attract valuable immigrants. The international standing of US and UK universities are an indication of this, with the top 25 including 18 from the US and 4 from the UK. But unlike general immigration, there is a limited amount of skilled immigration. London and SE England attract most of the positive immigration, and looking in from America, the living standards there do not seem to spread broadly throughout the UK. [https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings)Immigration in Europe is causing problems because so much of it is not based on merit or education. Non-western immigrants in Denmark largely lack education or useful skills, and because of this they are a net drain on society their entire lives and is projected to remain true in 2050. Low skilled immigration makes social safety nets more difficult to sustain, not less. [https://rockwoolfonden.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Newsletter-May-2015.pdf?download=true](https://rockwoolfonden.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Newsletter-May-2015.pdf?download=true)This is the type of immigration that is widely objected to in the US and UK as well. The countries having a net beneficial immigration policy doesn't make this type of immigration more beneficial. Policies that would limit less valuable types of immigration to limit the downsides of it still make sense. Especially impoverished refugees who are de facto economic migrants using an archaic system past a certain scale.This is ignoring the real negative effects on social cohesion and stability. Especially for the already questionable uneducated immigrants who tend to be highly religious with a serious language barrier. Or that building infrastructure and training people may be a solution in a perfect world, but in places which are already struggling to properly build housing stock or hospitals or anything else, it exacerbates those problems.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"lol.

In 1968, the publication \\"American Baptist\\" wrote: \\"Because Christ calls us to affirm the freedom of persons and the sanctity of life, we recognize that abortion should be a matter of responsible personal?decision . . .\\",  in 1971, the Southern Baptist Convention stated as a goal \\"to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.This was pre-Roe-v Wade when abortion was largely illegal in the states where Baptists were most active!People changeall the time.The issue is that people think change should be sudden. It never is. Trump's GOP didn't form under Trump. It had its roots back when Newt Gingrich decided that power for power's sake was to be the way forward for the GOP. It has taken decades for the people on the right to divorce themselves from any ties to reason, values, and facts and come to a point where they support a party on the simple pretense that a strong-man, anti-democratic xenophobic bigot who has a stated goal of wanting to be more like Putin and Orban lead it.Not many years ago, the left rose in arms and went to Spain to stop a guy just like Trump.

One doesn't try to appease them.

They are afraid of the world as it is. And they genuinely hate America. Just listen to their rhetoric about how terrible a place this is and how awful everything has become -- they absolutely hate what this country is. They hate the idea of people, particularly women and minorities, exercising any sort of freedom. They despise any notion of community. The abhor any notion that anyone in the world would be any different than they are. They say as much every damn moment of the day.If the USA is to remain a democratic free state where people of any, or no, religion, can live their lives freely regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, then the modern GOP must be opposed with every fibre of our being.

In the apartheid system Israel  has set up to maintain the Jewish supremacy, they deny all human rights to Palestinians, including the right to due process and a fair trial. Zero of the Palestinians being held in Israeli jails and torture centers have had an actual conviction in an actual court with evidence and legal representation. All of the thousands of Palestinians held without charges are exactly like hostages and Israel never even bothered to pretend they are held legally.  Of those that were convicted in the racially biased military court system, no distinction has been made between those who killed occupation forces like soldiers who are legitimate targets and civilians which are not. And on top of all the other reasons, Israel employs torture as a method of extracting confessions, which always yields confessions, but will result in false confessions alongside any real ones, so none of that information can be used in a court of law. The argument that ISRAEL bound and burned its own citizens is beyond the paleNo one said Israel bound them, but Israel definitely burned them. The helicopter pilots opened fire and their rockets led to the junkyard of burned cars at the music festival, the location of most of the civilian deaths.Despite the confusion, twenty-eight Israeli combat helicopters fired all of the ammunition they were holding, including hundreds of 30 mm cannon shells and Hellfire missiles, during the day.After landing his Apache to reload ammunition at roughly 10:00 am, the commander of the 190 squadron instructed the other pilots to shoot at everything they see in the fence area, separating Israel from Gaza. If twenty-eight attack helicopters fired all their ammunition and told their pilots to shoot at everything, then you should know many of those people who were burned to death were not Hamas but Israelis had been taken hostage. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever for Hamas to burn them anyway, they only have value if they are alive. The only hostages thought to have been killed by Hamas after capture were the six who were in a location where Israel was closing in, and killing them is exactly what you would expect as hostages are only useful if you can trade them. The argument that Israel DIDN'T kill lots of their own citizens in friendly fire on October 7th is delusional at this point.","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"He was there and got a huge cheer when they showed him on the Jumbotron so I'm sure he enjoyed that.

All this is just brainstorming off the top of my head.Health: similar to pornstars with regular STD panels and general health screenings. Strong encryption of records to protect their identities. Anyone who leaks these documents could be penalized in a way between a HIPAA violation and revenge porn.Financial: sex workers can get an agent or manager who is sworn to a fiduciary standard. Standard 10%. If not their own agent there should be an organization that counsels workers on the info they need to succeed. Sex workers must file federal returns every year. You could mandate electronic payments only. Clients who dont want something appearing on their credit card can buy a gift card with a certain amount and use that as payment.Physical safety: Agents and managers must be licensed and inspected regularly. Any with criminal records are forbidden from applying to manage others. Those who become unregistered or violent pimps anyway would be charged with trafficking, rape, coercion, racketeering, tax evasion, etc. Repeated violations end with them on a sex offender registry or in jail.Educational: sex workers would regularly meet with advocates and/or advisors who would advise them of their rights and options, since many get into this due to dire financial problems. Advocates could also meet with those applying to become a sex worker to determine the reason theyre entering the industry and steer them to resources they didnt know they had. They would have access to local, state, and federal social services, job training, education, and legal services. There could be unions too with all these options.Clients: all prospective clients must submit to a health screening in advance of a liaison with a sex worker.","title":"Prostitution: What do you think?

in a non-competitional mode, we could if we wanted live together without hurting each other and the consequence could be an immortal lifelife where no one dominates another but all are respecting and appreciating each others unique expression ...now how to reverse this downfall, how could we as a human species ascend once again gradually towards doing no more kiling towards each other and fellow species ?i guess the most simple way could be to stop quarreling with each other, find ways to create local harmony, come together in the circle of equals where every person of every species is heard, listened to what one needs and the local people of all species assembly, all who live here now would try to find a way to accomodate everyones basic needs, make sure everyone is fed and housed and is given some space to creativly experience ones own individualitythere are two ways i can see we could help thisone would be to simply ignore the state as the fictional construct what it is and connect to each other in voluntary solidaritythe assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral and unethicalland, water, air, human beings, animal beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent entities who want to be their own persons, all bodies carrying biological organic life and or the digital synthetic equivalent of can never by property of anyone but perhaps only of themselveswe the 8 billion human beings alive could allow each other acess to 1000 m2 fertile land and 1000 m2 forest without anyone asking another to pay rent or buy landso one could either on ones own or with others together plant vegan food in the garden, build a home from clay, hemp and straw, grow hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree gets killedthe human being not dominating any other human beingthe human being not dominating an animal being, not enslaving animals, not killing animalsthe human being not killing trees but planting hemp to satisfy heating and building materials needsthisway creating a field of gentleness, living either beside each other or with each other according to how much community one wishes or is able to experiment with ...very well possible that after a while living in such a gentle way of non-violence, higher capabilities as in telepathy, tapping into the etherical abundant field, levitation etc. but most of all a spontaneous absence of hunger might rise up from such living non-violently, an example of this can be found in the bigu phenomen experienced by some qigong practitionersa second way how to reform our human society could be to try reforming the constitutions of the regional and nation states wherever one lives on this planet via collecting signatures from each other for people initiatives, cititen referendums to demand a public vote where a reformed constitution would be either accepted or rejectedthe main change for such a constitution of a regional and or nation state i believe could be helpfull would be to allow everyone, every person of every species to leave the coersed assocition to the state at any moment followed by the state releasing a 1000 m2 of fertile land and a 1000 m2 of forest for everyone who would not want to be associatiated to the state anymore but would want to live in some sort of free space for free beings, neither state nor nationalso possible to think of a constitution reform what would shift all political decison powers fully to the local community, the village, town and city-district becoming its own absolute political sovereign over itself so that the circle of equals, all persons or all species living here and now in this local area could acknowledge each others same weighted voting power and invite each other to participate in all decision findings without anyone representing anyone else but everyone standing up for ones own oppinion if one think its necessaryvoluntary solidarity replacing coersionacknowledging each others needs and wishes instead of imposing duties onto anyonereleasing each other from all pressure, give each other spiritual mental emotional and physical space to

Three times the man refused, but on the fourth request he agreed, he went out first to the north, but saw only mist and haze; then he went sucessfully to the west, south, and east, but again saw only mist and haze...

An important thing to note is that this video was captured in 2019. Since then, we have seen almost the entirety of the Biden Administration, and the vast majority of her promises remain unfulfilled. It is incredibly interesting to note not just how few promises she has attempted work on during the current administration, but how few have been promised in the next one. Almost like she's just talking out of her ass for a lot of it.For those who are curious to look into it for themselves, the link is at the very bottom.Harris gets the mic at roughly 1:52:30 and steps away at 2:25:30.

We need leaders who have the courage to speak truth. So let's speak some truth today... The economy of our country is not working for working people. Almost half of American families cannot afford a $400 unexpected expense in our country today.\\" Remember, this was during the Trump Administration. The Biden Administration has since worsened it.It's also interesting how, at roughly 2:03:00, she proposes a large tax cut in order to generate more wealth for the average family, the same strategy she criticized Trump for in their debate. She then criticizes Trump's \\"War to Destroy Obamacare,\\" which is especially ironic when you consider that it was the Biden Administration themselves who, as Trump and Biden so succinctly put it, \\"beat it to death.\\"At roughly 2:14:00~ish, she says that, when she becomes President, she will enact a plan to give teachers a raise -- a raise consisting of $13,500 each year, because \\"[Trump] would rather give teachers a gun than a raise.\\"At 2:16:45, she purposefully misquotes Trump as saying that Neo Nazis were fine people as they marched on Charlottesville. Remember, not only has this been repeatedly debunked, but she used this exact same quote five years later during a debate, a sign that this falsehood was one of the only things she could try to pin on him. Really interesting when you look at it that way.At 2:20:10 she says what is said in the clip above, which is just as ridiculous the second time.Full video:\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=437587516816805","title":"This is how freedom of speech get eliminated by Democrats"},{"text":"Fucking weird ass clown.","title":"As Eric Adams prepares to appear in court, the number of Democrats calling for his resignation keeps growing"},{"text":"Believe nothing.

Steve Bullock in Montana won the governor's race twice in presidential election years where Montana voted for the Republican presidential candidate (in 2016 Bullock won by +5 at the same time as trump won MT by +20). Bullock still lost the senate race in 2020 by 10 points. New Hampshire has voted for a Republican governor and Democratic senators at the same time. In Tennessee, the popular former Democratic governor Phil Bredesen lost to Marsha Blackburn in the 2018 senate race by 10 points. Alsobrooks, assuming there's no career-ending scandal that comes out between now and election day, should still be the heavy favorite. Maryland is just so ridiculously deep blue.

As for copyrights, I agree that in art, a subject made of fusions and inspirations, copyright laws should barely exist. As long as someone isn't literally stealing the words you wrote, I am ok with it : this includes fan fictions, AI art, movie remakes, anything. However, you seemed to extrapolate this to fields which matter to humanity a lot more than art and which's difference and similarities are way more objective. Two reasonable people can disagree on how much inspiration is allowed : Macbeth by Shakespeare was greatly inspired by the popular works at the time, which he perfected. However, in science, differences are more obvious: genetically edited seeds have DNA structures, drugs have formulas and machines have blueprints. History showed us that the system is open to abus, yet, for fields other than art, the present copyright system is mostly fine.","title":"CMV: Nintendo's patent lawsuit against PocketPair (developer of Palworld) proves that patents are a net detrimental to human creativity."},{"text":"Maybe, but I doubt it changed anyones mind.
