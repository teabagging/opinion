Ergo, an immigrant is actually better for the economy than a citizen- though immigration does not affect birth rates that way2) Population booms correlate strongly with increased economic benefit, whilst population reductions correlate strongly with economic strife. Ergo, we can conclude that the two are closely intertwined.

Not just the news media, but also the courts (if you can't get justice against huge corporations, how does anyone know the truth about what they do?). Somehow escalating those fights was never worth it. Meanwhile, the internet came along and made a heavily centralized news media non-viable in general, both by the invention of new platforms, and by depriving the existing institutions of their ad and classifieds revenue. Yet, anyone with the power to do anything about it just... figured it'd work out somehow.Without a firm source of truth, of course people are going to retreat to their biases and latch onto the first person who promises a heroic solution. It takes a lot of work to educate someone away from those instincts, and even a university education can't always manage it.The only way out of this is a massive reform of the legal system, and I don't know how we get there. Not only do we need to make the courts more equal and reliable, we need a way to fund investigations at a much greater scale than what something like ProPublica can do.

Private management while retaining public ownership is a great system that keeps costs down and efficiency up.The issue with CAHSR is that the planning stage fucked up. American infrastructure planning goes hogwild on expensive designs where it's not needed which then takes up valuable resources on areas where expensive engineering is needed (largely the fault of consultants pushing grandeur over pragmatic design). Low-hanging fruit in infrastructure planning seems to be avoided like the plague because \\"good enough\\" isn't \\"perfection\\", and for some reason that appears to be a problem. Politicians also are a huge problem in that they rely on these consultants and never take initiative on projects, preferring to keep them in planning purgatory. The longer things take, the better organized an opposition to a project can become, and that allows NIMBYs to do everything they can to derail these projects. Though the failure to utilize low-hanging fruit is a seriously big issue.I was gonna include a long rant about my hometown Chicago's CTA and their $5-6 billion boondoggle of a rapid transit extension, but I decided to trim it down.

The kicker, is that there's an electrified commuter train line (4 electrified tracks + 4 non-electrified tracks used by Amtrak/freight rail) that hits up very dense communities, significant tourist destinations, and major employment hubs. The commuter rail provider, Metra, investigated converting the line to rapid transit service and found that it could be done for $300-500 million dollars and yet crickets from the politicians who are instead pushing the expensive project forward.

A recent meta-study found no relationship between population growth and economic growth.[15]\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_declineThere is, however, a lot of evidence that lower birth rates will mean rents will decline.

Are you familiar with the phrase, too many chiefs, not enough Indians? Not everyone can do white collar work. And with generative AI coming online, I think there are going to be a lot fewer white collar jobs in the immediate future, as a number of positions are made obsolete. You need blue collar workers too. And there are billions of poor people in the third world, with tremendous work ethic and physical capabilities, that could contribute substantially to the Canadian economy. What's more, being able to move to Canada and earn a first world salary would be transformative for these people. They're earning 50 cents, $1 an hour in Brazil, in the Philippines, in Malaysia. And they could be making $10, $15, $20, even $30 an hour in Canada. You want houses built? You think a foreign trained engineer or doctor is going to build a house for you?

Canada's point based immigration system is classist, racist, and counter productive. It is also harmful to the countries that we select immigrants from, because they need the brains we are draining a lot more than we do.

The researchers are interested in continuing to study whether there is a link, but all of them stress do not extrapolate that HSV-1 means you will get dementia. This from a 2022 story at [dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/alzheimers-neurodegenerative-disease-herpes-epstein-barr/a-61357638):As with the herpes virus, scientific studies have shown a connection between EBV and Alzheimer's disease  but not a causal relationship.\\"Most studies are based only on correlations. That doesn't say much,\\" explains neurobiologist Tzeng.The problem with the correlations between herpes or EBV and Alzheimer's disease is also very simple, according to Tzeng: \\"It is known that the viruses multiply in the human body when people get older. And it is also known that Alzheimer's disease mainly affects older people. Instead of EBV and HSV eventually leading to Alzheimer's, the correlations noticed in the studies could simply mean that they multiply in old people who are affected by Alzheimer's because the molecular environment in the cells supports their reproduction.\\"Continuing to look into the possible links between these viruses and the disease is an important step for Alzheimer's research, but, \\"there is no need to be overly concerned,\\" says Tzeng.[This is another researcher quoted from the same story:According to Itzhaki, the possible connection between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease has been known since at least 1997. Nevertheless, she says, large parts of the scientific community rejected the idea.Now that many researchers have become more open-minded, studies have confirmed the idea  but they are not unequivocal cause-effect proofs.Their results are consistent with our hypothesis,\\" Itzhaki says. \\"But only few researchers are now initiating new studies that explore factors that actually reveal causality  that would be the only possibility to finally prove our theory.\\nSo, to any reasonable degree--no, the research has not found *causality*--all the researchers say we need to continue looking to see if its there. Take this from [Alzheimers.org](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2020-09-15/could-familiar-viruses-herpes-simplex-cold-sores-and-chickenpox-have-role-causing):As outlined above, there is a significant body of research creating the impression that infection with HSV acts as a risk factor for Alzheimers disease. That said, it cannot necessarily be assumed that these viruses are directly leading to the development of Alzheimers. It could be that infected cells are doing something which otherwise healthy cells are not C making them easier to study and responsible for the link in this way. Further experimental studies and clinical trials are therefore needed to tease out exactly how these viruses are involved in neurodegeneration, and ultimately to prove whether they do indeed cause Alzheimers disease.For now, it is risky to suggest that treatment of these viruses could prevent dementia. Thats not because this approach isnt supported by enough research C the need to further test a treatment for any disease is just standard practice, regardless of supporting evidence. Afterall, treatment is not risk-free.Therefore, it would be reckless to assign patients unnecessary harm. [The reputable new sources like this one](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/herpes-may-double-risk-of-dementia-but-could-delay-it-by-almost-5-years) highlight studies seeking to find a link and discourage you from extrapolating causality from them until more research is done.","title":"CMV: Biden and others may be suffering from mental decline related to dementia or Alzheimer's, and there appears to be a significant relationship between HSV and those conditions.

His approval rating was decreasing over time during his presidency while Trump's was increasing. Biden did nothing about any of this because he wasn't able to. By 2021, according to report from just last week, he was already having 'bad days' where his meetings were cancelled. Trump, many others, pointed out that Biden was old as shit and the Dem leadership and the Biden administration were lying about it. I dislike Trump as much as the next guy but Dems telling people to their face that their eyes are lying to them really hurt them and validated Trump to many low-info voters. The debate was just the final stab through the heart, and the fact he didn't IMMEDIATELY stop running did not help. Then Kamala gets in. What does she do? She HUGS one of the least popular presidents of the last 50 years. She will not separate from him on any issue and when asked for differences, she cannot name a single one. Creating some space between her and Biden would have created headlines, led news cycles, and at least increased her chances at taking one or two of the swing states. Dems would have the house right now, is my bet. A even better situation is if Biden did not run again (as was the obvious thing for someone his age to do), or NEVER run in 2020. He barely won then, and it took quite a lot of BS to make that happen. We also know, thanks to Podsave, that the Biden-loyalists running her campaign basically believe that if Kamala  HAD started to make some noise about how she had some differences from Biden, Biden staffers in the administration, and his inner circle of loyalists, would have leaked info about how Kamala was actually totally in agreement, literally in the room, on all decisions being made by the Biden administration, and therefore try to tie her back to Biden anyway. She should have ignored this issue, but she did not.

A key part of this is the understanding that, until the 1700s, most governments wanted more people in their country; and even through the 1800s, more fights were over \\"we want these people\\" than \\"we don't want these people\\" (see: War of 1812, which was at least in part Britain and the US both arguing that sailors were their people).Now, some of that is tempered by in-group solidarity, and not wanting someone who doesn't fit in to be living around you. However, you can't deny that at least a part of the slave trade was getting more people; that the US's permissive immigration policies through the 1920s were about getting more people, and so on. The only time more people is a problem is when those people start to run out of resources - and up through the 1800s, the solution to that was to send those people to war and get more resources.However, at the same time as those in power are bringing in more people, they're trying to keep those new people from having any political power. Again: see slavery. It goes back to Rome and you don't get to vote unless you're a Roman citizen - meaning, born in Rome. It probably goes back further than that; with there being evidence of similar efforts to restrict power in earlier nations as well, including in the Old Testament.And the US has a long history of that. Asian immigrants got limited power. Whites tried to restrict rights to the Irish until the 1860s, when the Irish became the support whites in power needed to keep newly freed Blacks from taking political power. Whatever it takes to get people in the country, but with as few legal rights and protections as the people in power can possibly manage providing....A lot of support illegal immigrants get from the political left in the United States is based on three fundamental ideas - one moral, one based in power politics, and one based on shared enmity:\\\\- (Moral) People have the fundamental human right to travel freely, including across national borders; and enjoy the same rights (though not necessarily privileges) of all people when they get there. Putting any legal barriers to entry, except in cases where a person is provably reasonably a threat to the country (including security risks like potential spies; health risks like people with infectious diseases; or safety risks like known criminals), is therefore immoral. While we can reasonably put barriers to citizenship (which grants you an increased set of responsibilities - but also privileges. For example: ACA, Social Security, etc.); there should be no barriers to entry.\\\\- (Power politics) Immigrants tend to support more progressive policies - notably, less political and military involvement with certain countries (In the US, this mostly means US support of Central American dictators); increased support for the poor and other social programs; and programs that increase socioeconomic mobility. Therefore, having more immigrants and getting illegal immigrants papers and later citizenship will, at least in theory, increase the political power of progressives\\\\- (Shared enmity): Many people on the political left want to increase the rights for illegal immigrants primarily because that makes it harder for corporations and other wealthy people to take advantage of them - notably, to pay them sub-minimum-wage, and then deport them if they try to report it. Increasing the rights of illegal immigrants, especially giving protection to them so that they can't be deported if they have an employment dispute with a US company dating to before deportation started, would make it harder for companies to abuse them AND to depress wages for people here legally.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"sbout $5b a year","title":"California Democrats race to secure more funding for high-speed rail"},{"text":"This post isn't clear in the view you want changed.

Which is why people are still looking into this. Like, we know that globalization has been good, on average, for American workers. And yet we also know that subsets of American workers have been economically devastated, and a critique of politicians has been that they ignored these groups while talking about how good globalization has been on average.Currently, by pretty much every measure, the U.S. economy is doing great. Far better than peer countries, and yet subsets of American families are economically worse off than they were a few years ago as a result of the way the economy has changed. So maybe let's not ignore evidence that shows that the least educated of Americans are negatively impacted by an increase of low-skilled immigrant labor in their area. And as I previously wrote, I think the way to address this is to ensure those citizens have the means and opportunity to increase their skills and education levels rather than limiting immigration. But we won't do this if our focus is on trying to dismiss any evidence that shows that not everyone comes out ahead economically when immigrant populations increase in their area.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Go back to your conservaturd safe space?","title":"Biden heads to St. Croix for final holiday as president"},{"text":"Now imagine if your two most important theories are basically only your own; you can't even find people on the internet who agree","title":"So hard to make friends or have meaningful connections"},{"text":"First time ever reading about this, pretty interesting.?","title":"Concerning the Moon landing, don't stop at Bart Sibrel's confession to Candace Owens; it being fake.

Thank you for not going down this routeThose aren't 10m people that go straight to the workforce, though. Our economy isn't flexible enough to handle change like that. I mean, that's pretty standard for any country. That's 10m people we need to provide transportation, housing, food, and then process. If you can imagine, that is a coat that adds up quick. Integrating these people into society isn't nearly as simple as giving them a job and a work visa. And again, none of this touches on the verifiable fact that the economic benefits are literally due to worker exploitation, and there is a link between illegal immigration and lower working conditionsAlso, I would love to go after the businesses employing illegal immigrants. That's a great point. I've made my centrist opinion on the matter clear in some other comments... plenty of Republicans rely on illegal immigrant labor. They are hypocrites and belong in jail with the rest of the people using illegal immigrant laborAnd if you wanted further clarification of my stance on the matter: the illegal immigrants don't belong in jail.

Heavy border security is kind of useless. People get by anyway, and they're just pushed to use more and more dangerous methods, which gets them killed or separated from their families. Deportation has the same issue.If you really want to stop illegal immigration, you need to address the cause, not the symptom. Why are people coming in illegally? Because there's a lot of opportunity for undocumented labor. How do you stop it? Remove the undocumented labor.Make businesses verify right-to-work before they hire someone, and fine them heavily for any infractions. Work will dry up, and most people will stop coming over when they no longer have a way to support themselves.If it's not feasible to find legal and documented labor for all the businesses that require it, let some people in legally who can fill the roles.Either position works for me. The only thing I'm against is painting immigrants as the enemy while simultaneously profiting off their labor.

I don't make connections outside of co-workers, and I'm used to people thinking I'm crazy. Still gotta put those feelers out though.Weird thing is, I heard from a podcast that \\"Conspiracy eventually leads to Spirituality\\" and 2024 has been kicking my head in with the notion. I went to Church for the first time in 27 years this April. Was going pretty regularly, and multiple times a week too, I was on a good stretch until summer after some shenanigans with the Pastor, and all my previous reservations came flooding back, leading to a literal panic attack.Unfortunately, my reasons for stopping church as a teenager haven't changed much, as I still see it as a Doctrine Center that focuses more on fundraising and culture creation, more than anything Jesus would have wanted. Plus, I don't know, man, I just can't do Black Church, which seems to be the pinnacle of all I just mentioned. I'm Black myself, but have generally been ostracized by the community at large for as long as I can remember. I still try, but more often than not, the relationship attempts end up adversarial pretty quickly. Side rant over.Good news is, unlike when I was a kid, I didn't just \\"give up on God entirely.\\" I was never Atheist, but definitely a Christian Agnostic, and even practicing Pagan for awhile. I started reading the Bible this year, started seeing all sorts of historical evidence for some of the things as having actually occured, while bridging in gaps from my Pagan \\"studies\\" for more of the fantastical stuff. Long story, I'm all in on Christianity, but still can't do Church. I don't hate on anyone though, nor seek to convert or preach. I'll talk about this stuff all day though!

You should have at least provided a strong argument there before trailing off into tangential points but given what you've said I don't know if you can actually isolate variables beyond correlation on the topic. And anecdotal correlation at that.  The only thing you said which is worth consideration is illegal immigration's effect on labor supply for citizens as there is a casual relationship there via an increase in supply. Your suggestion that it is fundamentally bad is narrow minded as if economies can't grow which benefit everyone while necessitating an increase in labor. That doesn't hurt citizens.  The effect there is basically zero despite propaganda of the contrary but it's also positive economically for the entire nation. Illegal immigration being less than 5% of labor isn't meaningfully suppressing wages or taking jobs either in totality. Rather the work they provide is often exploited to the benefit of all Americans for otherwise unsustainable economic margins in specific industries, mostly agriculture. Those aren't jobs Americans want or can do as competitively. This is a means of work that has been leveraged against the world's labor since the industrial revolution but overall that has resulted in an exponential economic experience.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"I dont bother paying attention to them","title":"What is hypocrisy and hypocritical people for you?

Enoch also talks about the shame they had over their deeds and that they couldnt turn their face to G_d (and he hid his face from them).  When you examine the Council of Nicea, you see what was likely the taking over of the Priest class that Jesus (blessed be his name!) talks about, who recieved thw laws from Moses and ran society.  The Council of Nicea was that same class taking over the Christian Church.  Suddenly many things changed, including trying to ban every book in the bible that talked about the watchers.  They succeeded with Enoch (which we know was in many bibles including the Ethiopian Bible as well as being one of the most prominent books found in the Dead Sea Scrolls), but thwy also tried to block many ither books including Joshua (remember, Joshua was used by G_d to defeat a great many of the Giants and carried the Ark of the Covenant to even level Jericho).  After the Council of Nicea, the church immediately changed so many things and brought in many pagan rituals into christian celebrations.  The main Roman church also immediately put up an image of Jacob's Ladder (Jacob was special because he tricked his way into receiving his brother's blessing).  I believe the Council of Nicea was the infiltration and takeover of the Apostles' first churches.  But I would love other people's opinions.  You have to remember that the Roman's were completely unsuccessful at conquering the Christians, because torture and death were seen as the most honorable thing you could do because it was following in the steps of Christ. The Roman's couldnt quell the christians, so they infiltrated them and now the very same people that had Christ murdered are the ones who through the Council of Nicea were able to introduce Mary as being worshipped, introduced imagery back into the church, and eventually set up the Pope as the head of the church (which again, Christ warned us about).  I may be connecting strands that arent there, but to me the Council of Nicea looks like those same watchers taking over the church.  Especially when you see that all the deeds that were carried out were trying to hide the existence of those stories from being remembered. The Dead Sea Scrolls showed us how important some of these books were, and the deeds of the Catholic Church show us how hard they have tried to cover up the existence of these stories ever existing.

Well, an incident happened where the DMV had a ring of corrupt employees selling drivers licenses. In the great wisdom of Greg Abbott and company they decided to outsource the issuance of drivers license to private hole in the wall companies.Today, well, let me just say, I call this state the Lead Foot State for a reason. Most Texans think speed limit is a suggestion, I have actually been told that. Really I believe it was a solution to get more people off the state budget. Here in Texas the authorities prefer for people to kill each other and then they come in and clean up and do some admin work, not much in preventative approach, with the exception of maybe one or two dedicated highway patrolmen.Instead, the state could have sourced more educated people for DMV positions, paid them more, paying someone more money usually is a good way to win their allegiance, its why New Jersey state troopers will jump in front of a bullet for the state, their starting salary is 90k with no experience or degree. And with a DMV worker making a reasonable but high enough amount not only will be more dedicated to their job, but it disincentives wanting to put together a fraudulent network of corrupt state workers selling licenses.In contrast, years ago when I checked a Georgia state trooper started at 33K, yeah that Georgia state trooper is not going to be going above and beyond to stop people like the New Jersey state trooper...you seeing a pattern here?

But that is only because of how residential zoning works. This isn't the fault of immigrants. It's the fault of our political process.

As always, government restrictions on the market lead to people suffering.You point out the lack of entry level jobs, yet at the same time champion a minimum wage. This is cause and effect. If you set the minimum wage to $15 an hour, yeah, that's going to make it difficult for people to get entry level jobs. If you look at youth unemployment in Ontario, it is at 17%. Youth are a surrogate for low skilled workers in general, since they as a class have less education, less job experience, and fewer skills than older workers. Raising the minimum wage would only make things worse, in fact the minimum wage needs to be substantially lowered, if not abolished.

The climate sucks, there is no available housing, and no work to be found.  That's why immigrants flock to the cities, where they can find means of living.  Not to mention trying to settle relatively pristine places would be a waste of them.  Our world doesn't have enough unsettled places, and it would be a waste of woodland (or desert) to convert them over to housing.  Canada should treasure it's untouched northern provinces as part of it's national heritage.  Keep the immigrants where they belong, in their own damn countries, and let the Western World protect what rightfully belongs to it.

Without knowing your exact issue with deregulation, not much can be defended here as the topic is quite wide.what the point of that growth is if the average person's life gets worseAs mentioned before with median real earnings, the average person's earnings have increased in the last few decades under neoliberalism. The same goes for job satisifcation. Without knowing whatever metrics you are judging \\"the average person's life\\" by, it's hard to respond.Housing, in my eyes is a human right, heathcare is a human right, food is a human right. Anything needed for life is a human right. Neoliberalism doesn't see it that way, and I question the morality of such an economic system.Neoliberalism **does** see it that way, which is why - unlike the classical liberalism it evolved, and modern right-libertarianism - it is quite supportive of the modest welfare state. Rather than opposing welfare's role in providing these basic provisions, it instead places a greater emphasis upon wealth creation and market solution than competitng systems like Keynesian socal democracy/liberalism. This greater emphasis, however, is far from absolute and still supports a large state structure for basic provisions.What is important, however, is that many neoliberals don't have an ideological opposition to the welfare state at all. While some on the right do (this sub falls to the centre and left of neoliberalism), the primary concern even among them is the promotion of wealth creation through lower taxation (decreasing business costs and consumer purchasing) and regulation. While these usually come at the cost of welfare funding, some implementation of neoliberalism actually saw increased public spending.One such example is New Labour in the United Kingdom. If you are not aware, New Labour was the dominant sect of the British Labour Party from 1994 to 2010. It's key characteristic was abandoning the Keynesian doctrine of the \\"Old\\" Labour Party, and adopting what was called \\"Third Way\\"; a synthesis of neoliberal economics and governance, with social democratic social justice. It governed Britain from 1997 until 2010 over three electoral terms, under two Prime Ministers Tony Blair (1997 - 2007) and Gordon Brown (2007 - 2010).As previously mentioned, [public spending](https://ifs.org.uk/taxlab/taxlab-data-item/uk-government-spending-over-time) rose under both Prime Ministers. When the took office, public spending was at 35.5%, and reached a low under them of 34.8% '99-'00. This inheritiance was close to Britain's post-war lowest of 34.6% in '88-'89. By 2010, they had increased public spending to 46.3%, which is the highest it as ever been exlcuding WWI, WWII, and Covid.I just want to know your reasoningBeyond everything I've said above, my reasoning for supporting neoliberalism is a quite simple one. i've grown up poor, and my family has been relatively poor for generations. On both sides of my immediate family, I am the first go to university and hopefully the first to not live off welfare benefits. I have more faith in emphasis upon wealth creation bettering my and my familieis circumstances than emphasis on redestribution. I am not convinced any programme that emphasises redistribution would help me more than neoliberal's emphasises upon wealth creation has done.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":"All","title":"cmv: Trudeau was right to rachet up the immigration levels"},{"text":"Nonsense!

I'll simply point out that letting in immigrants wouldn't be \\"helping them\\" insomuch as it would be \\"helping our economy\\".  Unskilled immigration creates a temporary caste where current citizens have a boost in quality-of-life and drop in cost-of-living.  I've yet to see a study that says \\"but if you cross a certain number, it stops happening that way\\".  I think your opinion that the \\"entire world\\" would hop the border is simply hyperbolic.   Ultimately, the corporations are far better served supporting the administration that allows the most illegal immigrants in. It is a simple financial factYou're missing the point, I think.  *NOBODY* is \\"letting\\" illegal immigrants in.  They're either letting *LEGAL* immigrants in by opening the border more, or they're making sure the immigrants who come in are illegal.  Using your 10M citation, that's 10M people we wanted to turn away that are now working for companies that know they can ignore labor laws.  Biden \\"talked a good game\\" but really tightened his fist, one of the things some progressives disliked about him.  A pro-immigration position isn't \\"let's let 20M illegal immigrants in!\\", it's \\"let's make those 10M people be legal and be protected if they need to go to the police\\".The biggest difference in sanctuary cities right now isn't that they let illegal immigrants do whatever they want whenever they want.  But if they are witness to a crime, they are generally protected from deportation as best our authorities can, to prevent them from hiding from the police.EDIT: And an interesting thought-point.

They then lobby to make immigration illegal while simultaneously exploiting that labour for far cheaper than they ever could if those workers were legal and got all the social benefits they would be getting if they were legal. [The economy demands illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzpiYIR6Xg). The left thus, by making illegal immigrants legal, try to ensure they get the same social benefits as everybody else. That leads to immigrants learning that they should be going to that place instead of some other place where they have less legal protections. That is why leftism is better for the economy, as Donald Trump famously stated. This puts enormous pressure on the right to come up with some way to make the immigrants illegal and profitable, such as by appealing to racism, which then leads to economic downturns as immigrants learn to avoid the racist places. Initially the markets are jubilant about the right coming into power as it can exploit the newly illegalized workforce, but as the workers flee, become unproductive and crash the economy as a result of this, demand for economy boosting leftism increases and you get more relaxed immigration policies and on and on it goes.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Would be a lot cooler if you could","title":"California Democrats race to secure more funding for high-speed rail"},{"text":"That is simply incorrect.

It is slightly possible that the cult dynamic is so strong, it wont dissipate until his last hamberder and covfefe is consumed, but theoretically, if there is any backlash to how awful this term will likely go, the party might realize they have to move on.So then the question becomes, who do they move on to? I really only see three possible outcomes.The most unlikely scenario is that an Obama-like figure bursts onto the scene and unites the party back into a functioning conservative party. That person would have to somehow lightly address the grievance politics of the MAGA movement but reenergize the Reagan politics of the establishments, do so as a charming and motivating individual, and probably tamp down a lot of the bigotry. I cannot imagine who that person would be in the current lineup of Republicans so its probably going to end up being somebody with a very low profile right now.The worst case scenario is the next Trump appears on the scene, masterfully plays the grievance politics game and riles up the bigotry, but the GOP has learned its lessons and this person is actually an intelligent human being with the capability to get the evil done. We get MAGA 2.0 Now with Competency! and things get really scary in 2028. Is that Vance? Probably not, but maybe he plays it cool the next four years and just does TV hits and breaks ties in the Senate if any occur, then takes the mantle.The hopeful scenario is that the last hamberder comes in the next couple of years and the MAGA segment of the population fizzles out without their glorious orange leader. There will be a brutal fight to out-MAGA each other to try to claim Trumps mantle and the ensuing chaos will throw everything into a stalemate. The threat of Trump in the primaries disappears, so the looneys start losing their place in the House in 2026 and that voting block is rendered inert. The establishment takes advantage of the power vacuum and puts up a candidate in 2028 in the Romney/McCain vein and the fringe loses its power for good.I dont think anybody can really predict how this is going to go until the great orange menace is out of the spotlight for good.","title":"CMV: Republicans will hold a permanent Senate majority for the foreseeable future"},{"text":"The Electoral College overriding the peoples will is 100% theft.The peoples will?

Probably 90% if you drop the weird urban agriculture fetishism they have. There are two books by the Strong Towns which are very easy introductions into the key concepts of organic growth and how transport infrastructure has been overbuilt to our detriment. (It's American centric but most applies throughout the anglo-sphere)*Suburban Nation* is a classic and basically a trope setter of much of the issues with the overly centrally planned nature of suburbia. *Triumph of the City* talks about the benefits of urbanism. *Anti-Fragile* is a bit more broadly political-philosophical but the concepts are very useful in terms of protecting dynamism and organic evolution. Even more broad but just as useful is *Seeing Like a State* by James C. Scott, which warns against overly central state planning and control. He's shorter more casual work *Two Cheers for Anarchism* is also influential on my thoughts and general life philosophy.The good thing about \\"how this would work\\" is that it's mostly about relinquishing control and just letting people do *stuff*. A townhouse on my street is converted into a daycare which is a godsend for my family. It would be illegal to do this in most of the city due to zoning. *Just let people do this.* Allow \\"missing middle\\" housing (a key buzz phrase that would be useful to search up on more). Literally just let it be built. There should be a department ensuring safety, but then most of what urban planning should be should be on a macro scale. Not, and I'm not joking here, preventing developments because they have too many guest bathrooms (a real issue faced by someone in my city). London has been seriously under building for many, many years and it will take a lot of time to catch up. Just start letting people do it!Around 80% of urban planning should be entirely neutral as to what is on a lot of land. It should be a black box and the art of urban planning is about stitching those black boxes together in a cohesive manner. Where some regulations make sense, it should be primarily about external impacts and not use. E.g. an area could be zoned to have certain noise restrictions that might prevent heavy machinery but would allow either office space or residential. You'd want similar things for pollutants. We don't need to go full libertarian here, but especially in a post-industrial society like London mixed-use should be the norm.The more positive *action* that should be done is shifting taxation from improvements (like housing) to the unimproved value of land. This stops people being penalised for building improvements, and instead returns the communal value of the community... back to the community. *Social Problems* or *Progress and Poverty* are the classic works by Henry George that go into this, but there's plenty of Georgist works in the urbanist blogosphere now too.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":"My dad who is a adamant Christian believes this.

First, there was a wave of news articles saying that Hillary Clinton could comeback, in 2022. So i was wrong about that. However, it was not immediately after Hillary Clinton lost, and only after Kamala/biden approval rating sunk\\nHowever, your claim that those are the different between Hillary Clinton and Kamala might not be what you think:\\n- Kamala Harris has ran twice as of now. Once in 2020, and in 2024. If her comeback us 2028, then shell have the same number as Hillary Clinton, making that point moot\\n- Choosing Kamala is rather irrational if you consider all other candidates the dnc has available. An objectively better candidate could pete buttigieg. Hes also progressive and liberal, young, and based on the sentiment on this subreddit, male and white. He has none of the baggage Kamala has and supposedly has. He is more separated from biden. The fact that hes head of the department of transportation isolated him from any questions on international policies. Personally, he is generally scandal free, hes not from California, and if the sentiment that Americans are too sexist and racist to elect Kamala is true (I dont believe that at all), then hes white, cis, and is a man. Yet his potential presidential run is not in question- I disagree with the notion that Kamala ran a progressive campaign. The only policy shes ran on thats progressive is a cultural policy, the pro choice position. No economic policy, the weird turn that is crypto will help minority groups, somehow, and the constant vague dodges on most subject make it hard to believe thats shes progressive. And the belief that the dnc is pivoting toward more progressivism is rather unbelievable, especially after the dnc leadership fight.I think that the real reason for the insistence that Kamala will run is because the dnc is at the weakest, and for the first time, the dnc is rudderless. 2016 was surprising, and really bad, but the republicans didnt get everything. They didnt get the house, and they didnt get the popular votes. So, the dnc has two pretty reassuring beliefs: the people still support the democrats, and that Hillary Clinton was not the real Obama successor. Hillarys closest connection is with bill Clinton, not Obama. Their divide widen when the two come to blow in 2008, so the leadership in the dnc only think that , well, the Clinton name is in the dumpster, so dont pick them next time. So in 2020, the dncs favorite is biden, Obamas vp. The dncs beliefs seem to have been vindicated when biden won in 2020. But that make 2024 even more devastating for democrats. They had everything: a functional economy, the incumbent advantage, trump shitting himself on tv, their candidate is Obamas vp, and they lost everything. House, senate, popular vote. Everything that had worked before, no longer worked. They dont have anyone to rally around. Both Obamas successor and bill Clintons successor lost, to the same guy. Their tactic completely fall apart, nothing that would have worked against bush or mccain worked. They are completely lost","title":"Are Democrats coconut-pilled?

I think its a very vocal minority of US citizens (talking about the US here) who is for 100% open boarders with no screening. Because why would we be? We need to be able to screen for people who actually present a danger to the US and her citizens; this is not a popular country globally and Im sure there are a fair few groups that would appreciate not being questioned too hard on their way to commit blatant acts of terrorism or selling deadly synthetic drugs on the streets. I am all for legal immigration, because thats how we are going to survive the population decline. We should open more pathways for folks to move here and become citizens along legal channels, especially those escaping violence and prosecution. Legal immigrants tend to be boons for whatever community they join, reduce the crime in those areas, and create business that keeps the economy chugging along as new wealth is created for areas struggling (Like Springfield, OH.)I think, instead of a wall (which will not work, and has never worked,) we should partner with Mexico to build up the facilities in boarder crossing towns. This is so that migrants can be housed until their applications can be processed and their backgrounds checked and they can have all of their court dates. Give folks who see the US as a safe haven a safe place to wait until they are allowed in illegally. The Mexican military and the US military should be able to coordinate a way to keep these cities safe from bad actors, and the coordination between the two countries on something like this could lead to future coordination in dealing with the cartels the US helped create. Now, for the illegal migrants: they come here for money and protection, and are essentially the backbone of our agricultural system. We get rid of them, we are fucked, because capitalism demands exploitation, and who better to exploit than a captive population of illegal migrants who wouldnt dare reach out for help from the authorities for obvious, they put children in cages reasons. They still need to go, because if we are a country of laws, we need to follow those laws. But we need to hold off until those agricultural roles can be filled through legal immigration. People **want** to follow rules, and Im fairly certain many illegal immigrants dont follow them because properly following the laws is made damn near difficult to impossible. Thats why we should work with Mexico to build up checkpoint towns with short term housing options, food and water, where the potential future Americans can wait while they follow the laws.Is there a chance of abuse? Yes. Is there a chance of inhumane conditions? Also yes. But Im not here to get into the nitty gritty details, just to speak my mind that if we want to end illegal immigration, we need to make the process accessible at the boarder. Again, folks generally want to follow the laws: we are social creatures and violating laws doesnt feel good because it means going against the tribes rules. Lets make it easier to follow the rules and give shelter and safety to those most in danger, as all humans deserve safety, security, food, water and shelter.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"I'm a utilitarian for the most part.

Not saying this to go against your last line, only as context to the rest of this comment.I think the problem is that you're misunderstanding (and therefore misrepresenting) the pro-illegal-immigrant position.  Because the way I look at things, I'm convinced that the astroturfing you're talking about is happening with anti-immigrant sentiment instead! Illegal immigration causes competition for housing and wages among the poorest Americans. It creates downward pressure on wages and working conditions. They are pretty much exploited by default.They are only exploited more than Work Visa immigrants *because they illegal*.  For those who come here to work, the \\"illegal\\" part isn't a choice - if they're working the farms they're not gun-runners or anything.  The \\"pro-illegal-immigrant\\" sentiment isn't that people want ICE to turn a blind eye.  They want those illegal immigrants *to be legal immigrants instead of deported*, which would royally fuck those businesses you think are spreading the sentiment. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enoughI agree, but that's a lower priority issue.  Immigrants on Work Visas go through a lot of hoops to work here under those terms and they are satisfied (and with a few annoying exceptions, not fearing deportation every day). Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers moreBut every single study says **immigration** provides a much clearer net benefit to the economy, without any sign of diminishing returns.  The problem with illegal immigration in this sense isn't that we lose control of the number and quality of immigrants, it's that immigrants can be exploited because we don't give them rights.  Ultimately, the corporations are far better served being openly anti-illegal-immigrant because that is the path that keeps undocumented workers from reporting the continued exploitation.  There's only so much money the government can (or will) throw at deportation, and that spend has a diminishing return.  The only thing that will stop there being a large number of illegal immigrants in the US is for the US economy to fail or their local country economy to strengthen.  So yes, those exploiting them want them CONSTANTLY terrified of an over-equipped ICE just coming to separate them from their families.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Hes pretty morbidly obese and isnt young, hes already 73 years old.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 26, 2024"},{"text":"You dont want illegal immigrants, and don't want to open up more avenues for legacy immigration?

If I understand correctly, your argument is that illegal immigration drives down wages makes life harder for working class people who aren't immigrants. This part is true, because illegal immigrants lack the protections that citizens enjoy, so they are forced into worse deals. The next part of the argument is where I think you're wrong. You seem to think that people who are in favor of immigrant rights are astroturfed because of the above argument, and that the only reason to be pro-immigrant is to keep wages down.Where your argument fails is that it doesn't examine *why* immigrants drive down wages. It's *because* they lack the protections that native-born people enjoy and are therefore more easily exploitable. If instead, we didn't criminalize immigration and gave them the same rights, they'd not have as much incentive to take the more exploitative deals and we could be allies in the class war. Further, there would be more demand for work if everyone enjoyed a decent standard, so the competing for wages would be a non-factor. So rather than the pro-immigrant people being a cause for the wage deflation, it is the people advocating for making legal immigration almost impossible.Your housing argument is fair, but immigration is but a drop in the giant ocean of reasons for that particular struggle. A couple of the bigger reasons is the giant investment firms buying up so much of the housing stock and driving up price, as well as zoning rules preventing the building of more dense housing.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"WARNINGThis comment is known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.Proposition 65 California Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25249.6 et seq.","title":"California Democrats race to secure more funding for high-speed rail"},{"text":"Yes","title":"Does anyone else think that aliens are really demons?"},{"text":"Maybe, perhaps the fallen angels.

This is one of the biggest problems with libertarians imo. You see, corporations are greedy and have every incentive to take advantage of their consumers however they can. Libertarians say well if a company decieves their consumers they will take their money else where and that company will go out of business. But that makes a lot of assumptions, namely that consumers will know they are being deceived or will make rational choices. Companies lie and get away with it all the time. They dump excess chemicals into your drinking water. They false advertise shitty products. They calculate how many deaths and the costs of lawsuits a defective car part will cost them and then sell it to you anyways. And the truth is, consumers are DUMB. They don't pay attention to what they're buying. They don't read the label. They don't read the news about a product recall or the local factory employing child labor. A large portion don't even look at the price of a product. Like how often do you buy a toy and read to see if it used lead paint or not? You don't, because it's been outlawed. The free market solution there would be to require every consumer to heavily research every purchase they make, and that of their competitors. It's just not practical. Point is, the flow of information needed for a free market to truly work simply isn't there. Companies are greedy and deceptive. Consumers are dumb. Free market also doesn't account for TIME. By the time the market realizes a product is slowly poisoning them and tells everyone to collectively stop buying it, 1000 people have already died.This is why you need regulatory bodies from government. Only the government has the power to regulate because they can enforce action. They are also \\"supposed\\" to be overseen by elected or appointed persons, giving consumers at least some form of say so.

It's as you said, just people advocating for humane treatment of illegals, or legal immigration reform, but nobody wanting illegal immigration. The last immigration reform bill that would beef up border walls was put forward by Democrats and killed by the GOP.Per a right-wing think-tank: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-collapse-of-bipartisan-immigration-reform-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/With the blessing of both Senator Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Minority Leader, a bipartisan team of senators began negotiations to produce a bill that enough members of both parties could accept to overwhelm objections from progressive Democrats and America First Republicans.The team negotiated for four months to produce this bill. It took less than four days for its support among Republicans to collapse. Why?The easiest explanation is that Republicans in both the House and Senate yielded to objections from their all-but-certain presidential nominee, former president Donald Trump. Once the House Speaker stated publicly that he would not allow the Senate bill to reach the House floor for a vote, Republican senators were unwilling to run the political risk of supporting a measure that would not become law.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Thanks, I also hope he's able to beat his esophageal cancer.

So illegal migrants are more prone to being taken advantage of because of a lack of protections and having a system that treats illegal migration as a worse crime than violating workers' rights only helps corporations.

But OPs post doesnt explain what the US should expect to receive in exchange for providing that service. The next paragraph submits, as an example, the plight of Haitian migrants, as asylum seekers; but it appears to be in reference to specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. *Asylum seekers are different than refugees, btw, they occupy two different immigrant classifications under US code. Back to the service to the world point, Im going to have to guess that OP either suggested admiration as a tangible benefit. To wit, because we dont take in enough refugees, we dont win the worlds respect for the act; therefore, we should abandon the practice. But I am not sure why the amount of refugees the US takes in is a given, as opposed to a variable. The democratically elected US government leaders chose to limit the amount of refugees the country takes in, presumably because there is low public interest in inbound migration for purely humanitarian purposes.If there were more public interest in it, there likely would be more refugee admissions to the US. Whether there are refugee admissions on a meaningful scale is a choice.Arguments that are premised on a variable or a choice, as opposed to a given, are *illusory*. For example, a similar line of argument to your logic could be, Efforts to introduce aggressive gun control laws for handguns are meaningless because US constitution law provides that possessions of handguns is an inalienable right for citizens.This ignores the reality that DC v Heller, the landmark 2008 ruling by SCOTUS on gun rights was a 5-4 decision or that precedents, like Roe v Wade (1973), 7-2 decision, can be overturned based on the political preference of contemporary key policy makers.Thus  just as your premise appears to be illusory, my strawman gun rights illustration is also illusory.A viewpoint that is illusory cannot be valid. It necessitates a change of view, or a correction, so that it has complete logic.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"DROK times my mang, you can't sue the big man in the sky.","title":"Biden slips to lowest approval rating since taking office"},{"text":"As has been pointed out multiple times in the past, 4 years in politics is a long time and a lot can happen in that time frame.

Not because he doesn't want to, but because doing so would be the best thing to have ever happened to the Democrats, since basically all our Liberal voters and a good chunk of our Conservative voters would vote Democrat no matter what. It'd ruin Republican odds of winning the Presidency for at least a decade afterwards, and would practically guarantee Democrat control of the House and significantly increase their odds of getting the Senate if Canada is only admitted as one state (and those odds would get higher the more states are carved out of Canada; if all the provinces become states, that's at *least* ten extra Democrat Senators guaranteed, probably more).

When workers can't report wage theft or unsafe conditions, it drives down standards for EVERYONE. Making their presence legal would eliminate the exploitation you're concerned about.

People will incur the expense from the personal purse when they find doing so value accretive. The externalities are more closely aligned. With HSR, massive costs are imposed on people who have no need or ability to use it, and the ticket prices are below the operating cost. You massively underestimate the cost of maintaining highways and bridges.I do not. By themselves they are expensive. Someone here mentioned $100m for a single interchange. That's a lot right? But **per use**, they are extremely cheap, MUCH cheaper than rail. A mile of interstate highway in the US will cost $30 million to build, will require very little maintenance and will last 10-30 years before it needs to be repaved, (main variable is freeze-thaw cycle). And remember, repaving is cheaper than building new road. So it's not even $30m every time. So a random mile of I-40 will require $30 million to construct, will need sporatic and very light maintenance (like sealing every 5 years) between repavings, and will carry over 400,000,000 vehicles in that time, on average, many with multiple people or freight. This is literally pennies per vehicle per use, and all other costs are privatized except carbon emissions I suppose, which EVs are changing.

Or like just existing policies with extra funding? The legal structure of most of the Vajpayee era policies hasnt actually changed. Yes. As outlined in the reply itself, it was. And extra funding is indeed part of policy. Especially when said funding was nearly doubled and in some cases, the outlay was upped by as much as 75%. Like Vajpayee proposed a GST policy in 1999, but didnt get to pass that. Had the BJP gotten a majority in 1996-2004. Much of the delays in implementation probably wouldnt have happened. Are we giving credit for proposals that don't pass now? Cause if so, Modi trounces ABV then. I dont think an LK Advani admin would have been any different than a Modi government. Ok..You can hate him, but hes undoubtably the most popular BJP CM, &amp; hes an effective communicator that surpasses Modi. I can. And I sure do. He is a a piece of human garbage.I really dont think anything PVNR did was something out of ordinary. Like most of these reforms were advised by the IMF &amp; World Bank, not something initially wanted by the government. No. This is a common myth that even I believed. Most of the reforms I originally listed in the stabilization portion were indeed part of IMF tranches, but the deeper reforms to the regulatory environment and the broader asset regularization and capital market reforms were largely down to MMS and the senior civil service at the time. Though the INF certainly consulted on them.Most of the PVNR cabinet were Congressi loyalists who were forced to implement policies out of pressure from PVNR &amp; the World Bank &amp; IMF. And he lost support within the party for doing so. None of which takes away credit from him. If anything, this shows how bullish he was in the aggressive pursuit of reforms despite in-party backlash. Vajpayee was more ambitious in changing Indias image structurally, which makes me admire him more. I respect PVNR for doing the correct things in stabilizing the economy and cutting red tape that held the country back, but I criticize him for not really making India a competitive nation when it came to domestic economic policy.I criticize Vajpayee for being a disappointment after inheriting an economy ripe for further reform, only to be met with further delay yet to be resolved by any PM since. I credit him for his modest successes where he had them (energy, telecoms, pensions, disinvestment, mild deregulation), but PVNR is simply incomparable when it comes to bold reform delivery that as I've already established, went *far* beyond the gamut of \\"stabilization\\" as you frame it.","title":"Manmohan Singh, who liberalised India's economy and served two terms as PM, dies"},{"text":"That'll lead to Singaporean planners killing themselves.","title":"California Democrats race to secure more funding for high-speed rail"},{"text":"Anyone know how much golfing Trump did while president","title":"Biden heads to St. Croix for final holiday as president"},{"text":"What does Indigenous Knowledge really mean?

All 1994 did was reduce protectionism and end state only monopolies, not actually encourage new privatization.I know the issues of the Electric Grid in India, but without the current structure, most of the grids energy production wouldnt be from private owned power-plants as it is now, but itd be inefficient SOEs with a few privately owned power plants if wed just used PVNRs reforms only. And India does reach its current energy demand annually, it should improve with better regulations and oversight to meet safety concerns, green energy transition and deliver the production, but so far its better than it was before 2003.","title":"Manmohan Singh, who liberalised India's economy and served two terms as PM, dies"},{"text":"I work for a large chemicals company and we recently announced a project in California (Im not going to dox myself so Ill just say trust me bro for the reason) and the immediate response from analysts was are you sure  you can handle their insane building process?","title":"California Democrats race to secure more funding for high-speed rail"},{"text":"Not necessarily true.We buy a lot of things that we don't expect to make money from.

Most of PMGSY was already implemented before Modi with 82% of roads in villages above 250 &amp; 500 people connected before Modi in 2014. And most of that has remained untouched by MMS other than continuing the policy.My actual quote -The PM-GSY would only see substantial *reforms* under Modi **spiritually**, making it deliverable at scale. Mind you, the targets set were for 99% connectivity for communities with a 1000 people and 500 people by 03 and 07, and that latter target was only achieved in *2022*. PMGSY say its peak in implenentation under the [UPA](https://omms.nic.in/dbweb) and most of these roads, particularly rural ones, saw expansion only under the UPA. PMGSY's first phase was plagued with delays and administrative issues that would only see resolution in its third phase with Modi. None of this is touching the issues PMGSY had with contracting, its QM issues, or its funding settlements. The road networks are literally the reason why the BJP &amp; NDA does well in the Northeastern India regions like Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim &amp; Tripura. Modi did more for this than ABV with his funding settlements. The actual electric grid you see in India was mainly through the permitting reforms from the Vajpayee adminThe Indian electric grid is not a point of particular pride, but I do give him immense credit for his reform plans here though. Hope Modi goes further here. On permitting, ABV simply laid thatch roofs over the brick layer by PVNR in his liberalization programme. See his work in 1994 for more. The only thing Modi government really did was add extra funding measures to implement the Vajpayee era infra policies faster than usual. Yes. Delivering policy matters, actually lol. Manmohan Singh has been called the do nothing Prime Minister from his opponents during the UPA era from 2004-2014 &amp; as much I respect MMS, theyre not wrong. I have not spent a character of my response defending MMS. And for PVNRs legacy, its good but most of that didnt do much in terms of creating India to be a leader in anything or increase productivity. The PVNR government barely had any plans for increasing domestic manufacturing (which can be done without protectionism) &amp; he had a weak defense policy imo. Its pretty hard to deal with productivity-oriented and export-based reforms when you have to navigate through not just one, but two economic crises during your tenure, especially whilst still recovering from being on the brink and from decades of maladministration and economic incompetence. If anything, ABV had open slam dunks on this front and failed to close the deal in furthering reforms to agriculture, land, capital markets, labour, etc. ABV tried on energy, but his unwillingness to tackle the factor markets after PVNR set him up so well is disappointing (the same applies to MMS and Modi of course). His defense policy is broadly irrelevant to me personally though. Plus he also made the Waqf board bill of 1995 which basically tanked the Congress party support  from any religious Hindu group. PVNR was a great statesman, but he didnt do any long term plans for increasing Indias Infrastructure or national security, which led to the BJPs big break in 1996 &amp; 1998.The Waqf Bill is bad.

Unfortunately though, due to sprawl oriented planning at the moment, we tend to build *out* over more environment rather than *up* over exisiting urban space. But yes, nature and the environment is an important part of the urban fabric and should be considered in town planning. But when a lot is zoned for construction, the town planners shouldn't be dictating the number of bathrooms, the number of car spaces, whether someone can do accounting in the building or not, etc etc.Also, private market has little incentive to improve homesYes it does? People spend a lot of money to have nice homes. Look at how expensive homes are. People are willing to spend inordinate amounts of money on housing. The problem is that a huge percent of that money is going into the actual land/location due to the artificial scarcity imposed by housing restrictions. Tax the land, lift the zoning, and instead of spending millions on land people can spend millions building nice homes. There are pockets of wealthy rural communities where land is cheap and housing is very, very nice.The way you *remove* incentive for nice homes is through price caps or zoning restrictions. It makes it either impossible to profit from nicer homes or shifts all the money into the land rather than the improvements.This is an example of how homes have been improved by social housing projects. I would absolutely think Government housing projects would be a benefit over the status quo. I'm just saying the status quo is not some neoliberal market. Market reforms will make government housing projects more effective. Making it legal for the government to build, making it legal for businesses to service residents more closely, allowing more heterogeneous communities where social housing blends in etc are all benefits. The status quo is just the worst of everything. housing construction project being treated as a Commodity.The issue is that housing *isn't* treated as a commodity. One of the biggest issues is that housing has been elevated to some sort of sacred *investment*. You don't buy a lump of iron and expect it to just sit there and appreciate in real terms over twenty years. You buy iron and put it to work. The issue is that policy has been repeatedly geared towards allowing land to appreciate despite just sitting there. It is effectively a Ponzi scheme. If housing was as commodified as carrots, we wouldn't be in this mess.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":" I think my understanding of markets is like how science works not some random chaos without a theory  all science is theory laden, meaning there are rules in place even to understand the probabilities and chaos.

The average worker benefits under a co-op, with a dividend, they can physically see the benefits of their labour, as they work harder, the profits increase, as the profit increases, their wage increases. As a result, efficiency should increase. If you are on about the Yugoslavia issue, I have mixed feelings about elected management. Management needs to deal with business issues. Elected management focuses entirely on saving jobs, which in turn causes a lack of efficiency. This, alongside several issues unique to Yugoslavia, is why, in the latter part, the economy began to fail. It goes against many core socialist principles, but I don't see an alternative. About shares, though, as more workers come in and buy shares, the share begins to decrease for the other workers. Although the money from the buying of the share could go towards filling in the lost money, as share prices decrease, management is encouraged to raise wages to stop employees going to smaller businesses, where the share is less diluted. I also like the idea of, say, 70% of the business being owned by workers, and 30% by shareholders, such as the creator of the business, this I feel would still encourage people to make business, as it is possible to make vast sums from a, say 20% share.

Things were slowly improving on a social level for a long time in the most general sense. 200 years ago we had slavery. 100 years ago women couldn't vote. We've moved forward. But in the past couple decades we have been backsliding and it is getting worse. Obama passing the ACA was the *visible* peak of power moving towards Dems. Now it's been receding ever since. Dems did not adapt to the internet. Putin did then Republicans followed. Dems still think traditional politics can win, but they can't. They also haven't figured out trump's game yet, and they fall into all of his traps. Just like the media does. Dems need to start playing as dirty as Republicans IMO. I don't mean the junk like taking bribes and fighting to help our enemies. But I mean conservatives have successfully astroturfed half the internet. Mainly, Dems need to change the way they attack trump and republicans, and do a lot more of it. Right now they try to appeal to people's sense of justice and morality by being the \\"good guys\\" and point out how evil trump is. But trump's fans love his supposed bad boy image. Just like most libs liked Biden's \\"Dark Brandon\\" thing more than the regular nice Biden - not that he did much Dark Brandon stuff but people sure liked the *idea* of a Biden playing hardball and smacking down the republicans. Mainly they need much better PR. In 2025 you gotta scream the same basic ideas over and over and over and over to cut through all the noise. Simplify the message. Stop attacking trump on every minor little goofy thing he says - that's why he says them. Focus solely on his failures and never, ever, ever let them fade from the public eye. And learn to meme. And by god Dems need to win some rural voters. They don't need to win the majority but like how trump is getting a few more % of the black and latino votes, each bit helps a ton. Right now everything past the suburbs is 99% solid red and not willing to change. Dems gotta run spoiler candidates like republicans do. Run a bunch of right leaning libertarians in purple states and districts to take votes from Republicans. In fact, I personally want a libertarian candidate/group to gain actual real power. Left/right is nowhere near as important to me as authoritarian/democratic, and the authoritarianism has always been the worst thing about Republicans. Real libertarianism has far more in common with the current Democrats than the current republicans. I think that social media is such a massive disrupter in politics that we are in a new era. And Dems and liberals and progressives have not adjusted while globally the right wing has. Dems are also way behind because of voter suppression and gerrymandering and how the Senate and EC work. This is why losing the rural vote hurts so much. When Dems and Republicans split the vote 50/50, Republicans win big. Look at NC - Dems won the popular vote in the state legislature 52-47% but Republicans ended up just like 1 seat shy of another supermajority. That has to end, by \\"voting harder\\" or by doing it the way the Founding Fathers did it when England denied them proper representation. Or somewhere in between. Whatever it takes, we are talking about people's lives and people's rights. I live in SC, which was blue 25 years ago. Once Republicans gain control they put 100% of their effort into locking in power permanently by changing the laws to make it so Dems can't win. Dems have to break this because it is what trump is attempting to do nationally and he is most of the way there. Also, Dems need to find a fucking monster stud of a presidential candidate. Not a nice guy. Someone that people see as a strong leader who doesn't take shit. But also someone who truly *doesn't take shit.* But also someone who appeals to the average person, not just to leftists and college professors and whatnot. Not someone like Biden and Harris who think the voters will just see that they are the better option without them spelling it out over and over. That really is the biggest failure of Dems - they can't seem to just spend time bragging about their victories. Biden did so many things he could have been shouting from the rooftops but no one knows he did them. And he basically didn't even talk to people about the economy until it was WAY too late and the GOP had already written the entire narrative. Anyway, Dems desperately need to shift gears and get with the new politics. They don't even have to jettison the old guard - Pelosi and Biden and that crowd are excellent statesmen (or statespeople if that's a word) and are great at negotiating things with other politicians behind closed doors. But they have lost the voters by being completely out of touch, and are way too worried about their personal success vs. success of the party or the people (looking at you, Clyburn). And culturally, liberals and progressives and social libertarians and everyone else who would potentially vote (D) are divided and scattered and no one is unifying them. Putin works to divide us and trump works to unite the far right and scare the center-right into accepting him as a \\"better\\" alternative to the \\"communist\\" Democrats.","title":"Hakeem Jeffries pulls off a pre-Trump power play"},{"text":"I dont favor term or age limits or anything else that restricts democratic choice.

The UK, today, does not build social housing, and these problems are ever-present. I feel that simply aiding in purchasing, although helpful in the private market, does not address the root issues of housing problems.\\nIf you look at the difference between the quality of housing in the UK from, say, 1920 to 1960. The difference is large. Very large. This is an example of how homes have been improved by social housing projects. A visible example exists in the UK.Also, private market has little incentive to improve homes, making it poor in a crisis such as now, when little housing exists.

It would be nearly impossible. Add in that its a state with closed primaries, and youre looking at very bleak odds for removing these completely ensconced politicians. Its sad.","title":"Democrats need to start taking the age issue seriously - Polling shows 79% of Americans support age limits for politicians in Washington.

Corpses lining up on the streets bad. The country was stagnant and sick. If we consider Blairite Labour as part of the neoliberal wave, similar to Keating's Labor in Australia and Clinton's Democrats, then you see *very* significant improvement from 1970-2000. I'm not particularly a large fan of Thatcher, but contrary to what you say, there's an obvious reasons why she was repeatedly re-elected and has such a formidable stature in UK politics.The housing crisis in the UK, much like most housing crises around the world, can be very clearly linked to the insufficient amount of housing being built in the areas people want to live. Housing is one of *the most heavily regulated* goods that exist. The UK has made a number of poor policy decisions which have concentrated economic activity in London (creating a \\"Primate City\\"), very heavily restricted housing development in that city, and then repeatedly rejected reforms that would help alleviate the issue (e.g. scaremongering about the \\"garden tax\\").If we were to slap *On the Housing Question* by Engels in front of all policy makers and rejected both liberal and Proudhonists suggestions for fixing housing and adopted full central planning for construction and allocation, I do not think you would get good results. At the moment there is a one-sided democracy where local residents can veto the construction of new goods that would benefit new residents (who during an approvals process remain only hypothetical). Expanding this democratic control at a local level only exacerbates this issue.If we were to expand the control at a national level, you may avoid the game theory issues of localism and veto points, but you end up with a national government making decisions about where local sidewalks go. You get all the issues of massive bureaucracies removed from realities on the ground conducting mega-projects and you end up with what we've seen has failed dozens upon dozens of times, whether it is the likes of Brasilia or the plannings done by Corbusier or what's gonna be a clear cluster fuck of Noem.What the approach to housing *should* be is the approach that works for so many other areas of the economy. Small scale, organic growth. *Allow* natural expansion and densification. Allow a heterogeneous smattering of build types. The government's role should be in setting up a stable *framework*, e.g. knitting the urban fabric together, but should err to hands off and allow natural experimentation of the actual usage of the land. The unimproved value of land should be taxed, and capital improvements encouraged (instead of discouraged or explicitly banned!)This approach also greatly support housing welfare, whether you want the government to purchase homes (cheaper, more evenly spread, with diverse income groups) or to just provide housing vouchers. You naturally get cheap housing and a salt and pepper spread for low income housing around higher income.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":"I've started really watching them since the end of the election.

Would that mean you should never have been born? If we discover an alien species with a sixth sense, a sixth means of pleasure, does that make humans inherently disabled?What makes a disability a bad thing? I mean, humans are \\"disabled\\" in comparison to fish, because if we are underwater for too long, we lack the ability to breathe, and will therefore die. Does this make us inferior to fish? Does that mean it's better to be a fish than to be a human? Maybe we are still superior to fish because our other abilities outweigh the ability to breathe underwater (after all, they also can't breathe without water).

I'm not entirely sure you're actually asking in good faith and I believe that you believe this stuff. But I will answer this part that you bring up here.Alienation as Marx posited it was more of a critique of industrial society where the creator is separated from the creation as the specialization of labor became commonplace in factories. This alienated the worker from the satisfaction of fully realizing the fruits of their labor. And sure this might suck a little, but there's no way a single person or even a medium sized group of people will fully build out a Boeing 747. There are thousands of complex parts sourced and developed by thousands of people around the world and brought together to assemble one of these. Not to mention the entirely separate design and development team. The grand majority will only see the finished product while flying on one. The fact is that the specialization of labor and subsequently alienation are byproducts of the modern world and this is irrespective of the economic system. The workers in the USSR were just as alienated from the final product as the American worker is today. This is true for the aerospace engineer in Germany as it is for the tabacco farmer in Cuba. While the rest of that statement on low regulation and low exploitative wages deserves its own thoughtful discussion, I'm just going to do a \\"whataboutism\\". In the Socialist/Communist states of the 20th century, weak regulation and low, exploitative wages were not only more common but also more severe than anywhere in the \\"free world\\". Environmental, labor, safety, health financial, banking and monetary regulations were all changed, ignored or abused in the socialist states in service of the state-run/owned businesses whenever it suited them. The state run industries imposed crushingly low wages (there is no competition for labor to drive up the prices) since your only option for working period (but especially in a specific field) was via the state. Additionally the lack of upwards mobility and a focus on rewarding loyalty rathe than performance further created an environment of \\"disposability\\" among workers. The dismal wage disparity can be seen in Cuba today, and not just comparing Cuba to another country like the Dominican Republic (the wage disparity is enormous literally 2,000% more with avg monthly wage in Cuba being $20 USD vs $400 USD in the DR), but comparing Cuba to itself in the 1950s where a comparable agricultural/industrial worker earned more BEFORE adjusting for inflation. After adjusting the disparity is even more pronounced.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":"Itd be funny.","title":"Democracy will hold if you dont obey in advance"},{"text":"My bad. I thought you suggested Hamas isn't active in the West Bank. Which would have been a lie. Or a half truth, at best. The pro-Palestine crowd is just as bad if not worse than the pro-Israel side. The side that *actually* doesn't look like ideologue dipshits are the ones who acknowledge it's an incredibly complicated issue with bad guys and innocents on both sides and that there are no easy solutions. The Israeli government and the Palestinian government both incite violence because it helps keep them in power. Meanwhile the people responsible for Israel taking control in Palestine (I say taking control because much of the land was already owned by Jewish settlers prior to the establishment of Israel so it's more complicated than \\"stolen land\\") are all dead and any sort of forced evacuation or repopulation of Palestinian lands in Israel proper would essentially create the same problems that the establishment of Israel did in the first place. Geopolitics is rarely black and white. Palestinians aren't the good guys, Israel isn't the bad guys. And the reverse is also true. The only way for real change to happen is for the right wing in Israel to lose its grip on power and for the various terror organizations in Palestine to disappear.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"It's such an obviously dumb move to anyone under the age of 50.

I also have ASD, and while it comes with challenges, it's brought unique perspectives and abilities that have enriched my life and those around me. Some of the most brilliant minds in history likely had ASD - should they have been \\"prevented\\" too?The fundamental problem with your argument is determining what counts as a \\"health problem\\" worthy of elimination. Who decides? A mild heart condition? Depression? Nearsightedness? This is a slippery slope that historically has always led to abuse.Those who have already been born should not be forced into any procedure as this would be a violation of bodily autonomy.But pressuring people through financial incentives to get sterilized IS a form of coercion. Many disabled people already face poverty - dangling tax credits would effectively force their hand.Your proposal also ignores that medical advances are constantly improving quality of life for various conditions. A diagnosis that severely impacted someone 50 years ago might be very manageable today. By implementing eugenics, we'd actually reduce the motivation to develop treatments since we'd just be eliminating people with those conditions instead.I'd strongly encourage you to connect with disability rights communities. Your view that disabled lives aren't worth living is exactly the harmful mindset they've been fighting against for decades.

Blair also ensured that waiting lists were at an all-time low, a suggestion that universal healthcare can indeed be free and efficient. For housing, I will use the UK again. Social housing, and it eventually sells off, ruined the UK housing market. Today, the vast majority of homes originally intended to provide affordable housing are in the hands of a few private associations. As a result, homelessness is high, alongside rents. Social housing, again, can be provided cheaply, as it was seen in the UK before Thatcher. The consensus practically rebuilt Britain.

I'm lucky if I can find a picture of some of the people running for local positions.  Beyond that their beliefs and ideas are a mystery to me.  Even at the congressional level most politicians provide nothing but a link to donate on their sites.  The news produces no profiles or useful summaries of their activities.  Furthering providing their lack of practical utility.  Occasionally a regional paper will do some interviews and include a paragraph or two summary of the discussion.

I think some of the back-sliding that the middle class has experienced could have been prevented. If so many Americans were not obsessed with escaping reality through entertainment seeking. Because therapeutic entertainment will never improve a person's life.  It promotes a docile posture that makes an individual an easy mark.Thats the problem with American capitalism. It has leaned on consumerism rather than the foundation of economic price theory.  Prices are supposed to be the most efficient communication channel for information.  I should know what does and does not add value based on the prices of goods. That is supposed to be the magic/ strength of capitalism.  When you pervert that model. With consumerism which thrives on extracting as much money as possible from consumers without delivering value adds. You get the unproductive non society improving capitalism we have now.  Where the seller who simply collects the most payments is king. Not the seller that delivers the most value.  You should look into *The Rise and Fall of America Growth.* The author details how massive value-adding innovations that built our global dominance has generally stopped.  Things like running water, the combustion engine, home-delivered electricity and modern sewage disposal.  These things kick started unprecedented economic growth that made the middle class aristocracy of the 50's through 70's possible.  People want America to be great again. But for that to happen we need to stop rewarding those who make useless expensive gadgets that are addicting and attractive. These products block us from accumulating human capital and becoming better.  Even the semi-conductor failed to deliver the kind of growth that the aforementioned innovations provided.  We have a pernicious consumers economy that predates on malaise by selling expensive knick knacks that can't make people smarter more innovative or more valuable.  So much so that Wall St now destroys any company that can't regularly generate ever-increasing profits every 90 days during an earnings call.  Making it impossible for helpful and value-adding products to get investment. Because there is no short-term profit potential.  Countless CEO's have admitted to divesting in employees and longterm growth to satisfy Wall St investors. The news is dying.  I will pay for it.  But I will not subsidize it like Bezos.  Our society is generating more and more poverty not well-heeled individuals that can sustain subscription-driven reporting.  I don't criticize the news out of disdain. I do it out of fear that they will not be able to exist in a consumerist economy that rewards the loudest most disruptive sellers.

But social democrats (especially in the US) are pretty fucking terrible at actually providing sufficient housing. Its the reason why so many major cities in the developed world have housing shortages, often caused or exacerbated by policy. You can rent-control all you want, but the forces of supply and demand are still there. Unlike in other sectors, efficiency in the construction industry generally *hasnt* increased to partially compensate for this (at least in the US), partly due to regulatory incompetence and partly because its really hard to automate past a certain point.Its the same with food to an extent, although there normally isnt a supply shortage so welfare becomes a lot more reasonable as a way of solving problems, assuming there arent many trade restrictions exacerbating it. This is more true for rich countries though, in poorer countries with less efficient agriculture supply and trade restrictions become more of an issue. The reason nobody starves any more in developed countries isnt just the welfare state, its also that their economies are much wealthier and food has become a lot cheaper and easier to produce en masse.For healthcare, the information asymmetry issues generally lead to market failures, which is why I support a government-funded public option available to all with sharp discounts for the poor (and an individual mandate), like in Switzerland or Germany or Ireland. It harnesses market forces to get very good outcomes with relatively less intervention needed.Single-payer systems get a lot of hype but they dont seem worth the extra effort, so to speak. Theyre hardly immune to political meddling - look at the NIH in the UK, or the VA in the US.","title":"How do you respond to marxist arguments?"},{"text":"Nah.

Also why would you want to kill fungi in your gut? They are typically only doing good fermenting food and making vitamins and amino acids in your intestines that get absorbed into the body, the key component of kefir that separates it from other soured milk is literally fungus. Your natural gut microbiome is what it is for a reason, everything plays a synergistic role unless you are very sick or disrupted it by eating antibiotics, certain drugs or maybe ingested too much chemicals like pesticides.?Also parasites aren't even necessarily 100% bad, there is literally parasitic worm treatment for things like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis which puts people in remission from their symptoms. Again I am not saying you should go around with them but there is a lot of evidence that suggests even parasites can do certain good things like reducing symptoms of autoimmune illnesses and prevent development of such and allergies.There a lot of studies of avermectins showing that they have antibacterial properties, like this one:?https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3553693/\\nEven if it involves tuberculosis antibiotics will kill good bacteria just like they kill bad bacteria.

We are not curious about drama because we are bad. I've read that our interest in gossip has a link to survival. So I blame no one for falling into the salacious story trap.  It's natural.  I try to support local reporters by writing them emails when they report interesting things and by donating.  The substack idea is new to me some maybe that is a sign for optimism about local political reporting.  I am not eager to see newspapers struggling to exist. I want them to be more dominant than social media.  But I have doubts that they can be.  So I fear that their demand \\"you pay for good journalism\\" will end in their own demise. Because it seems like fewer people every year will have the disposable income for such products.  So if a person can't expect to save a significant sum of money from a newspaper subscription. How can they be expected to give the minimal amount of disposable income they do have. To a paper that is mostly providing entertainment and distraction not measurable value adds? Since an increasing majority of our population is lower income and is going to stay lower income for the majority of their lives. In a few years I wouldn't be surprised to see Bezos claim that \\"people don't trust the post enough to pay for it. So it can't exist anymore and I am closing it\\".

Wikipedia says something about them not being the villains the writers wanted them to be and that they were not taken seriously?  I am not going to finish reading the Wikipedia page as this post is not related to startrek.Our country is ruled by corporations that operate exactly on that assumption.  Whether the majority of us agree is irrelevant because those with the most influence in this country live and die by the belief.  That just about everything in fact can be boiled down to dollars and cents.Even when it can't our society has still tried to force the profit motive into every sector we can whether it be religion healthcare or politics. (See mega-churches, for-profit medicine and the ever-increasing role of dark money in politics)How didn't I address advertisers?They funded the news until social media took most of the advertising from the news.  Generally speaking news has always been funded by advertisers. But now that the internet makes it more efficient to advertise on social media.  The lifeline for traditional reporting is wearing thin and looks as if it is on the brink of snapping.I want local journalism to be revived.  Because national papers can not provide information on local politics that voters need to make informed decisions. The problem is that corporations have made running a small business next to impossible because a small business can not overcome the savings that economies of scale produce.  Without those business almost no one has any interest in advertising enough at a local level to support local newspapers. In at least every American county.National papers can barely get by just on ad income. So reporters need a better value proposition than what they have been promoting lately.

Because I pay for subscriptions.  But I used to not and I know I am not better off or better able to conduct my life than when I ignored it.  It largely serves as a distraction.  Unfortunately, the US opened the door for Putin's invasion.  By haphazardly invading Vietnam and Iraq. We claim to support a less violent \\"rules-based order\\" but only when we we're willing to keep our thumbs off the scales.  I never agreed with these conflicts but since I didn't prevent them and am a citizen I have to own them.   That double standard makes Putin's aggression seem less controversial to the rest of the world and posterity. This is evidenced by many uninterested nations not bending over backward for Ukraine. Since the US is leading the propaganda offensive against Putin. While acting as if we have never violated the \\"rules-based\\" model we expect other nations to follow. Regardless I don't need to know about Ukraine. I can't help them, I have no army.  Same with Israel.  The information I learned about COVID was mostly wrong at the end of the pandemic.  I have no problem with the Trump victory. I mention it to demonstrate that honest reporting on the man's issues did not serve as the lever. Defenders of the media would like you to think their reporting serves as. Trump is hilarious and will make the next 4 years rather entertaining. Biden is pathetic to watch and regardless of why, Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump won in 2020.  Which would have given Ukraine more time to strengthen its economy to mount a more effective defense. Trump demonstrates the bankruptcy of our society and its supposed greatness.  I think he is an excellent representative for our nation because he is more relatable to Americans than the leaders who control this country.  He is also representative of the perverse incentives that drive our society. Its high time the world sees us for what we are.  Not an efficient highly effective society capable of almost anything. But a sclerotic gerontocracy of overmarketed strengths that we simply lack and wish he had. Trump is right on a few things even if he is wrong on most things.  I have no animosity for the man and bet he's a hell of a time at a party.  His obsession with being the best at everything is sad for a man his age but I can learn to ignore it.  I want my view changed because I want local journalism to be revived. But when national journalism offers such a weak value proposition.  I don't think it can ever exist locally or even nationally for the foreseeable future.

You have provided little evidence and simply told me a story.  The majority of human mistakes come from assessing reality from a storytelling perspective rather than with empirical evidence.  Beyond major revelations like the Pentagon Papers.  I do not believe that journalism generally contributes to the common good in such a definitive manner. For every big expose on corruption several are stifled because the papers owner wants to protect their wealthy advertisers or allies. Other revelations simply don't move the political needle as much as expected because people either don't care or don't remember them. Or some other force I'm unaware of.In an increasingly top-heavy economy.  The argument that \\"good reporting costs money and helps society so pay up\\" is not enough to justify the expense to the working poor.  These people vote and lack the time and resources to be well-informed on political developments.  So they will forgo subscriptions and vote with their guts rather than their brains. As those who were willing to show up to the ballot box this past November did. Your explanation sounds good.  But I can't be certain of it or even relatively confident in it.

He was sidelined and got no respect from the party because he refused to bend the knee to the Gandhi family.As we pay tribute to Dr Manmohan Singh let us not ignore the contrast of farewells of these two people. Giving complete credit of liberalisation to Dr Singh would be giving support to attempts to erase PV Rao's legacy.After Narasimha Rao passed away, his body wasnt allowed inside the Congress headquarters for ordinary workers to pay their respects.Raos body was taken to Hyderabad for funeral, which was attended by leaders like former PM H D Deve Gowda and BJPs L K Advani. Then Congress President Sonia Gandhi wasnt present there, though.Notably, That night, television channels showed visuals of the half-burnt body (of Rao), skull still visible, lying abandoned.

Wars of conquest need tangible, painful, long-lasting consequences in order to disincentivize tyrants from starting them. Consequences that are a direct affront against the pride of that nation, and more importantly, the legacy of its ruler at the time. Land grabs fit the bill here.And in the case of the Middle East, it clearly works. The history of Israel's conflicts in the region show that none of its hostile neighbors respected them until they realized that if they kept on going to war, pretty soon they were no longer going to exist.Just on a conceptual level here: If you know you can always recoup your losses, what's stopping you, whenever things begin to turn south, from calling a ceasefire, spending a couple years re-arming, and then going at it again over and over 'til you eventually win? Well, the way I see it, absolutely nothing.

Not respond to an invasion of their territory and the slaughter of civilians? Not rescue their citizens who are still being held hostage a year after the invasion? Does Hamas get to make their military infrastructure immune from attack by putting it in civilian areas?We have this blatantly one-sided narrative where apparently Israel is supposed to fight with one hand behind their backs, while it's cool for their enemies to engage in blatant war crimes against them.Palestine elected a terrorist government, whose stated goal was and is the extermination of Israel. They fight a religious war against Israel, with fanatical dedication and no respect whatsoever for international rules. Just like they did on October 7th, they would happily massacre Israeli civilians if given the chance. And, you think Israel should fight that enemy with one hand tied behind their backs? Or, just let that enemy survive, grow and re-arm in preparation for their next slaughter of Israeli civilians?As for your comparison to WW2, the Nazis systemically rounded up civilians and sent them to death camps, executing millions of Jews for the crime of being Jewish. These weren't civilians dying as collateral damage from a war between governments. It wasn't in response to a Jewish government slaughtering German citizens. The Jews weren't holding German citizens hostage. Many Jews were actual German citizens, being executed by their own government. There was no Jewish state committing war crimes against Germany, and these weren't people killed in the heat of battle. These were prisoners in war camps.Go study some history about the Holocaust, and go study some history about Israel, too.If you want to try to condemn the Isrealis from the sidelines for how they are choosing to protect their own people, then you tell me what realistic action they should be taking that will ensure the long term safety of their civilian population. You tell me how they should have responded to an enemy invading their territory and slaughtering their civilians, and how they should be fighting an opponent who uses human shield tactics and treats their own civilian population as a tool to promote their campaign to destroy Israel.The pro-Palestinian crowd seems to have a lot of complaints about Israel, but I have yet to hear any of them present a realistic option for how Israel could deal with their current circumstances better than they have.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"You don't know what the political situation in Australia will be 20+ years from now, when they will actually have Virginia class subs.

It's as if people legitimately don't understand that war inevitably results in civilian collateral damage.

That's how this all started. This wasn't a war that Israel sought out, this was a war started by the Palestinians.You mention 1947. Do you remember what happened in 1947? The UN passed a resolution dividing territory between the Jews and Arabs. The Jews accepted the divide, and the Arabs did not. The Jews declared statehood, and the Arab World united, with countries dozens of times Israel's size invading and trying to wipe Israel off the map.The Jews didn't start this. The Jews are just trying to protect their own. If the government the Palestinians elected would do the same, we wouldn't have fighting right now.Was it average civilians who started the war? No, but we never seem to draw that distinction in any other war (not every Russian is in the army, but we still say Russia invaded Ukraine, because the government represents the people). There is no evidence at all that the Israelis are purposely trying to inflict civilian casualties. In fact, all the evidence is the opposite.

Fragrance formulations have become much weaker in the last decade due to IFRA regulations and restrictions on key ingredients. What you're probably noticing is your own heightened sensitivity - it's a documented phenomenon that many people developed increased sensory sensitivity during lockdowns due to reduced exposure to daily stimuli.I worked in fragrance retail and actually tested vintage vs modern versions of popular perfumes. The difference is stark - modern ones are way more watered down.

In Middle Eastern countries, projecting fragrance is considered positive and respectful.

The significance of the Holocaust isn't about \\"hatred\\" (lots of populations hate each other at extreme levels, even calling for genocide of each other). It is about numerical efficiency of the killing they enacted. The Jewish population is STILL lower than its global levels were before the Holocaust.The Israeli military currently has the same opportunity to be ruthlessly numerically efficient at Nazi levels. They just clearly aren't doing that if you look at the numbers. Yes, they are killing civilians even in unjustified ways. \\"Killing civilians\\" does not make you a \\"Nazi\\" unless you want to say that any country waging a war is equivalent to a Nazi.The Palestinian people are cornered and pretty much no one could stop Israel from something greater than the \\"Bombing of Dresden\\". Which would be AT LEAST 10k deaths per DAY. The casualty numbers are nowhere near that.Then you consider that the number of Hamas members kills seems to be much greater than the percentage in the general population. And it seems like they are targeting Hamas not just random Palestinians for elimination.I won't even get into the fact that Jews were not constantly committing terrorist attacks against German civilians.

This can be indirectly achieved through recognition by other countries. For example, many countries in the United Nations voted to recognize the Communist regime as the legitimate regime of China and drove the Kuomintang regime out. But usually the recognition of a big country is worth the recognition of many small countries.\\"De facto\\" means that a regime actually controls a certain area. For example, the Taliban now actually controls the entire Afghanistan, although not many countries in the world recognize them. In Nolan's Batman movie, Bane blew up Gotham's bridge to the outside world. He actually controlled Gotham, but no one thought Gotham could join the United Nations. This is easy to understand. Regional armed forces that do not participate in international politics are not considered countries. For example, primitive tribes in the Amazon jungle have their own laws and armed forces, and use bows and arrows to attack any strangers who approach, but they are still part of a larger country.Therefore, the United States is a country because the US government actually controls the United States, and Britain has given up its claims on the United States and recognized the existence of the United States as an independent country. It gets both \\"de jure\\" and \\"de facto\\".Similarly, Taiwan is not a country, the Taiwanese government only has de facto, there is no country in the world called Taiwan. Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. They claim that they own the entire Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, but major regimes around the world do not recognize their claims. This is why Taiwan is keen to use money to get some small countries to support them.Now back to Tibet, when the Qing emperor abdicated, he announced that all territories would be handed over to the Republic of China, but the Republic of China was defeated by the People's Republic of China. Later, major countries in the world recognized the People's Republic of China as the only government representing China. Therefore, the People's Republic of China has \\"De jure\\" over Tibet.Tibet declared independence after China entered a state of chaos, but almost no country in the world recognized it (except Mongolia, which also took the opportunity to declare independence, but almost no one recognized Mongolia either, so they were just entertaining themselves). Later, the People's Republic of China took control of Tibet and thus gained \\"De facto\\" .Therefore, Tibet is an indisputable part of China. You asked what would happen if China lost. First of all, there is no if. Secondly, if China lost, Tibet would have to obtain de jure. The history of our world did not happen, so this question is meaningless.Also. yes, the United States was initially called a \\"rebellion\\" and only became a war of independence after it won. Assuming that Britain and major countries in the world did not recognize the United States after that, the United States would still be a regional armed force with only actual control capabilities.","title":"CMV: Nothing is wrong with Xinjiang and Tibet being part of China from a legal pov."},{"text":"Absolutely.

It is being thrown around too muchm and also refers to the Arabs, not (just?) Jews. Hence you see Arabic languages also referred to as Semitic languages. If we were to change the term to discriminatory-towards-Jews, you still wouldnt fit that description in my eyes. One comment outlined that someone not understanding the difference between the two events you mentioned is bad at humanity - I really cannot agree with that at all.I think in principle, the comparison isnt wrong. Despite the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, they have decided to persecute the Arabs within their own territory, as well as those outside. That observation alone stands, and it is a rightful observation. Wars and killing innocent civilians is wrong and those who disagree with that should look inwards before they start debating that which surrounds them.Now, is it the same?On one hand, many Jews, especially the current government, according to their faith of believing they are the Chosen People, believe that Palestinian land is solely theirs. They regard the Arabs as second-class citizens. Because of this, they carpet-bomb cities and pulverise buildings, as retaliation. Most who oppose what the Jews are doing will agree with that. Hamas, Hezbollah and such also play a role - what you think about them has a heavy influence on how you interpret the war.On the other hand, the argument of the Nazis was race, and the supposed subversion of Jews in Europe. They believed that their land is theirs alone (blood and soil policy), and sought to get rid of the Jews completely. At first they sought to have them migrate elsewhere - French Madagascar was an early idea. Because of logistical and political reasons, this did not become reality. Other western countries also refused to take in German Jews. The Haavara agreement at last was a deal to allow for migration into Palestine. But as you most likely know, all of these prior ideas did not become reality. Instead, they murdered Jews in the east by various means. That includes not only gas chambers in extermination (and labour) camps like Auschwitz, but also direct executions by the Einsatzgruppen. They sought to germanise Eastern Europe, getting rid of the Jews in the process, brutally.At last, the differences become quite obvious. What is happening in Gaza is surely tragic. But it is also nothing unique in terms of modern warfare. Palestinians are not being put into gas chambers, nor are they being mass-executed by other means. Many of them die, a large amount also by bullets, however it must also be stated that the Jews possess means by which they could kill them much more effectively, as deranged as that may sound, which they do not utilise. This highlights not only the differences between the Nazis and Zionists, but also the reality of the mission of the Zionists.What the Zionists are doing is murder. No doubt. Is it planned, systematic mass murder? No. Could it be discrete mass murder? There is no way to answer this question right now, as the conflict in Gaza is ongoing.I hope this answer is less polarised and more transparent as some of the other answers youre getting.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"I think its a bit misleading though to say that theyre preventing trans healthcare forever.

I think we are all familiar with the story of how the Nazis gained power and then advanced more and more antisemitic laws targeted at Jews to deprive them of rights, citizenship, and property. This eventually led to the mass executions of Jews in Germany either in camps or by bullets. The thing is, this did not only take place in Germany. It happened across multiple countries, transcending language and culture and saw those other countries aid and collaborate with the Nazis to carry out their genocide.95% of Jews living in Poland in 1939 would die in the Holocaust. The Israel Palestine conflict is fundamentally a land and border dispute conflict. Israel very well may be committing genocide in Gaza currently, but in no way is it comparable to the Holocaust as I think nothing really compares to the Holocaust, it is unique historically.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"Good for you.

The closing date was revised to the first quarter of 2025 from the third or fourth quarter of 2024 previously. Nippon paid a hefty premium to clinch the deal last December in an auction, but the deal faced opposition from the powerful United Steelworkers union (USW), as well as politicians. Biden has said he wants U.S. Steel to be domestically owned and operated, while President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to block the deal after he takes office in January. On Monday, the committee that vets foreign deals in the U.S. for security concerns referred the decision whether to approve or block the deal to Biden. He has 15 days to decide, and if he takes no action, the merger will get an unexpected green light. \\"Nippon Steel hopes that the President will use this time to conduct a fair and fact-based evaluation of the acquisition. We remain confident that the acquisition will protect and grow U.S. Steel,\\" the company said on Thursday. U.S. Steel shares were up 1.7% before the bell. They have never hit the offer price of $55 per share, signaling investor worries over the timeline for the deal's completion. Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urged Biden to approve the merger to avoid marring recent efforts to strengthen ties between the countries, Reuters reported in November. Nippon also said on Thursday the review process of the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice was also underway, without specifying when it may end. Despite the opposition, U.S. Steel shareholders overwhelmingly voted in April to approve the acquisition. The two companies have also worked to assuage concerns over the combination. Nippon has offered to move its U.S. headquarters to Pittsburgh, where the U.S. steelmaker is based and promised to honor all agreements in place between U.S. Steel and USW.","title":"Nippon Steel pushes deadline to close U.S. Steel deal as Biden decision looms"},{"text":"Or claim that he did it first: \\"I declared it in my head when I declassified those documents.\\"","title":"Biden's legacy will forever be cemented *mic drop*"},{"text":"Executive orders cant override laws.

You see that a lot with lost cause and neo-confederates in the US to defend the slavers rebellion.  But there is a problem there.  In the framework of that time, there were a LOT of abolitionists. There were leaders and plenty of Americans alive in George Washington's time calling slavery a horror and inhumane, so I sure can say that today.  There were entire states passing laws against slavery on moral grounds of it being evil.  Also make sure we aren't just looking at those whose writings have survived.  Almost all of what we read before the civil war when men were far from home with a working post-office was written by the elites.  If we let the business and rich elites' control all that is said today, how different would that look than the reality that most of us live?   And we are focused in this case on one area, the United States, one of the few nations yet to abolish chattel race-based chattel slavery.   I do hope in 200 years people don't look back on this time and look in certain geographic areas and see honor killings and think that way.  That hey, a man killing his 13-year-old daughter for being raped was just something some people in our times did and shouldn't be judged for that.  Nope... I can think TODAY that honor killings are immoral and evil... Someone 200 years from now sure can as well.  They don't have to say that since it's accepted by the elites and others in certain areas it's morally grey to us here today.  And I sure hope in 200 years we are judged for our shortcomings.  How many of them are based on us closing our eyes for greed.   If in 200 years they say \\"you morons, why were you still destroying the world with fossil fuels when you could have invested more into renewables\\" good on them.

One faction is the Musk-like, technocratic transhumanist group, and the other is the religious right. The two are in alliance because the transhumanists dont want to face the policy and ethical probes they'd get from the Democratic Party, and the religious right wants to end the multi-religious, secular society that has been growing over the generations.Theres a couple on YouTube that I find both interesting and frustrating. They try to bridge the gap between these two groups, but its clear to me that theyre essentially transhumanist liberals who leaned right because it made more sense politically, rather than from any inherent philosophical belief. I dont think Trump is really part of either group. Hes not a transhumanisthe doesnt understand technology well enough to care about itand hes definitely not a Christian in any meaningful way. He might believe in some vague form of a higher power, but ultimately, I think he kind of worships himself as a god. Neither group really needs him beyond passing laws that benefit them. Theyve both got their own agendas, and Trump is just the vehicle to make them happen.Theres an inevitable clash between the two factions, and Trump will have to choose a side. Whichever side he backs more heavily is going to be the faction that sticks with him, and the other will eventually break away, trying to remove him or those close to him from power. If Trump backs the transhumanists, the religious right will turn against him. If he sides with the religious right, the transhumanists will do the same.Personally, I prefer the transhumanists over the religious right, even though I do have my own religious beliefs. I prefer that people have the option to choose their life path. Trying to force Christianity on people, especially in America, will only lead to resentment and the eventual despising of religion. You can enforce a society that dresses and talks like its Christian, but unless it comes from a persons heart, its meaningless. It damages peoples souls for the sake of creating a facade of saintliness, which, to me, goes against everything Christianity stands for. The goal of Christianity is to convert through ethics, spirit, and personal examplenot through enforcing a very particular lifestyle.","title":"Biden, Trump send different Christmas messages"},{"text":"Money.Money is the answer.
