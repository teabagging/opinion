Youd have to be extremely disconnected from current events or an intentionally low-information voter to not have formed a strong opinion about either candidate by now.

And Im your losing candidate for state Senate District 37.Behind that defeatist and unorthodox introduction is a serious point Barr is trying to make about the state of American politics. In many state legislative and congressional districts across the country, aggressive gerrymandering has helped erase competitive elections, effectively guaranteeing the result and leaving voters without a real choice.Barrs opponent, incumbent state senator Vickie Sawyer, who ran unopposed in 2022...  At a recent forum on aging, Sawyer brought up unprompted her support for a bill that would require sheriffs to detain undocumented immigrants who have been charged with a crime, even if they have made bail  so they cant kill our children, she said. Sawyer did not respond to a request for comment.-The effort by Democrats to run candidates everywhere regardless of their electoral chances is in part philosophical, a commentary on an undemocratic system that picks winners and losers.**Advocates of the strategy say it is also politically pragmatic to have down-ballot Democratic candidates campaigning in conservative areas that the party has long ignored, especially in swing states*A 2021 study in Missouri by Every State Blue found that having a Democrat on the ballot in a state legislative district increased the vote share for the top of the ticket by 1.5 percent.*In Florida, a state where Republicans dominate in a highly gerrymandered legislature, a Democrat is running in every state legislative district this year.

[This study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/political_extremism.pdf) show that even just asking people to explain how complicated political plans work weakens their trust in it (although not asking them to give reasons for why it's a good idea). Asking people to explain policies in detail both undermined the illusion of explanatory depth and led to attitudes that were more moderate (Experiments 1 and 2). Although these effects occurred when people were asked to generate a mechanistic explanation, they did not occur when people were instead asked to enumerate reasons for their policy preferences (Experiment 2). Finally, generating mechanistic explanations reduced donations to relevant political advocacy groups (Experiment 3).Basically, ask what the Democratic party should do instead regarding foreign wars. Ask if they're opposed to specific foreign wars, or to most wars, or to every single war on principle. (You may want to ask about WWII, since that's an obviously good one for leftists, but don't dwell too long on it). If it's specific wars (probably Israel/Palestine, maybe Russia/Ukraine), ask them to describe what the US is currently doing there in those countries. Feign lack of understanding if you must, but get them to describe exactly how the US is involved in these wars.Incorporate active listening, namely, with the goal of trying to learn about their side instead of arguing why you're right. [This is effective at long-term reducing transphobia](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/transphobia-and-canvassing.pdf) during door-to-door canvasing, for example.Ask for their plan for ending the war, and how the US should be involved, if at all. Ask how they think Netanyahu should handle the situation. Ask how Abbas should handle it. Ask how Abbas can meaningfully reign in Hamas. Ask how other Middle Eastern countries could be involved, and what their goals are. The point is to get them to understand that the situation is complicated, and the easiest way to do that is to have them explain it to you in the first place. Heck, maybe you'll even learn something useful from them.","title":"Help me explain to leftists.."},{"text":"And I thought college-educated people seem to be swinging even more dem this cycle.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 18, 2024 - 18 days until election day!"},{"text":"Historia regum Britanniae was written between 1136 and 1147 ,mostly due to hard time finding historical sources.

Just unbelievable numbers. Voting today surpassed each of the last 2 days to be the second biggest day after money, probably due to it being the weekend now.

Rather, the polls are more accurate this cycle because they adjusted the weight of each demographic to more accurately predict support for Trump. Maybe the polls say +2 in a swing state because shes +2 in a swing state instead of Biden being +6 in the polls but the same +2 when the votes are counted. When all is said and done, I think were going to have a very similar result as in 2020 and I think the polls for the most part are going to be pretty accurate. If anything, I think its more plausible that pollsters are under representing the support Harris has from woman voters as well as disenfranchised republicans that cant stand Trump. If you havent noticed, shes been pushing that a lot. There are also abortion amendments on a lot of ballots as well as some pretty horrible down ticket candidates like Robinson in NC and Lake in Arizona that could potentially drag low propensity voters from showing up.Well see.","title":"Kamala Harris continues to underperform in critical states"},{"text":"She is just following orders.","title":"Why Harris Remains Unlikely to Break From Biden on Israel and Gaza"},{"text":"I voted against him but haven't been happy with Biden/, the Democrats and haven't been planning to vote for either. After the VP debate waltz dismissal of free speech bothered me, that was my biggest take away from the left on the debate. That didn't change my mind on anything however discussing it in reddit and with my friends actually concerned me so much how quick people were to dismiss the importance of free speech that I actually considered voting for Trump/against Kamala for about 2-3 days. After 2-3 days I realized they're unlikely to actually propose any policy and even if they did it'd never pass Congress or the supreme court and Trump is frankly terrible so that didn't last long.A few days ago I hear Kamala say she's giving 20k to black people to start small businesses and I think if that's true I'm voting against her, that's ridiculous. In reality it was just rhetoric and her actual policy proposal doesn't discriminate by race. I used to consider myself a far left progressive but the left has kept marching left leaving me thinking they're both crazy and the best option is that they balance one another.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Kind of cringe but I guess he thinks this helps him get some more of the populist vote.

Many of his speeches have phrases almost 1-1 with speeches Hitler gave (just recently he tried to rally his base against an \\"enemy within\\" to incite military violence against citizens he doesn't like, which is exactly the wording Hitler used to rally his base against jews), he's openly admitted he wants to be a dictator, he's good friends with many dictators who know how to manipulate him so the US would basically be in their pocket, he incited the first non-peaceful transition of power because he convinced himself the only way he could lose if it was rigged, and he's using that to justify \\"fixing\\" the problem that people have to vote in order for him to be elected. We saw in his first term that many of the guardrails put in place to prevent people like him getting away with attempted authoritarianism crumble when the rest of the government goes along with it. The supreme court has granted him immunity for \\"official acts,\\" meaning he could likely get away with making good on those promises of political violence, and above all he just wants power. I have my grievances with many other republican presidents, but I cannot tell you that they didn't care about our country, the laws that govern it, and the people that live here. Trump has no beliefs outside of his own quest for power. He will do whatever it takes to retain power, and what that means is appealing to his base of fascists by destroying the guardrails of democracy that prevent him from doing that.On top of that, I am a member of a notable marginalized group whose rights are on the line.

And *she* should be forced to take a cognitive test.The projection is baffling no?Before I continue, I'd like to bring your attention to a quote from Trump back in 2016. He had just received the frontrunner nom and was being interviewed by a reporter when he said the following:  When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different.Believe it or not, Donald Trump actually tells the truth sometimes. Here he is admitting to having the mental and emotional capacity of a child. Which is why we constantly hear him resorting to these kinds of childish remarks that essentially amount to:*\\"I know you are, but what am I?\\"**\\"Im rubber and you're glue!\\"**\\"They started it!\\"*While the media and the general public has all but sane washed this narcissistic manchild...I think Harris should challenge him to a live, cognitive battle...Since Trump is so adamant about Harris's mental unfitness, they should go head to head in a battle of wits.Trump will claim he already took a \\"cognitive test,\\" but in reality, this test, referred to as MoCA, is basically used to determine whether you're a vegetable. It involves asking patients to repeat words, identify pictures of animals and draw clocks set to a specific time.Donald Trump took a \\"cognitive test\\" that a child could pass. Yet as a result, he was deemed to be in \\"excellent\\" health. This was also four years ago mind you, and it's obvious to anyone who can pass a test like MoCA, that Trump's mental state is deteriorating.Trump should have been disqualified long ago. If any of us observed one of our relatives behaving like Trump does, if grandpa was posting the things Trump posts on Truth Social, or if grandpa was rambling incoherently like Trump does at rallies, during press conferences, interviews and town halls, we would be very concerned. But very few of Trump's supporters want to acknowledge this. In fact, they're not concerned, they're onboard with the insanity...Trump and his supporters think it's unfair that Biden dropped out of the race now that it's been shown that Harris has a better chance of defeating him. But not too long ago, these same people were demanding that Biden be removed from office because of his cognitive decline... If these people cared at all about democracy, they would be consistent in their beliefs that Joe Biden isn't fit for the presidency. But it was never about that, it was always about demonizing Trump's opponent.I mean, ffs, they're literally using the same exact playbook for Harris, coincidentally attacking her cognitive function in one of the most brazen attempts at projection I've ever seen.And keep in mind, the few Republicans that have broken from Trump have been ostracized, vilified and cast out. Some of these people worked closely with Trump and in the highest levels of government during his administration, and now they're warning Americans that Donald Trump is the one who is unfit, dangerous and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House again.","title":"Kamala Harris questions Trumps stamina: Is he fit to do the job?"},{"text":"Call Alex Jones!

There seems to be an adjustment being made since trump outperformed the polls in 2016 and 2020, but that doesn't mean it will happen this time so they could very well be over biasing for trump this year. Elections are just really hard to poll since you have to figure out who will actually bother to vote, and a lot of things can change in 4 years so adjusting for past elections could cause you to be way off because those factors that caused that are no longer relevant. So they are often wrong and sometimes very wrong. Like the famous Dewey defeats Truman happened because everyone believed the polls that Dewey was going to win in a landslide. Everyone thought Kerry had defeated Bush because of exit polls that were way off. in 2012 everyone was annoiting Romeny because of the polls. And of course 2016 when no one saw trump winning because of bad state polling showing Clinton getting at least 270. So don't focus on polls too much, they are not good at predicting the actual election.

This means the best pollsters have largely slowed down and/or stopped entirely, since their results are just being lost in the noise of an absolute FIREHOSE of GOP-funded polls over the past 3-4 weeks intended to make the aggregated results appear better for Trump. This benefits the aggregators (like 538) and the media because it allows them to claim the election is a nail-biter, which drives engagement. Because of this, they give those GOP-funded polls *some* weight (albeit lower than the weight of quality polls) and add them to the pile in their analysis. If there are, say, 30 garbage polls and 5 quality polls, then even though the quality polls have very high individual weight they are under-represented in the aggregated results by the sheer quantity of garbage polls with very little individual weight. But the truth is nobody really knows what's going to happen on election day, so GOTV and enthusiasm are almost definitely going to win this election -- and those metrics are almost assuredly in Harris's favor.","title":"Kamala Harris has won over 60% of undecided voters in past month: poll"},{"text":"Subscribed to post just to see comments.","title":"What do you think would happen if the nation split in two between the major parties?"},{"text":"Because trump is a well-known champion defender of Muslims.","title":"Anti-Israel Group 'Abandon Harris' Expands into Battlegrounds Wisconsin and Georgia 'To Ensure Kamala Harris Loses the Swing States'"},{"text":"Those are all Trump voters prior to the conflict, just trying to trick a few people into not voting for Harris.","title":"Anti-Israel Group 'Abandon Harris' Expands into Battlegrounds Wisconsin and Georgia 'To Ensure Kamala Harris Loses the Swing States'"},{"text":"A vote for Stein is just a vote for Trump.

Harris remains 18 points below Bidens 2020 level of support with Arab-American voters.Among Muslim voters in Wisconsin, Harris trails Stein, 44 percent to 39 percent, while Trump holds only 8 percent of the vote, according to a poll from Marquette University.","title":"Anti-Israel Group 'Abandon Harris' Expands into Battlegrounds Wisconsin and Georgia 'To Ensure Kamala Harris Loses the Swing States'"},{"text":"Sounds about Russian.","title":"Anti-Israel Group 'Abandon Harris' Expands into Battlegrounds Wisconsin and Georgia 'To Ensure Kamala Harris Loses the Swing States'"},{"text":"I follow him from the cheap seats, but do have my binoculars on sometimes to see some of the details.

Obama who was and is more aware that religious voters are increasingly irrelevant to Democrats.Without the religious relevance affecting a formerly huge subset of voters, it's not strategically, militarily, nor economically relevant to us, and is an outright diplomatic burden. Strategically speaking the Levant has little to no value historically (no empires kept their power bases there) and today (no influence over oil.) Militarily they've done * all in any US wars, having been absent in both nearby Iraq *twice* and the most \\"war against terrorism\\" war, known as Afghanistan. Utterly irrelevant to us.Economically speaking they have no influence over any critical resources like oil, not part of a huge trade union (see EU,) nor do they produce anything of such value that they're an essential global economic cog (see Taiwan's semiconductor fabs.)Having Israel revert to *normal* relations appropriate for an irrelevant area (see Syria's 10+ civil war nobody bothers to intervene in) rather than on some \\"Holy Land\\" pedestal is all that's needed to rein it in.Without US \\"special relationship\\" diplomatic support it's a few short sanctions (most common form of diplomatic protest) from everyone around and Israel's critically import dependent (most prominent example being oil) economy and military revert to normal.  \\"Normal\\" being the economies and militaries seen in that area like Lebanon, Syria, Jordan. If severe enough maybe even *Gaza.* And there are quite a lot of countries even outside the region who are irate enough over Israel's policies to make it that severe.The mere *mention* that Harris might consider reverting Israel to a normal relationship would do.

Its going to be a fight, an ugly fight, said one Liberal MP, who is a Trudeau supporter and did not want to be identified, in an interview with The Hill Times. [...] Liberal sources told The Hill Times that the dissenting group of MPs has representation from coast to coast to coast, including women MPs, visible minority MPs, those seeking re-election, and those who are not. They added that the strategy for handling the upcoming Oct. 23 caucus meeting has not yet been finalized, and will likely continue to evolve until the last minute. This past week saw a flurry of activity within the Liberal caucus, with MPs calling each other to gauge where they stood on the leadership issue. Reporters were also reaching out to MPs for their opinions on whether Trudeau should be replaced. There was a sense of suspicion among some MPs, with some describing calls from their colleagues as spy calls aimed at finding out who supported Trudeau, and who wanted him to step down. One challenge Trudeaus supporters faced was the uncertainty over the identity of a group of more than 20 MPs pushing for change, as their list was never made public. Even Liberal MPs who back the prime minister privately acknowledged that, based on conversations over the past few months, an estimated 60 per cent of the caucus is concerned that if the leader isnt changed, the party will lose the next election. However, they were unsure how those MPs would act in Wednesdays caucus meeting. A Liberal source familiar with these private discussions claimed that while cabinet ministers are publicly backing Trudeau, they are not privately discouraging the 20-plus MPs who are calling for his resignation. Some MPs told The Hill Times on Oct. 17 that they each received around 20 calls from reporters within 24 hours, all focused on the Liberal leadership. Media reports on Oct. 17 suggested that four cabinet ministers will not seek re-election, and that a cabinet shuffle is expected in a few weeks. Those ministers include Sports Minister Carla Qualtrough (Delta, B.C.); Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario Filomena Tassi (Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas, Ont.); National Revenue Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau (Compton-Stanstead, Que.), and Northern Affairs Minister Dan Vandal (Saint Boniface-Saint Vital, Man.). Tassi, Vandal and Qualtrough later confirmed on social media or issued statements to confirm they wont re-offer in the next election. MPs interpreted this announcement as part of a PMO strategy to keep potential cabinet hopefuls engaged and on their side. This past week, some MPs requested that the national caucus chair Brenda Shanahan (Chateaguay-Lacolle, Que.) extend Wednesdays caucus meeting beyond the usual two hours, given the importance of the leadership discussion. However, as of print press time on Oct. 18, the request had not been approved. Typically, when the House is in session, all parties hold their respective private national caucus meetings for two hours, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. In interviews with The Hill Times, some MPs and political operatives who want Trudeau to resign said that they plan to respectfully urge the prime minister to reconsider leading the party in the next election. They will point out that the party has begun losing byelections in traditionally safe Liberal ridings, has trailed the Conservatives by a 15-20 point margin for more than a year, and that even Liberal candidates are no longer using the prime ministers name in their campaign materials in byelections. [...] MPs who support Trudeau argue that the dissenting group should not have taken their case to the media to push for his removal. Instead, they believe this conversation should have happened within caucus first. Im a little upset and disappointed in the sense that this grouping of people, whoever they might be, could have brought it to the caucus in a very tangible way in hopes that wed be able to resolve their concerns before they attempted this, said Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Man.), parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, in an interview with The Hill Times. So I dont think they gave the caucus a fair shake, and, at the end of the day, theres a lot of people who are disappointed in that, that are hoping for us to do well. However, members of the dissenting group say they have been making serious efforts to have this talk for months, but claim they have been effectively blocked by the caucus chair and the PMO at every turn. They highlight that, after the Toronto-St. Pauls, Ont., byelection loss in June, nine MPs sent a written request to Shanahan for a discussion, but it was denied for logistical reasons. In the last two caucus meetings, both the rural caucus chair and the Atlantic chair conveyed that their colleagues wanted to discuss Trudeaus leadership. However, at every caucus meeting and during the summer retreat, the agenda was packed in such a way that this issue couldnt be raised. These MPs argue that this is a serious conversation that cannot be resolved in just five to 10 minutes, or even within an hour. They believe the leadership should have granted the request from the nine MPs in June, and scheduled a special caucus meeting dedicated to this discussion Who are they kidding? The request was made [in June]. You think that request just disappeared and somebody withdrew the request,? They said, no, were good. That request was standing. It still stands. Whats the difference? It was made four months, five months ago, said an MP who wanted Trudeau to step down. They [the PMO] should not assume that people arent going to resort to other ways to get their message out. This message was already attempted. They blocked that attempt, and they tried to manufacture compliance. This MP and others said that after their June request for an in-person caucus meeting was denied by the caucus chair, most MPs used their one-on-one conversations with Trudeau to urge him to change his senior staff and to shuffle his cabinetamong other suggestionsbut no action has been taken. Lamoureux and others who share this view argue that by starting this leadership conversation, their colleagues are aiding Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievres (Carleton, Ont.) Tories. Lamoureux said that if Trudeau does not lead the party in the next election, he is unsure whether he himself would seek re-election. The Hill Times reported on emails sent by Liberal MPs Chandra Arya (Nepean, Ont.) and Yasir Naqvi (Ottawa Centre, Ont.) to all caucus members saying that it would be a mistake to change the leader at this time, and any such discussion would only help the Conservatives. For about two weeks, The Hill Times and other media outlets have been reporting on a group of more than 20 Liberal MPs pushing for a leadership change, primarily due to concerns that the party has been trailing the Conservatives by 15-20 points for over a year. According to a recent seat projection by Polling Canada, if an election were held today, the Conservatives would win 224 seats, the Bloc Qubcois 43, the Liberals 39, the NDP 35, and the Greens two. These MPs and Liberal insiders insist they are raising these concerns in the partys best interest, as they believe Canadians have tuned out the prime minister. They emphasize that, like the majority of the caucus, they hold genuine respect for Trudeau, but fear that without a leadership change the Conservatives could win more than 200 seats. They also stress that these concerns reflect the views of their constituents who are worried that the progress made by the party on issues like pharmacare and other progressive policies will be undone if the Conservatives were to come to power. On Oct. 16, four-term Liberal MP Sean Casey (Charlottetown, P.E.I.) publicly called for Trudeaus resignation. Before that, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather (Mount Royal, Que.) said that the party should hold a robust caucus discussion on who should lead the party in the next election. In June, after the Liberals lost the Toronto-St. Pauls byelection, Liberal MP Wayne Long (Saint John-Rothesay, N.B.) demanded Trudeaus resignation in an email to his colleagues. Prior to the start of the national Liberal caucus retreat, Liberal MP Alexandra Mends (Brossard-Saint-Lambert, Que.) said that her constituents dont want Trudeau to lead the party in the next election. Back in January, Liberal MP Ken McDonald (Avalon, N.L.) publicly called for Trudeaus leadership review but, after pushback from the centre, recanted it. Both McDonald and Long are not reoffering in the next election.","title":"Expect an ugly fight over Trudeaus leadership at national Liberal caucus meeting, say Grit MPs"},{"text":"I want to believe Trump is just running a horrible campaign because he's a buffoon surrounded by bigger buffoons.

Also, your 4 voter analogy assumes equal influence, but in practice, the current system concentrates power in swing states.

They also tend to take shots at white men as a safe target.I watch Dropout, a comedy platform with a large left wing bend to its politics, a fair bit, and I mostly enjoy it.  But here are a few jokes that made me uncomfortable:1.  A contestant on a game show was given a grid of white male faces, and asked which ones had internalized misogyny.  The answer was that they all did, because all men have internalized misogyny.  If you want to make a point about gender fine, but notice you have to notice they didn't put any other races in the grid.  Do other men not have internalized misogyny?2.  Another joke that white men don't go to therapy.  Again, didn't see how 'white' helped here.3.  A gay, female contestant yelling to other female contestants that they should never date men.It's a consistent theme in left wing spaces.  Growing up everyone talked about how big an issue gender gaps in higher education were.  Well, now women make up the majority of law school and med school students, and no one cares about that any more.I'm solidly a democrat, but I completely get how young men might be turned off by a political viewpoint that treats them as punchlines.","title":"Democrats Problem With Male Voters Isnt Complicated"},{"text":"That's not why I roll my eyes. \\"Progressive\\" is meaningless. https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/g46swe/what_exactly_does_progressive_mean/Yet, people write and talk about day after day as though it were  not only actually \\"a thing,\\" but so important to our lives.

If six or more of the 13 keysall true/false statementsare false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose the election. Should five or fewer be false, it is expected to win.Based on this model, Lichtman has officially predicted that Harris will win the election, though the system is not without its critics.\\"Well, the shakiest key is the foreign policy success key,\\" Lichtman said during a live-streamed interview on YouTube on Wednesday in response to a question about which keys the Democratic Party could be in danger of losing.\\"I gave that to the administration because it was [President Joe] Biden...who put together the coalition of the West that stopped Putin from conquering Ukraine and going after our NATO allies and deeply endangering America's national security.\\"Newsweek reached out to the Harris campaign for comment via email.While he said American support had kept Ukraine \\"alive\\" for more than two and a half years, even enabling the Eastern European country to make an incursion into neighboring Russia, he caveated that \\"wars are fluid.\\"\\"And I suppose there could be a catastrophe in Ukraine,\\" the American University professor said.In an email to Newsweek on Friday, Lichtman clarified: \\"It is just the shakiest comparatively because wars are uncertain.\\"However, by now I am confident it will not flip. Even so, a flip would not change the prediction because Harris has a two-key cushion with four negative keys.\\"**The 13 keys, as set out by the historian in a 2012 article for the Social Education journal, are: Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections.* No primary contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.* Incumbent seeking re-election: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.* No third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.* Strong short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.* Strong long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.* Major policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.* No social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.* No scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.* No foreign or military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.* Major foreign or military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.* Charismatic incumbent: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.* Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.","title":"US election \\"Nostradamus\\" identifies possible Kamala Harris weak spot"},{"text":"Trump is scared.

Removing residential construction jobs from the total, more than 1.3 million construction and manufacturing jobs have been created under the Biden-Harris Administration. And this agenda is spurring union jobs: the U.S. now has 400,000 more union workers than in 2021. To date, American workers are advancing over 60,000 projects thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law C projects to rebuild deteriorating bridges, make roadways safer, upgrade ports to be more efficient, modernize airport terminals, and expand public transit and passenger rail services, including the first high-speed rail system that will be operational on American soil. And, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Laws Build America, Buy America Act, all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in federally-funded infrastructure projects are required to be produced in America. Together, these projects are strengthening the American economy by fortifying supply chains and lowering costs, improving Americas global competitiveness, and creating millions of good-paying jobs that bring people into the middle class.*Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration:** More than 16 million new jobs have been created, including 1.7 million construction and manufacturing jobs C with construction employment at a record high since data collection started in 1939. \\n * During the previous administration, from January 2017-December 2020, 172,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.    \\n* More than 700,000 transportation sector jobs have been created C including pilots, port workers, bus drivers, rail engineers, and others. \\n* Investment in the construction of new factories has nearly tripled.   The country has reached the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. \\n* American workers are advancing over 60,000 projects to rebuild Americas infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, ports, and more through our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Learn more about the impact of President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by the numbers.And the Biden-Harris Administration is creating training pipelines to ensure all Americans can access the hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs created by the Presidents Investing in America agenda. The Administration has made the largest federal investment in U.S. history in Registered Apprenticeships and has launched nine Investing in America Workforce Hubs across the country that are bringing together unions, local governments, employers, training providers, schools, community colleges, and other stakeholders to facilitate partnerships to train and connect workers to jobs in high-demand sectors. Secretary Buttigieg and other senior administration leaders have visited union facilities and community colleges across the country meeting the workers, apprentices, and pre-apprentices who are vital to building tens of thousands of projects as part of our Infrastructure Decade.*Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Project Highlights** The Brightline West High Speed Rail project will be Americas first true high-speed passenger rail system connecting Las Vegas and Southern California. It is expected to create 35,000 construction jobs, 1,000 permanent positions, and carry 8 million passengers a year when completed in 2028. Additionally, the trains will be manufactured in upstate New York, specifically the American Pioneer 220 (AP220), in Americas first high-speed rail production facility. The site will create roughly 300 jobs in the local community, including electro-mechanical assemblers, quality management, quality control, industrial production and test engineers, project management, supply chain management and logistics employees. Because of the work of the Biden-Harris Administration, it is estimated that more than 95 percent of the total direct dollar expenditures for the Brightline West project will be spent on domestically sourced products and labor. \\n* The Hudson River Tunnel project will build a new two-track rail tunnel from the Bergen Palisades in New Jersey to Manhattan, directly serving New York Penn Station and rehabilitating the existing North River Tunnel. Its expected to create more than 72,000 jobs in the region. The existing North River Tunnel serving Penn Station is more than 110 years old and was severely damaged during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. While the tunnel has been repaired frequently, its age and damaged condition present reliability concerns for more than 200,000 people who travel through the tunnel on more than 400 trains every weekday.  \\n* The Blatnik Bridge Replacement project will replace the current Blatnik Bridge, a major connection between the cities of Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, that is otherwise at risk of closing within the next ten years due to decaying infrastructure. The updates will help prevent fatalities and serious injuries that are seven to ten times higher than the state averages and improve employment access for approximately 6,000 daily commuters. Additionally, the project is expected to create nearly 10,000 construction jobs and ease lengthy detours that regional freight currently experiences. Additionally, the MnDOT has developed a contract with the Duluth Workforce Center for outreach to groups underrepresented in the heavy construction trades while also leveraging its workforce development program with Duluth Public Schools, which will create good-paying, union jobs within the area. \\n* The California Inaugural High-Speed Rail Service Project will help deliver high-speed rail service in Californias Central Valley by designing and extending the rail line between Bakersfield and Merced, procuring new high-speed trainsets and constructing the Fresno station, which will connect communities to urban centers in Northern and Southern California. This 171-mile rail corridor project has already created over 14,000 good-paying, union construction jobs. \\n* The Long Bridge project, part of the Transforming Rail in Virginia C Phase II program, will construct a new two-track rail bridge over the Potomac River to expand passenger rail capacity between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, VA. Nearly 6 million passengers travel over the existing bridge every year on Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express lines. This upgrade will reduce congestion and delays on this heavily traveled corridor, and the Transforming Rail in Virginia program is expected to create more than 36,000 jobs.There is an interactive map on [Invest.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) where you can flip between ongoing public and private infrastructure projects.

The top 10 MSAs alone account for more than a quarter of the countrys population. In fact, MSAs with populations of 500,000 or more (like Boise) make up about 75% of the nation. The idea that the majority of Americans live outside these areas is simply not true. Large parts of the U.S. are uninhabited, especially in the West, where 90% of the population lives in metropolitan areas due to the vast, harsh landscape that is state and federally-owned. Republicans actually perform quite well in major metro areas. The popular vote has been relatively close in recent elections, and there are more Republicans in California than the populations of the bottom 30 states. A moderate Republican from California could easily gain traction, winning votes from Democrats in California and neighboring states. Its happened before.While some cities may not be battlegrounds, their suburbs and surrounding areas definitely will be. In a popular vote system, the entire country would matter.

Weve all dealt with it. Its just kind of never panned out that the true undecideds do much of anything, and usually are ashamed republicans for one reason or another which is why they like to police shaming so much. Its also why Democrats target the independents who do vote and lean republicans but can be swayed Democrat, which isnt a swing voter but a Reagan Democrat - the politically engaged people who are honestly just kind of awful people in terms of their politics but electorally hold an incredible amount of power both geographically and in numbers.There is an argument that exists for engaging disengaged voters, but that has literally never panned out whenever it has been attempted as a strategy. Theyre the most fickle and arguably egotistical of all voters and there is a massive gamble trying to engage people who regularly dont vote (part of why the real undecided swing voters usually end up just not voting because they are just not politically engaged and uninterested). There are a lot of 2008 Obama and 2020 Biden voters with no votes in between that are undecided Trump/Kamala voters just purely by the numbers and the amount of engagement in our elections.And thats kind of my point, theres no reason to worry about mocking or not mocking undecided swing voters. They tend to be overly sensitive about being undecided but at the same time unlikely to ever decide. There are undecided regularly voting type people, but they are not the same group - older independent and more conservative boomers that can be engaged and are the ones the campaigns target by the general going to the center every season. These unlike the politically disengaged undecided voters are politically engaged, but tend to just generally have conservative politics and outdated opinions they are stubborn about and can be engaged with.

Note, below I'm saying \\"you\\" for brevity, but I really mean any hypothetical undecided voter.For the first reason, look, these candidates are not barely distinguishable. They differ on many critical issues, so regardless of your views, one of them has to be better aligned with you. And in a two-party system the rational choice is to vote for whichever candidate is *better* aligned with you, even if you're not thrilled about either. Staying out of it is not a beneficial action for you at all, and people have to accept that compromises have to be made - your ideal, perfect candidate is not really going to be running unless you yourself are the candidate, so you ought to look at both and decide who suits you better.For the second reason, I think it's hard to fathom what more information you could possibly be waiting for. Neither candidate is an unknown. So either it feels like people just haven't been paying attention, which would explain their hesitance to make a choice, but is irresponsible. Or they are just extremely indecisive as they have all the information but still can't bring themselves to make a choice, which goes back to the point of your ideal, 100% match candidate being a pipe-dream unless you're running, so it's time to be realistic and assess who's better aligned.If someone \\"really doesn't want Harris (or especially Waltz)\\" (although I'm curious what strong disdain this someone has for Waltz who's a VP candidate of all things) but the \\"thought of Trump is vomit-inducing\\" and the words they chose aren't meaningless or arbitrary and opinions are attached to them, then since \\"vomit-inducing\\" is normally seen as far worse than \\"really doesn't want,\\" I would think that person is probably better-aligned with Harris and would vote for them, no?","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"the enoughsanderspam - neoliberal pipeline was real cause same here","title":"Kamala Harris Rolls Out National Marijuana Legalization Plan, Pledging To Make It The Law Of The Land"},{"text":"Not a good example and the sample size is 1 person so do not use this as a reflection of others but it did a different perspective for me: Saw a post from one [Gianmarco Soresi](https://youtu.be/KTlhX0BkzGY?si=T8eJ16iKgPc7W6Hl)s stand up about an individual who was undecided voter. Their explanation was that they hate Trump but feel unsure about the VPs (Vance and Waltz) because everyone she know likes Waltz and they are a contrarian and just want to not like Waltz since everyone they know likes him.Once again this is one individual, but there is no debating it reasoning with this person on the perspective of what makes someone a good candidate and why you should vote for them based on their policies and values. This individual clearly does not care about those things when deciding, they are on a whole other perspective that I cannot fathom or reason with. I would imagine other real undecided voters, not those who are faking or are embarrassed conservatives, likely have such a different perspective that doesnt match the standard vote for someone that matches your values and desired policies rhetoric. The problem right now though is that a non-vote is basically a vote for republicans since generally republicans do not win off the popular vote and there a lot of one sided voter suppression on top of that.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Where is Stacey A.?","title":"Can Kamala Harris win over Georgia?"},{"text":"She has been having a truly incredible campaign, probably the best I've ever seen.

We draw the conclusion that there must be a basket of people who switched votes. On top of that, we build narratives about what must have resonated with people. It's all reductionist and very rarely do we consider the actual mechanics of why political power occurs.What I mean is when the Tea Party rose to power, the media reported that their arguments must have resonated. What people still rarely talk about is how the Dems got more votes, but the Project Redmap was such a success that voter turnout didn't matter. But going back to the mythological swing voter, it still rests on the underlying assumption that the voters in each election are more or less the same, a static electorate. That assumption seems ultra faulty:  Most Americans aren't consistent voters. What really explains why a county can go from Obama to Trump may not be that a single person changed their vote, but that the change is *WHO VOTED*. What this means is that voter mobilization, not voter persuasion, matters. What we also know is that American voters will trust the political parties on certain issues more or less. It's why people say they trust Trump on economy more than Harris; it has nothing to do with the person but everything to do with what party the person comes from. What this also means is that issue salience is the key to winning, not convincing someone that you're more right.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Yes, exactly.

It's impossible to test those odds, so we can't say if they were right.Because the quality of their odds rely both on the quality of their model and the quality of the input polls, we also can't say whether or not 538 is wrong or the polls were wrong when assigning odds. The only true poll is on election day and that is distinct in time, place, and participation from the polls before the election.

Democrats tend to think critically and deeply about issues rather than just fall in line with whatever a political leader or talking head says.It's not about loyalty to a party but rather about aligning with principleslike social justice, climate action, and inclusivity.What you're hitting on is that there's asymmetries between the parties. Asymmetric Politics by Waldman/Grossman is a must read. What the book shows strong evidence that the Democratic Party is a coalition of interest groups but the Republican Party is more of an ideological party.But what I wanted to change your view on is that I don't think the GOP is \\"cultish\\" and I don't think that rank-and-file Democratic voters are less partisan. As far as cultish, the Dominion law suit showed how much does the base control the GOP and how much does the GOP control the base. I always thought Fox News and their ilk controlled the base. But, the Dominion law suit shows that when Fox doesn't give the base what they want, they'll go to the competitors. The other thing that shows how the base isn't just a cult - vaccines. There's many videos of Trump trying to take credit for operation warp speed and wants to take all that credit, but he actually has gotten boo'd. It's something that he loses the base on. His popularity has been that he's been giving the base what they want.In contrast - rank-and-file Democratic Party voters show there's a symbiosis between the base and the party. One aspect of a political party is it helps people take positions. It's a feedback loop, not straight line causation. While I think the party leaders shifted because public opinion shifted on gay marraige, I also think the whole \\"we must save democracy\\" comes from the party leaders down.Naomi Wolfe back in 2004 was on the fringe saying the GOP wants to end democracy. Now that's as mainstream as it gets. What the people don't want to hear, and why the \\"they're a cult\\" has so much hope behind it, is that the base truly wants what Trump is selling. We'd rather think they're just being a tiny bit pied-piper'd and that it goes away when he goes away. Instead, Trump is the symptom. We will get more and more and more Trumps unless the incentive structures change. What the people don't want to hear about the Dems is that the GOP has structural advantages, some of whom make Marjorie Taylor Greenes more possible, is that the Dems have been asleep at the wheel. They keep saying \\"vote\\" and \\"turn out\\" but Project Redmap of 2010 meant the turnout was actually meaningless. Dems got 1.3m more votes in the House and didn't have a majority. The person in charge of the Dems version of Project Redmap simply said \\"The Republicans are better at the long game than we are.\\" They are so feckless that it hurts.","title":"CMV: the left and democrats are not capable of the same cult behavior as maga"},{"text":"I don't think abortion has lost Anywhere it's been on the ballot over the last few years.","title":"A reason democrats will win Arizona"},{"text":"How is there not legal trouble for this?

If a Democrat says \\"15 out of the 20 states receiving the most federal funding per capita were from mostly red states\\" and it turns out that it's really 14/20, that IS a lie, but it's a minor one and doesn't really disprove their larger point that most of the states receiving more money are red states.If a Republican says that \\"5 million illegal immigrants voted in the 2020 election in swing states, causing Biden to win the election fraudulently\\", and it turns out that the real number is less than 500 and didn't influence any results, that's a HUGE lie and does negate the overall point that there's massive voter fraud.

Plus, I don't like that the democrat party is no longer an American entity. The democrat party has become a \\"world\\" party, a part of a global faction of others around the world. We dont want globalist democrats from around te world meeting at their retreats discussing how they want to conform our lives with their plans and agendas for us. To the world democrat party, we are all just drones on the tax farm and mean nothing individually. But to us, our lives are ours, not theirs.  We already know the democrat agenda and no democrat will differ from that. Trump is smart, intelligent, clever,  strong, wise, etc. Many of us watched his career, going all the way back to the 80's, the man is a fighter, a winner, he is relentless and indefatigable! Kamala is a lightweight, hollow, ignorant about many many many things, she is out of her depth, in way over her head, is pretty dumb, and is itching to make us all live out her goals for us.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"10% 10 times is 100%.That depends if we're talking about 10% relative to the original progress, or 10% relative to the remaining progress.

Trump is more focused on issues domestic while Biden's was foreign. I was kind of on the fence until I saw a executive order that made me convinced he was unfortunately hitting his age limit. When I heard she was in, I immediately went all in on Trump. I don't think anyone who done a tiniest due diligence should support her either1. Is offensive to all of my mom's side of the family. Fake Jamaican accent, Rasta stereotype, despite her father at all not acting like a Rasta at all. My mom is a immigrant from Jamaica. Kamala crosses the line between having jokes and being offensive. Whats offensive is she does all that then reality is she wasn't raised in Jamaican culture. She was raised by her mother who was Indian as the dad left them at 7 years old. That's too short of a time for someone to learn and understand the culture. People rarely remember at 5, let alone 7 years old.\\n2. Participated in the problem of the justice system. She never cared about justice, only her win rate. She refused to share evidence that would save someone's life, as it was a death row case, until a judge forced her to share the evidence. She then later laughs at  herself admitting to smoke weed despite jailing people for it. That is the problem why systemic racism is in there, especially black men. When I saw her lie on that debate stage with a crooked smile, it proved to me she is that same slimy sleezeball when she was a prosecutor.\\n3. Just fake. Doesn't even know what she does then just smiles and wave. Now she gets mad even for small things like in her interviews whenever she was challenge. You can't trust her with the nuclear codes. At least Trump keeps it under control and he has a reason to feel frustrated. Unlike Kamala when you highlight honest questions about failures.\\n4. Called my entire generation stupid and treats everyone like they are stupid. She was caught on tape calling 18-24 year olds stupid. Her condescending captain obvious is very rude. Just like the Deplorable, but worse cause its attacking something we can't control.\\n5. Missed the Al Smith Dinner and boycotted BIBI. Doesn't give me good vibes she is keen on protecting religious liberties.**Meanwhile Trump**1. Improved his behavior a lot compared to when he started. He isn't as mean or nasty compared to in the past and when he does, its reasonable because someone hit him first.\\n2. Strong track record before Covid. Everyone thought he would crash the economy, then it got so well that Obama tried to take credit for it.\\n3. He stuck with his policy, and didn't shift when its convenient like Kamala or Biden did. He knows what he is doing, the other doesn't.\\n4. Takes responsibilities for his faults and makes steps to fix them. That's a leader. Kamala just pretends she did nothing wrong and blames everyone but herself. That is a man-child or in this case, a woman-child. Not a leader. Biden gave her tasks, and she failed in everyone of them. President requires a promotion, not a promotion for failing upwards in life. This is a reason most democrats said they didn't support her initially which I agree. \\"Serve your state first with a strong success record\\". Trump at least had a record as a businessman and getting politicians in bed with him for donations like Chuck Schumer.\\n5. **Only moderate in the race.** The media tells you he is radical, but look at his political stance history. During 2016 there was discussions on gay marriage. Trump ended it. At the start of the primaries, everyone but Trump was discussion when to pass a national abortion ban. Trump ended it and made it back to the states  just like Gay marriage and refused to accept a national ban.\\n6. He only wants America to win and doesn't care about sticking to a party line. He is too egotistical to let himself fail in his job as presidency. He wants to be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in history. He is in it to win it. You can't fail if you have those ambitions.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"The spice must flow","title":"Kamala Harris Rolls Out National Marijuana Legalization Plan, Pledging To Make It The Law Of The Land"},{"text":"If it was a mistake, why did the mention it at the time it was played?","title":"Bret Baier Admits Mistake With Trump Clips During Kamala Harris Interview"},{"text":"I'm not deep in the manosphere so I have no idea, but I think there is actually a structural challenge to identifying that person.

Let's break down this listTowns:  \\n25.8% voted  \\n2614 ballots  \\n10.122 active votersRabun:  \\n23.3% voted  \\n2, 898 voted  \\n12,446 active votersPulaski:  \\n17.6% voted  \\n986 voted  \\n5,608 active votersGreene:  \\n19.3% voted  \\n2,940 voted  \\n15,256 active votersUnion:  \\n26.7% voted  \\n5,393 voted  \\n20,196 active votersFun fact: Union, Rabun, and Towns are all tucked up in the very NE corner of the state and are in that area between N and S Carolina that got hammered by Helene. Not sure how that will play into their votes, but it could be an interesting wrinkle in things.Now, let's compare those numbers to what is happening in metro AtlantaDeKalb:  \\n16.5% voted  \\n25,042 voted  \\n486,821 active votersCoweta:  \\n17.3% voted  \\n12,531 voted  \\n109,450 active votersGwinnett:  \\n14.9% voted  \\n29,808 voted  \\n580,424 active votersCobb:  \\n14.9% voted  \\n39, 271 voted  \\n514,056 active votersFulton:18.1% voted  \\n49, 911 voted  \\n751,129 active votersThe rural counties have the higher percentages because there are fewer of them. Yes, there are 159 counties in this dumb state so that it could be death by a thousand cuts, but of the \\\\~11 million people here, \\\\~6 million are in the metro area. Atlanta (with some help from Savannah and Columbus, both of which are looking good too) can carry this state. It takes longer for metro counties to get to the percentages of rural counties.ETA: The gender breakdown is also very interesting. As of noon, it is currently 54.8% female to 45.0% male, with .2% other voting as well.","title":"Can Kamala Harris win over Georgia?"},{"text":"You need to have an actual good candidate for a ground game","title":"For the first time since Harris replaced Biden atop the DNC ticket, Trump leads in all swing states per Real Clear Politics aggregate polling"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/u3pd6cr6fjvd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec98be9e011557b511cee10c253c2af45375c97a27 SEP 2024, Harris/Biden signed an EO to allow the use of lethality of the US military on USA soil against USA CITIZENS.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"Of course!!!

In the heart of the leafy area surrounding Atlanta that was key to Joe Bidens victory in 2020, Todd, secretary of Gwinnett county Democrats, likens the enthusiasm for Harris among party activists to the emergence of Barack Obama 16 years ago.\\n \\n But Obama lost twice in Georgia and there are signs of fractures in the group of voters that Harris needs to keep her hopes alive of winning the state and, with it, a path to the White House through the Sun Belt of southern and western swing states.\\n \\n Polls are showing small but significant gains for Donald Trump among black men that could prove decisive in a state with Americas third-biggest black population. He lost Georgia in 2020 by only 11,779 out of five million votes, a margin of 0.23 percentage points.\\n \\n Both sides expect another close battle, with conflicting signs as to who is ahead. There was a record turnout this week of 843,991 in the first three days of early voting, which traditionally favours Democrats, but also improved polling for Trump, who was placed ahead by 52 per cent to 45 per cent among likely Georgia voters by a Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday.\\n \\n My phone rings all day, every day. There was a lot of support for Joe Biden going up against Trump but that was more desperation, not true excitement. This is true excitement for Harris, said Todd, 71, who acts as a distribution hub for election material in Lawrenceville, the county seat 30 miles north of downtown Atlanta.\\n \\n Gwinnett is the second-largest and most diverse county in Georgia, where Biden ran up 75,841 more votes than Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and improved on her vote share from 50.2 to 58.4 per cent to seal his capture of the state. But four years of a Democrat in the White House have given some of those Biden voters cause to rethink, notably opponents of his support for Israel and others who felt better off financially during the Trump presidency.\\n \\n Its very close, Todd said. Ive gotten phone calls from Muslims saying that the people in their mosque are not going to vote  Theyre not going to vote for [Trump] but theyre not going to vote for [Harris], she said. I got a phone call today from a younger black guy, in his thirties or forties, and he said, My friends think that Trump sent them a cheque [the governments pandemic stimulus payment] because it had his name on it. So they think Trump actually sent them the money.\\n \\n Gwinnett county may be part of the better-off northeast Atlanta suburbs but it is not all pensioners living in large homes in smart cul-de-sacs. One reason why it has been trending towards the Democrats after backing Mitt Romney and John McCain against Obama is the arrival of younger, well-qualified Americans to work in Atlantas growing tech, film, logistics and manufacturing sectors. It was 90 per cent white here as recently as 1990 but that figure is 32.5 per cent, with 26.9 per cent black residents, 23 per cent Hispanic and 13.2 per cent Asian-American.\\n \\n Based on where our trends are going over a decade, the destination for Georgia is to become a blue [Democrat] state, said Brenda Lopez Romero, chairwoman of Gwinnett county Democrats. Whether that happens in 2024, I think that definitely by 2028 you will see Georgia solidifying more as a blue state.\\n \\n The uncertainty over Georgias political status today  it has two Democratic senators but a Republican governor and state legislature  makes it a prize that the Trump campaign believes it can claim back this year.\\n \\n Its like 2016 all over again but better. The energy across the state is unbelievable, said Morgan Ackley, the Team Trump Georgia communications director, during a break at Trumps rally in the northwestern Atlanta suburb of Cobb county on Tuesday. Trump is due to speak in Gwinnett county next Wednesday, while Harris returns for her third Atlanta rally of the campaign on Saturday.\\n \\n A lot of families are having to choose between gas for the car and putting food on the table. Everyone understands this is a pocket-book election and we were better off under Donald Trump, Ackley said, quoting the cumulative inflation for Georgia of 21.8 per cent since 2021.\\n \\n Kevlon Galloway, one of the few black Georgians at Trumps rally, said he voted for Biden but felt let down by the Democrats. In 2020 I was a first-time voter, I just went along with what I heard from my family and at my school. Then I moved to California and lived in a blue state and saw the homelessness and how they spend money and it doesnt fix anything. I saw the black community that wasnt doing great, said Galloway, 25. I think we need to give the Republicans a chance.\\n \\n As for Obamas recent speech in Pittsburgh berating black men for considering Trump, Galloway said: When Obama said that, it was like the Democrat Party owns black people, like we cant think for ourselves.\\n \\n Trumps main messages to Georgians are based around prices and border security, referring to the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed in February while jogging at the University of Georgia in Athens. An illegal immigrant from Venezuela was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty.\\n \\n Harriss main campaign message at her rally in Cobb county last month focused on restoring access to abortion after another tragic death of a young Georgian. Medical treatment for Amber Thurman, 28, suffering from sepsis after taking abortion pills, was fatally delayed by doctors allegedly concerned that they could be prosecuted under Georgias strict abortion laws.\\n \\n Harris revived Democrat polling fortunes in Georgia to put back in play the Sun Belt route to the presidency through the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, which share some characteristics with sizable black or Hispanic populations. It is seen as an alternative to the main route for Harris of holding the three swing states of the Rust Belt  Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  part of the so-called blue wall where Trump prospered in 2016 but which Biden recaptured four years later.\\n \\n In March, polling for the Wall Street Journal suggested the Sun Belt was falling out of reach for Biden, with Trump ahead in all four states. Its polling this month found that Harris was ahead in Arizona by two points and Georgia by one point, and much closer in North Carolina at just one point behind Trump (although five points behind in Nevada).\\n \\n But Andrew Pieper, a political professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, believes this route to Harriss victory would be unlikely in the event of Trump recapturing Pennsylvania, the largest Rust Belt battleground. The Sun Belt alternative is mathematically possible but it doesnt really seem practically possible, he said. If you dont win a state like Pennsylvania, which is more Democratic than North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona, it doesnt seem plausible that you would end up winning Georgia or North Carolina or Arizona.\\n \\n He pointed to the Democrat Josh Shapiros comfortable election as Pennsylvania governor in 2022, while Georgias Republican governor Brian Kemp easily won re-election against Stacey Abrams, a prominent Democrat, in the same year. Kemp, a moderate, was heavily criticised by Trump for certifying Bidens victory and rejecting his attempts to persuade officials in Georgia to find him the votes he needed to win. The pair have recently made up and appeared together at an event.\\n \\n The presidential election is really evenly divided, Pieper said. If I had to handicap it, I would say Trump is going to squeak through in Georgia. I dont think wed be talking about this if a Kemp-style Republican were running on the Republican ticket but I think theres enough suburban women who are uncomfortable with Trump to make it a race for Democrats.","title":"Can Kamala Harris win over Georgia?"},{"text":"Remember the good old days when it was acceptable to throw out the incumbent after they drove the economy into the ground?","title":"This is what the left actually believes"},{"text":"Republicans approve of this","title":"Trump overcharged Secret Service agents to stay at his D.C. hotel, new Democratic report says"},{"text":"We've known this for a while.

Any dude over like 45-50 is going to come across as a complete fossil. The world that young men inhabit is different than the one guys from Gen X and older lived in. Trying to \\"hey, fellow kids\\" with a liberal geriatric is a losing strategy, IMO. When I was in my early-20s, I didnt like DemocratsI'm the opposite in some respects. I started identifying with Dems politically sometime around age 14 and never really looked back. As I've aged and married into a family where my wife has *much* younger siblings and then having my own sons I can more clearly see why Dems aren't winning these young men to their cause. I believe Reeves is right to focus on the educational system. It is extremely polarized to Democrats, highly female-coded and there is evidence of systemic bias against men in this setting. Yet, the prevailing cultural conversation within education is that women are more likely to be disadvantaged.I'll focus on an area I'm familiar with which is medical school admissions and enrollment. The last 5 years have been the 5 most gender imbalanced medical school classes in the last 20 years for which data is easily available. They have all favored women. This is despite the fact that men have posted higher MCAT scores and higher average science GPAs in each of those 5 years. Women outperform on non-science GPAs. To be clear, the MCATs and GPAs are not all that different. Yet, the culture within many universities and medical schools is that women need a leg up to enter the profession with many having robust mentoring programs targeted at young women. Men are oftentimes left to find their own networks and supports.That's only one area that I know of with a wealth of data, but the general theme is the same across the educational system. The system is working better for women relative to men and equality conversations rarely (Reeves is *the* notable exception) focus on the needs of men. Within academia and the broader culture, the idea that their needs to be programmatic offerings targeting men is one that is usually met with hostility. This is overwhelmingly the case in Democratic circles. Yet, the data paints a clear picture that it is men, and not women, who need additional educational supports. From a policy standpoint, I am not sure what is feasible. The Dems have a perverse incentive to not change anything about the education landscape as the sector is among the most polarized in their favor. The GOP is laughably antagonistic to education generally and oftentimes arguing in bad faith when they bring up any reforms. I'm not sure what Reeves aims are in their entirety, but I think a push towards programing and outreach that is targeted to men's educational pursuits is warranted. My view is that educational institutions that offer programing directed towards women but not for men should be viewed skeptically under Title IX.To be crystal clear, **this post is in no way advocating that women should receive less than equal treatment or that misogyny is acceptable.** There are additional areas where women still face significant barriers, notably sexual harassment in their professional setting -- https://www.aamc.org/news/women-medicine-make-gains-obstacles-remain and those desperately need to be addressed as well. That bar chart in the article highlights exactly why I think the Mark Cuban/Tim Walz to appeal to young men is so silly. If you are under 50 this institution is actually quite equitable and if you are in under 40 it actually looks tilted towards women. Data on medical school admissions, class profiles: https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/data/2023-facts-applicants-and-matriculants-dataThe reason I focus so heavily on education is it is the formative social institution in most young people's lives. Personally, we are contemplating sending out kids to gender-segregated schools.**Edit** Typos and clarifying a few words.
