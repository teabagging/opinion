There were two major flaws with the criminal case that would have made proving sex trafficking difficult. If I was the prosecutor on the case I would have been really apprehensive about my chances at trial.  To prove sex trafficking you have to prove that the defendant transported someone under 18 across state lines for the purpose of sexual intercourse or sexual contact.1.  The victim on the case was apparently uncooperative and unwilling to voluntarily testify in any charge against Gaetz.  Pulling details out of an uncooperative victim in front of a jury is difficult and there was little telling what they will say on Cross examination.2. The proof that Matt Gaetz paid for the sexual contact was a venmo payment to Joel Greenberg, a former elected tax collector for Seminole County florida.   Greenberg is a friend of Geatz and was the informant to the FBI on the case. However, Joel Greenberg is a convicted felon. More importantly, Joel Greenberg plead guilty to attempting to frame a political opponent and set them up based on allegations they were having sex with a minor.  Sure, there is some hard evidence in terms of a financial transaction.  But if a defendant is going to argue that they are being framed as part of a political Vendetta, the victim is going to say that they were compelled to testify against their will and the state's main Witness has previously been charged with attempting to frame someone for the same crime, you've got a trial problem, when the defense only has to convince one juror to be steadfast that Reasonable Doubt exists.For what it's worth, I am a lawyer and have been a prosecutor in the past, although not a federal prosecutor.","title":"She Was a High School Student and There Were Witnesses. - The fight to release a damning House Ethics report about allegations that Matt GaetzDonald Trumps pick for attorney generalhad sex with a 17-year-old girl has begun."},{"text":"Prime age LF participation is near all time highs.

It is that event that is memorialized by the MDCCLXXVI at the base of the pyramid, and not the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as the uninformed have supposed. ^1The significance of the design is as follows: the pyramid represents the conspiracy for destruction of the Catholic Church, and establishment of a One World, or UN dictatorship, the secret of the Order; the eye radiating in all directions, is the all-spying eye that symbolizes the terroristic, Gestapo-like, espionage agency that Weishaupt set up under the name of Insinuating Brethren, to guard the secret of the Order and to terrorize the populace into acceptance of its rule. This Ogpu had its first workout in the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, which it was instrumental in organizing. It is a source of amazement that the Catholic electorate tolerates the continuance of use of this insignia as part of the Great Seal of the U.S.ANNUIT COEPTIS means our enterprise (conspiracy) has been crowned with success. Below, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM explains the nature of the enterprise; and its means a New Social Order or New Deal.**It should be noted that this insignia acquired Masonic significance only after merger of that Order with Order of Illuminati at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, in 1782.**Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (Roosevelt kinsman) and Thomas Jefferson, ardent Illuminist, and defender of Adam Weishaupt, proposed the above as the reverse of the seal, on the face of which was the eagle symbol, to Congress, which adopted it on June 10, 1782. On adoption of the Constitution, Congress decreed, by Act of September 15, 1789 its retention as seal of the United States. It is stated however, by the State Department in its latest publication on the subject (2880), that **the reverse has never been cut and used as a seal,** and that only the obverse bearing the eagle symbol has been used as official seal and coat of arms. It first was published on the left of the reverse of the dollar bills at the beginning of the New Deal, 1933.What is the meaning of the publication at the outset of the New Deal of this Gestapo symbol that had been so carefully suppressed up to that date that few Americans knew of its existence, other than as a Masonic symbol?It can only mean that with the advent of the New Deal the Illuminist-Socialist-Communist conspirators, followers of Professor Weishaupt, regarded their efforts as beginning to be crowned with success.In effect this seal proclaims to the peoples of the U.S. that **the entire power of their Government supports the conspiracy to undermine and destroy it and the Constitution on which it rests** - that it is **a Government of traitors.*REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

He has connections to the Jesuits. I also recall Biden having some Freemason connections.That brings me to Dr. Emanuel Josephson. Josephson was a Columbia and Johns Hopkins graduate, and longtime NYC ophthalmologist. Dr. Josephson ran into problems with the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate and AMA. He would go on to write several books aimed at the Rockefeller Syndicate. Josephson also wrote of Weishaupts historical Illuminati saying that theyd merged with European Freemasonry in 1782, and forced the Vatican to reinstate the Jesuit Order. Nesta Websters earlier work mentions this. Josephson acknowledges the Rothschilds as more of serving the Vatican/Jesuit/Illuminati. Josephson writes:Several groups of members offered Weishaupt special problems. The Protestant princes and rulers of Germany and Europe were delighted with Weishaupts plan to destroy the Catholic Church, and they flocked to the Order. **They brought with them control of the Masonic Order, in which they initiated Weishaupt and his fellow conspirators in 1777.  Subsequently, at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, they effected a merger of the Order of Illuminati and the Masonic Order. Weishaupt sought and welcomed the powerful support of these rulers.** But he realized that he must not permit them to suspect that, in furtherance of his internationalist goal of One World dictatorship, the Order was dedicated to destroying them also. Weishaupt craftily solved this problem by limiting the princes and rulers to the lower degrees and barring them from the knowledge of the true purposes of the Order, that were revealed, cautiously, only to those in the higher degrees. ^1Renegade Jesuits, whom Weishaupt initially welcomed, then rejected, and finally welcomed once again into the Order, and Jews, who were initially rejected and later were welcomed, also constituted special problems.  Eventually, however, Weishaupt and his successors welcomed into the Order these groups, and all others that could be trusted to be thoroughly discontent with the prevailing order. And it was primarily, renegade Catholics, chronic malcontents and revolutionaries among the Protestants, and Jews who were selectively advanced to the highest degrees and innermost secrets of the Order of Illuminati and its successor organizations.An amusing story is told of the earliest relations of the Rothschilds with the Vatican. The Vatican found itself short of ready cash after almost half a century of war waged on it for the Jesuit Order by one of its unordained members, Adam Weishaupt, to avenge its abolition, in 1773, as immoral and a menace to the Church and the Faith by short-lived Pope Clement XIV in his Papal breve Dominus Ac Redemptor. Weishaupt and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to \\nthe Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution; by directing Napoleons conquest of Catholic Europe; by the revolt against the Church led by such priests as Father Hidalgo, in Mexico and Latin America; by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pius VII in jail at Avignon until he agreed, as the price for his release, to \\nreestablish the Jesuit Order. This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822, Treaty of Verona. (72:8 ;73) ^2The Jesuits thus so completely impaired the credit of the Vatican that no Christian banker would entrust it with a loan of needed funds. Only the nouveau riche Jewish upstarts, who had made their fortune in the latter part of the Napoleonic wars, the Rothschilds, would trust the Church with urgently needed 5 million pounds. Pope Gregory XVI was so grateful to the Rothschilds that he conferred on Kalman Rothschild a Papal decoration. In deference to the Jewish faith of the philanthropic banker, the usual cross in the decoration was replaced by a Star of David. Rothschild was incensed at this discriminatory gesture. He demanded, and was awarded, the decoration with a cross. Ever since, the Rothschilds have been the \\nfiscal agents of the Vatican. The Rothschilds sought to extend their financial and political dominion to the United States, for themselves primarily to serve the interests of their Vatican masters.**REFERENCES**^1 Roosevelts Communist Manifesto,\\nEmanuel M.

Don't let shit like that get you down or make you hate, but always protect what's yours and what you believe in.3rd: If you want to do something, then work on joining a cause that is worth joining or start your own. If you think joining a mormon church will better you as a person and those around you, then go for it. If you think spreading a message is something you want to do, then learn how speak in public, make videos, or write music, and start engaging with other people. Anything (non-violent) to get your message out. Look into ogranizations that follow your own beliefs. See people like Charlie Kirk, who has the vision to create Turning Point to help the younger generation.Read alot, be informed, and don't avoid conflicting views. Know your opponent better than they know themselves, and you'll never lose an argument. Who knows, maybe you can help your family too.I personally try to ascribe to the same beliefs, but I am admittedly limited in my own space, and I don't have the mental nor physical capacity to do what others can. Maybe you can while others can't.","title":"I've been fence sitting all my life, now I'm ready to MAGA!

Even FDR, who was undeniably pro-working class, explicitly said that his goal was to undercut left-wing movements and to save the capitalist system. Though, if we were to point to a decisive moment where the Democratic Party dislodged themselves from working class interests, I would argue this was in 1972 with the changes to the party instituted by the McGovernCFraser Commission as a response to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Prior to this, the campaign groundwork of the Democratic Party relied heavily on the party retaining strong connections with union grassroots organising, and unions held influence within the party itself and over the selection of party delegates as a result. Effectively this meant that the Democratic Party had to ensure that their program resonated with working-class interests in order to not lose their organising base. The resut of the McGovernCFraser Commission was that the selection of delegates became a purely inter-party issue, which undercut the influence of the unions.It should be said that some of the changes instituted by the McGovernCFraser Commission were positive, such as leading to an increase in female and black representation among delegates from southern states, but it came at the sacrifice of working class interests. When analysing the attitude of the Democratic Party towards organised labour, we can observe them gradually abandoning working class interests from the 1970s and onwards. [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/) from the Atlantic cover this abandonment starting in the 70s. The recent demographic shift of white working class voters becoming a strong base of support for Trump and the GOP is simply the ultimate consequence of this half-decade gradual abandonment of the working class by the Democratic Party.","title":"Dems need to stop being nice to Republicans"},{"text":"Where I struggle with the stolen land idea is: native groups, just like Europeans, fought each other all the time.

As we have seen from the pick of senate majority leader, most Republicans only back Trump for votes, but secretly want to block him.Gaetz is a literal pedophile being appointed as AG. He will do whatever Trump says, and Trump has every incentive to put him in office. He's already talked about forcing a recess if the senate gets roudy, and he has enough votes in the congress to do it.Since Trump is a lame duck and probably has only a couple years of energy left, if Trump starts to actually hurt the economy, then it will be in Rs best interest to throw him under the bus. In the meantime, they are trying to keep things restrained to have another 2016-2020 presidency.

Some are of course paid under the table, and there's no tax there, but more scrupulous employers do withholding.\\"Illegals\\" can get an ITN, which is similar to a SS for tax purposes. They pay in to SS and medicare but, contrary to popular belief in certain circles, they are not eligible for SS or medicare benefits. They paid in to SS and medicare to the tune of 96 billion dollars in 2022. And that just income tax. They also of course pay sales and property tax like everyone else. And before someone tries to argue that renters don't pay property tax, their landlords certainly do, and therefore the renters do.

The US consisted of just 16 states. And a war with France seemed to be looming.This is how far we had to go back, because in those days, we didnt play games, Trump said at a November 4 rally. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil.Trump has claimed the law will give his administration tremendous authority and allow officials to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.Legal experts who spoke with CNN say attempts to invoke the law could face an uphill battle in court. But given how frequently Trump referenced it while campaigning, and its presence in this years Republican Party platform, its likely well be hearing about it more in the coming months.# What circumstances allow the president to invoke this law?The text of the?[Alien Enemies Act](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fuscode.house.gov%2Fview.xhtml%3Fpath%3D%2Fprelim%40title50%2Fchapter3%26edition%3Dprelim)?says it can be invoked whenever:* A war is declared between the US and any foreign nation or government OR\\n* Invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government AND\\n* the President makes public proclamation of the eventIn other words, if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation or government has invaded the US or threatened to, a president can invoke the Alien Enemies Act.# Who would be impacted?In those circumstances, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government who are at least 14 years old and havent become naturalized US citizens shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.In other words, certain people who arent US citizens could be declared alien enemies based on their nationality. And that designation could be the basis for detaining and deporting them.Originally, the law applied only to male foreign nationals. But it was amended in 1918 after Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to give him the authority to target German-born women during World War I, says Katherine Yon Ebright of the Brennan Center at New York University.Even though the law technically doesnt apply to them, in the past children under 14 have been detained with their parents to avoid separating families, Ebright says. In World War II, the typical alternative was sending your young children or US-citizen children to an orphanage.","title":"A little-known law from 1798 could be a key part of Trumps deportation plans\\n"},{"text":"Mac Miller - Donald Trump\\nRIP Mac","title":"Pick a pop song as the Anthem for the Republican Party"},{"text":"Its not like germs have ever been an issue for the military!","title":"Germs are not a real thing: Trumps defense nominee says he hasnt washed hands in 10 years in clip"},{"text":"My wife and I both work in the tax industry.

It seems to me this last election was all about that 'vibe' sentiment.","title":"Elizabeth Warren smells something fishy going on with Trumps transition team"},{"text":"The Rift! With R.

It wasn't anything like the stories I heard from older people who grew up in the 1960s during and immediately after the Cuban Missile Crisis. They said they had drills in school where they were supposed to get under their desks. We never had any drills like that in school, and it was perceived as something corny that was done in the distant past; even some of our teachers who grew up in the 1960s perceived it that way. We knew that if you were close enough to a nuclear explosion for it to cause the school to crumble around you, you were screwed from the intense radiation even if being under your desk did manage to save you from falling debris.Every kid was terrified of that shitI wasn't; not even close, and no one I knew was either. Like I said, it seemed like a very remote threat; not something we ever dwelled on. We were taught the concept of \\"Mutually Assured Destruction\\"...MAD is based on the idea that nuclear weapons are so destructive that neither side would use them because both would be totally destroyed. The threat of MAD is intended to deter the use of nuclear weapons.... as well as the similar concept of \\"Peace through Strength,\\" which we heard from President Reagan.it was in lots of hugely popular movies for all ages of people, it was in the songs and predictively programmed in the TV shows, etc. etc. etc. I think you're overstating this by a lot. I don't remember nuclear war being a popular theme for movies, songs, or TV shows in the 1980s. I remember WarGames (1983) and the made-for-TV movie The Day After from the same year, though I never saw either one of those movies until many years after they were released. There was Red Dawn (1984), but that was about a Soviet-backed invasion of the US, not nuclear war. The Terminator (1984) was premised on a nuclear war happening in the future, but the focus of the movie was saving a woman from a \\"cyborg\\" assassin. As for songs and TV shows, nothing comes to mind. I'm not saying there weren't any, but I doubt there were lots of hugely popular ones.Like today in schools they have \\"active shooter drills\\" we had \\"bomb drills\\"Like I mentioned above, we never did. The only drills we had were fire drills.It sucked very much.\\nAfter a childhood of being scared of that shit, you realize it's just propaganda at leastI loved growing up in the 1980s and rarely gave the threat of nuclear war a second thought.","title":"I remember hearing that nuclear weapons cause damage to the space-time continuum and that was detected by many extraterrestrial species and that is why some of them came here."},{"text":"*certainly* wont","title":"Food prices worried most voters, but Trump's plans likely won't lower their grocery bills"},{"text":"Somebody gotta be a real one and leak it.","title":"She Was a High School Student and There Were Witnesses. - The fight to release a damning House Ethics report about allegations that Matt GaetzDonald Trumps pick for attorney generalhad sex with a 17-year-old girl has begun."},{"text":"What are the odds hes talking about one person?","title":"Rogan says hippies, artists, musicians thanking him for Trump endorsement"},{"text":"This is fake.

Both Jan 6th and this new administration and its plan threaten world stability. Not on a war/peace thing but the US has been stable and the foundation for something like 90% of the economy of the world because of the stability of the US Dollar. Its purely backed by the \\"Full faith and credit of the US government\\" because it was seen as a stable government and an economic powerhouse. Once that faith in the USD tanks, both internally and externally, everything else tanks. Stocks, import/export, etc. We are already seeing stuff over the last few years. Global trade was largely protected by the US Navy patrolling the seas and keeping the sea lines safe. They have scaled back and will probably stop almost all together, which will see a raise in piracy and impact global trade.Once that goes away, the rest of the world that uses USD goes with it. The BRIC countries will like to think they will be fine, but the BRIC countries are still largely tied to USD. Which is funny because a a couple of the BRIC members are the ones causing the instability, but its not going to benefit them when their trading partners collapse too.So, all these rich people who think they are going to be immune when the economy tanks are deluding themselves. If everything goes to shit, then people like Elon are fucked. They don't have much liquid assets and Crypto is only going to take them so far. When the DOW, S&amp;P and NASDAQ crater because of all the economic insecurity, they will be worth jack and shit. They are playing a dangerous game that the USD will still have value, if they get their way. But too much fuckery by these people and POOF, there goes the USD and much of the backbone of economic trade for the world. They are playing a game of Russian Roulette with a couple bullets instead of one. If it clicks on empty, they have MASSIVE paydays.

I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.Some had cast doubt on Mr Trumps chances of securing a hostage deal in the Middle East after naming a series of foreign policy hawks to his cabinet.In a video from December last year, circulated as Marco Rubios nomination as secretary of state was announced, the Florida senator said he opposed a ceasefire in Gaza and wanted Israel to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor appointed ambassador to Israel, asserted there was no such thing as a Palestinian during his 2008 presidential campaign.Mr Trump also told the Post that his presidential transition team and the Biden White House enjoyed a very, very good relationship.The meeting between the two men on Wednesday was their first direct interaction since their presidential debate in June, in which Mr Trump suggested his opponent was mentally deficient.At the same event, Mr Biden said the Republican had the morals of an alley cat and had sex with a porn star, referring to his alleged affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/)","title":"Biden asked Trump to work with him for hostage deal in Middle East at White House meeting"},{"text":"From the article: For a show about different perspectives, The View doesnt seem to have any when it comes to Trump.

That's the entire point of the thing to be a safety check in case the American people elect a potential tyrant. But electors haven't worked that way in well over 150 years. Then another mechanism is to have Congress refuse the results and elect someone else, but Congress is full of people loyal to the man and not the country. Then finally, Congress could remove him once as he takes power, but again loyal to the man, not the country. Finally the Supreme Court was designed to remain completely neutral and would always side with the Constitution and preventing any branch from gaining too much power could limit the damage, but they have been compromised as well. But the framers of the Constitution never dreamed that a party would be more loyal to a man than the country itself and never installed any real consequences should a president become a tyrant. They believed that there would always be enough people in the government who would act in good faith, and people would instead remain loyal to their home states needs. They also thought that while the Federal government was of a higher authority, it could never be used against the individual states.This has happened before. Andrew Jackson was a bomb to the established government that was still on shaky ground and upended everything while destroying the economy and trampling rights. But the only silver lining was that Jackson still loved the country itself and believed what he was doing was for the betterment of the nation. Trump is just burning it down to establish himself as a dictator. The only thing that can resist him is the bureaucracy of the Federal government, which is what generally blunted his damage last time, so he is specifically attempting to target that first.","title":"Elizabeth Warren smells something fishy going on with Trumps transition team"},{"text":"ITT: People who think Democrats should not reflect on their policies / strategy and instead would prefer to just shrug and say huge portions of the voter base are simply stupid.This may be convenient for you, but it's not going to help us fix whatever is left after this.

Dennis:*  \\n  \\nWith President-elect?Donald Trump?and his fellow Republicans winning control of the White House plus?both chambers of Congress?in the Nov. 5 election, the Democrats will have one important tool for checking the power of the majority party: the filibuster. Thats the prerogative enjoyed by the minority party in the Senate to demand never-ending debate to thwart legislation, which must be approved by both that body and the House of Representatives.Filibusters once required senators to stand and speak for hours, but since the 1970s, the mere threat of one has been enough to grind a bill to a halt. Almost all bills are doomed unless supported by the three-fifths supermajority required to end a filibuster. With 53 of the 100 seats in the new Senate, the Republicans fall short of that. As a result, many pieces of Trumps agenda will require negotiating with the Democrats. The minority party can also use the filibuster to slow, though not stop, the confirmation of nominees to?more than 1,000?positions the president can fill?only with Senate approval, including cabinet members, Supreme Court justices, federal judges and ambassadors.","title":"How the Senate Filibuster Will Force Trump to Negotiate With Democrats"},{"text":"If that's any help, I can think of at least one worse choice people made for their own well-being recently.

It has. Marginally so, but it has. That said, in my experience and opinion that was generally an issue of having *only a few* women present. Most of the issues and headaches came from having like 7 women on a FOB of 700 soldiers. Which has been a thing for *decades,* well before women were integrated into combat units. We were an infantry battalion. Women were excluded from every billet, including MOSs like supply or signal where women were generally allowed. So why did we have women on our FOB?  Because support units were still integrated, and our intelligence, maintenance, and food service personnel all came from a support unit.  So those units had female soldiers, and a handful wound up assigned to our FOB. Handful was the main issue. If we had, say, 100 female soldiers out of 700? Or 200? It would likely have been *less* of an issue. But overall it was still fine. Though amusingly out of 7 soldiers 1 did wind up going home halfway through due to pregnancy. Which, small sample size, but a hilariously bad percentage. Knew her, she was a good soldier, no reason to think it was intentionalbut when you let two married soldiers bunk together for the deploymentIn short yeah it complicates things but generally nothing that cant be handled by decent leadership and cultural progress.","title":"Trumps defense secretary pick said women shouldnt be in combat roles.

There is a massive information gap in a) how the entire system works (from federal to county level) and b) how policies function, how they are implemented, what policy cycles are and so on and c) how people in Congress are responsible for everything and while the president has a lot of sway, legislation is the job of Congress.Then you have endless people who vote on ?vibes. In 2016 I met someone, because he found Hillary unsympathetic and Trump funny. In 2020 he went for Biden, because Trump was not serious enough. These people lack education as well and compensate by choosing by whatever they feel that day about any candidate. They cant fathom that this isnt some sort of beauty pageant. Of course there are those people who are in it as if it were sports. Their team has to win for the winning. They vote R, because their parents and grandparents and even great great uncle Chuck did, who fought in the confederacy. They value what they perceive as tradition and dont really care about the repercussions of their actions. Finally, of course, misinformation is one giant factor. Whether its cable news, who for all intents and purposes depict both parties as the same thing, just opposite sides. Which is, quite frankly, insane. At least since the Tea party brought forward congresspeople, democrats and republicans are immensely different, where the former arent perfect, but the latter obstruct and are simply put incapable of governing.

And I just worry a lot of Americans are now under his spell.  And as far as his policies causing harm, we already know what his supporters do when that happens.  They'll lie, deflect, blame, do whatever it takes to avoid the shame of feeling \\"I voted for a rapist because of his policies and now his policies are awful\\".

I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.Some had cast doubt on Mr Trumps chances of securing a hostage deal in the Middle East after naming a series of foreign policy hawks to his cabinet.In a video from December last year, circulated as Marco Rubios nomination as secretary of state was announced, the Florida senator said he opposed a ceasefire in Gaza and wanted Israel to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor appointed ambassador to Israel, asserted there was no such thing as a Palestinian during his 2008 presidential campaign.Mr Trump also told the Post that his presidential transition team and the Biden White House enjoyed a very, very good relationship.The meeting between the two men on Wednesday was their first direct interaction since their presidential debate in June, in which Mr Trump suggested his opponent was mentally deficient.At the same event, Mr Biden said the Republican had the morals of an alley cat and had sex with a porn star, referring to his alleged affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/14/biden-asked-trump-hostage-deal-middle-east/)","title":"Biden asked Trump to work with him for hostage deal in Middle East at White House meeting"},{"text":"USA is a dumpster fire.","title":"Gaetz pick sends GOP into panic"},{"text":"'Citizens', HA.

The authors of the Constitution wanted to make sure that departments would not go without leadership just because Congress was out of session. So they added language that says, during a congressional recess, the President can make temporary appointments without Senate approval. Those are called \\"recess appointments.\\"In the modern era, there's really no reason not to wait until Congress is back in session. But the Supreme Court has ruled that the President can still make recess appointments to this day.TLDR: Recess appointments are a constitutionally archaic but still valid way for a president to appoint senior officials without the consent of the Senate even when those appointments would normally require the approval of the Senate.More details here:https://www.history.com/news/constitution-congress-recess-appointmentsEDIT: BTW, recess appointments are not just a Trump thing. Many (all?) modern presidents have used recess appointments to fill some senior positions when the Senate has been hostile to their picks. What's new this time is that Trump is demanding a Senate controlled by his own party help him use recess appointments instead of the normal process. He wants absolute control over his appointments and for the Senate to step aside and give up their \\"advice and consent\\" role entirely.

So they hoped it would actually work to keep people employed and the economy stable. They were working to ensure that with the oversight, but the GOP saw an opportunity to hand free money to the wealthy and ran with it.Also worth noting that PPP was sold as a \\"loan\\" along the lines of the 2008/2009 auto manufacturing bailouts (which were actual loans and were eventually paid back with interest), but in PPP's case the \\"loans\\" were immediately forgiven. The people who voted for that shit fucking decision also voted against student loan debt relief because of course they fucking did.Oh, and we should also mention that printing around $800 billion and just handing it out with PPP helped to drive the Inflation that the GOP screamed about for four years (without doing shit to actually help fix it, of course) and ultimately successfully used to install Dear Leader as dictator for life.I hate this fucking timeline.","title":"Republicans Ran a Dysfunctional House.
