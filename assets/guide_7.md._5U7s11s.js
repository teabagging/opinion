Well for some people, others just think a vegetarian diet is healthier and don't really consider the moral implications. For the latter this wouldn't even be an issue. If you are a vegetarian for moral reasons, cognitive capabilities matter in that calculation. Most animals don't have the cognitive power to understand any of the implications and just feel mistreated if you try to force them into a diet they aren't evolved for, cats are obligate carnivores, they need meat to thrive. If you want to prevent their suffering they need meat. Humans have turned cats into a global problem and in a lot of ways it's probably not moral to own cats, especially ones that go outdoors.Feeding your cat is kind of a complicated web of moral calculation. Fundamentally, we must admit that a meat industry exists regardless of personal diet and most pet food is made of waste from that industry which would otherwise go unused so in a way feeding them commercial pet food is better than letting them kill even though that's what they would do naturally. If we are going to kill those animals as a society then we may as well feed the waste to our pets.Bottom line, cats exist, we love them, even if you're vegetarian your cat needs meat and that's not a direct conflict. There are confounding implications but none of it really matters in the end if you subscribe to any level of pragmatism over idealism. Perfect conditions do not exist and while we may want to improve them we need to operate in the moment with the facts of our reality whether natural or imposed by systems we disagree with.","title":"CMV: it is impossible to be both a vegetarian and a cat person"},{"text":"Yep.

In a world where H1Bs can change jobs enough that there's no real price advantage, there is a culture difference, but it has nothing to do with your average American having a worse culture than your average &lt;Insert Nation Here. The real reason is that Trump's \\"Mexico isn't sending their best\\" is wrong.The person that decides to move thousands of miles away from their family and friends, to a place with different food, a different language, and where staying is very difficult is not your average person. Your average person will not take the risk unless the country is being bombed. So when you pick a random person that is willing to uproot themselves, vs someone that didn't, you are getting someone more motivated, more of a risk taker, and more biased towards action. So it's a very good signal.You will find people like that born in America too, but you'll need different signals to find them. But if you are hiring and all you have is an average immigrant and an average american, with no other information, the immigrant is a better bet. It's the same thing that makes people believe that people that went to a very good school are typically smarter.

Thats right: Since the election, U.S. consumers have become more likely to say they expect prices to rise next year, Rampell wrote.While Trump ran his 2024 campaign on appealing promises to bring everyday prices that have skyrocketed for consumers in recent years down, he acknowledged in a Time magazine interview only after winning that election that he could do no such thing, Rampell reminded readers.Id like to bring them down, Trump told Time magazine. Its hard to bring things down once theyre up. You know, its very hard.The only thing surprising about the admission from Trump is that he said it out loud, Rampell wrote.One thing Trump didnt acknowledge, however, is how his economic agenda  tariffs, deportations, tax cuts, and kneecapping the Federal Reserve  could worsen the problem that voters hired him to solve, according to the columnist. But Americans seem to be catching on anyway.Rampell pointed to a University of Michigan nationwide survey that measures consumers about their views on the economy. It found a surge in participants since the election reporting that now is a good time to purchase big-ticket items, because prices will probably rise.We dont know for sure whats driving these shifts in consumer views, Rampell added. Most likely, Americans are absorbing news coverage of Trumps proposed tariffs and their potential to raise prices on food, cars, apparel, appliances and other common household purchases.Trumps threats of mass deportations could also drive up fruit, vegetable and dairy prices, she warned. And, Rampell concluded, Trump could easily worsen increased prices consumers are already facing in the face of other geopolitical and supply-chain issues.","title":"Consumers Finally Realize That Trump Could Worsen Inflation: Fearing high prices, some are stocking up for what could be an expensive four years"},{"text":"Aye, this is the Canadian way of doing things.

And the large cities have pretty much said they won't be cooperating. So I'm curious what army Trump intends to hire to carry this out because he will need an army larger then the Karen's who are screaming about illegals.Then there is the legal peril that this will put the so called private prisons. After Trump is gone which could very well be way before the 4 year mark if Trumps economic agenda turns to shit what happens then? Do these CEOs think they will escape potential prison sentences for their cooperation with policies that could very well harm every household in America? Trumps old the the masses are likely to demand a scape goat and you sucker's will be smack dab in the middle of it all. So if you don't see that bus coming you deserve to be thrown under it.Then there's the likely outcome of a complete reversal of policies. Once inflation shoots sky high and it will politicians will be left scrambling. So now you've gone a built all these facilities which will be stranded assests. Worse still is the speed at which you'll be asked to work will guarantee you committing all sorts of violations which means the companies will be fined like no bodies business. Again scape goats are going to be found and this could very well see laws passed that allow for the government to go after the CEOs board members and shareholders of these companies depending on how badly this harms the American people.There is no scenario where this end well for these companies or the board members working for them. It's setting you up to become political and economic pariah for the sake of Donald Trump who isn't long for this earth give his age and health.

In 2018, tariffs didnt end up producing inflation and the Fed ended up cutting rates because of fears of a growth slowdown from souring sentiment and investment.  \\n  \\nBut the 2018-19 episode followed years of very weak price pressures where businesses were reluctant (or downright unable) to ask customers to accept higher prices.  \\n  \\nIs the current environment different? The  underlying conditions of the economy will matter greatly in determining how much businesses attempt to push higher costs along to their customers.  \\n  \\nWe are at full employment. If you impose a cost-shock, it will get passed through much more than if youre in a downturn, said Ray Farris, an economist in New York. The cost shock works its way into the system depending on the stage of the cycle youre in.  \\n  \\nAnother wild card: whether an increase in prices gets passed through in one fell swoop or whether companies spread out the increase in tariffs over time. If companies phase the pass-through, and they dont do it immediately and completely, it will appear increasingly to the public that there is more of an inflation problem, said Farris.  \\n  \\nThen there are questions of political optics for the central bank: The Powell Fed prizes an apolitical, sober-minded culture. We dont speculate, Powell said two days after the election.  \\n  \\nBut the Feds rate policies dont just include actual day-of-the-meeting policy actions; they also include a suite of communications and guidance about the outlook and the reaction function. The big step-up in the inflation forecast last week left analysts scratching their heads because recent firmer inflation readings alone didnt seem to support the revision, notwithstanding Powells claims to the contrary. (The current-year inflation projection has kind of fallen apart, he said last week.)  \\n  \\nAnd one Fed official, Governor Adriana Kugler, implied in a pair of speeches after the election that immigration had boosted labor force growth and eased wage pressures recently; the case to continue to cut rates rested on these tailwinds not reversing into headwinds.  \\n  \\nA final point: While Trump has long stated his desire for rates to be low, some of his advisers are leery about the Fed continuing to cut because they recognize inflation hasnt been vanquished.[https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1872637428025954770](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1872637428025954770)","title":"The Fed Is TryingAgainto Size Up Trump"},{"text":"Not saying you werent.

People don't realize how close we were to losing the nation there.  The slavers rebellion and its supporters in Maryland were literally cutting off Washington DC from the nation.   There was an actual violent charge to disconnect the capital from the support of the US military and allow the rebellion to take the city.  The siege of Washington was on.  This wasn't someone going \\"we don't like you\\".  This was people attacking the military, destroying rail lines, pushing for others to join in terrorism and rebellion against the US.  Lincoln believed that the right to suspend the writ of Habeus Corpus had been written for this exact reason and was a power he had because when it was written, and as the nation operated, Congress could be out of session for months.   He believed this was a last gasp action, thus one that wouldn't be given to a group who might not even be around to use it.  Yes, he used it to save the nation.  Yes, the author of the Dred Scott decision in a circuit court ruling said since the committee on style moved that in a section talking about Congress that its practical application didn't matter one bit, it deserved to be with Congress.  It's easy to sit back here after and go 'well the Confederacy maybe didn't have the organization to make that move even if they had cut off DC in Lincolns first few months in office\\".  But at the time, the nation's existence was on that precipice.  Lincoln saw a way to save the nation and used it.

May I ask your point? What are you attempting to accomplish. No man shall stand before the great delusion l. Are you trying to change something. Are you just reiterating the word? Esoteric instruction only reaches the few. Most people have a fundamental knowledge of the word. Perhaps you're digging so deep that the wider message of the gospel is being lost on the public at large. Grace, mercy, hope, faith, and above all, love\\n This is the message of salvation. Perhaps what you are doing is scriptural at times. But, being grounded in the word is what we all need. Is your message strictly of conspiracy? The message of Ephesians 6:12 is apparent. So. Why expound on it so deeply? As we mature in the word it's not necessary to be overzealous. There are people we can't reach or change. That is because men have God-given free will. Not even Christ would force them to give up. Though every knee will bend, and every tongue confess that he is lord. They can still refuse to accept Yeshua Hmaciach. Matthew 3:17 is the word from God that a follower of Christ must heed. Are you a Christian? Or a follower if Christ? There is a difference. Being a follower is more important. Many people call themselves Christians &amp; know the word. Satan knows the word very well &amp; sets in the front pew in church. But, his anger over Father God having man judge the angels in the form of Christ overrides his love of the Holy Spirit. Is it a desire to be well thought of? Or is it the desire to be still and know that God is in control? I'm just trying to understand what you expect to accomplish. Do you have something to add to the word? It seems you're zealous for the word. Brother, in the spirit. I place my hand upon your shoulder with in agape love.  We're all in this together. 1 Corinthians 13:1-7 Father God, may we do your will and spread your gospel in the fullness of time.

And they get especially annoyed when the manufacturer is deliberately crippling their own product by upcharging for features that are already present whether you pay for them or not. \\nPeople don't have a categorical issue with the subscription model. People have been playing MMOs and subscribing to magazines for decades. The BMW example just happens to be a prime example of how not to do a subscription.Let's look at this point specifically:   If BMW can't charge for the heated seats they just won't include it or charge a fixed fee like before. They aren't going just give it away.In a sense they are just giving away the materials and labor under the subscription model. BMW already installed the heated seats on those cars whether you pay to activate them or not. Under the normal model where you either buy the feature or don't, BMW could have saved money by not including it in the cars that wouldn't use it.It also disproves the needlessly judgmental conclusion that people just want free things. If people just wanted free things then they wouldn't care about this change at all, because the previous status quo still involved spending more money on extras.

In some way, they all believe in a natural social and moral hierarchy where they deserve to be privileged above those they look down on. Whether they're oligarchs looking down on those who are not \\"successful businessmen\\", techbros looking down on those not \\"smart\\" enough, religious fundamentalists who believe they are more worthy because god says so, racists, misogynists, ..., it's all the same dynamic and the same rejection of the principle of equality. They can all work together (for a while) in the same political movement because they share the same rejection of equality, and any reactionary movements tends to gravitate towards the same hit list (ethnic minorities, women, people whose sexuality they disapprove of, ...) because they're made up of people with the same need for hierarchy and status, just in different contexts.This doesn't even have to be an acknowledged or articulated belief, because all the ideology is just a convenient facade for them feeling they deserve status and power because of who they are. You just need one of a set of emotional biases to get caught up in this and an inherent selfishness or lack of empathy to allow it to dominate your better nature, without necessarily understanding the dynamic itself. Fear and rage are often triggers because they suppress empathy and thought, which is why propaganda focuses on both.And of course, once you reject equality you will end up rejecting democracy because why should the \\"lesser\\" people be allowed political, economic and social rights? Self preservation will not stop this because of the way this movement works on an emotional level. Exceptionalism is an inherent facet to its appeal so none of them will see how removing democracy and its protections threatens their interests until they are personally impacted by it.

However, I think context might be important here.My question was about demand for a service or skill in a globally accessed market. If you remove demand for that skill locally what happens to the amount you a business is  willing to pay for the price of that skill.it goes down.Telling me more people in the market increases the demand does not work for higher level skills in a global Market services locally. 1 million new engineers into a market to locally servicing global needs does not equate. Those service needs are already baked into this particular equation. However moving those engineers to the location you need them in will drive down the demand locally for the services needed to serve the same global market.We are not talking about a product serviced and sold locally. This changes the equation. While I agree with your statement it does not exactly equate to my point as the offset for bringing in labor to service a local need that supplys a global service is not affected as those people you are leveraging to offset the impact local are already in the system. That is exactly what is causing the increased need.Cool things to think about and I am 100% on the side of immigration. Just to have a level set.

Its one of the reasons why using a 1-dimensional axis to define politics is so silly. But populist is an even more meaningless term.In my opinion, Trump is a conservative in the sense that he sees the country as having had virtues in the past that need to be restored. This is literally what Make America Great Again means.The liberal mindset is more about trying things that have never been tested. Pushing Obamacare on the whole country, when it hadnt been tested (outside of a very small trial run in MA). Allowing people to use bathrooms of the opposite sex, without concern of potential consequences. Banning gas appliances, or forcing electric cars, in hopes of fixing the environment.Liberals are cynical because they believe nothing America has done or been in the past was ever good enough. They are arrogant because they are sure their solutions are right for America, without being sure of long term effects on society. And they are reckless, because many of their experiments could cause a lot of side effects.I dont think Trump has that dangerous mindset liberals have. But hes not a neo-con either, nor is he really a laissez faire conservative. But hes conservative in the sense that he wants to try ideas he believes worked in the past, even if some of those ideas (like tariffs) havent been popular in a long time.","title":"Is Trump a conservative?"},{"text":"Theyre kissing the ring hoping they get perks","title":"Big companies that denounced Jan. 6 are now showering millions on Trump inauguration"},{"text":"I meant he'll be losing votes for the party.

Greed and entitlement. It seems we agree that the notions of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have been severely perverted over the years. The bar for 'happiness' (read also: success) has gone waaaay up from what it was under the New Deal or the America of modest suburban homes and an honest day's work. But humility has been replaced by competitiveness as a core American virtue - a process I am sure you can trace yourself. Trump shares the same modern perverse view that everything is a zero-sum game that the strong should 'win'. They see this as optimal, and axiomatic. Happiness leads to someone else's inevitable misery. Living means that others have to die. Freedom means that someone has to pay the price. I think we both find that distasteful. Although I am likely more cynical about Americans than you. To me, Trump is how entitlement and self-righteousness play out in the end. His soul is the same dark lump in the core of American culture. A glowing example of what it means to be a winner. He likely experienced real loss when Joe took away his plan to kill some prisoners. We can't be good in his view, unless a bad person swings from the end of a rope - preferably in a live-stream. That's the price of righteousness in the new America. In the end I do agree that this wasn't what your founders wanted. They just wanted to live a simple life without the King of England breathing down their necks.

Ergo, an immigrant is actually better for the economy than a citizen- though immigration does not affect birth rates that way2) Population booms correlate strongly with increased economic benefit, whilst population reductions correlate strongly with economic strife. Ergo, we can conclude that the two are closely intertwined. A population boom without requiring the 18 years of pseudo-parasitic drag on the economy that children represent would almost certainly benefit the economy, as is typically predicted in economic models regarding immigration.

Is she justified to severely hurt him in this case instead of like a slap, calling him out and calling the cops on him? I think this man is sexually harassing this woman here.\\nI'm not defending the dude here in the news. He was a douche that should be punished. The issue here with most comments is what counts as sexual assault worth severe retaliation??\\nRead this carefully - is a woman a victim if she severely hurts a person if the act counts as sexual misconduct of any kind because for some reason it grants her the right? Trying to humiliate her in front of people by ripping her clothes and she gets violent? Acceptable. Trying to full on rxpe her and she gets violent? Acceptable. Severely hurting someone when the other person wasn't actively harming her when the situation could be de escalated by being less violent and calling the cops? Not acceptable.\\nSexual misconduct is disgusting but ANYTHING that counts as sexual misconduct does not call for intense violence. You're talking about the depth of the cut - the article also doesn't state whether the dude was actively trying to remove her clothes or only lifted her skirt and then laughingly backed away.\\nBoth acts are disgusting but the second one would require the girl to stab him out of vengeance, which is an offense.\\nAll I'm saying is don't just always sympathize with the victim's activities because the victim experienced sexual misconduct as the degree of misconduct is what asks for measures. Protecting yourself from it and hurting the offender is valid, acts of vengeance or anger when the misconduct was completely avoidable in other ways is not.\\nThis calls for abuse of power by women who could misuse this.

And long term, a rapidly growing population is only going to contribute to the strength of our economy, and to the strength of our nation.","title":"cmv: Trudeau was right to rachet up the immigration levels"},{"text":"Those companies, especially Google, hire large amounts of H-1B workers.

The results of many of these studies show that the estimated impact of population growth on economic growth is generally small and can be positive, negative, or nonexistent. A recent meta-study found no relationship between population growth and economic growth.[15]\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_declineThere is, however, a lot of evidence that lower birth rates will mean rents will decline. [I mean, theyre pretty blatant about it.](https://coloradobuildermag.com/business-management/industry-economy/americans-declining-birth-rates-set-to-hit-housing-market/) Declining birth rates mean lower demand for rental housing two decades from now when those born in recent years will be entering the rental market, according to Natalia Siniaskaia, assistant vice president of housing policy research for the National Association of Home Builders. The effects will spread to the single-family market in the following years and will persist for years to come.\\nSo really it sort of backs up OPs point. If its increasing the population, its driving up housing costs for everyone and theres not a lot of evidence that it helps workers.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"This is really true - all of it.

That's not what Canada should be about, and that should be shut down. Instead, these people should be allowed to simply come here and work. That way, they will have more money to support themselves while they transition because they aren't shelling out big bucks for a useless college diploma, and they will have more free time to work, put in overtime, and otherwise get ahead in life.However I disagree that we only want skilled educated professionals. Are you familiar with the phrase, too many chiefs, not enough Indians? Not everyone can do white collar work. And with generative AI coming online, I think there are going to be a lot fewer white collar jobs in the immediate future, as a number of positions are made obsolete. You need blue collar workers too. And there are billions of poor people in the third world, with tremendous work ethic and physical capabilities, that could contribute substantially to the Canadian economy. What's more, being able to move to Canada and earn a first world salary would be transformative for these people. They're earning 50 cents, $1 an hour in Brazil, in the Philippines, in Malaysia. And they could be making $10, $15, $20, even $30 an hour in Canada. You want houses built? You think a foreign trained engineer or doctor is going to build a house for you? But there are probably 20 million Brazilians that would jump at the chance to be a framer, or a drywaller, and to put in 60+ hours a week. We are an advanced industrial economy. We've got capital. We've got natural resources. We need labour. And this wouldn't just be good for us, it would be transformative for those poor immigrants. Canada's point based immigration system is classist, racist, and counter productive. It is also harmful to the countries that we select immigrants from, because they need the brains we are draining a lot more than we do. And what happens when these highly educated guys come to Canada? They end up driving a cab or doing some other menial work because their credentials don't carry through and compulsory licensure laws prevent them from doing the high quality work they could have done in their home country.","title":"cmv: Trudeau was right to rachet up the immigration levels"},{"text":"Well that guy needs to run for office too.","title":"Trial of man accused in Trump assassination attempt in Florida pushed back to September"},{"text":"Who would had guess that the president who hates working class and loves his billionares friends would do this things because he hates the working class and loves his billionares friends??","title":"Am I the only one who wants Trump supporters to suffer?

A key part of this is the understanding that, until the 1700s, most governments wanted more people in their country; and even through the 1800s, more fights were over \\"we want these people\\" than \\"we don't want these people\\" (see: War of 1812, which was at least in part Britain and the US both arguing that sailors were their people).Now, some of that is tempered by in-group solidarity, and not wanting someone who doesn't fit in to be living around you. However, you can't deny that at least a part of the slave trade was getting more people; that the US's permissive immigration policies through the 1920s were about getting more people, and so on. The only time more people is a problem is when those people start to run out of resources - and up through the 1800s, the solution to that was to send those people to war and get more resources.However, at the same time as those in power are bringing in more people, they're trying to keep those new people from having any political power. Again: see slavery. It goes back to Rome and you don't get to vote unless you're a Roman citizen - meaning, born in Rome. It probably goes back further than that; with there being evidence of similar efforts to restrict power in earlier nations as well, including in the Old Testament.And the US has a long history of that. Asian immigrants got limited power. Whites tried to restrict rights to the Irish until the 1860s, when the Irish became the support whites in power needed to keep newly freed Blacks from taking political power. Whatever it takes to get people in the country, but with as few legal rights and protections as the people in power can possibly manage providing....A lot of support illegal immigrants get from the political left in the United States is based on three fundamental ideas - one moral, one based in power politics, and one based on shared enmity:\\\\- (Moral) People have the fundamental human right to travel freely, including across national borders; and enjoy the same rights (though not necessarily privileges) of all people when they get there. Putting any legal barriers to entry, except in cases where a person is provably reasonably a threat to the country (including security risks like potential spies; health risks like people with infectious diseases; or safety risks like known criminals), is therefore immoral. While we can reasonably put barriers to citizenship (which grants you an increased set of responsibilities - but also privileges. For example: ACA, Social Security, etc.); there should be no barriers to entry.\\\\- (Power politics) Immigrants tend to support more progressive policies - notably, less political and military involvement with certain countries (In the US, this mostly means US support of Central American dictators); increased support for the poor and other social programs; and programs that increase socioeconomic mobility. Therefore, having more immigrants and getting illegal immigrants papers and later citizenship will, at least in theory, increase the political power of progressives\\\\- (Shared enmity): Many people on the political left want to increase the rights for illegal immigrants primarily because that makes it harder for corporations and other wealthy people to take advantage of them - notably, to pay them sub-minimum-wage, and then deport them if they try to report it. Increasing the rights of illegal immigrants, especially giving protection to them so that they can't be deported if they have an employment dispute with a US company dating to before deportation started, would make it harder for companies to abuse them AND to depress wages for people here legally.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"I have a couple of strange things I have noticed that nobody in the media has answered yet.Where is all the phone footage from behind the podium.

I would argue that American culture is fundamentally impossible to define, because it's intentionally blurry - it belongs to no singular group, nor any particular ideology, race, heritage, etc. American *populist poltiics* is broken - but that's going to be the case any and everywhere, and specifically why *no* democracies (including ours, when it was first established) have ever actually run via populist voting alone. Our current issues with populism in the US are... more of a result of apathy and the absense of civic ownership of government: People became too accustomed to being comfortable \\"for free,\\" (not really for free, but you know what I mean). We have whole generations of people who were taught about government as if it's some foreign, abstract thing rather than something that only functions when the people it governs actively participate in it.Even now: People talk about the election and the president-elect as if it's a done deal - as if there's no earthly mechanism to prevent his ascension to power (for lack of a better descriptor). In reality, our founders would be disgusted with us for being so defeatest; They fought against the largest and most-powerful military force  to ever exist in the history of the world, at the time, which was backed by the largest, furthest-reaching empire to ever exist in human history. And *they won*. And fought that empire and it's leaders over far less grievous things than our president elect has done. In reality, there is *always* a choice. Government is a construct - it exists because *we* want it to exist; similarly, we can just as easily *deconstruct it;* we can amend it, change it, destroy it, replace it, etc. It's all pretend - it only exists because we all collectively agree it does. The crimes of any leader are only excused if the populace as a whole says that they are. If we want to see certain people held accountable for their crimes, then some of us need to become comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable and participating in, to a very extreme degree, the most base and fundamental aspect of establishing fair governence.","title":"Nikki Haley rips Ramaswamy: Nothing wrong with American culture"},{"text":"I don't think it matters anymore.

In fact, most studies have shown (and my own experience agrees with this) that people working from home actually put in MORE hours each day than those working in an office building. So Employers are getting loads of tangible benefits out of the arrangement and employees are happy to have a few intangible benefits in return. There is no practical benefit in going back to the old work model, and most of the reasons I've seen stated seem to boil down to middle management fearing that everyone will realise how little value they actually add to the organisation.

I agree it would be great to offer more opportunities for folks, but that's kind of a separate issue.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Having a Bachelor's and a Master already puts you into the top 15% of all Americans.

His admin cut social programs and welfare benefits for countless Americans.Reagan took money from the social security fund to pay for his budget deficits.His admin rolled back labor organizing dramatically, and his handling of the air traffic controllers union strike was heavy handed and normalized union bustingReagan played the most prominent role in carrying out supply side economic policies. Part of this agenda involved removing regulations and lowering taxes on businesses and corporations, which was supposed to translate into things like higher wages for workers, better jobs, etc, hence the \\"trickle down\\" label.However, unlike the new deal response to the Great depression, which depended on the federal government intervening in the economy, the Reagan administrations response to \\"stagflation,\\" did not result in long lasting positive outcomes for the working and middle classes.Before Reagan's presidency, income tax on the wealthiest Americans was as high as 70%. By the end of Reagan's presidency that number dropped to 28%. Reagan was also responsible for generating major tax breaks for corporations and estates, all for the sake of limited government and a redistribution of wealth to the top.People brag about short-term improvements during Reagan's presidency, but the emphasis should be on short term, while it should also be emphasized that during this time, the rich got richer, and the poor, middle and working class saw little improvement.The incomes of the wealthiest Americans rose by over 100%, by comparison, the incomes of workers rose by a whopping 17%. All that wealth really trickled down huh? And since then, that wealth gap has only continued to widen. Since Reagan stepped into office, executive salaries have skyrocketed as much as over a thousand percent, while average worker compensation has increased by only 18%In 1980, the average CEO earned 36 times the average worker. Today, the average CEO earns 400 times the average worker.For the average worker, wages haven't even kept up with inflation. Where's the trickle down?Throughout Reagan's presidency, even though there were concerns directed at his policies, Reagan still maintained that if workers weren't getting richer, It was solely due to their own moral failures. And ever since Reagan, this idea has taken hold in the Republican consciousness.In terms of Reagan's influence on unions:The mid 20th century saw a peak in Union activity, nearly 1/3 of workers belonged to a union. Not only that, but unions had power, power to mount challenges against their employers. This even allowed unions to bring about important labor laws.During this time, Reagan was a member of a union himself. He was even president of the screen actors guild. But then he flipped.While he was president of the screen actors guild, he abused his power to grant his talent agency a waiver that would get him comfortable and well paid television roles. The FBI actually investigated this for anti-competitive behavior. His talent agency was eventually forced to shutter its doors.Despite this, Reagan still used his previous position as a union president to appeal to union workers on the campaign trail.\\n \\n**The air traffic controllers union strike:**These workers were striking for better working conditions and higher pay.The problem is that they were federal workers, and Reagan made it perfectly clear during a press conference that what they were doing was against the law, and that if they did not end their strike immediately, they would all be fired. Yeah, what a real working class hero.Two days later, 12,000 workers were fired, not only that, but they were barred from working for the federal government ever again.This actually crippled the labor movement, and it hasn't recovered since.At its peak, union membership accounted for over a third of all workers in the United States, at the end of Reagan's presidency that number was cut in half. Today, union membership accounts for around 10% of all workers. Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers sent a heavy-handed message to Union workers. That message, in part, not only legitimized Union busting, but made it more acceptable.Moving on...Today, Republicans like Trump have taken a page from Reagan's playbook, appointing corporate loyalists and cronies into positions of power within agencies like the NLRB where they can cripple the power of unions, make it harder for them to operate effectively, and continue disrupting whatever balance is left between employers and employees. While Trump was president, his administration rolled back labor regulations, making it difficult for unions to organize and negotiate for better working conditions.His administration also implemented policies that struck down protections for federal workers and restricted collective bargaining rights.Trump's policies favored employers over employees. Don't forget his recent remarks in front of a crowd of Union workers where he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.Trump's new administration is expected to be the richest in US history. Billionaires funding billionaires helping billionaires, yet they run on a so-called populist platform. On the other hand, Joe Biden has been one of the most pro-union presidents in recent memory. Biden has publicly and outspokenly supported unionization efforts. He is the first president to join workers on the picket line. He has issued executive orders that have helped improve working conditions for federal employees, and he has supported legislation that makes it easier for workers to unionize and bargain collectively.By comparison, the labor relations board under Biden has been more active in protecting workers rights, even investigating union busting practices.Biden's policies have protected worker's overtime pay and pensions and have ensured federal support for union jobs, construction projects, higher wages, collective bargaining and labor standards.Under Biden's admin, the gender pay gap narrowed. His administration also targeted workplace discrimination and the PUMP Act provided workplace protections for pregnant and post-partum workers.Biden's infrastructure agenda funded tens of thousands of infrastructure projects nationwide. Many of these projects require that all manufactured goods and construction materials be made in America.Biden's CHIPS and Science Act invested in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, in workforce advancement and training, and in chips research and development.The Biden admin also helped to implement a corporate minimum tax and a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.In the end however, the media and the American electorate have memory-holed Trump's record as president. The general public is an irrational force, a much too large percentage of American voters aren't making politically informed decisions, instead, they're letting their feelings decide the outcome of our elections. And that's what got Trump elected, *feelings*","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy Dragged After Wild Rant on How American Workers Suck"},{"text":"Having spent time in Texas I can only assume their high school STEM classrooms are as impressive as their football stadiums.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy Dragged After Wild Rant on How American Workers Suck"},{"text":"Yeehawww looming in anticipation","title":"SHOCKING: Laura Loomer Mocks Elon Musk and Donald Trump"},{"text":"The tariff talk is a brilliant strategic move.

Which is why people are still looking into this. Like, we know that globalization has been good, on average, for American workers. And yet we also know that subsets of American workers have been economically devastated, and a critique of politicians has been that they ignored these groups while talking about how good globalization has been on average.Currently, by pretty much every measure, the U.S. economy is doing great. Far better than peer countries, and yet subsets of American families are economically worse off than they were a few years ago as a result of the way the economy has changed. So maybe let's not ignore evidence that shows that the least educated of Americans are negatively impacted by an increase of low-skilled immigrant labor in their area. And as I previously wrote, I think the way to address this is to ensure those citizens have the means and opportunity to increase their skills and education levels rather than limiting immigration. But we won't do this if our focus is on trying to dismiss any evidence that shows that not everyone comes out ahead economically when immigrant populations increase in their area.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"It's not a smart thing to say politically (especially looking at republican voters) but he's right.

Thank you for not going down this routeThose aren't 10m people that go straight to the workforce, though. Our economy isn't flexible enough to handle change like that. I mean, that's pretty standard for any country. That's 10m people we need to provide transportation, housing, food, and then process. If you can imagine, that is a coat that adds up quick. Integrating these people into society isn't nearly as simple as giving them a job and a work visa. And again, none of this touches on the verifiable fact that the economic benefits are literally due to worker exploitation, and there is a link between illegal immigration and lower working conditionsAlso, I would love to go after the businesses employing illegal immigrants. That's a great point. I've made my centrist opinion on the matter clear in some other comments... plenty of Republicans rely on illegal immigrant labor. They are hypocrites and belong in jail with the rest of the people using illegal immigrant laborAnd if you wanted further clarification of my stance on the matter: the illegal immigrants don't belong in jail. I only support deporting the criminals. The people hiring them, however, do. I'm not anti-immigrant. I'm not even against people hopping the border, and I understand that it is a necessary alternative route for people experiencing hardshipWhich is why we need to keep that shit secure and protect the people that need to use it.But all this costs money that would be better spent as aid to the countries these people are coming fromImmigration is only good when it benefits the economy.

Deportation has the same issue.If you really want to stop illegal immigration, you need to address the cause, not the symptom. Why are people coming in illegally? Because there's a lot of opportunity for undocumented labor. How do you stop it? Remove the undocumented labor.Make businesses verify right-to-work before they hire someone, and fine them heavily for any infractions. Work will dry up, and most people will stop coming over when they no longer have a way to support themselves.If it's not feasible to find legal and documented labor for all the businesses that require it, let some people in legally who can fill the roles.Either position works for me. The only thing I'm against is painting immigrants as the enemy while simultaneously profiting off their labor.

You should have at least provided a strong argument there before trailing off into tangential points but given what you've said I don't know if you can actually isolate variables beyond correlation on the topic. And anecdotal correlation at that.  The only thing you said which is worth consideration is illegal immigration's effect on labor supply for citizens as there is a casual relationship there via an increase in supply. Your suggestion that it is fundamentally bad is narrow minded as if economies can't grow which benefit everyone while necessitating an increase in labor. That doesn't hurt citizens.  The effect there is basically zero despite propaganda of the contrary but it's also positive economically for the entire nation. Illegal immigration being less than 5% of labor isn't meaningfully suppressing wages or taking jobs either in totality. Rather the work they provide is often exploited to the benefit of all Americans for otherwise unsustainable economic margins in specific industries, mostly agriculture. Those aren't jobs Americans want or can do as competitively.

If you can do that and still be the best President ever, doesnt that just show we are willing to accept our Presidents being dictators, rather than being a valid justification for his actions? Wilson and FDRWilson was a bitter racist (even relative to others in his time), and he vastly expanded the power of the federal government. He established the income tax and federal reserve, neither of which I view favorably.FDR obviously also increased the power of the federal government too (which again I object to), but my main objection to him is actually similar to my objection to Lincoln: FDR wanted the court to stop shutting down his New Deal policies, regardless of their constitutionality, so he threatened to pack the Supreme Court with justices that agreed with him. This coerced the court to make one of their worst decisions of all time, Wickard v. Filburn, which held that a farmer planting crops on his own land and using them to feed his own animals, therefore neither leaving his home state *nor* engaging in commerce, somehow qualifies as interstate commerce and was punishable under the unconstitutional Agricultural Adjustment Act.Demanding SCOTUS to make insane decisions under threat of packing the court, with a motivation to reform the country unconstitutionally, makes one a dictator, not a good President.","title":"CMV: Lincoln was a good President but should not be considered the best"},{"text":"Thats not government workers fault.

Many federal agencies and employees are in similar positions - anyone that doesnt have customer facing responsibilities could be working from home quite effectively and it would reduce federal expenditures on leases and expensive office space.

This wasn't just some political disagreement - Confederate sympathizers were actively sabotaging railroads, burning bridges, and organizing armed resistance in border states. Without quick action, Maryland could have seceded and cut off DC from the North entirely.You mention Washington, but he actually did something similar during the Whiskey Rebellion. He personally led troops to crush tax protesters and authorized military trials for civilians. Jefferson's embargo destroyed the economy and trampled states' rights far worse than anything Lincoln did.The key difference is that Lincoln's actions were targeted at preserving the republic itself. Without those emergency measures, we might be two separate countries today, with slavery potentially continuing for decades longer in the South. The Chief Justice you mentioned, Taney, was the same guy who wrote the Dred Scott decision that claimed Black Americans could never be citizens - hardly an impartial arbiter.Every foundational President had to take controversial actions to preserve the nation. But Lincoln's presidency literally determined whether we'd remain one country and whether human bondage would continue on this continent. That's why he's considered the greatest - the stakes were existential and he got it right when it mattered most.Also worth noting that Lincoln restored habeas corpus as soon as it was practically feasible.

You *might* save at most 10k and that's with including a lot of legal headaches. My H1B Visa counterparts make the same amount as their US hired counterparts.**Secondly, I don't think Tesla factors in H1B Salary differences and cost.** This isn't going to make much sense if you're on the outside looking in but having worked in industry, I'll try to explain it. If I'm working on Project X, I have to sit down and figure out how many engineers I'll need to complete everything. So lets say that I've determined I need one manager, one senior engineer, and two junior engineers. When I calculate the total engineering costs, every single one of those resources will cost lets say 200 per hour. No, I do not make 400k a year as an engineer. But that's supposed to be an averaging out of everything that goes into paying me. So that's my salary, health insurance, retirement, bonus, rent for the building, so on and so on and so on. It also includes any differential between what I make and what my manager makes.  I don't actually go in and factor in the actual salaries that people make. That's how you end up with bureaucratic letdown. If at the end of the year we find out that there's a huge differential in the amount made and the amount paid out? My excel sheet gets increased to 225 per engineer or decreased to 175 per engineer. It gets increased to better estimate cost, and it gets decreased to win business. **Thirdly, H1B is a national security/development program.**The thing you need to remember is this. A Russian missile engineer would probably be much happier working at Ford. Ford gets an extra engineer. Russia loses a missile engineer. Uncle Sam is happy because we have deprived Russia of a missile engineer in exchange for....nothing.","title":"Musk, Ramaswamy defend Silicon Valleys foreign-born hires"},{"text":"Not to mention that the Project 2025 architects have been planning how to do all of these things for years now (in some cases, decades).","title":"Trumps Tariff Threats Are Setting Off a Global Supply Chain Freakout"},{"text":"I certainly dont have evidence of him doing that outside of the war, but I dont see any indication that he wouldnt have just found another excuse to do so - someone willing to imprison dissenters and ignore court orders to do so is probably not all that concerned with justification, imo.

As always, government restrictions on the market lead to people suffering.You point out the lack of entry level jobs, yet at the same time champion a minimum wage. This is cause and effect. If you set the minimum wage to $15 an hour, yeah, that's going to make it difficult for people to get entry level jobs. If you look at youth unemployment in Ontario, it is at 17%. Youth are a surrogate for low skilled workers in general, since they as a class have less education, less job experience, and fewer skills than older workers. Raising the minimum wage would only make things worse, in fact the minimum wage needs to be substantially lowered, if not abolished.

I mean people live in frozen wastelands like Nunavut, Alaska, and Winnipeg. Sure, there is probably a reason why 50% of our population is huddled along the Windsor to Montreal corridor.

It's not fair that people in the rest of the world are squished together in extremely densely populated megacities, while we leave most of our land idle, being wasted. Canada should continue to intake record numbers of immigrants in order to even out the balance.Canadians are not hoarding land.  Immigrants to Canada are choosing to move to already over-populated cities because they are not going to live a half-mile from a den of Polar Bears.  I can tell you that much as an American.  It's like suggesting that immigrants to America should try to establish settlements in Death Valley, and wondering why they don't.  I can tell you why...  There is nothing there.  The climate sucks, there is no available housing, and no work to be found.  That's why immigrants flock to the cities, where they can find means of living.  Not to mention trying to settle relatively pristine places would be a waste of them.  Our world doesn't have enough unsettled places, and it would be a waste of woodland (or desert) to convert them over to housing.  Canada should treasure it's untouched northern provinces as part of it's national heritage.

I'll simply point out that letting in immigrants wouldn't be \\"helping them\\" insomuch as it would be \\"helping our economy\\".  Unskilled immigration creates a temporary caste where current citizens have a boost in quality-of-life and drop in cost-of-living.  I've yet to see a study that says \\"but if you cross a certain number, it stops happening that way\\".  I think your opinion that the \\"entire world\\" would hop the border is simply hyperbolic.   Ultimately, the corporations are far better served supporting the administration that allows the most illegal immigrants in. It is a simple financial factYou're missing the point, I think.  *NOBODY* is \\"letting\\" illegal immigrants in.  They're either letting *LEGAL* immigrants in by opening the border more, or they're making sure the immigrants who come in are illegal.  Using your 10M citation, that's 10M people we wanted to turn away that are now working for companies that know they can ignore labor laws.  Biden \\"talked a good game\\" but really tightened his fist, one of the things some progressives disliked about him.  A pro-immigration position isn't \\"let's let 20M illegal immigrants in!\\", it's \\"let's make those 10M people be legal and be protected if they need to go to the police\\".The biggest difference in sanctuary cities right now isn't that they let illegal immigrants do whatever they want whenever they want.  But if they are witness to a crime, they are generally protected from deportation as best our authorities can, to prevent them from hiding from the police.EDIT: And an interesting thought-point.

In many cases, society suffers so badly that it's worth it as a society to invest massive resources into things like police forces in order to deter and halt the most egregious cases of \\"externalizing costs\\" such as, say, *armed robbery.* Obviously BMW economics are not armed robbery, but it IS worth legislating against this kind of behaviour to ensure that consumers and manufacturers play nice with each other, because rampant anti-consumerism *does* damage society as a whole when left unchecked.In other words, this shit is so awful that it should really be illegal. It's not large in scope... Yet. Which means now is a good time to nip this in the bud before this economic model subsumes billions of dollars worth of productive industry and becomes so big that it's political suicide to kill it.?I feel like you've made better points that point to other differentiators.

That wont make the government more efficient just like how it doesnt make businesses more efficient. All you get in private business is a short term gain in profit and a long term decline in product quality and customer satisfaction. There is no silver bullet to make the government more efficient by losing people or making them miserable. You need to go in with a scalpel and not a hatchet for this kind of operation.

[The economy demands illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzpiYIR6Xg). The left thus, by making illegal immigrants legal, try to ensure they get the same social benefits as everybody else. That leads to immigrants learning that they should be going to that place instead of some other place where they have less legal protections. That is why leftism is better for the economy, as Donald Trump famously stated. This puts enormous pressure on the right to come up with some way to make the immigrants illegal and profitable, such as by appealing to racism, which then leads to economic downturns as immigrants learn to avoid the racist places. Initially the markets are jubilant about the right coming into power as it can exploit the newly illegalized workforce, but as the workers flee, become unproductive and crash the economy as a result of this, demand for economy boosting leftism increases and you get more relaxed immigration policies and on and on it goes.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Where work will set them free?","title":"Trump's border czar plans halfway homes for migrant kids"},{"text":"Murkowski is unbeatable.

The central authority periodically retires or prunes transaction histories to improve efficiency.

It is slightly possible that the cult dynamic is so strong, it wont dissipate until his last hamberder and covfefe is consumed, but theoretically, if there is any backlash to how awful this term will likely go, the party might realize they have to move on.So then the question becomes, who do they move on to? I really only see three possible outcomes.The most unlikely scenario is that an Obama-like figure bursts onto the scene and unites the party back into a functioning conservative party. That person would have to somehow lightly address the grievance politics of the MAGA movement but reenergize the Reagan politics of the establishments, do so as a charming and motivating individual, and probably tamp down a lot of the bigotry. I cannot imagine who that person would be in the current lineup of Republicans so its probably going to end up being somebody with a very low profile right now.The worst case scenario is the next Trump appears on the scene, masterfully plays the grievance politics game and riles up the bigotry, but the GOP has learned its lessons and this person is actually an intelligent human being with the capability to get the evil done. We get MAGA 2.0 Now with Competency! and things get really scary in 2028. Is that Vance? Probably not, but maybe he plays it cool the next four years and just does TV hits and breaks ties in the Senate if any occur, then takes the mantle.The hopeful scenario is that the last hamberder comes in the next couple of years and the MAGA segment of the population fizzles out without their glorious orange leader. There will be a brutal fight to out-MAGA each other to try to claim Trumps mantle and the ensuing chaos will throw everything into a stalemate. The threat of Trump in the primaries disappears, so the looneys start losing their place in the House in 2026 and that voting block is rendered inert. The establishment takes advantage of the power vacuum and puts up a candidate in 2028 in the Romney/McCain vein and the fringe loses its power for good.I dont think anybody can really predict how this is going to go until the great orange menace is out of the spotlight for good.","title":"CMV: Republicans will hold a permanent Senate majority for the foreseeable future"},{"text":"The Electoral College overriding the peoples will is 100% theft.The peoples will?

In particular, *this is not wasteful* in respect to customers who don't want the service at all. You're not \\"wasting\\" resources distributing the software to people who aren't currently keeping their subscription up to date and therefore are not licensed to use it.In the former case, you've actually already paid the manufacturing costs associated with that capability, your sunk cost has already been factored into the initial sale price, and now you are simply engaging in naked anti-consumerism, denying people of services that were already paid for just to charge extra from the people who do care about that functionality. There's a \\"negative sum\\" to this anti-consumerist game whereas software distribution is by economic necessity, positive-sum, where the increased productivity of clients who use said feature outweighs the costs of the subscription model.I don't mind car companies charging for features, and I appreciate that economies of scale make it more convenient to simply sell a small range of models with all features included whether the customer cares about each one or not. The problem I have is that, in the BMW model, *everybody is, on balance, worse off.* Customers are missing out on services they already paid for, *and* the company is wasting resources manufacturing dead weight that customers aren't using. It's the externalization of costs to the detriment of society as a whole. In software, simply charging for the service you use has no external environmental downsides or unnecessary additional distribution costs attached to it.","title":"CMV: Subscriptions are better than owning in most situations, people just want stuff for free"},{"text":"Ummm?? 15000  WHOAH, that is NOT ENOUGH.

I think its a very vocal minority of US citizens (talking about the US here) who is for 100% open boarders with no screening. Because why would we be? We need to be able to screen for people who actually present a danger to the US and her citizens; this is not a popular country globally and Im sure there are a fair few groups that would appreciate not being questioned too hard on their way to commit blatant acts of terrorism or selling deadly synthetic drugs on the streets. I am all for legal immigration, because thats how we are going to survive the population decline. We should open more pathways for folks to move here and become citizens along legal channels, especially those escaping violence and prosecution. Legal immigrants tend to be boons for whatever community they join, reduce the crime in those areas, and create business that keeps the economy chugging along as new wealth is created for areas struggling (Like Springfield, OH.)I think, instead of a wall (which will not work, and has never worked,) we should partner with Mexico to build up the facilities in boarder crossing towns. This is so that migrants can be housed until their applications can be processed and their backgrounds checked and they can have all of their court dates. Give folks who see the US as a safe haven a safe place to wait until they are allowed in illegally. The Mexican military and the US military should be able to coordinate a way to keep these cities safe from bad actors, and the coordination between the two countries on something like this could lead to future coordination in dealing with the cartels the US helped create. Now, for the illegal migrants: they come here for money and protection, and are essentially the backbone of our agricultural system. We get rid of them, we are fucked, because capitalism demands exploitation, and who better to exploit than a captive population of illegal migrants who wouldnt dare reach out for help from the authorities for obvious, they put children in cages reasons. They still need to go, because if we are a country of laws, we need to follow those laws. But we need to hold off until those agricultural roles can be filled through legal immigration. People **want** to follow rules, and Im fairly certain many illegal immigrants dont follow them because properly following the laws is made damn near difficult to impossible. Thats why we should work with Mexico to build up checkpoint towns with short term housing options, food and water, where the potential future Americans can wait while they follow the laws.Is there a chance of abuse? Yes. Is there a chance of inhumane conditions? Also yes. But Im not here to get into the nitty gritty details, just to speak my mind that if we want to end illegal immigration, we need to make the process accessible at the boarder. Again, folks generally want to follow the laws: we are social creatures and violating laws doesnt feel good because it means going against the tribes rules. Lets make it easier to follow the rules and give shelter and safety to those most in danger, as all humans deserve safety, security, food, water and shelter.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"I'm a utilitarian for the most part.

They are pretty much exploited by default.They are only exploited more than Work Visa immigrants *because they illegal*.  For those who come here to work, the \\"illegal\\" part isn't a choice - if they're working the farms they're not gun-runners or anything.  The \\"pro-illegal-immigrant\\" sentiment isn't that people want ICE to turn a blind eye.  They want those illegal immigrants *to be legal immigrants instead of deported*, which would royally fuck those businesses you think are spreading the sentiment. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enoughI agree, but that's a lower priority issue.  Immigrants on Work Visas go through a lot of hoops to work here under those terms and they are satisfied (and with a few annoying exceptions, not fearing deportation every day). Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers moreBut every single study says **immigration** provides a much clearer net benefit to the economy, without any sign of diminishing returns.  The problem with illegal immigration in this sense isn't that we lose control of the number and quality of immigrants, it's that immigrants can be exploited because we don't give them rights.  Ultimately, the corporations are far better served being openly anti-illegal-immigrant because that is the path that keeps undocumented workers from reporting the continued exploitation.  There's only so much money the government can (or will) throw at deportation, and that spend has a diminishing return.  The only thing that will stop there being a large number of illegal immigrants in the US is for the US economy to fail or their local country economy to strengthen.  So yes, those exploiting them want them CONSTANTLY terrified of an over-equipped ICE just coming to separate them from their families.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Hes pretty morbidly obese and isnt young, hes already 73 years old.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 26, 2024"},{"text":"You dont want illegal immigrants, and don't want to open up more avenues for legacy immigration?

We had a LOT of people online advocating that people should vote against Labour because they dont support Palestine. In many constituencies (including my own) thatd be a vote for the Conservatives, even if you voted a third party such as Greens or LibDems. There were also a lot of posts and comments advocating for people to just not vote. Essentially throw in the towel and all the toys out of the sandbox, and protest the current institution by not voting. They are both absurd premises and, with the context that my father regularly accused me of being a communist as a teenager (Im more a moderate socialist admittedly), people irl further left than I am see that. Ive had many conversations with people who, like I, voted Labour only to get the Cons out of their constituency. Some got to vote Greens or LibDems, but a lot of people who would normally rather chop their arm off than support Labour sacrificed their vote to get rid of the Cons. At the time I was genuinely convinced those that started the above movement against tactical voting were trolls/right wing/foreign bots or something of that vein. Then most well known leftist outlets and activists picked it up, likely out of shortsightedness and a need to react, and random people ran with it online.

If I understand correctly, your argument is that illegal immigration drives down wages makes life harder for working class people who aren't immigrants. This part is true, because illegal immigrants lack the protections that citizens enjoy, so they are forced into worse deals. The next part of the argument is where I think you're wrong. You seem to think that people who are in favor of immigrant rights are astroturfed because of the above argument, and that the only reason to be pro-immigrant is to keep wages down.Where your argument fails is that it doesn't examine *why* immigrants drive down wages. It's *because* they lack the protections that native-born people enjoy and are therefore more easily exploitable. If instead, we didn't criminalize immigration and gave them the same rights, they'd not have as much incentive to take the more exploitative deals and we could be allies in the class war. Further, there would be more demand for work if everyone enjoyed a decent standard, so the competing for wages would be a non-factor. So rather than the pro-immigrant people being a cause for the wage deflation, it is the people advocating for making legal immigration almost impossible.Your housing argument is fair, but immigration is but a drop in the giant ocean of reasons for that particular struggle. A couple of the bigger reasons is the giant investment firms buying up so much of the housing stock and driving up price, as well as zoning rules preventing the building of more dense housing.","title":"Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor"},{"text":"Did you actually read my example?GPS navigation requires satellites, and satellites have finite lifetimes and need to be replaced.

Kinda hard to have a lot of serious intellectual development when your culture has a notorious streak of anti-intellectualism.

Sure, some companies abuse the model, but that doesnt mean subscriptions are inherently bad.The John Deere situation is a different beast. Its absolutely wrong to restrict farmers from repairing their own equipment, and we do need better right-to-repair laws. But the idea of offering services like diagnostics and remote updates as a subscription isnt inherently badits how theyre enforcing it thats the problem. This is less about the subscription model itself and more about a company exploiting its dominance to lock people out of what they already own.The Adobe argument also oversimplifies things. Yes, they made a lot of money selling perpetual licenses, but those licenses were prohibitively expensive for smaller users. Subscriptions allow people to access top-tier software without paying thousands of dollars upfront. Thats a huge win for freelancers, small businesses, and students. And while open-source projects like Linux are awesome, theyre often run on donations or volunteer work, which isnt a sustainable business model for every company.The music example is more complicated, too. Streaming hasnt been perfect for artists, but its made music more accessible to billions of people and has given smaller, independent artists a chance to reach global audiences. Under the old system, most artists still struggled to make money because record labels took a huge cut. The real issue isnt streaming itselfits how revenue gets distributed.At the end of the day, this isnt about renting your life from corporations. Subscriptions arent mandatory. If you value ownership, you can still buy perpetual licenses, physical media, or whatever works for you. Subscriptions are just an option that offers flexibility, convenience, and access. The real problem lies in companies abusing the model, and we should push for better laws to protect consumers.

Why?The easiest explanation is that Republicans in both the House and Senate yielded to objections from their all-but-certain presidential nominee, former president Donald Trump.

A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers &amp; if were really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH:Anyone who says they have the \\"TRUTH\\" is lying to you. Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer). That doesnt start in college, it starts YOUNG. A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. Someone didn't have a date to prom.A culture that venerates Cory from Boy Meets World, or Zach &amp; Slater over Screech in Saved by the Bell, or Stefan over Steve Urkel in Family Matters, will not produce the best engineers.Venerates characters that haven't been relevant in over 20 years? (Fact: I know *multiple* sets of immigrant parents in the 90s who actively limited how much their kids could watch those TV shows precisely because they promoted mediocrityand their kids went on to become wildly successful STEM graduates). Praising immigrants isn't going to win you friends with the conservatives. More movies like Whiplash, fewer reruns of Friends. More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons. More books, less TV. More creating, less chillin. More extracurriculars, less hanging out at the mall.How dare children have free time! Most normal American parents look skeptically at those kinds of parents. More normal American kids view such those kinds of kids with scorn. If you grow up aspiring to normalcy, normalcy is what you will achieve.I don't even know what he's saying here \\"those kinds\\"? Does he means nerds? Now close your eyes &amp; visualize which families you knew in the 90s (or even now) who raise their kids according to one model versus the other. Be brutally honest.WHAT FUCKING MODELS!? You haven't actually said anything yet. Normalcy doesnt cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent. And if we pretend like it does, well have our asses handed to us by China. Work will set you free.This can be our Sputnik moment. Weve awaken from slumber before &amp; we can do it again. Trumps election hopefully marks the beginning of a new golden era in America, but only if our culture fully wakes up. A culture that once again prioritizes achievement over normalcy; excellence over mediocrity; nerdiness over conformity; hard work over laziness.But only for the poor. Rich people can still sit back and sip expensive whiskey. \\n Thats the work we have cut out for us, rather than wallowing in victimhood &amp; just wishing (or legislating) alternative hiring practices into existence.

And if you argue that you could buy one without the system in place, then you're arguing that its better to pay for the system + the right to use it, which is just bonkers.If you're talking about maintenance, you would need the same ammount, wether or not you have to pay monthly to heat your seats, if you only turn them on during the winter, there's the same ammount of wear on the system right?And since you talk about flexibility, would there be a daily, weekly, monthly subscription? If you live somewhere where you only need to heat up your seats for a week, paying for a whole month doesn't sound like flexibility, and i bet your ass that if they make the subscriptions daily you're gonna be charged more money, so it'd be more advantageous to pay monthly, say, but then you only use it for a week, idk, sounds like needlessly complicated and a waste of money.Better to pay a flat price for the feature and use it whenever you want to.Edit: i misread something, i understand you actually meant that the heated seats feature would be in place but not paid?
