Trumps DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.His attorney general appointment was met with condemnation and astonishment from both Republicans and Democrats.Gaetz, 42, who has never worked in the Justice Department or as a prosecutor at any level of government, was investigated by the department for nearly three years over sex trafficking allegations involving a 17-year-old girl. He denied the allegations. His office said in 2023 that he had been told by prosecutors that he would not face criminal charges.In June, the US House Ethics Committee announced it was investigating several allegations against Gaetz, including that he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favours to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.Read more here: [https://inews.co.uk/news/matt-gaetz-withdraws-trump-nominee-attorney-general-3394202](https://inews.co.uk/news/matt-gaetz-withdraws-trump-nominee-attorney-general-3394202)","title":"Matt Gaetz withdraws as Trumps nominee for attorney general"},{"text":"Ah yes, the most pressing issue facing Americans today: bathrooms in the Capitol.

(related) Trump's other nonsense cabinet picks (Hegseth, McMahon, Gabbard, Kennedy, etc.) have a much easier time in confirmation because R Senators consider the Democrats to have been given their 'sacrifice'.","title":"Matt Gaetz withdraws as attorney general nominee"},{"text":"I say Hooray!

These are people who make more than $35,000 but less than $58,000 per year, but dont currently qualify for overtime; to oversimplify, bosses have?[reclassified many of these workers as managers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/economy/labor-department-overtime-rule.html), exempting them from federal overtime protections.The Biden rule would make them eligible: According to Labor Department spokesman Jesse Lawder, this group includes hundreds of thousands of people who do many types of manufacturing work as well as those holding low-to-medium-level positions in everything from retail and fast-food franchises to construction. Many are overworked and underpaid due to the same elite rigging of our economy perpetrated by the Rich Men North of Richmond.","title":"A Trump Judge Just Nixed Overtime Pay for Millionsand Media Yawned"},{"text":"Dont trust experts, do your own research!Its a real shame that nobody knows how/has the patience to properly research things anymore.","title":"Republicans Target Social Sciences to Curb Ideas They Dont Like"},{"text":"Double edged sword, maybe this ends some religious organizations' tax-exempt status down the line.","title":"The House Just Blessed Trumps Authoritarian Playbook By Passing Nonprofit-Killer Bill:"},{"text":"Ill give her Dorie.","title":"Ellen has fled the country after Trump's election | America Is Getting Greater Already ??"},{"text":"Who could have predicted that a real life super-villain's super-power would be super-stupidity?","title":"'Like nothing you've seen': Trump team readies a flurry of executive actions for Day 1"},{"text":"If a man can identify as a woman, then why can't a Caucasian identify as african-american?","title":"GOP Lawmakers Team Up to Define Male and Female by Biology"},{"text":"And Frump has blood on his for all the US covid deaths.

This is because, according to [lifemd.com](http://lifemd.com), \\"while males typically have lower levels of estrogen than women, maintaining a proper balance between this hormone and others is essential.\\" The fact that you are comparing this to giving an otherwise completely healthy child puberty blockers to disrupt the natural body cycle for a child is FUCKING INSANE. How do you even begin to compare these two scenarios?If a child is going through puberty early and the parents want to delay that development until it is a more appropriate time then almost no one is going to have an issue with that nor attempt to create laws to prevent it.Where is your evidence of this? You think no one is going to have an issue with a parent intentionally delaying their child going through puberty? Again, are you FUCKING INSANE? This isn't a thing, and if it was, you could argue these parents should be arrested for child abuse.Something like 80 percent of the males in the US are circumsized, which is done shortly after birth, at a time when a child can't consent and isn't fully developed and yet there has been no major push for any sort of law to prevent this.Male circumcision was promoted because, at the time, the medical industry completed studies that indicated male circumcision was a reventative measure for an array of pathologies including reduced risks of penile cancer, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and even cervical cancer in sexual partners. In recent times, those medical benefits have been challeneged, but according to the AAP, the data meant to challenge these claims still isn't conclusive. Further more, this procedure happens when you are a baby. You have no recollection of it happening and there are no long term side effects on the child or their development.Few, if anyone, claimed that these instances were 'harmful\\" and \\"unhealthy,\\" until it became a trans issue. Why is that?Why is that? It's because 1 of your scenario compares giving medicine to a child to treat a medical issue to giving a child medicine to intentionally disrupt their natural body's development. Your next scenario is literally a fantasy you created in your head to help support your argument. And the last scenario compares a completely irrelevant medical procedure that happens when you're a baby for assumed medical benefits throughout the boy's entire life.","title":"Trump win emboldens Republicans' anti-trans rights blitz"},{"text":"What blows my mind is the foundation in Germany for someone like Hitler to rise to power made sense back then.

An equal amount is withheld and paid by the employee. So if your gross pay is $1,000, and $62 dollars is withheld for SS and $14.50 for MC, your employer pays an additional $76.50. The employer is also responsible for quarterly reports and quarterly unemployment insurance (federal and state). Employers have lobbied for decades to remove this mandate.Weve all heard about how republicans want to privatize SS, but forcing individuals to pay 100% would accomplish the same result.And theyll couch it all as personal responsibility.My bigger fear is theyll also eliminate the EITC.

The couples anxiety stems, in particular, from testimony that former White House communications director and current View co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin gave in 2022 during the January 6 hearings, during which she recounted running into Gaetz outside of the Oval Office. **Farah Griffin testified that Gaetz was carrying a folder filled with conspiracy theories about Joe Scarborough murdering his intern,** which he then presented to President Trump, who later tweeted about it. **Despite the baseless nature of the conspiracy theory, Joe and Mika are petrified of retribution and of Gaetz opening an investigation into Joe and the intern, one source with knowledge of their concerns said.** Thats what this was about. It has nothing to do with ratings or Comcast. Its all about fear of retribution and investigation. Another source close to the matter said **Joe and Mika believed that by meeting with Trump, they could assuage his potential desire for reckless payback and thus nuke any possibility of having to endure the headlines of a Gaetz witch hunt or legal torture campaign.** (Reached for comment, Scarborough referred me to an MSNBC spokesperson, who denied this characterization of the motivations for Joe and Mikas Mar-a-Lago visit and said it was both false and inaccurate.)","title":"Morning Joe Stars Are Reportedly Petrified Of Matt Gaetz Opening Investigation Into Death of Scarborough Intern"},{"text":"How about all those Pizzagate morons voting to put actual sexual predators in office?

That is a bullshit excuse to just hate on trans people and claim it is really about the safety of a child.If a cis boy has heightened levels of estrogen and is developing breasts almost no one would have an issue with them taking tesosterone and maybe even having a top surgery to remove the breast tissue; nor would people be calling for laws banning parents and their children from making this type of decision.  In fact, my anti-trans cousin suffered from this condition and he himself wishes that he would have known about it as a teen so he could have had gender affirming care of hormone therapy and surgery as a minor.  Yet, he opposes those things for trans people.  If a child is going through puberty early and the parents want to delay that development until it is a more appropriate time then almost no one is going to have an issue with that nor attempt to create laws to prevent it.Something like 80 percent of the males in the US are circumsized, which is done shortly after birth, at a time when a child can't consent and isn't fully developed and yet there has been no major push for any sort of law to prevent this.Few, if anyone, claimed that these instances were 'harmful\\" and \\"unhealthy,\\" until it became a trans issue.  Why is that?  I'll answer... it's because people don't care about the actual procedures, they only care about the why a person is getting them.  If the why is transgender healthcare for a minor, they want it banned.  If it is for some other form, then the same exact procedures are perfectly fine.","title":"Trump win emboldens Republicans' anti-trans rights blitz"},{"text":"The promises of a pedophile carry no weight","title":"Gaetz reportedly tells senators he wont go after Trump foes C in his first week"},{"text":"They locked up a city of 2 million people, half of which are Children.

Im in NC, and we elected all blue across the board *except for Trump*, it makes no sense at all!The key data raising concerns that a hack may have been deployed is the number of bullet ballots which exist for Trump in swing states. Bullet ballots are when voters vote for one candidatein this case the Presidentand dont fill out the rest of the ballot. Every year, in every stateincluding in the past two elections Trump ran inthe percentage of bullet ballots is around 1%. This trend has stayed consistent in the 43 non-swing states in the 2024 election. However, the percentage of bullet ballots is not just anomalous in swing states for Trump this yearit is off the charts.According to one of the open letters, in Arizona, Trumps percentage of bullet ballots totaled 7.2%. In Nevada, 5.5%. In comparison, bullet ballots for Trump in Oregon, Utah and Idahothe three states which border Arizona and Nevada, with equally fervent Trump voterscount for less than 0.05% in each state.The same pattern continues across the other swing states, with an astonishing 11% of votes for Trump in North Carolina being bullet ballots.Even more bizarrely, the bullet ballots are not widely spread out across the swing states, but targeted in a handful of counties. In Arizona, for example, Maricopa County accounts for almost all of the historic number of bullet ballots.Critically, only 400,000 votes would be need to be added in strategic precincts in swing states in order to secure Trumps victory. In each of these swing states, too, the number of votes for Trump takes the count just over the margin which necessitates a legal hand recount. If anything, experts say, the numbers are too good to be true.Finally, the other piece of data raising eyebrows is the fact that Trump won all seven swing statesthe first candidate to sweep the board in four decadeswithout record voter turnout. Less than 50% of voters chose Trump, with Harris less than 1.7% behind him. One data scientist crunched the numbers:Its north of a 35 billion to 1 probability that you could win seven out of seven outside of recount range with less than 50% of the vote.https://www.planetcritical.com/p/cyber-security-experts-warn-election-hackedhttps://youtu.be/iX3vMJOADlE?si=SGcrHilQ3GT5OnP3https://newrepublic.com/post/188045/elon-musk-2024-election-meddling-pac-planshttps://www.threads.net/@alex.nick.jungle/post/DBjoTQigVTJhttps://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-judge-orders-erie-elections-board-to-extend-hours-as-thousands-of-mail-ballots-remain-missing/https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-orders-pennsylvania-county-issue-ballots-voters-who-did-not-receive-them-2024-11-02/https://www.timescitizen.com/kifg/election-error-absentee-ballots-not-counted/article_4e5970bc-9d60-11ef-a470-6ba443293219.htmlhttps://substack.com/home/post/p-151721941https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/donald-trump-contest-election-outcome-4521f4f7https://www.threads.net/@realmcspocky/post/DCIdMzWx74nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/media/elon-musk-dominion-voting-misinformation/index.htmlhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/election-day-bomb-threats-overwhelmingly-targeted-democrat-leaning-rcna179006https://www.reuters.com/article/business/china-grants-more-trademark-approvals-for-ivanka-trump-firm-including-voting-m-idUSKCN1NB0TL/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0l3wl76gzoIf you took part in Elons lottery or if youre in a swing state and the numbers arent adding up, check and see if your vote was confirmed.Edit 2: oh look, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence findings:https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/report-select-committee-intelligence-united-states-senate-russian-active-measureshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_electionThe final and fifth volume, which was the result of three years of investigations, was released on August 18, 2020,[6] ending one of the United States highest-profile congressional inquiries.[7][8] The Committee report found that the Russian government had engaged in an extensive campaign to sabotage the election in favor of Donald Trump, which included assistance from some of Trumps own advisers.[7]Edit: ignore anyone who tells you not to believe what you can see with your own eyes, or anyone who tells you not to make sure your vote was counted.

His first administration had a lot of bad picks, Deep Staters and other TDS sufferers who undermined his administration.   Having to take 4 years off enabled him to assemble a team of \\"Avengers\\" who have established their bona fides as real outsiders who will address government problems, and who align with Trump's goals.2. Trump would frequently insult people in very classless ways.  While he still does this (and the people he does it to certainly have it coming), he seems to be more selective about whom he insults, and less crass about it.   He has also adopted a much more conciliatory tone towards his opponents. 3.  Trump is not a liar, per se, but he is a bullshitter.  By that I mean that he says stuff that is exaggerated, and technically untrue, but no one takes it literally, at least no one with any sense.  A good example of this is him referring to his election as the biggest landslide in American history, which is simply not true.  Nixon in 1972 and Reagan in 1984 won with way larger landslides.  Reagan won 49 states.  But Trump's victory is unprecedented in the last few decades, and was unexpected by pretty much the entire media.    \\n  \\nHe's a salesman, and he excels at self-promotion and braggadocio, even if it means he's not always strictly telling the truth.  However, it seems to me that he's doing this less as well, and while he hasn't stopped being the larger-than-life personality that people love and his enemies detest, I do feel like he's more grounded now.  He's always had a habit of making seemingly outrageous claims that turn out to have been true all along, but I think he's toned down his \\"bullshitting\\". \\\\--I have no idea if his second administration will be more effective than his first, but I believe it will be.  Despite making a lot of mistakes, he did accomplish a tremendous amount of good the first time around, and unlike the whole Democrat Party (it seems) he \\\\_does\\\\_ learn from his mistakes.  I am very optimistic about his second go-around, and am thankful that he did have 4 years to focus on making new allies and laying the groundwork for his second term as 47.","title":"With the completion of the election...is there anything that you dislike/criticize about trump?"},{"text":"Americans paid attention as evidenced by the huge rallies for Kamala apparently you were sleeping.","title":"Jimmy Kimmel coins new nickname for Trumps AG pick Matt Gaetz: Caucasian Diddy | The late-night host ripped Gaetz and tied him to another famous sexual assault investigation"},{"text":"he shouldn't even be breathing our air...","title":"Leaked DOJ investigation into Matt Gaetz alleges web of payments over three years"},{"text":"There's that, but it's also the idea that once an egg cracks, you can't put it back in it's shell.Coming to terms with the fact that you're trans is similar, it changes how you view the world and yourself on a fundamental level.","title":"The House will have its first openly trans member next year.

This is an immensely broad subject and deeply connected to the overall health care economy of the U.S.And if you are unaware, the health care economy of the U.S. is fractured due to over a century of government intervention. This is like asking how do libertarians intend to deal with cancer. The answer is not political. Libertarians want people with mental health problems or cancer or any other problem, to be able to obtain the care they need.But we must recognize how that century+ of intervention has made obtaining that care more expensive and made us all more reliant upon third-party payers like insurance or government.Ultimately, what the government has done through its intervention is made people more dependent upon additional government intervention (I would assert this is always a goal of government) while also limiting access to care which enriches a smaller number of providers who benefit from the regulatory state.When these happen together, we have higher costs and the need for more resources to be expended by government to maintain more dependent people and those increased costs.So if you seek a solution to mental health and to health care in general, the answer is always to start removing the layers of intervention like layers of an onion.

The article is linked below and details much much more:Since 1965, Title I has provided critical financial help to high-poverty schools and districts. Project 2025 plans to eliminate Title I funding entirely. In its place, states will receive no-strings-attached block grants with zero regulations or oversight.  A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that removing Title I funding would also worsen existing teacher shortages by wiping out up to 6 percent the workforce, concentrated in low-income communities.   Removing Title I funding would mean losing thousands of teachers and ultimately limiting childrens access to quality instruction, said Will Ragland, vice president of research for Advocacy and Outreach at CAP. It would be devastating to local schools, students, families, and communities.If Project 2025 succeeds in gutting this funding, students are not going to get the support they need, said Denise Specht, President of Education Minnesota. And the staff delivering those services and support will lose their jobs.

They took to the airwaves and the Internet and pronounced that congressional Republicans could undo the presidents agenda  with him still in office, mind you  and enact into law a conservative vision for government, without compromise. Strangely, according to these voices, the only reason that was not occurring had nothing to do with the fact that the president was unlikely to repeal his own laws, or that under the Constitution, absent the assent of the president or two-thirds of both houses of Congress, you cannot make law. The problem was a lack of will on the part of congressional Republican leaders. Now we see that these same voices have turned to the threat of a government shutdown or a default on the debt as the means by which we can force President Obama to agree to their demands. I wonder what they would have said, if during the last two years of President Bushs term, the Democratic congressional majority had tried something similar. The tragedy here is that these voices have not been honest with our fellow conservatives. They have not been honest about what can be accomplished when your party controls Congress, but not the White House. As a result we missed chances to achieve important policies for the good of the country. The response I often hear to these points is: Well, Republicans at least need to fight. On this I agree. It is imperative that we fight for what we believe in. But we should fight smartly. **I have never heard of a football team that won by throwing only Hail Mary passes, yet that is what is being demanded of Republican leaders today.**https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/eric-cantor-the-gop-after-john-boehner.html","title":"Trump thinks he won a mandate to change America.

There's a case to be made that voluntary community organizations aren't just a better way to solve problems than outsourcing things to the government. They actually foster relationships and build real community. They help people feel less isolated and less helpless. Some of the biggest symptoms of depression are loneliness, meaninglessness, and helplessness. Joining a volunteer fire department, taking part in a religious organization, helping your neighbor build a barn or tending to aging people can make you feel better about yourself and more connected to your community. And if you need therapy, you can find or start a community organization to hire a therapist to help people in the community.  Government programs in the US have a history of being public relations showpieces for whoever is being elected - but the real work of mental health is done in communities, schools, and daycares.
