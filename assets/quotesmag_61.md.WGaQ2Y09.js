I hate, absolutely abhor the fact that most of our 'political' discourse in this modern age is centered around what candidate A) should or could have done to win.  Should it not be more important that the party or candidate have policies and competence to bring to government?   This is not football.  Winning is not the goal!  Yes, winning is the necessary fist step to achieve the goal.  But every election cycle we get hyper-focused on messaging, fundraising, ground games, online presence... and that election cycle never ends.  So winning becomes the de-facto goal!When do we have time to actually consider and debate policy and administrative competence?  I guess I'm just griping about a particularly frustrating aspect of democracy itself.  Maybe heightened by our current media landscape.  But I think I have a point.  **We, the people, should not have to care about campaign strategy**.  We should be evaluating candidates based on their competence and policy proposals.

Its terrifying. If I werent the type of person who fact checks and researches everything thoroughly, Id believe the lies. They repeatedly played fake videos of illegal immigrants running rampant beating up police officers in NY, misinterpreted video of an illegal immigrant giving cameras the finger. Trump is constantly talking about how the dems are letting MS 13 and other violent gangs into the country and how they are terrorizing Long Island residents (which the second part of that is partially true). They play videos over and over of mobs of thieves running into high end stores and robbing them in California. They went nuts with the story about the Venezuelan gang that supposedly held up an entire apartment building in Colorado. It doesnt help that crime in NY and Cali has increased. We cant ignore these facts. Although Im not sure why. My mom went to NY last weekend and said all the stores had every single item locked behind glass. As far as socialism, Cubans dont like that Obama worked with Cubas government and got rid of the wet foot dry foot law, and opened up tourism to Cuba. The moment Obama repealed wet foot-dry foot, we lost the Cuban vote forever. And anything to them that even reminds them of socialism, they are phobic to. Trump shut down tourism to Cuba during his reign to show them that he wont work with their government and Cubans ate it up. They hate when the US shows any willingness to work with Cubas regime.Ironic being that Trump is Russias puppet and Russia and Cuba are communist bffs.Venezuelas trauma is even more recent as they were a rich and prosperous democratic country not that long ago until socialism took over. Any whispers of socialism will make them run. All Trump and his people have to do is say the dems have a socialist agenda, and talk about us raising taxes and what not to convince them. Which theyve been saying since 2016.So what I am saying is that democrats need to start listening to what the other side wants judgements aside. If we dont we will alienate the MAGA cult further.","title":"Democrats Will Win Again Once Trump's Economy Tanks"},{"text":"I definitely agree with you on most of that.

So anyway, there's the mid-terms, which are must win, and must dominate. If that doesn't happen, it's likely we're in for another 8 years of MAGA control. The Dems will be screwed. It's time to really distance the party from the far left. The public doesn't like it, they showed up strong to oppose it, and it's just not part of a winning formula. They aren't worth the small number of votes that appeasing them adds when you consider the number of votes it costs the party with independents and alienated Rs seeking a temporary home. The far left voters are fickle, and when they don't get their way, many flee to vote for the fringe third parties out of spite, but only after already causing reputational damage to the mainstream party.

And they don't care that Biden is still president for another 2 months and can work with Dems currently in Congress to for example give Ukraine all of our weapons right now if they felt like it. But Biden and the Democrats won't do that for some reason.These same people who believe these things aren't asking me anything about politics, and are in fact going quiet during political conversations around me, then as I move away they start up again about what poor victims they are that their wonderful policies have been rejected by the people, who are too stupid to know what's good for themselves and keep voting the wrong way.The Democrats are already in \\"crybaby victim\\" mode and show absolutely no signs of self-reflection of what they did wrong to lose so epically this election. They just think of themselves as victims right now and are still insisting their way of doing things is the best in the history of all mankind, and the rest of us are just too stupid to be able to acknowledge their wonderfulness.edit: and I should add that as soon as it was apparent that the Dems were losing 2 days ago, the PR people were aggressively pushing their messages out, making sure to fill up people's minds with controlled thoughts rather than going into some kind of respectful self-reflection about what they did wrong. The PR blitz has been constant the past 48 hours making sure to control people's thoughts on this. This is a key part of the establishment's infrastructure for keeping the situation under control.

A lot of people don't even realize that they do it.

Democrats accurately point out objectively terrible things that Republicans have done, and they need to get off their high horses and stop looking down on other people.It's not a fair double standard. It's actually completely ridiculous. But, it's baked into our electorate and the public consciousness to the extent that even left leaning people fall into it.

So, we have to coddle the \\"working class\\" so they don't feel abandoned (*emotionally*, actually having pro-worker policies that will help them isn't enough, you see).

The state has the largest national guard and can deny access to federal authorities, just as red states have done to Biden. Finally, Newsom could refuse to allow the government to collect taxes from California, effectively starving the Trump administration from using 1/12th of its resources. Potentially far more given tariffs are expected to replace income taxes.","title":"Joe Biden preparing for possible migrant surge ahead of Trump presidency"},{"text":"I hate this.?

Yes, there are policies of his that I hope fail, but that doesn't mean I have to hope he fails....not sure I am being clear on what I mean but I hope so.","title":"I give Biden some credit"},{"text":"Republicans dont have a super majority in the Senate, so they cannot just pass any legislation they want.

And that folks might take to the streets. But the GOP also knows that Trump will severely punish protesters, so most people won't bother. They'll stay quiet and compliant, which gives the GOP even more confidence to push the rules further in their favor.","title":"Who can Dems run in 2028 that will appeal to voters the way Bernie did?"},{"text":"Also every state did that and MI actually shifted less right than most states.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 7, 2024"},{"text":"Coulda fooled me. lol","title":"The US election, while shocking, was not a repudiation of democracy"},{"text":"I heard 52% of women voters chose Trump.

For one, if were talking about my intuitions personally, I obviously find intuitive that there are quantities of items in the world. But I dont find it intuitive that I have a reason independent of my attitudes to do certain things or abstain from certain things. I understand that there are other people who do, and theyre rational in holding that belief, but if other people hold that belief, Im not rational in holding it.

Do I have that right? If not, please correct me.To return to which view is simpler, I think even though you arent necessarily describing some platonistic view of morality, its still more complex than the evolution argument. We both include evolution in our explanations for our intuitions, but I think your view takes it one step further because whats morally good seems to guide our evolutionary development. What Im saying is that evolution is the one of the only things we need to explain our intuitions(plus maybe culture and social customs). And I think your view is more complex for another reason.

Started in 2016, as Im sure a lot of people did. I asked her about her opinion on the psychology of each political side and she stated that democrats in this country and liberals elsewhere are highly neurotic folks. We spiral on our mistakes and are probably perfectionists in other aspects of life, to an extent. Not all of us but I suspect a large portion identify this way. The current GOP experience a collective Dunning Kruger effect and overestimate their limited abilities. Imagining myself as such a person gives me anxiety honestly lol. I think it would be really hard to change what makes us liberal, the fact that we want to be deliberate and present the best ideas that help every hard working American is like really ingrained in our belief system. The GOP just has one thing tax cuts for the rich and everything else is their way of dividing the 99%. They dont care about the working person so they do not need to aim for perfection because their position is relatively simple. Id love to understand if others see it that way, but is this part of the issue with our side?? I feel like its inherent in our value system that we behave this way. Another interesting note: I asked my therapist early on about her politics because I felt scared to see a person who wouldnt understand my anxiety about being a woman of color, first gen American, LGBTQ, etc. she said that in her field, she hasnt yet seen a MAGA type therapist, EVER in 30 years of practice.

I feel like NY is somehow worse. I will say this. Democrats tend to listen to their constituents. If their constituents demand change. CA Democrats have in many areas at least become more open to building more housing, changing things to make that more possible etc. It's just that their constituents up until recently demanded a lot of these unhelpful things. You want to end mass incarceration then you have to stop putting people in jail for minor crimes. The end result is that people are exposed to more lawlessness and disorder. People hate that. In CA weirdly I don't even see issues with \\"migrants\\" it doesn't seem to be a factor in homelessness at all. Instead what I see as a problem is the fact that there are lots of unsheltered drug addicted and mentally ill homeless people that litter and do petty crimes. They refuse to go to shelters even if the shelters exist. The police have to go through all this rigamarole to break up encampments. Cities don't want to make \\"no barrier\\" shelters or put people in prison, so they just end up on the streets doing a bunch of disruptive things. It's not an issue in a lot of red states because there is no housing shortage and they just arrest people who are doing drugs. So it's good that a lot of blue states have lower incarceration rates, but there is a cost to that as well. CA just voted to be more harsh on petty thefts and fentanyl use. Basically there was a wave of kind of leftist DAs and city governments since 2016 and they failed very badly at actually governing. State governments are a little better but also wanted to pursue a lot of these progressive aims and didn't think about the negative consequences. Particularly NJ and NY seem to have gotten the worst of this but it's here in CA too. In SF there has been a notable shift to the right after briefly being having a very left wing government. Other large CA cities as well. This is possible with Democrats, it's a big tent you can elect kind of extreme Democrats or very pragmatic ones. It seems like there is less variation on the right. It seems like this would be a good time for more of the pragmatic moderate Democrats to emerge. Also it should be noted that back in the 80s and most of the 90s a lot of cities were in decline. Large cities made a huge comeback after the recession. \\"Superstar Cities\\" during this time they were all run by Democrats. Their one big issue and failure was a lack of building new housing. Other than that it was Democrats that controlled cities while they saw crime decreases, economic growth and all these positive elements.

Kimmel did a random segment in LA, (and yes they stage/filter people and it's hardly a scientific survey) but it was asking live on November 6th if they planned to vote **on November 6th**.They all responded yes, who they were going to watch the results with, etc. There's millions of Americans who haven't voted and are completely apolitical/ignorant to politics entirely.Kamala got **15m less** votes than Biden in 2020 and Trump got about **2 million** less than 2020. Yes he increased margins among certain demos, but far less people came out to vote for the Democrat candidate.However to your point, even those who do vote, I'd venture to say 40% of MAGA literally have no idea what is going on, or vote on \\"feels\\" not facts. There are countless interviews of MAGA voters who say they are voting for Trump because *they're afraid the stock market will crash* despite it being record breaking under Biden, or complaining about gas, which again is back to basically pre-pandemic levels. Or simply complaining about things the government has absolutely zero control over like groceries etc.Yes there's a lot of Americans who want to see mass deportations and even cheer on a dictatorship, but I don't think that's the *majority*, I think it's just plain and simple incredibly stupid and uninformed voters.Also this stuff is cyclical. People vote with their wallets and despite inflation being lower than any Western economy, unemployment being incredibly low, GDP and virtually any measurable metric being quite good, for the average American who's struggling, they **always** punish those in power.It's why every 8 years we go through this stupid ass doom cycle of Republicans inheriting a recovering/good economy, do their best to destroy it and then Democrats clean it up. Every. Single. Time.Trump inherited a very strong economy (and for some reason voters just ignore the millions dead and record high unemployment, etc) and answer \\"yeah it was better 4 years ago,\\" not realizing it was **Obama's economy**. Not accepting gas was so cheap because of lockdowns and millions dying.I'm cynical but I hope Trump does exactly what he promises; kills social security and suddenly those who voted for him that rely on it are struggling to live, deports millions of *legal* immigrants, kills healthcare and as crass as it is, any female MAGA voter that needs an abortion to save their life/child is unable to.

If yes, then you place the collective above the individual, which I believe has some devastating flaws. Theres no such thing as whats best for society unless youre comfortable with violating large segments of society, which inherently makes it impossible. People can only know whats best for themselves; therefore the optimal scenario is to allow for voluntary interactions and transactions between individuals as much as possible. Governments role in this should be to prevent force, threats of force, and fraud between individuals. When you accept the use of preemptive force as an acceptable form of governance, you are opening the door for individual rights to be sacrificed for the collective.

The defense insisted they understood it to entail a broad grant of immunity for any prosecution involving his business affairs from 2016 to 2019. Prosecutors said, no, they didnt mean it that way. So Judge Noreika blocked the deal and told the two sides to work it out. reading the Plea Deal, the state said hunter would not be prosecuted for any crimes detailed in attachment A, which is detailed as follows Agreement Not to Prosecute 16.

You cant force a candidate without a primary because you feel like lying about Biden being healthy. Your campaign cant be Im not him during a time when the median voter can barely afford prices in grocery stores because of the supply chain issues during Covid. You need to wake up and the give the people what they want rather than complaign and call trump dumb. The people voted republican because dems didnt talk about high prices and they also let 100000x immigrants come in the country recklessly so they could try to skew the vote. Dems need to wake up and stop putting trump on a pedestal and just treat him like you would treat Romney. With respect and taking debates seriously. Kamala fell right into the trap Hilary did. She didnt take him seriously, her interviews were dogshit (same one liner over and over is frustrating the American people because its political BS - she was not ready. And she said she wouldnt change anything Biden did.

They should have a program and stick by it and if voters like what they propose they vote for them and if enough voters vote for them, they win. Obviously it's an ideal and it happens nowhere exactly like that but it really seems worse in the US where there is only two parties so they really seems to fight so much each other instead of trying to build a program that appeal to people.","title":"Sanders Slams 'Big Money Interests' and Consultants That Control Democratic Party After Loss to Trump | \\"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\\" said the Vermont Independent. \\"And they're right.\\""},{"text":"INTERESTING theory!

This is from the information I manually recorded from [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/president-results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/president-results) , so there could be some errors in my efforts. If 100% were tallied, it would come out to about 156 million votes.   That 7% is approximately 14,343,432.It is safe to assume that not all of those would have been Democrats, but some could be those who voted in 2020.  We already know there are many people who vote for Biden previously, but voted for Trump this time around. There are a lot of states that have declared the winner far before 90% of their votes, for example, Washington State showed 71% complete, leave around 1,110,000+ ballots not yet counted for one reason or another.   I don't know if those % are based off ballots that have been received but require manual verification, or if its based upon registered voters in each district. With that said,  if you were to take all of those votes,  and make them for Harris,  because a large portion of them are going to states that have are largely red or blue,  there would only be 28 more points in Harris favor.  On the other hand if all of those votes were to go to Trump, it could over turn more blue states red.  A good example would be California, which was listed at 60% reporting.  That's nearly 6.6 mil votes, which could change trump from going from 4 mil to 10.6 mil vs Harris going from 5.7 to 12.4 if it was all in her favor.  Most states at this point are tallying for other positions, and for historical records because swapping 28 points to Harris from 28 to Trump would not change the election.","title":"Where did the missing 15 million Democrats go?"},{"text":"Depends on the content of the agenda of course, but Im immediately skeptical because white men are better off than anyone else at the same income level here.

That aspect of things worked out for him then and it did not end up costing the consumer. Whether or not he can do it again remains to be seen. Youre taking a campaign/media interpretation of what he said as gospel. What he wants to do and has always said he wants to do, and has done in the past is threaten tariffs on companies who keep jobs out of the country or want to move jobs out of the country along with threatening tariffs on countries who implement disproportionate taxes and tariffs on us. The only real tariffs he actually put in place were on China and the Biden administration has kept them in place because they ended up being beneficial. All of those economic predictions before the election were based upon the assumption he actually enforces the tariffs rather than using them as a threat to get what he wants. His main source of economic growth and how he plans to pay for things will be through massive energy production via oil and natural gas. He will withdraw from the Paris climate accord again and allow the refineries and oil producers to go at 100% production and expand (they have been capped since Biden took office per the Paris Climate Agreement) this will give us an over-abundance of oil and gas, it will most definitely bring down prices across the board as energy costs have been passed down on the consumer. Transportation, production, storage, refrigeration, power, heating etc. gas prices will plummet.His idea is to be able to sell our excess oil and gas to other countries (particularly in Europe) in order to pay down the debt and for whatever crazy shit he plans on doing. One of his biggest gripes last time was that Europe chose to purchase oil and gas from Russia instead of the U.S. (Which they are still doing while at the same time sending aid to Ukraine to fight Russia) and he believes getting Europe off of Russian oil and gas will help keep Putin in check economically. All this will of course be at the cost of climate change, the environment, and the loss of federally protected lands. Again, Im not a supporter of this idea nor do I think it will work long-term but Im just explaining the actual truth of the situation. It will probably work in the short term, but the long term consequences may not be very good. Especially now that he has Musk pushing even more energy production than he did last time.","title":"Two Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"Brilliant lol!!","title":"David Pakman begging his Paid Members to stop Unsubscribing.

Maybe if she had run in the primaries and been campaigning for longer, it would have made a difference, I don't know, but being railroaded into voting for her, I think, is one reason 5 million dems didn't vote, and why even more may have voted 3rd party.  And we should also address the elephant in the room: Harris is a woman.  That may be a reason she didn't sway enough Independents and undecided voters to win.

Because I think this is a helpful model for understanding people's behavior.Everyone has a model in their head of how the world works (our expectations). We use that model to know how to navigate the world. It's what helps us plan for the future. When something changes out doesn't match our expectations then our model of how the world works is no longer accurate. When our model of reality isn't accurate then our plans for the future are no longer clear. This can be a small inconvenience like some unexpected delay when we are trying to get somewhere on time. But it can also be really significant like a betrayal or death or politics.People tend to be attached to their future plans. When those plans are no longer certain they actually need to go through the grieving process. I didn't know we had to grieve imagined futures until I was in my 30s, that was incredibly eye opening. The grief process has 5 stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The stages aren't necessarily in order or linear and once a stage is complete it doesn't mean it won't come up again. For something small, like someone running late for an appointment, the only part of the stages they might be aware of is annoyance. But in that small example of someone being late you can sometimes see all the stages. Someone is late and you have plans afterwards.  You look at your phone and say to yourself I can make it (denial), after your late appointment you speed to the next appointment (it's a form of bargaining), then get stopped by a train you start swearing at the train (anger), then you get frustrated then sad (depression) that you're going to miss whatever it was and then finally make peace with it (acceptance).Sometimes people get stuck in a certain part of the process. For some people its denial, others anger and still other depression. Usually we get such because sometimes moving through the different phases can be disoriented and require feeling emotions or having realizations about ourselves that we aren't comfortable with.I find that easier to think about when it seems as thiugh someone can't hear me.","title":"cmv: Stupidity is the only valid prejudice."},{"text":"That's incredible.","title":"Republican Dave McCormick flips Pennsylvania Senate seat, sends Democrat Bob Casey packing after three terms"},{"text":"I don't quite understand.

The act of torturing and killing one of your own kind that we are universally hardwired to protect and nurture rings insane alarm bells in most of our pro-social brains.

Of course, ideology and culture can overwrite some of these morals, and distance can make us partake in moral horrors purely by forcing us to be ignorant of the consequences.Maybe we don't need stance-independent moral facts to have something more than just arbitrary preferences.

I never had to deal with a sibling who had learning disabilities.","title":"My Sister is Unhinged"},{"text":"The study is looking at a subset of people who experienced long-term cognitive effects after recovering from COVID.What study are you referring to? The study in the NEJM looked at people that didn't have Covid as well as those that had Covid of varying durations and severities, ranging from asymptomatic to over 12 weeks of symptoms. It was not specifically looking at people who experienced long-term cognitive effects. It then sought to determine *whether or not* any of these people did, in fact, have cogntive effects.In our study cohort, we tracked the prevalence of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing Covid-19, in England from May 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022,12-15 using data from a randomly selected community sample of 3,099,386 adults (18 years of age). A total of 2,494,309 participants (80.5%) consented to be recontacted and to allow data linkage with the National Health Service (NHS). Between August 1 and December 30, 2022, we invited a subsample of 800,000 adults (32.1%) to complete a follow-up survey7 and cognitive assessment (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). This invited subsample comprised participants who reported positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 test or who suspected that they had had Covid-19 and whose symptoms persisted for at least 12 weeks; participants who, as part of the REACT study, either had a positive result on a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 or were unvaccinated and had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on an at-home lateral flow immunoassay device16; and participants who were randomly selected from the remaining REACT study population.In fact:Participants who reported having poor memory or brain fog were slightly more likely than participants without subjective cognitive symptoms to participate across all the study groups, including the noCCovid-19 group (Table S4B).There were only *slightly* more people who had reported cognitive deficits in the study than those who did not report cognitive deficits. So portraying this as \\"looking at a subset of people who experienced long-term cognitive effects after recovering from COVID\\" is not accurate. Looking at community data, the authors of the study said that the cognitive protection that vaccination offered was \\"small\\", not \\"significant\\", as you said. When it comes to vaccination and long Covid, the protection is not as strong as you are making it seem. A [recent review in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6) says:COVID-19 vaccines may partially reduce the risk of long COVID in adults by 15C70% (mean, ~40%)86,87,88,89; they may also partially reduce the risk of long COVID in children90,91.An average 40% reduction in potentially permanent cognitive damage is not particularly substantial. Further, when you say:There will always be vaccinated folks who are still at risk because of their age, immunocompromised status, etc., but **for most folks, the current strains of COVID-19 will cause mild illness at the very most, with a low likelihood of long-term symptoms.**While this is technically true if we lean on \\"most\\", this contrasts what the article you sent says in spirit. The article says:**The prevalence of long COVID is currently** 11 percent among those who are unvaccinated and **5 percent among those who have had two or more doses of the vaccine.**When discussing medication side effects, a common framework adopted by European regulatory agencies is that side effects that affect 10+% of patients are \\"very common\\", side effects that affect 1-10% are \\"common\\", \\"uncommon\\" between 0.1-1%, \\"rare\\" between 0.01-0.1%, and \\"very rare\\" less than 0.01%. This framework lines up with the WHO's definition of rare diseases (less than 0.065%) and the Orphan Drug Act's definition of less than 200,000 Americans (roughly 0.066%). Long Covid is therefore (within this framework) a *common* sequelae of the disease even among vaccinated people. These studies also indicate that recurrent infection *raises* the risk, so it becomes increasingly common the more we are infected. Everyone is free to make their own risk assessment, but it seems you're attempting to portray what is a common sequelae across all age groups and health statuses as uncommon, which is not what the data indicate. Keep in mind as well that many of these studies on long-term sequelae in relation to vaccination are looking at *symptomatic* sequelae, whereas many of the cognitive deficits are completely asymptomatic. The same goes for immune system and cardiac sequelae. The clinical relevance of asymptomatic sequelae is of course debatable, as the study authors themselves admit. But I personally am not willing to accept a 5% risk of long-term cognitive deficits each time I go out, and I suspect that if most people were offered a pill that they needed to take each day that came with the same risk, they would refuse. Most people I know will avoid even medications that are generally considered safe but have risks that are much lower in frequency than LC.","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"This cycle can't go on forever.

That those gains are temporary.

She won't have the same appeal because she'll continue to focus on Liberal culture wars an only mildly on class war. Bernie focused on class which is why he could reach across that seemingly uncrossable rift because that class identity, unites the majority of the country and a large segment of the people whom, at the moment, only Republicans really talk to. She'll automatically have an uphill battle since she's a woman but he bigger issue is that she won't be seen as relatable and working for the average person.

She did start late and it could have been better.  But she honestly would do a good job as president.  Hillary might have too, but she has whatever the opposite of charisma is.  The GOP quickly unified behind the man who sent a mob to storm the capitol.  And a lot of Republicans bailed on this.  Dick Cheney and Bernie Sanders under the same tent was mind blowing.  But I think there is a lesson to be learned in this.  They will not check him in any way.  Democracy did prevail, but I'm really starting to doubt democracy.  Or rather, I'm seeing it as inherently dependent on education and having actual authoritative sources of information.  Everybody thought Trump would be better for the economy because everybody was talking about how everybody thought Trump would be better for the economy.  Nobody analyzed it on any media, except for the wonk blogs and the places where the book readers hang out.  Nobody spelled out, repeatedly, how he coasted on the Obama economy until he tanked it against a pandemic.  They just let the \\"Trump better for economy\\" message get repeated over and over and over.  Everywhere.  They always play defense because of the culture of \\"otherness\\" that insists that all opinions must be heard.  So they're really, *really* bad at simply calling bullshit.  And it was epic, quest to save the grail layers of bullshit.  Eating cats and dogs, poisoning the blood of the nation, bullshit.    But when, \\"is Joe Biden running for president\\" one of the biggest Google search terms on election day, we're all in deep trouble.  I think a hard reality sinking in on me is that there is a population out there just entirely tuned out.  And Trump was on TV, former president, they know him.  Why is the VP running?  They just don't know.  Eventually we're going to have millions of people turning out to vote for the champion against the lizard people.  I don't think Don is going to make four years.  We'll see, but is this dementia patient in a diaper really going to shit himself through the next state of the union address?  Maybe he'll fall down some steps or something.

It's a cult of personality.  DeSantis dearly wanted to enter it's spotlight, but never did.  They're all riding on the charisma of the golden ~~calf~~ leader.

(Note that I don't believe in all of them as the right thing to do.)1. More austerity during the COVID pandemic. It would have hurt a lot of people who were out of jobs but inflation would be a bit lessened during the recovery. Although this is a really hard one, there was no easy way out of the economic aftermath of COVID due to lockdowns and supply disruptions. Obviously, Dems were really in a hard place here in regards to inflation and they did a good job overall so I can't be too harsh here. But it really does seem like Americans prefer layoffs to higher grocery prices.\\n2. Crack down hard on immigration. Would be cruel to the vast amounts of asylum seekers in the aftermath of the pandemic, but Americans seem to consistently want it.\\n3. Bully State and local governments about housing. Keep talking about housing supply importance until the whole conversation has shifted. The idea of tax credits for local governments who loosen zoning? Great, just too little too late.\\n4. This is more for local Democrats but they really need to address the petty crime problem in cities. Yes, overall violent crime is subsiding, but San Francisco-esque lenient policies on drugs, public homelessness, and theft are simply not popular.\\n5. Pander to men. Loudly say \\"men's rights matter!\\" and \\"we need to talk about men's issues!\\" If you want to get more substantive (which isn't necessary), can bring up men falling behind in education and how to bring them up. To be fair there was a little of this from Walz with a nice emphasis on boosting trade schools.\\n6. Come up with more catchy slogans! \\"We're not going back!\\" was good but needs to be more of them focused on a specific policy (drill baby, drill). It can be a huge oversimplification, that's fine.\\n7. Repeatedly denounce the most fringe \\"woke\\" stuff. It's not enough to just not associate with these people.   Kamala didn't really engage in that much identity politics this time around. But people in their right-wing misinformation bubbles believe that what any random leftist does represents the Dems, so we need politicians to call those people out. And might even have to throw in some \\"I'm not a fan of DEI\\" or \\"let's keep women's sports to women\\".\\n8. Frame the foreign policy into an \\"America First\\" dynamic. Americans don't care about what's going on the other side of the world. Now, it's very important to not let Ukraine fall to Russia, but they need to frame this issue as 'sticking it to the Russian commies' instead of saving Ukrainian lives. Maybe even lie that Russia is coming to attack the U.S. Now as for Israel, an arms embargo was actually was a highly favorable position in multiple polls. While it might upset some older Republicans, it seems that increasingly even right-wingers don't give a fuck about \\"protecting Israel\\" so it might be time to loosen the cord, while simultaneously boosting enthusiasm among the young leftist base (and winning Michigan).\\n9. Go on all the podcasts and Twitch streams and Youtube videos. Yes that includes Rogan and all the right-wing manosphere podcasts. The idea that you are \\"Platforming\\" these ghouls is misguided-- they are already far too entrenched in society. This is the way we re-capture the younger vote especially among men. Traditional news media doesn't cut it anymore.\\n10. Literally just talk shit about the opponents more. It was working, and then Trump got nearly assassinated and then they backed off. But civility isn't the answer anymore. People like entertainment, and people like leaders who look strong and doesn't take anyone's shit.","title":"Best piece Ive seen on why democrats lost"},{"text":"Trumps ego (which, lets be clear, is the most important thing to him) would never let him step down voluntarily","title":"Biden to push through anti-Trump plans as he vows to make last days in office count"},{"text":"It doesnt matter.

The absolutely ONLY good thing to come out of this nightmare is that NOW people know we weren't *exaggerating, lying, making things up or trying to make ourselves a victim* when we tell them that DUH there are STILL a SHITE TON of racists in this country. Racists, misogynists and homophobes. They do not care if any of us are MORE HURT THAN WE WERE BEFORE ... because we were being abused before tRump and his GD fake golden escalator ... and they VOLUNTARILY voted in a rapist, bigoted, criminally convicted financial and business LOSER rather than allow a SMART ... and the truth is she runs intellectual rings around that moronic plebe ..  hell my grand daughter does and she is developmentally challenged ...  a smart, TRULY CLASSY MIXED RACE BLACK WOMAN ... BLACK ... WOMAN to touch the seat that Barack Obama \\"accidentally\\" (to them it was a mistake!!) sat in! I've seen far too many \\"let it burn\\" from people who could either afford to leave the country or start a business if they lost their jobs. It makes me want to SCREAM. My present employer has racist tendencies and man oh man is he acting weird right now. Not exactly nice, but all the snide little \\"your work sucks\\" little remarks weren't there. No, I'm brilliant. He just has to mess with me. Example, I had to research a project before I completed it but it was still relatively timely. He told me to stop trying to be \\"Rembrandt\\" and work faster. The next day when he opened his email and saw the SCOPE of the work my research had spawned ... he asked me a bit in awe \\"how did you DO this?\\". I was still pissed and snapped \\"because I AM Rembrandt!\\" Nah, he didn't know what to say, but that's the kind of shite we got in the art department. No, it wasn't just me he picked on ... Two black people in the building, both of us women and two other artists... he has no respect for artists either. This shite has been going on forever and most people turned their backs and pretended they didn't see/hear anything ... and then wondered why we would get pissed. Now we're terrified and it wasn't our fault. I looked up the chart of who voted ... black people more than 70 percent voted for Harris. The rest of you got us where we are now. I can't even thank you sarcastically... I'm so pissed. I had to have this talk with my kids AND my grand kids. My mum was raped and so was I and one of my sisters. No not all at once. But go look at the actual rape stats. And don't be even remotely cute if you're poor. I had to quit an amazing job when I was younger because a boss wouldn't keep his hands to himself, yet ... It was somehow my fault? I was naive ... thought my next boss would appreciate the truth. Didn't get that or the next two jobs I applied for until someone told me to take that place off of my resume. I could tell you 62 years worth of stuff like this ... but my life wasn't unique. These are things that many if not most of us have to live and have had to. A few of you ... Like you shoesandhose actually CARE, but for the most part I've found that most white people just wish we'd shut up and go away. HENCE THE VOTES WE JUST SAW. We never wanted special privileges... just for you to leave us the hell alone and let us rise or fall without your boots on our necks ... Literally AND figuratively.

If you just look at the absolute amount, it looks much worse for Biden. I have no idea where you are getting the idea that federal expenditure in levels was much greater under Trump. You may have been misled by NYT, WP, NPR, or any other cheerleader outlets for the left. Just go look at St. Louis Fed's data.And if you look at quarterly federal government expenditure, you can see that the rate of increase since Q1 of 2022 is markedly steeper than the pre-Covid trend. That steeper trend is on Biden and his American Rescue Plan and Inflation \\"Reduction\\" Act.I should have been clearer on the 6% mark. In emergencies, federal deficit as percent of GDP can be much higher than 6%. But the US government has pretty much only crossed the 6% threshold in emergencies. And as we put the emergency behind us, we would normally cut down on the deficit spending. It's been the opposite for Biden since 2022. In short, Biden crossed the 6% threshold when the country was not in an sort of emergency. And it's only gotten worse.I hate to break it to you. But like 95% of economic reporting in any media outlet is just pure spin. And most PhD economists on media are lying to you for political expediency.

Any state that seeks to limit self determination and control to a single ethnic group is invariably going to trounce on the self determination of other ethnic members of the state and be bound to maintain certain demographic control. It was for that reason that Israel pulled out of Gaza, they couldnt maintain demographic control.One does not need to be antisemitic or hypocritical to be against all supporters of ethnocracy.","title":"CMV: People blaming Zionists and Jews for war in Gaza are either hypocrites or antisemites"},{"text":"Thank you, and know you are always welcome here brother.

His rallies were pretty much full.There is no way Biden won naturally.
