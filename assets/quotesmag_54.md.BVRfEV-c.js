What was he offering the American people? Ill waitHarris had an agenda, she had plans for healthcare, to give people money to help purchase a home etc. Stuff that her campaign talked about all the time and the information was easily accessible online. She had no record on inflation and immigration. Shes a Vice President. Vice Presidents historically dont have much influence when it comes to policy decisions. Inflation has been on a consistent downward trend thanks to Bidens economic policies. But none of that mattered I guess because the American electorate is so economically illiterate they dont seem to understand much of anything. Trump is a deranged, dangerous man who had no policies but people still voted for him because the price of eggs was cheaper back in 2019 so I guess that must mean hes better for the economy. Let me repeat this, hes a DANGEROUS, DERANGED man and people still fuckin voted for him. You can try and spin why they voted for him a million different ways but it will never make sense. Hes not a mentally stable person and voting for him again at this point after everything he has done is deeply disturbing. This goes beyond normal politics. As I said in my first comment, this is a problem that goes beyond poor political messaging from the Democrats. It has more to do with the fact that this countrys educational system has been in crisis since the 80s and thats resulted in having an electorate that doesnt know basic facts about how their government works or how the economy functions. Having a dumb, ignorant electorate is not healthy for a democracy. I really dont care if this sounds elitist you and I both know that what Im saying is true. And you what? At this point, I honestly think the best way for Americans to learn about what a catastrophic mistake they made on Tuesday is to have them suffer the worst consequences of a second Trump term. Mass deportations, tariffs that wreck the economy, gutting of SS and Medicare, repealing of the ACA etc.","title":"Democrats finding no shortage of blame to assign for Harris loss"},{"text":"We didn't vote for them.

She voted for Trump this year because she couldnt stomach the fact Kamala was installed as the Democrat candidate without the opportunity to cast a primary vote for somebody other than Biden. I applaud my friends decision and believe she is not alone in having made such a decision. Despite the medias apparent belief, democrats are not a monolith and do not all appreciate being pigeonholed into a specific candidate. I appreciate she was willing to buck her party and vote for somebody she doesnt particularly like because she felt her party took her voice away. I dont think democrats have yet fully realized this election was a referendum on their game playing. The verdict is in and the democrat elite has been rebuked. Doubling down and asserting democracy has been subverted is willful ignorance at this point. This should be a time of reflection for the left, but thats a hard, if not impossible, pill to swallow for people who have made it their lifes work to claim victim. If they continue down this path, it will lead only to obscurity and irrelevance. Should they choose that path, the world will be a better place. The choice is theirs: look inward and see if middle ground can be achieved through democratic processes or double down and continue the toward authoritarian tyranny. The choice is clear to me which is a better path, but only time will tell if they can lift the blinders of hypocrisy and learn to listen instead of pontificate and virtue signal.","title":"Rachel Maddow Insists Trump Voters Have Let Democracy Go"},{"text":"That's exactly what has happened though.

It wouldn't matter if Trump was Terminal with confirmed dementia, they would still vote.Democrats aren't so monolithic or blindly loyaal; nor do they have the propaganda apparatus that Republicans have to distort reality.Harris was unquestionably better than Trump in every way, on every issue, as well as physical fitness, as well as character content.

Its the same way Georgia elected a bunch of hardliners who promised to be tough on immigration - but then to the farmers chagrin, started with paying a law to require every person working in the state to show verifiable proof of citizenship* to get a job, with the intention of driving out illegal workers. But once the law passed the farmers were left with millions of pounds of food rotting in fields and orchards, and they begged the legislature to repeal the law. And youre 100% right about WFH. This is whats really sad. The Infrastructure Act that Biden signed included money for states to pay for local contractors to lay high speed internet to every front door of every house in America, prioritizing veterans, elderly, and disabled people. Virginia, where I live, got 750m to do this and should be finished in 2026, I think. The problem has been smaller towns, theres no incentive for the broadband industry to run the lines from the main pipe to the houses because the cost is like $1m per mile, and small towns its financially unviable for a for profit business to do. Just 19% of Americans live in areas classified as rural. So with the federal money, small businesses should flourish in small towns, and it should be easier for couples and families to relocate for remote work. Sadly, Dems spent more time debating culture war issues than talking about that this program means for the economy. It shouldve been a cornerstone of their achievements. But regardless, I hope to be hearing some great stories of the changes this will make for especially remote health care for elderly and disabled folks as rural healthcare is also in crisis.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Check out the Bridges Podcast (his pod.

This results in more skilled labor jobs in the U.S.  when a company has profits, they must reinvest profits to avoid paying high corporate or capital gains tax. One way is by paying employees, often upper management as you say, some is by paying dividends to investors for stock traded companies, and some is by investing in the companys growth. Growth is the best way to increase upper management salaries and investment returns. Therefore, the majority of profits are used to for growth thus capital improvements thus more high paying jobs for middle class. If however, the growth happens in other countries, profits are used for capital investments in another country which instead creates high paying jobs (relative to the country) outside America.

There will be many bad takes about the election, but ultimately it was the economy, and particularly that people feel worse off.

He might or might not damage it too much, but one thing he certainly won't do is revert people's grocery bills to what they were before. His supporters are in for a shock about that but they'll probably find an excuse. The Democrats' mistake was not replacing Biden earlier and finding a candidate who wasn't connected to him, so they could distance themselves from him, as people (wrongly) blamed him for inflation. It was a bad mistake by Harris not to distance herself as much as she could and say she'd do things differently. Don't talk about the economy or GDP. Talk about prices. Bills. Things that are tangible to people. Although to get credit Harris outperformed most incumbent governments by about 20 points. It just wasn't enough.","title":"Why Did Trump Win?

An executive order is one type of executive action. And yes, any executive orders Biden enacts could be undone by Trump. Unless undoing it would be so unpopular that Trump would refuse to do so... but I doubt there's much that would fall into that camp given Trump's lack of shame.On the other hand, nominating judges is an executive action that can't easily be undone. There are no Supreme Court openings, but there's still plenty of federal judge openings to fill, and he's doing that. Judges can be nominated and confirmed by the president and Senate, but to remove a judge requires impeaching and convicting them - something Trump demonstrated is quite difficult to do even when there is good cause to do so.I don't know the details of which falls under this, but there are other federal positions like this too. The more of those Biden fills now, the harder it will be for Trump to put in his own loyalists later.I suspect there are other actions Biden can take that have staying power, but I'm not sure what those are. That's what OP is hoping to learn, though some people are making some wild claims on what he can do that don't hold up (like packing the court isn't going to happen now, for instance - he'd have had to do that when he had majorities in the House *and* Senate, and didn't have the votes to do it then anyway since if he tried Manchin and Sinema at a mimimum would have refused).","title":"What are some key executive actions Biden should enact to undermine the next administration's plans?"},{"text":"Only in super wonky circles","title":"Obama's delayed Harris endorsement was a \\"silence heard around the world\\": DNC official"},{"text":"Yep.

Democrats do not even know what they are talking about, it is laughable 3) Democrats had no message of unity, no message of what will they do to improve the situation, Ya it is true, Covid screwed things up, and democrats and Trump had the country closed down, I do not blame Biden for this outcome, personaly, but I do blame him for having poor economic policy, and increasing the deficit by reckless spending. But Harris did not give perfect reasons on what she will do to improve the situation for every day Americans, instead in that one interview where she said she would not do anything different that doomed her to loose 4) The condensention, and the idea that democrats know better than the average american does, Having Obama speak to Blacks and tell them to vote for Harris is condenscending, having those cringe worthy commercials of women it is ok to vote Harris just lie to your husband, or hey husband did you do the right thing votting Harris for yoru daughter is cringe worthy 5) Just having Harris as a canidate in itself is disgusting.

Like they were 70% to 80% Democrat during some of his terms. The fact that he could credibly threaten this was a major reason the New Deal wasn't challenged too hard, because they didn't want to see court expansion happen.Edit: What Biden CAN do is nominate as many judges as possible to other federal courts - he is already doing this from what I've read. And he can also ensure as many other positions that can't be fired by the president as possible are filled. I believe he's doing this as well.

I suspect a good majority of them were once illegal immigrants or decedents from illegal immigrants. As a centrist, I do see and empathize with the burden tax payers have to take on for a flood of immigrants. But it is a bit rich to say that they are legal migrants because I know it is very difficult to be a legal migrant in the US (took me 16+ years to become a permanent resident and I have a PhD). For most immigrants, they have to either be illegal first and apply for asylum (sometimes with false pretext); or marry an American (again, lots of fake marriages happening there); or get sponsorship from a family member who is already an American citizen (takes about 3 years). Otherwise, it would normally take 7+ years at least (if you are very lucky, that is) to get a permanent residency status through legal means, which includes studying in college to completion (Elon Musk didnt; thats why his immigration status is dubious and I am sure he broke the law there, but the rich have different rules ); and then work for an employer who would sponsor you a work visas AND eventually a green card (spoiler alert: not too many exists, meaning you need to be either working for an abusive employer or a for a big name tech/a really big corporation with established HR department for immigration).

Their politics are way more \\"drama-driven\\" than our are (if you can believe it). They have heard strong men all their lives. Men are dominant in their culture; women are second-class citizens and sometimes property.Look at the Arab Spring? Remember that? Remember how the Liberal West cheered it on? Remember the month's long drama in the streets?  How did that turn out?  EVERY SINGLE NATION that participated in Arab Spring ended up with a MORE autocratic government than before - and in Syria's case the complete disintegration of that nation by the very autocrat who ruled it (Assad) who remains in power.Latin American and African (and even Southeast Asian cultures like India) immigrants also come from mostly male-driven, paternalistic, authoritarian cultures.I'm not saying that all immigrants from the above regions are captive to authoritarian appeals, but the bulk of them are - including many of the women. A lot has been written about the time bomb waiting for the Dems once Latinos begin to gain some economic hegemony, Latino men are conservative, mostly.So, combine all of the above with AI-driven targeting on social media, where a majority of the above folks (including us, especially GenZ) get their information, and you end up with the result we saw on Tuesday.This race is not about policy - you can't beat well-targeted propaganda and cultural propensities with policy promised; you have to meet them on the same turf.Gaza is now finished, period. Just one day after the election, Netenyahu said that Palestinians were not going to be able to resettle in Gaza. So how did all those protest votes work out.What gets me (an an emotional level, in spite of my comments above) is that most of these immigrants are here because of Democrat Party policy; if it wasn't for the Dems, many of them would be back home suffering. It's maddening to hear that they felt betrayed by Kamala, but based on what I wrote above, understandable.These people are going to learn a horrible lesson under Trump and especially under the pure fascists who advise, write, and make-up Trump's administration.

A college is not the only place you can get an education, in fact you can get an education ALL BY YOURSELF.

It is inaccurate to say because someone didn't go to college past graduation means they are uneducated.And how much longer are you going to follow the \\"tax the rich\\" carrot? It's been there for a while, hasn't it? Ever wonder why it's still there? There isn't a single country on planet Earth that has come up with a progressive tax system that funds every social program wanted by taxing the wealthiest citizens alone. The best any European country has come up with is tax everyone. The top 1% in America pay over 45% of the income tax in America. That's more than the bottom 90% combined. It's a lovely idea, that's why politicians use it to win people over. It's also a pipe dream. Have the rich taxed to the point that it provides enough to fund all the social programs and cut taxes for the bottom earners. It's never happened. Even Biden said \\"Hey reelect me and I'll tax the billionaires.\\" Why isn't he doing it now? Why didn't he do it when he came in office? Obama raised the taxes on the top earners, why do the same issues still exist? Because it's a pipe dream.

First i think ot should be said that the majority of young men, especially, have no issues with gender rights. Could it be that the democratic party doesn't and isn't speaking with them? If you look at the communities the democratic official states it serves (https://democrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/), there is no explicit mention of men or young men... I mean objectively speaking how are young men suposed to recieve that message as anything other then you don't belong with us. If we want to win im 2026 and 2028, we need to understand where the root of the issues lie, why, and how to address them.Im not saying hey let's bring down women either. Women need to be lifted up and celebrated for there victories. But you are fooling yourself if you think that we cant lift up young men as well as women. A few more stats for to think over. women graduate from college at a 2:1 ratio compared men. It should be celebrated that women are achieving such rates, buuuutt the question needs to be ask why is the male number so low?Men are 3x as likely to  kill themselves Men are 5x more likely to be incarceratedThe majority of homelessness are menWatch this video letme know what you think: https://youtu.be/jzLmznS91kM?si=ZTUz5N3At_fBtANxOne last thing I'll leave you with.

But at what risk? Other diets will achieve the same results, without the negative side effects many people get from Carnivore. Studies show whole grains help things such as Candida.  Folate is what is needed to create life, but since most people on a SAD dont consume grains or legumes, people develop a deficiency in folate . Imagine whats going to happen to all these poor children whos mother formed them while on a carnivore diet. Mikhalia found out she was deficient in folate and tried to play it off like whoopsielooks like you need to supplement after all. But the studies all show how detrimental that really is, causing the second generation to have autism, speech delays, gender dysphoria and all kinds of mental health problems due to a lack of folate in the pregnant mother.

Historically the majority of the world lived mostly off grains, tubers, seeds, fruits, some fish and plants from the Brassicaceae or Solanaceae family that we cultivated to add more flavour to our dishes. Who is actually eating 7-8 servings of whole grains grains in the west? Most times they eat grains, theyll eat white rice or flour that has been stripped of the bran and germ-which directly leads to these issues, or avoid grains all together. \\nYoull see other countries like in China, India, Ethiopia that have been collectively thriving on a plant-based diet for thousands of years.

What happened cannot be justified in any way, it should not have happened, and not just because it emboldened his base, but because democracy is done with voice, pen and paper, not with violence.However, in the split second when the bullet was cruising along, the institutional damage + expression of political instability was already done, the only thing that might happened then was, someone might have had a very, very bad day.Well, let's just say, there were other people for whom such a bad day could have happened that I'd have been more sorry about (although given how things panned out, that might well have been the best day of that man's life).After all, life works like this, one day we're here, and the next we might not be. Being in politics shouldn't come with any risk to personal safety and it's of paramount importance that all members of society work towards it not being so. However, when outcomes are in the hands of sheer chance, some paths might appear preferable all things considered, it's not a moral failing to express that in my opinion.","title":"The Economist dropping truth-nukes this weekend"},{"text":"of course they are. woke ideologies are only intended to disrupt and destroy.","title":"Stil small chance for civil war?

The root cause of this concern is the trillions of dollars that major U.S. corporations have spent on?open-market repurchases? aka stock buybacks  since the financial crisis a decade ago. In 2018 alone, with corporate profits bolstered by the?Tax Cuts and Jobs Act?of 2017, companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index did a combined $806 billion in buybacks, about $200 billion more than the previous record set in 2007. The?$370 billion?in repurchases which these companies did in the first half of 2019 is on pace for total annual buybacks that are second only to 2018. **When companies do these buybacks, they deprive themselves of the liquidity that might help them cope when sales and profits decline in an economic downturn.**AndTaking on debt to finance buybacks, however, is bad management, given that no revenue-generating investments are made that can allow the company to pay off the debt. In addition to plant and equipment, a company needs to invest in expanding the knowledge and skills of its employees, and it needs to reward them for their contributions to the companys productivity. These investments in the companys knowledge base fuel innovations in products and processes that enable it to gain and sustain an advantage over other firms in its industry. ... **Stock buybacks made as open-market repurchases make no contribution to the productive capabilities of the firm. Indeed, these distributions to shareholders, which generally come on top of dividends, disrupt the growth dynamic that links the productivity and pay of the labor force.?The results?are increased income inequity, employment instability, and anemic productivity.**","title":"CMV: Were at the end of the long-term debt cycle, and the current market mirrors the lead-up to the 1929 stock market crash"},{"text":"It's going to get really boring listening to the complicit media telling us that there should've been SOMEONE or ANYONE who would keep citizens informed.","title":"The Economist dropping truth-nukes this weekend"},{"text":"Race is done.

Then, Citizens' United all but sealed the fate of losing working class support. I feel that after the Bush Administration, in tandem of focusing on corporate interests, Democratic focus shifted to college education middle class (A class of people with money to spare) over impoverished Midwestern and Southern towns ravaged by deregulated corporate interests that used local labor and left them for dead. The idea that Democrats have cared for the working class is just an idea the party rides off the back of FDR and the new deal. They haven't represented those values in decades.

I agree with you that our financial system is much more stable today than it was in the past. If it wasn't, I think the long-term debt cycle may have ended in 2008. I think it's more stable because of those safe guards, but the safeguards (Fed's Role in Monetary Policy, FDIC Insurance, Risk Mitigation Policies post 2008, etc.) seem to delay the end of the long-term debt cycle rather than prevent it from ending or remove the concept all together. More importantly as a result of technology (algo trading risks, cyber attack risks, etc.), unpegging from Gold , derivative products, increased global finance interconnectivity, and failure's post 2008 to truly tackle shadow bank institutions like hedge funds and private equity firms, we have new risks which dont have safe guards for. I did some digging on your comments on money supply, which on their face DO look extremely high, but after looking at it with inflation adjusted, it seems there is less risk to the amount of dollars out there than I initially thought. I award you 1 * for making the point that the amount of dollars \\"out in the wild\\" isnt extraordinary, regardless of productivity levels. I see your points that back then there were other risk factors such as the state of global economy, the dust bowl, etc. but I think we have our own unique risks that are similar today. We are in cyber wars with our adversaries today, which has already shown economic consequences and these risks are only increasing. Growing tensions between China and the US could lead to semi-conductors shortages which directly and indirectly fuel the economy, costs of climate change, etc.While wages have increased, they havent kept up with the cost of living. I'd argue many demographics are experiencing the inability to by non-essentials, and those who haven't are increasing their reliance on increasing their debt to do so as we are currently at a record high on credit and delinquencies. Purchasing power in the U.S. is much lower than it was beforehttps://citycountyobserver.com/4489272/#:\\\\~:text=While%20wages%20did%20increase%20during,relative%20to%20the%20base%20year.[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/credit-card-debt-and-delinquencies-are-on-the-rise-reports-finds.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/credit-card-debt-and-delinquencies-are-on-the-rise-reports-finds.html)In regards to bonds, I should have been more clear. Im speaking about the premiums, not the yield. WIth interest rates coming down, bond premiums should be going up, but they havent (Yet at least, maybe that will change)My belief is that the market crash will be caused by the end of the long-term debt cycle, and not the other way around. I believe the U.S. is spending more and producing less. Inevitably making our currency less valuable. I think you're right about a lot of what you're saying TODAY, and the delta I awarded is probably the most important paragraph as it related to the reliability of the dollar, so im leaving this post still worried, but less worried in the more immediate term until a catalyst wrecks it's stability and value per dollar (my guess is war).  I still believe the risks are leading us to the end of the debt cycle in the nearish future (next 5 years tops) but you've made me question how fast this would all come to be.","title":"CMV: Were at the end of the long-term debt cycle, and the current market mirrors the lead-up to the 1929 stock market crash"},{"text":"Yeah I think that's possible, if you search with a different phrasing like \\"reason**s** to not **vote for** Kamala Harris\\" you get results as usual.","title":"Try it.

The local families are seeing the towns empty out, and they are seeing no young families move in and have babies. I suspect the immigrants are going to their own churches, where they can have services in their native language, further dividing them from the native born population. I recently drove an hour outside DC, to rural farmland, to pick apples. After, we stopped at a little crossroads, houses from the early 19th century. In the general store they had coffee and Cokes, and hard boiled eggs and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for $1.75, bologna sandwiches for $1.50, and they also had Tamarind soda and popular Latin snacks. Because the farm workers there arent white people in overalls, theyre Latin American migrant workers. 3rd generation farmers living in big clapboard houses with shiny trucks and SUVs in the yard are living side by side with immigrants, and their kids dont want to take over the farms It has to be heartbreaking.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"This is very confusing everyone hates every NYC Mayor, yet they win reelection.

I think it needs to be acknowledged that the sum of the changes mean that we now live in a State-Capitalist economy, rather than a simply capitalist one. That is on the basis that a significant, perhaps the largest source of investment now comes from QE delivered by the Fed to banks, who then loan it out as leverage to invest in the stock market and other assets. Thats the state directly acting as the primary source of investment funds in the country, something that fundamentally changes how the economy works. The mortgage freezes and other direct subsidies seen during the pandemic deepen the state as a manager of the economy, and will be seen again during future economic crises. How I think this makes the new economy different going forward - the state has tied its legitimacy to the economy. As long as the state remains perceived as legitimate and strong, it will be able to act to prop up asset prices, which will remain high in the medium-long term regardless of anything else happening in the economy. If the government is perceived as the opposite, its ability to do these things will dissipate, and the economy and government will come crashing down together, probably in an irretrievable way. The lower and middle classes will bear the costs of maintaining asset prices, and will see their standard of living decline over time. TLDR: asset prices will become more stable in the future, people who arent rich will become poorer, look to problems in the government to signal a change in this situation.","title":"CMV: Were at the end of the long-term debt cycle, and the current market mirrors the lead-up to the 1929 stock market crash"},{"text":"He was incredibly progressive, we were just so out of luck with his age.","title":"30 Things Joe Biden Did as President You Might Have Missed"},{"text":"He already did.

They are really just vehicles for a large number of people to pool their assets and make investments. These companies manage money that other people give them, they don't really own them. And in the case of these companies, the number of people who invest with them is very, very large. Vanguard has over 50 million investors. These are normal people like you and me, and also our retirement funds, pension funds, and similar things. For example, I have a brokerage account at Vanguard. Let's say I buy some of their S&amp;P 500 ETF. This ETF is designed to track the S&amp;P 500 so it owns shares in most of the companies that make up that index - the largest companies in the country. On the books of these companies the stockholder will be listed as Vanguard because Vanguard runs this ETF. But in reality I am the owner of these shares, along with millions of other investors.So when you see that BlackRock, or Vanguard, or State Street, or any other large institution \\"owns\\" tons of shares in some company what you should really understand is that this actually reflects a collective ownership through brokerage and retirement accounts of millions of people.

First, the founding fathers warned us against party loyalty. We shouldn't wear the title of our vote, mostly because the party's of the past don't reflect the party's we see today and likely won't reflect the parties of tomorrow. My views are conservative, and I've voted for democrats in the past and would have voted for RFK this time around but gave my vote to trump when he endorsed him. As far as the sexual accusations against trump. No one has ever made any accusations that were concrete enough for criminal court to even consider. He was found liable in civil court, which doesn't need a unanimous vote from a jury, nor does it require any physical evidence to be presented in the trial. A lot of people like to use this as \\"proof,\\" but the woman in question endorsed trump as president immediately after, which makes people question an already questionable accusation. As for epstein. He bunped shoulders with a lot of wealthy people. He was kicked out of maralago by trump for making advancements towards a guests daughter, and the two never appeared again publicly after that, nor was he invited to any public events held by trump so it's unlikely they had any kind of relationship beyond just knowing each other. I don't say any of this out of an ultimate defense of trump, though. If it's uncovered that he's been up to funny business, he needs to be in the same boat as the rest of them. I don't think it's a coincidence, though, that almost all the accusations against him came after he announced that he was running for president, and all came from liberal states. While I don't think he's the best example of how a man should carry himself ,his behavior isn't repulsive. He acts like most guys do, and he's very open about that and wears it on his sleeve. It would be easier to believe he's a manipulative liar if he wasn't so brutally honest and open about so much stuff. He admitted to taking advantage of tax loopholes and about over evaluating his property when he borrowed on it...He didn't even deny that he said \\"grab her by the p*ssy\\"...he just pointed out that sometimes guys say stupid shit to each other when they're in private, and we do ??","title":"I did vote for trump, but I have questions"},{"text":"Because Bush was part of the political establishment","title":"Why Isnt Bush Hated as Much as Trump?"},{"text":"I've been asking this for the last four years.

I don't think there is a solution other than only nominate white male candidates. How the fuck is that a solution to anything? Harris-Walz was a strong ticket in principle.

There have been threats by many democrats to take down conservative news outlets and media as well. I see it as something similar to that. On the other hand, firing people on the sole notion of ethnicity/race like Hitler is something that is actually fascist, as it is done without rationale on the human character. I do not think Trump will actually pull through with firing any of those journalist. Most of the stuff he says, just like Kamala, is simply to stoke stronger emotions so he gets votes. To me, it is of a wiser option to vote Trump simply because he is the kind of guy that would do anything to ensure that he wins in the public eye. It is this reason that makes him feared among other leaders. It is also why if Putin walks into Kiev, or Hamas into Tel Aviv, that will be a lost to US might and effectively Donald Trump - and he absolutely despises being seen losing so he will do anything to prevent that. It's a shared interest of Trump's ego and US might that I personally think will be more beneficial to the US as compared to Kamala Harris. You might not agree with me here, and that's fine too. I do not think you're evil, we just have different values that we uphold and we can debate those civilly under the first amendment. Politics isn't as simple as black and white, it is in fact incredibly nuanced and complex. People that don't side with you should not be simply labelled as fascist. Such axioms only lead to further unpopularity among the Democratic party, and something has to change if you want to swing Americans back to your side.","title":"The Dems need a course-correction of monumental proportions  and must start validating voters"},{"text":"After you fill out the petition they are asking for a small donation.

And, for some reason, people are more apt to believe that dems with higher education at prestigious universities are seen as elites who look down on you, so I can see them arguing that against him. But agreed, he was my choice over Kamala back in 2020 because he was well spoken and made me more excited as a voter.I dont disagree that its been an issue for decades and we just ran people who happen to overcome their approach-Im 32 so i havent been actively engaged in politics for that long. I got really lucky going through my teens and early 20s under Obama- it wasnt something I had to think about much. Where we went wrong in this past decade Ive been more engaged,is not running Bernie in 2016. Weve been in a social atmosphere that has favored populous movements, and I think a lot of people who were excited about trump had similar sentiments about Bernie (I cant square the circle that is the chasm between their preferred policy and how the same people could possibly favor both, but people dont really pay attention to policy cause they dont understand it) im a more moderate voter, so Bernies policies were never my first choice, but I trust him as a person. Helps that I grew up in vt I guess, but I think their takeaway from that movement was all wrong after he won back in 2016, and that was only furthered when we ran Biden and won purely on reactionary votes after people realized what a trump admin really meant. I guess 4 years is long enough for voters to forget, but I wish dnc would start playing the long game like the rnc has.

If this does break out into a World War III level event then Trump may try to use the fact that its wartime as an excuse to stay in power for a third term, and America turns into a modern day Nazi Germany.\\nObviously both of these cases are very extreme, and itll probably be somewhere in between, but Id bet money on the fact that his second term will be much worse than his first, and he will solidify himself as the single worst American president (twice if you count Trump 45 and Trump 47 separately)","title":"Biden vows to make every day count before leaving White House to Trump"},{"text":"Best answer.

Hill said this factored into Putin's decision to invade Ukraine during the Biden administration.\\n \\n Russian President Vladimir Putin often became frustrated with President Donald Trump over his lack of knowledge on geopolitical issues, Fiona Hill said, adding that this played into Moscow's decision on the timing of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\n \\n One of the reasons Putin invaded Ukraine with President Joe Biden in the White House was that he expected the US to \\"sue for peace\\" and thought it would be better to deal with Biden than trying to negotiate with someone like Trump, whom the Russian leader had \\"to explain everything to all the time,\\" Hill, who served as the top Russia advisor on the National Security Council under Trump, said Tuesday at a Chicago Council on Global Affairs event.\\n \\n \\"He thought that somebody like Biden  who's a transatlanticist, who knows all about NATO, who actually knows where Ukraine is, and actually knows something about the history, and is very steeped in international affairs  would be the right person to engage with,\\" Hill said.\\n \\n \\"You could see that he got frustrated many times with President Trump because he had to keep explaining things, and Putin doesn't like to do that,\\" Hill said, adding: \\"Even though he loves to be able to spin his own version of events, he wants to have predictability in the person that he's engaging with.\\"\\n \\n A number of Trump's former advisors have said the ex-president had a poor grasp of global affairs.

John Kelly also once said Trump \\"doesn't know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,\\" says Hill's new book, \\"There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century,\\" which was published last year.\\n \\n In the book, Hill writes that Trump's meager comprehension of international affairs was a \\"major liability\\" for US national security.\\n \\n \\"Whenever he got to meetings and the conversation started, it seemed like the first time he was hearing things from world leaders,\\" she writes.","title":"Rubio: Democrats lost election because they think Americans are dummies"},{"text":"The trump administration also had the same policy for gender affirming care in federal prisons.

The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'\\nD Isaac Asimov, 1980https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.735633/full  \\nTextual Inference Comprehension in Mild Cognitive Impairment: The Influence of Semantic Processing and Verbal Episodic Memory  \\nThe results confirmed that the failure to understand textual inferences can be present in MCI and showed that different cognitive skills like semantic knowledge and verbal episodic memory are necessary for inference-making.Inferential processing is the ability to build mental representations for the complete comprehension of information that is heard or read, based on the application of personal knowledge added to the explicit information expressed, establishing associations and relations, allowing the comprehension of implicit information (Gutirrez-Calvo, 1999).Verbal and written communication requires different types of inferential reasoning. The continuous realization of inferences is critical to discourse comprehension since not all information is explicitly conveyed, and some degree of predictions and deductions about what the speaker or writer really means is often necessary to maximize communication effectiveness. The comprehension of inferences is based on well-developed semantic integration and verbal memory skills (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983; McNamara et al., 2007).Thus, the ability to understand textual inferences is considered a high-demanding task that recruits multiple cognitive functions and, therefore, could be sensitive to detect cognitive decline in the early stages of MCI.https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp  \\n Four in five U.S. adults (79 percent) have English literacy skills sufficient to complete tasks that require comparing and contrasting information, paraphrasing, or making low-level inferencesliteracy skills at level 2 or above in PIAAC (OECD 2013).  \\n \\n In contrast, one in five U.S. adults (21 percent) has difficulty completing these tasks (figure 1). This translates into 43.0 million U.S. adults who possess low literacy skills: 26.5 million at level 1 and 8.4 million below level 1, while 8.2 million could not participate in PIAACs background survey either because of a language barrier or a cognitive or physical inability to be interviewed. These adults who were unable to participate are categorized as having low English literacy skills, as is done in international reports (OECD 2013), although no direct assessment of their skills is available.\\n \\n Adults classified as below level 1 may be considered functionally illiterate in English: i.e., unable to successfully determine the meaning of sentences, read relatively short texts to locate a single piece of information, or complete simple forms (OECD 2013).\\n \\n What is the make-up of adults with low English literacy skills by nativity status and race/ethnicity?\\n \\n U.S.-born adults make up two-thirds of adults with low levels of English literacy skills in the United States.5   \\n \\n However, the non-U.S. born are over-represented among such low-skilled adults. Non-U.S.-born adults comprise 34 percent of the population with low literacy skills, compared to 15 percent of the total population (figure 2).\\n \\n White and Hispanic adults make up the largest percentage of U.S. adults with low levels of English literacy, 35 percent and 34 percent respectively (figure 3).\\n \\n By race/ethnicity and nativity status, the largest percentage of those with low literacy skills are White U.S.-born adults, who represent one third of such low-skilled population. Hispanic adults born outside the United States make up about a quarter of such low-skilled adults in the United States (figure 3).","title":"Rubio: Democrats lost election because they think Americans are dummies"},{"text":"Got it.

Then saying US companies dont have the resources to move certain imports domestically, so theyd have no choice but to put the price on the consumer. Not very snappy.

The result is a self-fulfilling prophecyOver 20 years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them.So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further. They will choose the smug style.It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for?...Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort their own impotence by shouting, \\"Idiots!\\" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.\\"I do recommend reading through the whole article, or at least what looks like the important bits.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Yes.

Stick with me for a moment, as I think all your propositions are correct, but you're missing one all-important proposition 5--that the voters were in fact conditioned to accept a false image of reality (a \\"hyperreality\\") that led them to vote against their own interests in our actual reality of facts and empirical truths.You're quite right about Proposition 1: Exit polling (and, indeed, pre-election polling) clearly indicated that a vast majority of voters--on both sides, but especially within the Trump camp--were concerned about the economy and immigration, not more esoteric themes like DEI or whether Harris should have won a primary first or whether SCOTUS justices should support abortion, etc. Those topics matter to the \\"very online\\" crowd, but not to the average unthinking/know-nothing voter. That means that propositions 2, 3, and 4 are generally accurate. Obviously if most voters cared mostly about the economy and immigration, and opted for Trump (2), Dems failed to message their proposals (3), build a case for a transactional vote in their favor, or consider ways to build a winning coalition (4).But here's the problem: The voters--the transactional voters who could have served as a Democratic coalition--are dead wrong. One might even call them stupid and idiotic and, at least by proxy, \\"racist and sexist\\" by virtue of supporting one even if the economy is chief on their mind.Why? Because, as a matter of *empirical fact*, Biden's record--which was basically Harris' platform--was better on these two core issues.Fact: The U.S. economy, in its fundamentals, is basically the strongest it's ever been by nearly all key indicators. Unemployment is at historic lows nationwide. Inflation is largely gone, and wasn't even Biden's fault in the first place (the burst of inflation was primarily a function of Trump and covid-era policies). The stock market is at record highs. The average American is better off than ever. And it goes further than that--Trump's proposed economic policies, insofar as they are anything more than \\"the concept of a plan,\\" are manifestly terrible for economic growth and prosperity. Tariffs, mass deportations, more tax cuts for the wealthy, etc., are *bad*, for everyone but especially the middle and working classes.Fact: Trump singlehandedly and cynically torched a bipartisan immigration bill that would have addressed the immigration crisis. Biden would have signed it. The absurdity of this situation didn't receive half the coverage it deserved, and Trump should have been shunted into the political wilderness forever as a result. But he skated away, as he always does. The voters were wrong. They drank all the misinformation kool aid.

Sure, we can agree on the biological difference between trans women and cis women as a matter of chromosomal and physiological fact. But there is a real concern among trans folks like myself (that might otherwise be willing to position trans women in sports as a strategic concession) that it opens the door to legitimizing all kinds of other exclusions. Today, it's sports; tomorrow, its healthcare access or bathrooms. Once you frame trans women as \\"different enough\\" to exclude from sports, you're implicitly framing them as \\"different enough\\" to be excluded from fundamental social spaces.\\nThe point is, if these concessions are being made on the premise of biological essentialism, you're setting a precedent. Its a slippery slope because it essentially equates to saying, Trans women are different in a way that justifies controlled access. And whats next? If they're different enough to warrant the state stepping in to restrict access to sports on the basis of fairness, it's an easy jump to restrict them from public restrooms, healthcare options, or legal rights under the same banner.\\nIt's really similar to the prisoner issue from the campaign - if a trans inmate requires healthcare and prisoners have a right to healthcare, then denying that means it isn't recognized as necessary. Similarly, if you concede that sports participation for trans women is too controversial to support, you're signaling that other rights might also be \\"too controversial\\" to uphold.Standing firm on trans rights isn't about cultural eccentricities or \\"craziness.\\" Its about resisting the erosion of a fundamental principle.That doesn't mean that we can't make any concessions, but we really need to think through the implications of those that we do. I personally see the following as good options at the federal level: * Advocating for no federal involvement in the sports issue, and instead leave it up to states / schools / professional sports organizations to decide on \\n* Restricting access to surgical procedures for trans kids, but leavig access to puberty blockers / HRT up to parents, their children, and their physician.","title":"Dems going after trans people this week should be ashamed of themselves"},{"text":"No but its why I said the perception  they did nothing to combat it.","title":"Ex-Hillary Clinton Adviser: Democrats Must Stand Up to 'Extremes' in Party"},{"text":"Whats there to lie about?

Especially towards their opposition, but even just how they seem to treat their family and the people around them professionally.Trump seems to be a world class asshole who revels in that fact. It's a tiny and meaningless example, but he seemed to always put little antagonistic statements about \\"his haters\\" into official holiday statements.  The guy can't even just wish all Americans a Merry Christmas or whatever without being intentionally divisive.  This kind of attitude and behavior coming from a party that had personally hated on Obama for 8 years previously engenders a similar response back from Democrats towards Trump.Trump also spent years before his first successful political campaign developing a following by continually harassing Obama about his birth certificate on twitter, then launched his 2016 campaign with the infamous \\"rapists and murderers\\" rhetoric.  Contrast Trump against the early perception that Bush was a genuinely nice person who was just a bit of a goofy dumb guy who'd get chuckled at for grammatical mistakes and messing up common sayings (bush-isms). However, people still generally thought Bush was an earnest person who wanted to do good for all Americans, (even his opposition), in a period of time where that still seemed to matter to the electorate. Especially after 9/11 when the country was temporarily united in a determined resolve to kill anyone associated with the attacks and crush anything that got in the way of that. As time went on that attitude generally stuck even as he made mistakes and the political divisions opened back up.  People still generally thought that he cared, but didn't know all of the answers and wasn't great at negotiating the competing forces in the country and within his own party.

Historically, Democratic policies have been better, but the average voter doesn't know that and would struggle to understand it if tol, because it's all about indirect control of the economy (e.g. regulation)*. The Republican message of \\"we'll cut taxes, deregulate industries so they hire more people, and throw out the immigrants taking your jobs\\" is much easier to believe it will make your life easier financially, even if it's not actually a good overall economic approach and doesn't actually improve wages.*I think the biggest misunderstanding is that inflation is not the same as prices, and prices going down (deflation) will basically never happen. So while the Biden administration fixed serious inflation, the less-informed population think \\"food is still at those raised prices, inflation is still a problem\\" TBF, food prices are still very reasonable to be concerned about, but nominal prices going back down was basically never an option without extreme regulation (which both parties but especially Republicans would prevent). What's actually happened is they've gone from rapidly rising to more stable, and (not necessarily for everyone, but overall) pay has been rising faster, so food is *effectively* becoming cheaper again. That's about the best-case realistic scenario under capitalism.

LGBTQ Laws need to be voted to guarantee the protection of all under the law. Grant a basic income to every American a Law, A optional at Least Nationalize Healthcare System that competes with the free market, Provide housing and by the government claiming from banks houses that have remained unoccupied for an absorbant amount of time or build federal housing market that competes with the local markets to drive down costs, no family should be homeless regardless. provide technical or state college within each state free as it is taxpayer paid as is that way we to can meet the world's competitive market and empower the children of tomorrow.The current political climate I would summarize in two words, Popcorn Politics. Actions like this have not been seen since the fierce campaigning since the time the radio was invented. The birth of the internet has created platforms like social media, which allow a greater voice and, narrative for the individual. Like minds attract other like-minded people and tribalism and echo chambers have formed. They want to feel safe and sane in their own principles and ethics. At the end of the day though it emboldens ego and people dont want safe. They dont want the safe choice anymore in the party. Safe is boring. It not an instant or dramatic change for the better its the same old, same old and the majority of the population between x-z live in an instant world. With more instant knowledge, we want more instant action and answers that lead to more questions. They want something deeper, something bolder. If you say an extremist cant win I say you do not know America. Sex, excess, hard music, hard alcohol, and extreme sports sell; why not extreme politics? Rarely is it argued the only way to counter one extreme is with another of equal weight in order to find or create a middle. I say extremes will be the case for the 21st century for politics. Why extremes in the Democratic Party? well, maybe it is to make up for the lack of action on all the social movements of the past 20C60+ years. From the Anti-War movements, civil rights, and womens rights. to recently Occupy Wall St, to Black Lives Matter, Antifa, #Metoo. They are the Disenfranchised screaming about the issues, and what has truly been done? The status quo has not worked those are disenfranchised and forgotten.Lets Have a maybe moment. Maybe it's because two of the longest wars in American history; the Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan were voted by centralists, who forgot the errors of Vietnam or were enticed by the military-industrial complex and forgoed evidence, facts, and diplomacy. Maybe it was the fact that some centralists worked with Segregationists during the 60C70s to find solutions, instead of protesting and standing with people of color. Maybe it was because centralists voted for a bailout for corporations during the recession instead of helping those facing bankruptcy and foreclosure. Maybe its because Democratic Centralists did not do more for abortion rights aka equal body autonomy, settled with a hyde amendment and now there is a 5 to 4 Supreme Court Conservative majority that could overturn. Maybe it was the 90s crime bill that put a generation of non-white people behind bars for petty drug crimes voted by centralist, along with stop and frisk programs enacted by Centrists. Maybe it was the fact that 20 years ago the majority of Centralists were against Equal Marriage or LBGTQ+ rights. Maybe it's the fact that the whole generation is burdened with college debt which costs compared to the cost of what it was 40 yrs ago have increased to almost debt slavery for X-Z Generation. Maybe is hows Rent is out of control, and people want rent control to better regulate the market from scumlords. It could be a few of these things or all these things. The Party right now has, and many times before had full control of all 3 branches of government at various times over the last 50 years. Theres only one reason they never codified Roe. They use abortion rights as a wedge issue to keep people voting for them. Their incompetence is legendary. Either way, the status quo has not worked for those that are disenfranchised and forgotten.Some say its a time of generational change and ideals within both parties; that it is a passing of the torch with the Democratic Party, as bold and equal to its rival. Others say its returns to the roots, to something similar to FDR progressives. If they wish to go 50 years back with overturning Roe v. Wade then let us as a party go back 77 years to the true values of a true progressive and modernize the goals of the party then with a second bill of rights.

He took a healthy economy and did some extremely stupid things with it. Most people didnt know why it seemed good or what was done to put it in the shitter. Explain that like we are 10. They assumed we were smarter about it. People were sold on Harris and Biden were one and the same. Far too many dont know how the govt works. Explain to them like we are 10 what a VPs job is and why most of that shit was not on her. Explain why her plans are different and how it will change things.Addressing her ACTUAL job of the border like we were 10 would have helped. It would have addressed that the failure was not all on her just because she was given a fake title as Border Czar. Then explain why things will be different. I know politicians rarely take accountability but the way it was handled seemed like Yeah it was my job but at the last minute when I did put a plan together Trump had it voted down.

Unions should stand for choice and stand with their sisters. Democracy is a frog in a pot at the moment. Democratic Leadership and Complacency have eroded the Democratic Party, a 50-year-old law will be overturned and women lose the right to their bodies. We should not be looking to them as saviors but as those that failed, we the people determine our rights. For example, Hillary Clinton said that she could compromise on abortion. Obama promised PP he would codify Roe v. Wade but never did despite having a supermajority. Nancy Pelosi said that pro-life Democrats should be welcomed in the Democratic Party. Pelosi is also campaigning for a pro-life candidate. Pelosi led the effort to get rid of abortion access from the Affordable Care Act when pressured to do so by the U.S Conference Of Catholic Bishops. Democrats stalled abortion protection in a committee. Pelosi said that Democrats shouldnt focus on abortion access. Clinton chose a pro-life running mate in 2016. But yes, blame the voters who are sick of the party of the oligarchs. Do I need to go into LBGTQ rights and marriage?? If nothing is done, it's time for new blood and new leadership.This should make some of us feel like the good lord bird John Brown wanting to protect all for all deserve equality. The Slow cooking of this meat that is libertys left hand has been going on for far too long thanks to Democratic Leadership has failure to protect the rights of women by the inaction of making it a law federally and my bet is the slow erosion will follow for LGBTQ rights of equality and treatment under the law Democratic Leadership has been totally disconnected from their base over the past 20 years ranging from Lbgtq Rights they were late to standing behind marriage(not believing in marriage in the early 2000s), Criminal Justice Reform, Healthcare as a human right, Technical or Higher Education as a Human Right, College Debt, Housing is a human right, a living wage equal to ones labor, and dignity for People regardless of idealogy. We all have more in common with each other from their labor, their family, their losses, and success than they do with any career politician or billionaire. They are disconnected from the struggle for the dream. There should be term limits, and age limits for all supreme court justices, house, and senate members. They should all wear body cameras when working and have them tied to the national archive database and released after reviewing to the public through the freedom of information act IF public servants like police officers must wear one, so should politicians and other public officials, for they could do more damage to the collective. Age has restricted understanding of technology just watch a cspan senate hearing. Individuals' data should fall under the 4th amendment and be protected, not sold by companys to be abused by possible foreign powers or political idealogues. The problem with people with power and time is that they can become a dragon. An Idealist who can impose aka tyranny, who can outspend and burn the Family/new/startup aka mom pop industry and buys out or makes laws by lobbying politicians against their competitor all leading monopoly singularity of technocracy of industry. If nothing is done, nothing is gained. Unions will be severely needed in profit over people, automation over worker future and I stand with them the laborer .Should a Person, Business, Religion, or Government own/control Nature? Or do natural resources/cycles/weather belong to everyone equally in an egalitarian manner unowned or owned collectively? why?In a finite resource-based society where weather affects others should those companies/individuals/government that leave impacts on it, should they pay/work off a continuous cost/face punishment for their length/damaging negligence depending on the action? these are the question we should be asking in regard to climate justice.

Wade was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, and for nearly 50 years the Democratic Leadership has failed to codify it into law. The Democratic Leadership has spent a 50-year grace period playing reactionary politics, infighting, complacency, societal disconnects, and right-wing kowtowing.The Dred Scott decision created the mechanism for slave-holding states to effectively create Bounty hunters who went to free states(under the guise of enforcing laws of the slave states that were not recognized by the free states). This, in turn, was one of many reasons that led to the outbreak of civil war. Would overturning of Roe have a similar effect, for similar reasons?Ten Grand if you rat on someone(healthcare worker, driver, etc) in Texas. Right now Louisiana Republicans are creating a law that classifies abortion as a homicide, my question is will they go after all those who previously had an abortion, and Target Healthcare Workers(doctors, nurses, providers, etc) by harassing them for previously performing abortion from and out of state, if it becomes law? Will they go after information and data on individuals? Right now data brokers track abortion visits and are willing to sell that data. If abortion is codified into law as murder, then will a miscarriage be manslaughter, and will they go after them for possible murder, how do you prove your innocence? Where will you raise your daughters, will you allow her to be raised in a state of choice or no choice? Their bodily autonomy/freedom will vary from state to state, what state will you support with your taxes? Women no longer have privacy or equal rights when it comes to their bodies.Consider the Boiling Frog metaphor for a moment. When we apply this metaphor to the current State of America, we can easily designate democracy as the frog, and the Republican Party has had control of the burner for the past 50 years, simmering our freedoms to a boil. The Republican Party has been quietly and consistently playing the long game by plotting and planning the dismantlement of our democracy. The Democratic Party only flinches in this fight after the Republican Party has landed a punch rather than putting up their fists and fighting back with equal passion and perseverance. Democratic Leadership only reacts after an attack on our rights within this democracy, (Gun Violence only after a school shooting), (Abortion only after a state restricts it),(Voting Rights only after 2016),( Criminal Justice Reform only after someone is murdered) (A Living Wage after a housing collapse) (Healthcare as a human right only after destitute or death) (Education after exorbitant inflated costs on the middle class) rather than realizing their ambition towards real progress.","title":"Dems need to be bold and offer solutions to help people!"},{"text":"The pandemic wasnt to punish us.

Your opinion is bullshit. The bad stuff doesnt reach them. Thats not their fault. Our algorithms and echo chambers dont lead to either side having a clear picture of the other. We see the worst of the worst of republicans but theyre seeing none of that, and only the worst things that democrats say and do.Ask yourself- why do so many people, who are otherwise average intelligence, think Kamala Harris is dumb? Shes a lot of things- but dumb is not even in the picture. The problem is, half the country actually believes she is dumb because thats all theyve seen. A few months ago I was 100% certain Trump was a drooling potato with dementia. I listened to 5 minutes of the Theo Von podcast (Bernie was the only other episode of Theo Von Ive ever listened to) with him- its not true at all. Trump is completely coherent, mildly charming, yet incredibly dumb. There are hours of him on Joe Rogan expressing coherent and lucid thoughts.  Very dumb thoughts, and not at all being challenged, but he doesnt have dementia. I hadnt seen that side of him in my bubble. On the flip side a year ago I thought the right wing rumbling on Bidens decline was bullshit because I had seen clips of him seemingly doing well. Its clear we were wrong about that as well. If we can be wrong and misled by the news and communities we use to communicate our opinions- why does it mean the other side, who are also misled, are the worst people on earth? We can only process what we see, and there are parts of America that are clearly seeing two different presentations.I re-read the Mueller report. When it came out I read it with bias and inserted my existing opinions into the report. It is clear to me Mueller did not think Trump was a Russian asset prior to his campaign. There is no logical reason why Mueller would document attempts by Russians to meet with Trump campaign officials if Donald Trump was already a Russian asset. It doesnt make logical sense, but Trump being a Russian asset has been something I believed since the story started getting reported on. Trump accepted the help, but there was no agreement between Trump and Russia that existed before the campaign. If Trump didnt run as a Russian asset, it changes what kind of threat he is. Hes not very bright, hes hateful, I dont think he makes decisions to benefit anyone but himself. There were a lot of failures leading up to Trump being re-elected, but lets not repeat them. Democrats have run bad campaigns and have slept for decades while republicans slowly built an unstoppable propaganda ecosystem. This bubble exists for the left wing, too. If you see THIS bad of an electoral defeat and respond by feeling so self righteous and you dont question if your beliefs are actually real, then I dont know what to tell you. There is something we are missing, and have been missing for a decade.  Calling them bad people and thinking that explains it is giving up.","title":"Why Did Trump Win?

Had Mondale run the same campaign today, it would set records for worst campaign. Why? Because he did tell it like it is: The crowd applauded wildly as the former Vice-President strode onto a stage festooned with festive bunting and balloons. But, when Mondale launched into his stump speech, he told the eager young students that not all of them would go out into the world and succeed. Many of them, he warned, would find that life could be hard, and that they might have setbacks. He predicted that some members of the audience would someday need the help of government services, and that, in the future, many would rely on Social Security. When I looked out across the room, it was as if a field of wildflowers was wilting before my eyes. One could feel the crowds optimism plummet, as soon-to-be college grads pictured themselves as needy old folks waiting for their government checks. Everything Mondale said was true. But it was not what American voters wanted to hear. The second instance was more famous. It was a moment during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention when, to the shock of many, Mondale chose to deliver the bad news that, if elected, he would raise taxes. At the time, Ronald Reagan, who was seeking a second Presidential term, was promising morning again in America, with a series of gauzy television ads featuring white picket fences and golden sunrises. But Mondale refused to peddle the magical thinking of Reaganomicsthe phony claim that slashing taxes would produce an economic boom so great that it would make up for the lost tax revenue. To the contrary, Mondale accurately argued, it was instead producing vast federal deficits, degraded social services, and runaway economic inequality. Rather than endorsing the ostensibly pain-free path of supply-side economics, Mondale declared that something had to be done to reduce the mounting federal deficit. Lets tell the truth. It must be done. It must be done, Mondale declared, during the most important speech of his life. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He wont tell you.

Im not a supporter, but I do actually just watch his rallies and speeches and they can be funny, engaging, charming, and authentic. He isnt just raving or senile or demented. The MSMs coverage of him is often demonstrably wrong about him, and people see it.?They also see that they dont think hes a fascist or a racist or a sexist, because they dont use those words the same way. Those labels seem as silly as seriously calling Kamala a communist. And a lot of people resent the MSM and the mainstream Democratic Party for what they are trying to shove down the publics throats.?For a lot of Americans, there are a lot of accumulated grievances about stuff like that, from covid to immigration, where they are extremely fed up with the democratic partys messaging. I think on immigration and the economy, people are seeing with their own eyes and feeling those issues on Main Street and at the kitchen table, but the democrats dont have a narrative about whats happening that makes sense to anyone. Trumps explanations arent right either, but at least he talks about the problems in a way that feels real. The democrats wont talk about immigration, for example, as if its a giant crisis, even when many people feel that way and dont want to be labeled racists about it.?And by the way, labeling half the country deplorables and trying to scold and lecture and hector your way into office doesnt work. It makes people hate you. The dems have to grapple with that legacy.?The other issue I think youre missing is identity, which also has a number of other descriptors. Lots of voters didnt LIKE Kamala. She didnt make them feel good about anything. She seemed snobby and standoffish and not their gal. Trump on paper is obviously not an everyman, but yet he connects with the American people and does a better job doing it than she did.?The more conventional narrative has to do with a small number of targeted demographics in swing states (black men in Pennsylvania, Arabs in Michigan, etc. ) and there are interesting things to say about those in detail. Theres also the missing ten million Biden voters. Their demographics are also important. But I think there are some higher-level lessons to be learned as well, apart from sifting through the demographics.?I mean, on paper in many ways, Trump is a terrible candidate. But he is also unnaturally effective with the American people. If youre considering whether its the fact that Kamela is a black woman, Trump is an example of how someone who youd think would be unpopular can win by force of personality. Find that equivalent in a black woman and youd have your president.?Kamala was qualified to be president in n the sense?that Id hire her to be CEO of something.

And almost passing a Republican immigration bill. A lot of Latinos are conservative and only sway Dem because of immigration policy. Take that away and you won't get many votes. - they went out of their way to alienate Arab voters with a genocide in Gaza. You can talk all you want about Trump being worse, it was Biden who gave the green light and bypassed Congress to give Israel even more weapons than they would have otherwise received. And then lied about their war crimes like the saying he saw pics of 40 beheaded babies and having to pull that back when it turned out to be made up by the IDF. - they alienate progressives by celebrating the Cheney's meanwhile not giving progressives anything. They did little to fight for a stronger safety net, for universal healthcare, or for an end to dark money in politics. They seem beholden to the corporate bankers and don't serve the people. - they alienate the youth by how they behaved toward the college protesters. They beat those kids, arrested them, called them antisemites even when the protests were led by Jewish students. Or like in the case at UCLA they were called violent because they were violently attacked by pro-genocide counter protestors. - they alienate environmentalists with record oil production. As I see it, the Dems forfeit this election by, not only standing for the status quo, but moving too far right. The Dems say nice things but either don't act or act opposite to their talking points.

First of all, nearly all homeowners *do* overvalue their homes. That's a very big reason they don't sell them. You're talking about *price*, not value.But there are multiple things that would happen. Probably the most important being that many more houses would be built, because the profit incentive to build houses would increase (especially considering that the housing prices aren't going up due to increase of manufacturing costs, but because a cartel has simply decided so.) That's what economics (and Capitalism, specifically) is about. That would increase supply and drive down prices, because it really doesn't matter what people *price* their homes at, they can only sell it for what people are willing to actually pay. Prices go up when demand is greater than supply. Even if everybody who controls the supply gets greedy, it doesn't prevent other actors from stepping in and increasing the supply, fulfilling demand until the profit incentive is reduced (most likely because all the idiots you're talking about realize that they will never sell their house for what they are asking for, so they reduce it to even lower than it was prior to their idiotic idea...because it's worth less now after the increase in supply.)You can extrapolate this to nearly every industry that doesn't have a government supported monopoly.Edit:What would happen?

They've explained to me, they lied about voting for Harris to avoid the lectures they were going to get. \\nThe why, is \\"betrayal\\" - their words.\\nThese are the reasons I was given, though again, I didn't care. 1. Biden said he wouldn't pardon Trump. They took that as of Trump would face actual consequences; then Jan 6th occurred &amp; more charges brought including 34 felonies.\\n1a. Trump's own former cabinet claimed Trump was a National Security Threat. That lands directly upon the White House to deal with, not the voters. 2. Student Debt. Nothing happened. They understood why it didn't, but it doesn't change the fact Biden entered the ring as a punching bag &amp; not a boxer. Dark Brandon is a meme, not an action hero.3. Rent. These people can no longer save any money to buy...\\n3a. House prices out of control. &amp; single family homes aren't being built. Instead multi dwelling buildings asking more than a mortgage would cost. \\n3b. This is destroying the middle class &amp; the American Dream. \\n3c. Forced births enter this above nightmare. Imagine getting raped, being forced to have a kid you will resent your entire life &amp; having three roommates so you aren't homeless. (Yes, I know someone this happened to).4. When Biden won there was excitement he was going to be the next New Deal President.

Whenever they're worried that people are going to the right, it seems like they're determined to show that they're right wing themselves. I canvassed for Sherrod Brown, and when I read through the materials for talking points I could use, it was all about how often he votes with Republicans. It's such a stupid strategy, because if people want a Republican they will vote Republican. All it's going to do is make people feel like it doesn't matter who wins if they're on the left. It also creates this idea in people's head that agreeing with Republicans is the default and desirable stance.What I want to see is Democrats saying 'this is what I stand for, and this is why it's good for you'. Don't focus on 'doing the right thing' issues, because the average American doesn't vote on issues because they'll help those in need or improve the environment. Point out that historically, the economy generally does better under Democrats than Republicans. Explain that more money to welfare recipients usually puts money in everyone's hands, because they usually spend it immediately, which means wherever they spend it gets more income and has to hire more people to service more customers, who then spend more money and it just keeps going in an upward spiral. When rich people get money, while they spend a portion of it and might send a small percentage of it to charity, most of it just stagnates and is essentially removed from the economy. Once people reach a level of wealth where getting more money has no impact on their spending, it is good for the economy to tax them more, because if you just leave them with that money you might as well have lit it on fire because no one will ever spend it.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"I find it very hard to believe that all those first time voters were voting for him.

Oh, and they are perfect examples of Dunning-Kruger.Want to know why the cost of your eggs, milk, and rent is high dummies? Here you go:- In 2017, Trump (not Biden, not Harris) signed an almost $2 trillion tax cut for corporations. That $2 trillion in taxes would have remained in the economy but was erased. It went to share buybacks, dividends, and the ultra-rich. No jobs were created. No wages were increased. No prices were lowered. Just a BIG FAT STEAL of money from the US economy into the wallets of the rich- In 2020, a global pandemic hit. Team Trump sent Americans \\"free money\\" with Trump's name on the fucking checks. It wasn't his money, dummies and there is no such thing as \\"free\\" money. Someone always pays. Well, except Trump. He's a well-known deadbeat.- So, all that newly printed money simply devalued the existing currency. Do you know what \\"devalued\\" means? It means the same $1 can buy a \\"whatsit\\" today can only buy 80 cents worth of \\"whatsit\\" tomorrow. That's also called INFLATION, because the cost of things are (stay with me) \\"...inflated\\" to match what the $1 used to be worth.So, to recap for the paste-eaters: - Trillions of your tax dollars (that should have been circulating in your economy) were given to the rich (not you) and then Trump devalued the money in your own pocket, causing your life to get more expensive.And millions of fucking morons eagerly voted for him to do it again.

They certainly have gotten drastically worse in the last 8 years.Coming from a conservative perspective, I started listening somewhere around 2008. There were legitimately good programs like Car Talk that were exactly what they were - laughing about car problems and possible fixes. The news was already biased though, everything conservative was given a negative slant, everything liberal a positive one. Liberal candidates were protecting freedoms and conservative candidates were supporting business over people.Now every single program repeats every liberal hoax without question or criticality.. At some point around 2020 I wrote a email pointing out several things that had long since been disproven but were presented as non-opinion news and requested that they issue a retraction for their own integrity. I dont think anything they presented about COVID, impeachments, or out of context statements has ever been retracted despite hundreds of demonstrably false statements.I used to listen because I legitimately wanted to understand a wide range of perspectives. Now its just blatant propaganda, hoaxes, and lies presented as news. Its sad that people listen uncritically and consider it some bastion of journalistic ?integrity. Its opinion talk radio and nothing more. All of the non-news shows are so deeply biased that they are offensive to anyone not completely on board with the propaganda - not because they are putting down half the country, but because they are doing it so slopppily and lazily that it looks like middle school bullying rather than good spirited humor.I cant learn anything when all I hear is half truths or complete lies followed by commentary about how stupid I am for not believing or agreeing.

This is basic economics: *Equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity of a good or service that is demanded is equal to the quantity that is supplied.?It's also known as the market-clearing price*3) Ironically, to achieve this kind of market would require government intervention. We see the inverse happen in places like the labor market. 4) Your assessment of how the market would react to such a scenario is implausible.   \\n  \\n\\\\- People would immediately compensate by downsizing, living together with family/roommates, relocating to more affordable areas, etc.   \\n\\\\- Builders would see opportunity and a huge influx of new housing would inundate the market (again, assuming government red tape wouldn't interfere)  \\n\\\\- Homeowners wishing to actually sell their homes would have to lower their prices to do so  \\n\\\\- These same homeowners need to live somewhere, right? What would even be the point of inflating home values if they need to re-purchase to live in another comparable home, unless they're downsizing/relocating to a more affordable area?   \\n\\\\- Banks, appraisers, and realtors would somehow magically have to be in on this bizarre scheme. People's creditworthiness would not magically increase so your \\"they'd have to pay double and bite the bullet!\\" idea couldn't even happen, realistically. They'd qualify for the same amount as they did before and would just end up with a smaller home than what they wanted. So realistically it would just look like a huge curve -- where selling your home becomes increasingly more difficult the more expensive it gets, as the market for people who even qualifies to purchase it becomes smaller and smaller. for example, electric providers who are the only option in an area.?Another irony, as this is an argument against government regulation and in favor of free enterprise. In most jurisdictions, state regulations effectively grant a monopoly to established utility companies, meaning that other businesses cannot legally compete with them within their designated service areas, essentially preventing new entrants into the market. Public utilities are some of the most regulated markets in the country. If they wanted it, they could 3x their prices tomorrow.?Well no, they couldn't.
