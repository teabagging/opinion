And in georgia, a prosecutor dragged his heels.maybe my guess is wrong, but it seems trump's lawyers (those that aren't in jail) just used delay tactics and it worked for him.

These Illuminarchs, according to conspiracy forums, are an elite group of reptilian hybrids tasked with controlling the worlds financial systems through a secret vibration currency linked to human brain waves.Bessent, the theory claims, has been subtly preparing for this role for decades. Tinfoil theorists argue that his rapid rise in the financial world wasnt due to skill or strategy but a highly advanced AI program implanted into his brain by extraterrestrial beings during a business trip to Switzerland in 1996. This implant, allegedly referred to as Project Oracle, allows him to manipulate stock markets and currencies by syncing with HAARP weather satellites, which double as global mood modulators.And it doesnt stop there. The real reason behind Trump offering Bessent the Treasury Secretary role? According to this theory, Bessent is spearheading the development of a global pineal gland suppression network disguised as financial reform. By flooding the economy with low vibrational currency (a blend of digital dollars and nanoparticles), the cabal can prevent humanity from ascending to its 5D awakening. This, in turn, keeps people docile, ensuring perpetual dominance by the elite.Oh, and lets not forget the ultimate smoking gun: Bessents suspiciously symmetrical eyebrows, which conspiracy forums insist are coded signals to his reptilian overlords. The precise angle of his brow allegedly aligns with key ley lines connected to the Pyramids of Giza and the Denver International Airport.To add more fuel to the fire, his supposed connection to Big Kale (yes, the leafy green) raises eyebrows further. Some suggest hes part of a long-term agenda to shift the global diet toward mind-calming foods designed to block psychic abilities, all under the guise of promoting health and wellness. The Treasury? Just the next step in this plan to enslave humanity one kale smoothie at a time.","title":"Donald Trump picks George Soros Puppet for Treasury Secretary"},{"text":"Yet their trump flags and Nazi flags are shoving into our faces!","title":"Interview: Trump Poses More Threats to Rights of LGBT People"},{"text":"Shell actually get paid this timewith your tax dollars.","title":"Pam Bondi is 4th ex-Donald Trump defense lawyer chosen for Justice Department"},{"text":"I honestly believe most people thought everything could continue like it had under Bidens administration but wed have a new president.

Biden spending too much. The green deal unacceptable etc etc. Day after day after day, Donald would say some negative thing about what the Biden admin was doing and it like a bell would ring through America. True or false it didn't matter. He used the news media to constantly feed a negative narrative day after day and after a while America would start saying it as well. If your going to fight you must get in the same fight. People keep saying you don't want to stoop to his level. I'm sorry but that's the new America. You need to start complaining from day one and never stop. Feed the nation what you want them to believe, that's how Donald won. Day after day he fed a false narrative until all of America was saying what he wanted them to say. It was disgusting to watch and no one would listen to me trying to warn everyone. But day after day it went on. Wether it was true or false. Generally it was simply what Donald knew would eventually catch on. You have failed because you just let him continue leading you around by your nose. You failed because you never cou tired or stood up for yourself. And it caught on and this is where America is.

The states in the us are closer to countries in Europe when it comes to population and economic weight. So what works in one state may not work in a state on the other side of the continent.

Scott Bessent wont freak out Wall Street, the industry hes set to oversee.Treasury secretary is a serious job for a serious person who can meet immediate deadlines and pressures weighing on the financial markets from around the globe. In many respects, the Treasury secretary is the quarterback of the economy.A radical selection couldve rattled investors and added risk to Trumps already complex economic agenda.Wall Street was unfazed by the selection. Some applauded it.Scott Bessent has been considered by many observers to be one of the most respected and competent contenders, said Judge Glock, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow. He has maintained his ties to traditional business and financial groups as well as to Trump loyalists.In other words, Trump did not pick the Matt Gaetz or Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., of Wall Street to run Treasury.That doesnt mean that Bessent will push back on Trumps policies, including higher and across-the-board tariffs, large-scale tax cuts or mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. Bessent is a relatively recent MAGA convert who founded hedge fund Key Square and previously worked as chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management. Last week, he wrote an op-ed on Fox News last week in support of Trumps policy.But Glock said Bessent would serve as a steady hand guiding the economy.","title":"Donald Trump picks George Soros Puppet for Treasury Secretary"},{"text":"I've been saying that for years.","title":"Trump team warns Republicans to support Cabinet picks or face primary funded by Musk"},{"text":"I doubt this ...

With that in place already, they could have had her run her as the only sensible choice by reminding people that she was already president and, using the power of the bully pulpit, convince people that they needed to maintain order at any cost because of the absolute crazy right wing threat that Trump posed.In fact, you know that if Biden played the game the way craven, cynical, rapacious Republicans have been playing the game for twenty years (with a tit for tat understanding of how to play hardball politics instead of getting dunked on by a dog all the time), that those right wing idjeets would have been losing their shit and making a tantrum-based scene everywhere, which would have seemed so destabilizing that it could have been the fulcrum of fear Harris needed to wedge those spineless stupid fucks out of their torpor).And then she could have and should have used the powers the supreme court gives presidents to completely fuck the GOP so hard that we would never have had to live through this nightmare. Jailed Gaetz, jailed trump, jailed Roberts, jailed anyone who stood in the way of getting this shit solved. She might have said I don't give a shit about decorum or tradition or any other fucking thing, only justice. I am a prosecutor, I am judge and jury, and these are my executive orders. What's at stake is too valuable to lose. She could have set a time-line at which normalcy would be restored, some definite time when all of the unholy subversive democracy and order-destroying maga maggots and Jan 6 traitors and congressional traitors and russian assets were purged. And tough shit. National Crisis hotline, this is Kams. I gotta go down fighting.Instead, we're going to live through an exceptionally miserable timeline and my fear is that we'll never recover. World war three and a putin ascendancy is the risk, and it's real. The idiocy and craven oligarchic kakistocracy of Project 2025 is the most dangerous but immanent threat we've ever seen as a nation (bar a few other episodes) and there was no other choice but to prevent it with every single tool possible, TWMHOALBTWNHAA (that was my humble opinion, at least before there was no hope at all).Instead, the world will fall to climate change deniers, the most ignorant, the most fearful, the most stupid, the least deserving of leadership, the most craven, the most twisted, the most rapacious, the most idiotic (and the most privileged with the brains to take advantage of all those others). And this time there will be no fighting back because the technocrats have the most powerful mass massacre toys ever known.Now, sadly, there is no stopping it and a christofascist regime will instead do the purging. And they will do it no matter the weak protests anybody raises or the slight inconveniences any sane dem tries to put in their way. Get used to it-- we're fucked. And when putin dies, China rises. (Which, honestly, is better than Putin since the chinese have an actual moral society based on Confucian values though that comes with a side-order of authoritarianism). So that's where we're at, and a random post by me, a cry of despair in the darkness buried in a thread five posts deep on reddit is not going to Occupy Wall Street the world, unfortunately.Too bad some are still so naive that they'll hope for the best until the moment they're put on the trains and put into the camps or forced to live in their hovels and eat ramen and wipe the shit off their asses with tree leaves or their own hand while wishing for better days, with the faint memory of better times somewhere at the bottom of a murky lake of their blood and tears.In the end, all the faces will be served up on plates to the rapacious leopards and there's nothing anyone will be able to do about it. And you will watch your loved ones die, and then you will die with a knot in your gut as well, just like billions of humans before you.Ah, human nature, my old foe. SMH.

The Teamsters president was also pushing for her.Out of all the terrible cabinet picks I think this is actually a pleasant surprise, but of course I am prepared to be spectacularly disappointed.One final thought, it will be interesting to see how she fairs during the confirmation (assuming there will be confirmations).  Will Republicans vote for her because she is Trump's pick or will they vote against her because she isn't sufficiently pro-corporate?Same with Dems, will they automatically vote against her because she is a Trump pick or will they vote for her because she is pro-labor and pro-working class?","title":"Trump picks Oregon Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead Labor Department"},{"text":"Redistrict?

He authored a chapter in Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise. Which outlines proposed FCC policies for a future Donald Trump administration.Carr previously served as the agency's general counsel and as an aide to FCC commissioner Ajit Pai. Carr supports changes to Section 230 and opposes net neutrality protections.Carr publicly accused social media platforms of being biased against the Trump reelection campaign and censoring conservative voices.In 2021, Carr criticized the Biden administration's proposal for $100 billion in new broadband deployment.He's an avid supporter of Elon Musk.When Elon Musk was criticized for denying Ukraine extended Starlink satellite coverage because he believed that Russia would launch an attack against the U.S. in response, Carr came to Musk's defense, claiming that there was an \\"effort to weaponize the government against Musk,\\" and that it was \\"part of a clear and repeating pattern of regulatory harassment that accelerated the moment Elon Musk stood up for free speech.\\"**Tom Homan**Homan is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, and has been named to lead Trump's mass deportation plan.Homan is listed as a contributor who helped write the 922-page Manifesto. He is also a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center.When asked about what his mass deportation plan will look like, he responded, \\"shock and awe\\" with a smile on his face.Homan has promised to execute \\"the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen.\\"He's expressed the need for \\"detention assets\\" from Congress. \\"Congress is going to have to give a massive amount of detention beds,\\" he said.\\"We're going to be out there looking for them [and] when we find them, remove them.\\"Homan has been making a case for himself over the last two years. During public appearances, he often uses aggressive and malicious rhetoric while warning Americans about all the violent criminals, terrorists, drug smugglers, murderers, etc, crossing our borders.Homan called Joe Biden \\"treasonous\\" and warned that \\"something is coming.\\"Homan has also said that child separation \\"needs to be considered.\\"Additionally, Homan has remarked that \\"nearly nine out of ten\\" asylum seekers are \\"committing fraud.\\"Homan has also expressed that he wants to end birthright citizenship and \\"chain migration.\\" Donald Trump's current wife and her family benefited from\\nchain migration.Homan supports \\"worksite operations\\" that prevent undocumented migrants from getting jobs.**John Ratcliffe**Trump is nominating John Ratcliffe for CIA director. Ratcliffe is listed as another contributor to Project 2025.Ratcliffe served as director of National intelligence in the final months of Trump's last administration. Ratcliffe has promoted 2020 election fraud theories.He also faced criticism for declassifying Russian intelligence about Democrats in 2016, even while acknowledging it was unverified.Radcliffe fervently defended Trump during his first impeachment hearings.Trump was impeached for withholding aid to Ukraine In return for political dirt on Joe Biden. That aid included javelin anti-tank missiles that were a front line defense for Ukraine against Russian proxies.\\"This is the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen, Ratcliffe said after the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump.Ratcliffe aggressively condemned Robert Mueller and his report on Russian election interference.Ratcliffe originally withdrew from consideration for the position of DNI in 2019 because there were growing criticisms about his lack of qualifications.He's a rabid \\"China hawk\\" and supports Trump's tariff policies that previously instigated a trade war with China.**Pete Hoekstra**Hoekstra is Trump's choice for ambassador to Canada and is among the list of contributors who helped put together Project 2025.He has been named a visiting distinguished fellow at the The Heritage Foundation, concentrating on education reform.When he was first elected, Hoekstra initially pledged to serve no more than six terms in the House. However, in 2004, he announced he would break that pledge and seek a seventh term.During his tenure, he opposed abortion rights, opposed expanding health care benefits for children, opposed gay adoption rights and gay marriage, and voted against paid parental leave for federal employeesHoekstra has earned an A rating from the NRA politically victory fund.Hoekstra was a proponent of the claim that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and held onto this belief even after no WMDs were found in the wake of the Iraq invasion.Hoekstra was a founding member of the tea party caucus. He has also been notorious for his anti-Muslim comments.**Russ Vought**Vought is major Project 2025 figure who is being considered for director of the Office of Management and Budget.He also spent time working for the lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation.He has spent years organizing a plan to restructure the government in a way that grants Trump unitary executive powers. Mr. Voughts role in Project 2025 was to oversee executive orders and other unilateral actions that Mr. Trump could take during his first six months in office, with the goal of tearing down and rebuilding executive branch institutions in a way that would enhance presidential power.In an interview, Vought laid out his plan for eliminating the independence of several government agencies in order to give the White House direct control over them. What were trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,\\" he said.Vought said that Trump has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle the power of federal agencies and civil servants.\\"We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy and have the president take control of the executive branch.Vought also helped publish a legal framework for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops on domestic soil in order to quell protests.*There are reports that Trump intends to consider several other nominees with ties to Project 2025*Steven Miller is set to play a major role in Trump's new admin, and he was previously listed as a member of the Project 2025 advisory board. I could write an entire separate post about Miller.Gene Hamilton and Reed Rubinstein, two Project 2025 contributors, are also reportedly being considered for top roles in Trump's adminLastly, over 100 former Trump staff have all contributed to the Project 2025 manifesto.What's more, two out of the three top executives on the Project 2025 board formerly worked directly for Trump. It wasn't too long ago that Trump said, I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.\\" Trump tried desperately to distance himself from project 2025 during the election, but now that it's over, Trump is taking off the mask.","title":"Trump picks Project 2025 co-author to lead White Houses budget office"},{"text":"They also supported the war in Kosovo, too.

Genocides also have several levels and means of being performed, several more than just killing people off. Cultural, ideal (think in this killing off religions or lifestyles without killing the people), being two examples.Also, gonna wipe the dust off of the stages of genocide:* **1) Classification** C The differences between people are not respected. Theres a division of us and them which can be carried out using stereotypes, or excluding people who are perceived to be different.\\n* **2) Symbolisation** C This is a visual manifestation of hatred. Jews in Nazi Europe were forced to wear yellow stars to show that they were different.\\n* **3) Discrimination** C The dominant group denies civil rights or even citizenship to identified groups. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, made it illegal for them to do many jobs or to marry German non-Jews.\\n* **4) Dehumanisation** C Those perceived as different are treated with no form of human rights or personal dignity. During the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as cockroaches; the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin.\\n* **5) Organisation** C Genocides are always planned. Regimes of hatred often train those who go on to carry out the destruction of a people.\\n* **6) Polarisation** C Propaganda begins to be spread by hate groups. The Nazis used the newspaper Der Strmer to spread and incite messages of hate about Jewish people.\\n* **7) Preparation** C Perpetrators plan the genocide. They often use euphemisms such as the Nazis phrase The Final Solution to cloak their intentions. They create fear of the victim group, building up armies and weapons.\\n* **8) Persecution** C Victims are identified because of their ethnicity or religion and death lists are drawn up. People are sometimes segregated into ghettos, deported or starved and property is often expropriated. Genocidal massacres begin.\\n* **9)Extermination** C The hate group murders their identified victims in a deliberate and systematic campaign of violence. Millions of lives have been destroyed or changed beyond recognition through genocide.\\n* **10) Denial** C The perpetrators or later generations deny the existence of any crime.Its been happening at different rates in different parts of the country, so some places are way back at the start, while others are approaching Stages 7/8.

So outcomes matter. If we have a system that leads to wildly unequal outcomes, the fact that the system is, on paper, equal is irrelevant. We are not all equal under the law if the law does not apply equally to all. And as long as you can pay for better legal outcomes, the law does not apply equally. I don't want everyone to have bad representation. Everyone should have the level of representation billionaires have. Barring that (as it is likely unrealistic), bringing everyone to the same level of representation would mean the law applies (more) equally to all.TLDR: A system where laws do not apply equally to the rich is illiberal. If you can pay money for better outcomes, then the law ultimately does not apply equally. Therefore that is illiberal.","title":"Trump hush money sentencing delayed indefinitely"},{"text":"I hope this leads to a fractious rebellion within their party.

Mr. Voughts role in Project 2025 was to oversee executive orders and other unilateral actions that Mr. Trump could take during his first six months in office, with the goal of tearing down and rebuilding executive branch institutions in a way that would enhance presidential power.In an interview, Vought laid out his plan for eliminating the independence of several government agencies in order to give the White House direct control over them. What were trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,\\" he said.Vought said that Trump has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle the power of federal agencies and civil servants.\\"We have to solve the woke and the weaponized bureaucracy and have the president take control of the executive branch.Vought also helped publish a legal framework for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops on domestic soil in order to quell protests.**Brendan Carr**Trump named Carr to head the FCC. He authored a chapter in Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise. Which outlines proposed FCC policies for a future Donald Trump administration.Carr previously served as the agency's general counsel and as an aide to FCC commissioner Ajit Pai. Carr supports changes to Section 230 and opposes net neutrality protections.Carr publicly accused social media platforms of being biased against the Trump reelection campaign and censoring conservative voices.In 2021, Carr criticized the Biden administration's proposal for $100 billion in new broadband deployment.He's an avid supporter of Elon Musk.When Elon Musk was criticized for denying Ukraine extended Starlink satellite coverage because he believed that Russia would launch an attack against the U.S. in response, Carr came to Musk's defense, claiming that there was an \\"effort to weaponize the government against Musk,\\" and that it was \\"part of a clear and repeating pattern of regulatory harassment that accelerated the moment Elon Musk stood up for free speech.\\"**Tom Homan**Homan is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, and has been named to lead Trump's mass deportation plan.Homan is listed as a contributor who helped write the 922-page Manifesto. He is also a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center.When asked about what his mass deportation plan will look like, he responded, \\"shock and awe\\" with a smile on his face.Homan has promised to execute \\"the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen.\\"He's expressed the need for \\"detention assets\\" from Congress. \\"Congress is going to have to give a massive amount of detention beds,\\" he said.\\"We're going to be out there looking for them [and] when we find them, remove them.\\"Homan has been making a case for himself over the last two years. During public appearances, he often uses aggressive and malicious rhetoric while warning Americans about all the violent criminals, terrorists, drug smugglers, murderers, etc, crossing our borders.Homan called Joe Biden \\"treasonous\\" and warned that \\"something is coming.\\"Homan has also said that child separation \\"needs to be considered.\\"Additionally, Homan has remarked that \\"nearly nine out of ten\\" asylum seekers are \\"committing fraud.\\"Homan has also expressed that he wants to end birthright citizenship and \\"chain migration.\\" Donald Trump's current wife and her family benefited from\\nchain migration.Homan supports \\"worksite operations\\" that prevent undocumented migrants from getting jobs.**John Ratcliffe**Trump is nominating John Ratcliffe for CIA director. Ratcliffe is listed as another contributor to Project 2025.Ratcliffe served as director of National intelligence in the final months of Trump's last administration. Ratcliffe has promoted 2020 election fraud theories.He also faced criticism for declassifying Russian intelligence about Democrats in 2016, even while acknowledging it was unverified.Radcliffe fervently defended Trump during his first impeachment hearings.Trump was impeached for withholding aid to Ukraine In return for political dirt on Joe Biden. That aid included javelin anti-tank missiles that were a front line defense for Ukraine against Russian proxies.\\"This is the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen, Ratcliffe said after the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump.Ratcliffe aggressively condemned Robert Mueller and his report on Russian election interference.Ratcliffe originally withdrew from consideration for the position of DNI in 2019 because there were growing criticisms about his lack of qualifications.He's a rabid \\"China hawk\\" and supports Trump's tariff policies that previously instigated a trade war with China.**Pete Hoekstra**Hoekstra is Trump's choice for ambassador to Canada and is among the list of contributors who helped put together Project 2025.He has been named a visiting distinguished fellow at the The Heritage Foundation, concentrating on education reform.When he was first elected, Hoekstra initially pledged to serve no more than six terms in the House. However, in 2004, he announced he would break that pledge and seek a seventh term.During his tenure, he opposed abortion rights, opposed expanding health care benefits for children, opposed gay adoption rights and gay marriage, and voted against paid parental leave for federal employeesHoekstra has earned an A rating from the NRA politically victory fund.Hoekstra was a proponent of the claim that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and held onto this belief even after no WMDs were found in the wake of the Iraq invasion.Hoekstra was a founding member of the tea party caucus. He has also been notorious for his anti-Muslim comments.*There are reports that Trump intends to consider several other nominees with ties to Project 2025*Stephen Miller is set to play a major role in Trump's new admin, and he was previously listed as a member of the Project 2025 advisory board. I could write an entire separate post about Miller.Gene Hamilton and Reed Rubinstein, two Project 2025 contributors, are also reportedly being considered for top roles in Trump's adminLastly, over 100 former Trump staff have all contributed to the Project 2025 manifesto.What's more, two out of the three top executives on the Project 2025 board formerly worked directly for Trump. It wasn't too long ago that Trump said, I know nothing about Project 2025.

You work together on problems and issues instead of breaking up because that just brings you closer together.Its sort of an ongoing process since you are always learning more about your partner and you and them are changing all the time.You just have to find the right person that works well with you and you and then make the choice to stay together through the thick and thin and get through anything together is the first step.","title":"What does it feel like to know youre in a relationship with the right person?"},{"text":"In defense of my blue state, we DID get our votes counted pretty quickly.

And if anyone has a loud mouth MAGA Christian they will be spending thanksgiving with - feel free to offer up this edification from a fellow Christian. This is what used to be preached in church on Sunday mornings - just without the political aspects.\\nJesus said in Matthew 22:34-40 that the greatest commandment is to love God and the 2nd is to love your neighbor as yourself.You love yourself by acting in your best interest. By making sure you have a home, and food, and clothes. You take yourself to the doctor and exercise and make sure you have some joy in your life. You love yourself by making sure you are safe, happy, and healthy. Even the gentiles do the same for themselves and their family.If you love God and have accepted Jesus as your savior then you are called to let His light shine through you (Matthew 5:16), to let the world know Him through you. You are to act Christ-like (1 Peter 1:13-16) You are called to go and sin no more, though you will fail bc you are human (Romans 3:23). But you must strive continually. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self control should be the fruit of your spirit (Galatians 5:16-23) otherwise your tree is rotten and you are not in Christ and He is not in you. For a rotten tree can bear no fruit. (Matthew 7:15-20)Everyone around you is your neighbor, both sinner and saint, regardless of race, gender, sexual identity, religion, nationality, economic status So the homeless person on the sidewalk you walk past, the poor woman at the checkout counter with coupons and pennies, the hungry children at your childs lunch table, the immigrant doing the labor to renovate your kitchen, the gay person serving you lunch after sunday church, the trans doctor saving your life in the ER. All of these people are your neighbors, both sinners and saints. (Luke 10:29-37).And you are *commanded* by Christ to love these people as much and more than you love yourself. To act in their best interest more than your own. (Matthew 7:9-12) (Philippians 2:1-5)Enacting policies that will cause poor people more suffering is not loving your poor neighbor. Enacting policies that will ruin the earth, that we have been called to be a good steward of, policies that ensure that the poorest amoung us will suffer more as a result of the changing climate caused by greed, is not loving our neighbor nor is it being a good steward. Supporting policies that allow your neighbors to be terrorized by hateful rhetoric or corrupt police is not loving your neighbor. Enacting and propagating policies that allow businesses to take advantage of your neighbors is not love. Enacting policies that that ensure the programs that care for the elderly, veterans, sick, needy, widows, and orphans have less or no funding is not loving your neighbors. Refusing to love your neighbor bc of their sin is a violation of the commandment. God loves you in spite of your sin. God loves your neighbor in spite of their sin. He yearns to be connected with them and He has put you in the place where you are so you can let His light shine and your neighbor be drawn to Him through you with love (2 Timothy 2:21-26). You cannot judge and condemn people into a relationship with Christ. You cannot hate them into loving Jesus. You cannot despise or ridicule them into living as Christ has called you to live when you accepted Jesus as your savior. The only way a person will be drawn to Christ, to the kingdom, to the Christian faith is with love. Romans 16:17 I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. 18 For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.Matthew 23 &amp; 24 (NIV) is a phenomenal read on the hyprocrites that claim to be righteous. 1 Peter 5:8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.YOU CANNOT support the policies trump plans to put in place knowing they will cause the suffering of your neighbor and claim that you are in Christ and producing the fruit of the spirit. To support and enable suffering is the very opposite of love. You will drive people further from God.","title":"Opinion: If you voted for Trump, how can you claim to care about women?"},{"text":"Probably because they had nothing against him anyways.

What do we have to keep a lid on until the election is over?\\" They discuss a few things including the Trump University fraud case in Florida. Trump says something like, \\"I'll handle that.\\" Then there are the sound of autodial on a Rohm or similar land line phone, and he has his conversation with \\"Pam.\\"After that they start discussing paying off Stormy Daniels. Trump wants to give her a shopping bag full of cash, 10s and 20s. Cohen asks, \\"Do you really have that much?\\" Trump says something like, \\"Oh yeah.\\" Cohen says, \\"That would be a bad idea because if you got caught you would look really guilty,\\" and then goes on to explain how he would set up an LLC just to pay her, and get reimbursed by the Trump Organization for \\"legal expenses.\\" Then Trump approves of the scheme and the amounts to be paid, and says to get the accountant.That is how I remember the tape.

The problem is that we do not live in those times, sweeping the whole country just isnt something that happens anymore. The only era that was similar was the Gilded Age which had similar polarization. The point is, by the standards of 21st century elections, it is as close to a landslide the Republicans have seen. Very few places in the country went leftward, instead California, New York and New Jersey went rightward. Red states went even further rightward. Groups the Democrats have relied on have started to turn away. Groups the Democrats hoped to reach out to rejected them. Pretty much everywhere the Republicans tried to expand their reach they did even if electorally it doesnt affect anything.This is different to 2016 and 2020. In those elections, blue states got bluer, HRC expanded margins in NY and CA even though she lost. She even got closer margins in Texas. These were places that shifted towards the Democrats in 2020 as well. The country looked increasingly polarized. In 2024 the results look like that trend is reversing, places are starting to coalesce around Trump. Republicans winning New Jersey and New York is starting to seem more likely than Democrats winning Florida or Texas.?The point is that Trump completely upended the ball game and made electoral magic.

Vice President?Kamala Harrisand others cast it as a radical plan to overhaul the government. But even before he won, some people close to Trump privately said they expected Project 2025-affiliated people to be hired in a second Trump administration.\\nSome of the proposals outlined in Project 2025 echo policies President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed.?Photo:?Brandon Bell/Associated Press\\nSince his decisive victory, some people close to the transition said they didnt see Project 2025 as a roadblock for people Trump wants to bring into the administration. One Republican advising some people looking to win administration jobs described having an affiliation with Project 2025 as a nonissue.The Democrats spent a lot of money making sure voters understood what Project 2025 was and the voters elected Trump overwhelmingly anyway, said Republican strategist?Alex Conant. I cant imagine what the political liability would be.Trump has picked?Brendan Carr, a career telecommunications lawyer and regulator, to lead the Federal Communications Commission as the agencys next chairman.?Tom Homan, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from 2017 to 2018, will take on the role of border czar. And Trump named?John Ratcliffe, a hawkish former House lawmaker, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.Carr is one of the authors of the Project 2025 policy blueprint, outlining plans to remove regulations conservatives consider overbearing or outdated. Homan joined the Heritage Foundation as a fellow in 2022 and is listed as a contributor to the Project 2025 document. Ratcliffe is also listed as a contributor.\\nBrendan Carr has been nominated to be the next chairman of the FCC.?Photo:?Jonathan Newton/Associated Press\\nVought, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trumps first term, wrote a chapter of the groups policy blueprint.Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said: As President Trump said many times, he had nothing to do with Project 2025.Some of the proposals outlined in Project 2025 echo policies Trump has endorsed, such as eliminating the Education Department and firing federal workers. And as Trump looks to the White House, Republicans close to the transition argued that keeping out everyone associated with the paperwhich was supported by dozens of conservative groups and leaders and was written by many Trump allieswas unrealistic and would deprive the president-elect of loyal appointees and conservative thinkers.?Democrats argued that there could be ramifications for putting some of these people in place, if not for Trump, then for other Republicans. Christina Reynolds, a vice president for communications at Emilys List, noted that Project 2025 did break through with voters.?Donald Trump doesnt have to face voters again, but everyone in his party will, Reynolds said, adding that changes to programs like Medicare would be unpopular with voters. They need to think carefully as they put these people in, as theyre passing budgets.The Project 2025 vision for the next Republican administration started in April 2022. It includes plans for nearly every federal agency, with a governing agenda and a series of 180-day policy plans.\\nRussell Vought was also director of the Office of Management and Budget in the first Trump administration.?Photo:?Stefani Reynolds/Zuma Press\\nPolicy proposals the group has put forward include: ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs; imposing additional restrictions on abortion, including by undoing the Food and Drug Administrations approval of the abortion pill Mifepristone; and putting in place tougher work requirements for food stamps. The groups tough?antiabortion stance?in particular has frustrated the president-elects advisers, who worked during the presidential campaign to prevent Trump from being painted as opposed to the procedure. Trump has said that abortion decisions should be left to the states.?Harris repeatedly emphasized Project 2025 in her campaign stops, arguing that its recommendations, if implemented, would harm the economy and hurt middle-class families.Can you believe they put that thing in writing? They put it in writing. They published it. They bound it and handed it out, Harris said in Atlanta in October.

Try to go outside of your CNN bubble and do a little bit of research on these departments that you find to be so super important, and then get back to me. In the meantime just do some research on all of these departments. \\nHere are a few examples of such grants that the administration has approved since December 2022:$45 million for a diversity and inclusion scholarship in Burma. Not content with pushing the DEI fad in America, the administration is also subsidizing it globally.\\nBurma (also known as Myanmar) has serious problems, including a badly flawed judicial system, rampant corruption, and high poverty due to a lack of property rights and heavy government interference in the economy. A $45 million DEI scholarship will do nothing to address those problems.$3 million for girl-centered climate action in Brazil. Not content with creating a climate corps in America, the administration gave a grant to an organization based in the Netherlands to promote DEI-infused environmental activism in Brazil.\\nAs with Burma, this grant focuses on niche far-left concerns rather than the genuine problems facing South Americas largest country.$125 million to racialize public health. The CDC has faced growing criticism in recent years for its politicized and unconstitutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its promotion of gender ideology, and more.\\nIts $124.9 million grant to the National Network of Public Health Institutes threatens to further damage the already frayed relationship between public health groups and the American people.The groups racial justice competency model is rooted in critical race theory, which claims that any outcome gaps between racial groups must be caused by systemic racism. A fixation on addressing inequities means forcing CRT ideology on the medical system, which is the last thing America needs.$573,000 to anti-Israel group for fighting disinformation. The Biden administration has embraced the Lefts crusade against disinformation, which is often code for censoring contrary opinions.\\nThis approach also applies to foreign policy, as the State Department has provided grants to many organizations working abroad. A problematic example of this is two grants worth over $573,000 to Virginia-based MENAACTION.Key members of the group have parroted disinformation themselves, repeating false claims made about Israels fight against Hamas. So not only are anti-disinformation grants of dubious value to begin with, but these grants seem likely to spread rather than restrain disinformation.$288,563 for diverse bird watcher groups. Proving that nothing is safe from the reach of DEI-mania, the National Science Foundation approved a grant for having ornithological societies (bird aficionados) create affinity groups based on identity characteristics.\\nRather than being based on serious evidence of bigotry or discriminationas though bird watching groups are nests of racistsits instead predicated on some members [lacking] a sense of community or feel[ing] their voices are not being heard.There are dozens if not hundreds departments that are just wasting your tax dollars and providing nothing to you at all, and those will be cut and you will not tell the difference.

Some states have never returned to previous funding levels, because they knew the checks would keep coming from the federal government.

AI Overview:  Many Revolutionary War veterans received little or no pay for their service. The Continental Congress promised soldiers half-pay for life, but the nation was bankrupt after the war. Soldiers who were paid were often given paper money or \\"bills of promise\\" that quickly lost value.\\n--When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783 ... Veterans had received little pay during the war and faced added difficulty collecting payments owed to them from the State or the Congress of the Confederation. Some soldiers began to organize protests against these oppressive economic conditions. In 1780, Daniel Shays resigned from the army unpaid and went home to find himself in court for non-payment of debts. He soon realized that he was not alone in his inability to pay his debts and began organizing for debt relief. I have been greatly abused, have been obliged to do more than my part in the war ... had my cattle sold for less than they were worth ... The great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it, and have no more courts, nor sheriffs, nor collectors nor lawyers ... Protests in rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 ... The insurgents were organized into three major groups and intended to surround and attack the armory simultaneously. Shays had one group east of Springfield near Palmer. Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield. A third force under Eli Parsons was situated to the north at Chicopee. The rebels originally had planned their assault for January 25. At the last moment, Day changed this date and sent a message to Shays indicating that he would not be ready to attack until the 26th. Day's message was intercepted by Shepard's men. As such, the militias of Shays and Parsons approached the armory on the 25th not knowing that they would have no support from the west. Instead, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the heads of Shays's men. He then ordered two cannons to fire grapeshot. Four Shaysites were killed and 20 wounded. etc etc ...","title":"Musk, Ramaswamy Proposal to Slash Spending Could Include VA Medical Services"},{"text":"No, you're annoying.

However, both parties still debate specific policy implementation and budget allocation. The Republican Party has expressed a preference for moving to a public-private partnership to administer many veterans benefits, while (most of) the Democratic Party favors investing in public infrastructure to meet VA mandates.For the quarter ending March 2024, 80.4 percent of veterans expressed trust in the VA, with 91.8 percent specifically trusting VA health services.However, multiple systematic reviews comparing VA and non-VA health care outcomes show that the VHA generally provides equal or better quality care, particularly regarding mortality rates and in safety, equity, and specific surgical and clinical outcomes.A recent audit by the VA Office of Inspector General concurred and highlighted concerns that increased spending on community care could erode the VAs direct care system and limit choice for veterans who prefer VA services. It warned that diverting funds from the VA to private care could reduce the quality of direct VA care.Defeat Project 2025 - [Veterans](https://web.archive.org/web/20240709101712/https://defeatproject2025.org/issues/veterans/)Project 2025 proposes that the VA reduce expenses by cutting benefits while funneling a larger fraction of its current budget into the pockets of private contractors. It proposes a personnel policy of replacing the leadership and decision makers with political appointees, while outsourcing core functions and silencing dissent from existing staff. It mixes policies from the current VA strategic plan with a dangerous vein of reduced benefits, corporate plundering, and politicization. Raw Story - [Project 2025 will rob veterans and active duty troops of billions in benefits](https://www.rawstory.com/project-2025-veterans/)Among other recommendations, the plan proposes eliminating concurrent eligibility for both service-related disability benefits and military retirement benefits, which Tucker says would reduce mandatory outlays by at least $160 billion through 2032, and revising the disability rating awards that determine eligibility for benefits and determine monthly disability compensation to reap significant cost savings.The plan also proposes to end enrollment in VA medical care for veterans in two low-priority groups to save an estimated $69 billion through 2032 and narrow eligibility for veterans disability by excluding disabilities that cannot be related to military service, which would save an estimated $37.6 billion during that same period.Government Executive - [Project 2025: The worst-case scenario for veterans](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/07/project-2025-worst-case-scenario-veterans/397874/)Veterans make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce, with approximately 300,000 veterans currently employed by the federal government.Many of these veterans, including a substantial number who are disabled, find employment in agencies that Project 2025 targets for elimination, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.By suggesting a 50% reduction in federal employees within a year and 75% within four years, Project 2025 is essentially advocating for a skeletal government, unable to perform its fundamental functions.By dismantling key agencies and slashing federal jobs, Project 2025 risks undermining not only government efficiency but also the livelihoods of tens of thousands of veterans. These actions will have far-reaching consequences, weakening the very fabric of our nations administrative capabilities, betraying our veterans, and damaging the economy to prove a twisted point. We must ask ourselves what is more important: the livelihoods of our veterans and the health of our economy, or the whims of the few who want to dismantle the government.","title":"Musk, Ramaswamy Proposal to Slash Spending Could Include VA Medical Services"},{"text":"Being able to hand over my phone with no hesitation for a quick google search or something if she doesnt have hers available, and vice versa.
