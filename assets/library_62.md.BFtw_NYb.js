Bush administration. Then, the president takes the advice or doesnt.If it were a true government agency, however, Musk would run afoul of federal conflict of interest laws unless he divested from his businesses or recused from government matters involving them, Painter said.Trump could grant a rare waiver exempting Musk from those laws, a move that has been politically unpopular in the past, Painter said.Tesla, SpaceX and X didnt immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether Musk would recuse himself.

Meanwhile, California allows mail in ballots to be counted if theyre postmarked on Election Day, and the county needs to wait for the post office to deliver said mail ballot.In fact, in LA County, 3/4 of all votes casted are done by mail. So that means even if 1/10 of all votes were postmarked on Election Day and only arrived a week after, thats a total vote of 300,000 that still hasnt been counted, and 300,000 ballots can make or break a slim lead margin.On top of that, California allows voters to cure their ballot envelope to match the signature they used during their ballot registration (during drivers license registration) and provisional ballots caused on Election Day.California is slow because it wants to be right and make sure everyone gets their voice heard.","title":"??MICHELLE STEEL LIKELY GOES DOWN IN CA-45.

Was and is still.  Since back when they were the head of the USSR.  But so is China, a much, much bigger threat, and pretty much anyone else, be they other countries, corporations, or individuals, who think they have something to gain by dividing the American people.  But an even bigger source of division is the ideological/philosophical divide of the American people, most readily seen in the political realm.  The way I see it, the left is completely opposed to everything about this country.  They hate the founders of the country, the culture they came from, their philosophy, and they way they structured our government.  This is the result of communist subversion, decades of it.  \\"The Long March through the institutions\\" is what leftists call it.  It's what Yuri Bezmenov warned us about.

He livestreams, he podcasts, he trades barbs with political enemies with acidic bluster. But for those who have closely followed his legislative career, the Florida lawmaker represents a sharp break from the corporate-friendly orthodoxy of the modern Republican Party. Indeed, Gaetzs elevation will provide sprawling prosecutorial powers for continuing his push against special interest influence and corporate malfeasance.\\nHis record speaks for itself. From his perch on the House Judiciary Committee, Gaetz has promoted a surprisingly consumer-friendly agenda, routinely breaking with his GOP colleagues on crucial votes. He previously supported legislative measures to break up Silicon Valley monopolies, sharply regulate the online data broker industry, ban noncompete employment contracts, and an end to the practice of forced arbitration, among other corporate accountability votes. He has also taken maverick positions on reducing FBI surveillance powers, cutting certain arms supplies to Saudi Arabia and legalising marijuana....In an era of severe political polarisation, the Florida representative has found opportunities to support actions of the Biden administration. In August, Gaetz wrote a letter to Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai, urging him to adhere fully to the antitrust ruling against the company secured by the current Department of Justice. He has called on Trump to continue a corporate law enforcement pattern started by the Biden administration. I would hope that whoever is the next FTC chair would continue many of the cases that Chair Khan has brought against predatory businesses, Gaetz told the Wall Street Journal.Gaetzs dealings with the populist Left do not end there. Not only did he push for a crackdown on the influence industry in Washington, he teamed up with Leftist firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a demand to end congressional stock trading over concerns that lawmakers have enriched themselves using insider knowledge. AOC is wrong a lot, Gaetz said, explaining the bipartisan push. But shes not corrupt. And I will work with anyone and everyone to ensure that Congress is not so compromised....As the Republican Party becomes more working class, were less captive to the neolibertarian view that everything big business does to people is OK, he once told reporters. That means, he added, the party cant be whores for big business and be the voice of the working class at the same time.","title":"Lee Fang: \\"The Left should welcome Matt Gaetz as attorney general\\""},{"text":"From your link: The last 4 years have been shit economically.

In the case of the DOJ, nominating Matt Gaetz, who has been accused of sex trafficking underage girls, as AG would be the perfect nominee to trigger mass resignations.These mass resignations then get rid of the bulk of the employees who would be viewed as \\"disloyal\\" by Trump and MAGA and open up slots to bring in MAGA cultists to take over the department.

He would have outperformed Kamala with moderates and right-leaning voters.The fake polling was just step 1 in the manufactured leverage to push him out. He said fuck those polls, so the DNC withheld the donor money, Obama got Clooney to pen his letter.These fucking imbeciles replaced the straight white guy who got 81 million votes, who was a lifelong all-American politician with a military family, from Scranton Pennsyvania - And replaced him with the LEAST POPULAR POLITICIAN OF ALL TIME, a California liberal female prosecutor with 70IQ with undiscernible racial identity.Ray Charles could have called that outcome from 100 miles out.\\nThe Mainstream Media and DNC are so out of touch with reality that they don't even consider any of this.Biden might have lost against Trump - but he carries PA and that alone puts his victory chance through the roof.Not even a fake '400 electoral landslide' poll could have justified Kamala over Joe. This is hands down the largest political blunder in American political history. It's so bad not a single political analyst can even yet publicly hint that the truth is they should have stuck with Joe.

We need to have a serious attorney general. And Im looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious. This one was not on my bingo card.A rightwing firebrand, Gaetz was a thorn in the side of his fellow Republican and former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, eventually leading the successful charge to?[oust](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kevin-mccarthy-oust-republican-house-speaker-vote-result-matt-gaetz)?McCarthy from his role.He was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case, though the department ultimately?[declined to bring charges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/15/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-case-closed-without-charges). And was under investigation by the House ethics committee amid allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other alleged ethical breaches.Gaetz has fiercely denied wrongdoing.Amid consternation even within his own party, its unclear if Gaetz can win Senate approval.Republican congressman Max Miller of Ohio told?[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general)?that Gaetz has a better shot at having dinner with Queen Elizabeth II than being confirmed by the Senate.Miller also told?[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-confirmation-doubt-00189382)?that Gaetz is a reckless pick with a zero percent shot.John Bolton, a former national security adviser, said Gaetz must be the worst nomination for a cabinet position in American history.Gaetz is not only totally incompetent for this job, he doesnt have the character. He is a person of moral turpitude, Bolton said in an interview with?[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/matt-gaetz-must-be-the-worst-cabinet-nomination-in-american-history-amb-john-bolton-224379461670).One anonymous House GOP member told?[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general): We wanted him out of the House  this isnt what we were thinking. Another remarked they were stunned and disgusted.Democrats, too, were left astonished by the announcement. Vice-President Kamala Harriss team said in a statement that Trump and Gaetz will weaponize the DoJ to protect themselves and their allies.Congressman Ro Khanna of California argued that voters were not necessarily voting for these cabinet picks when they decided to elect Trump.People voted for Trump to have lower prices and a secure border. I dont think they voted for the appointments that theyre getting, Khanna told?[CBS News](https://x.com/CBSNews/status/1856833480312984003). He is not moving to the center. Hes going to his Maga base, and well see if hes overreaching on the mandate he had from the American people.Kate Maeder, a California-based political strategist, said the announcement should not come as a surprise, but wondered whether Trump trusts Gaetz will make it through the confirmation process. Its not a surprise that Trump is rewarding his political loyalists, Maeder told the Guardian. Its a shock to many that hes considering Matt Gaetz for attorney general. But is this a serious pick? I dont think so.In this political climate, its definitely possible for Matt Gaetz to be confirmed, she said. But I think itll be difficult. Some of the more moderate Republican senators are already on record questioning this choice.","title":"Republicans baffled after Trump picks reckless Gaetz for attorney general"},{"text":"Yeah that is what it is.

However, I understand that the Biden administration did mostly the right things given the situation and the historic crises. There were several times in the past few years when I would see \\"The economy is great!\\" while I'm doing an MS in engineering and struggling to find work that isn't at an Amazon warehouse, and became very very bitter, almost to the point of voting Trump just to \\"burn it down\\". I have very little to no stock market investments and therefore to me it doesn't matter if it's at 30% returns or 1% returns. In the end my reasonable side prevailed, but I can understand why for some people it may not have, and they may have chosen to burn it down.

But it takes significant competence and that's a tough one to learn on the fly. \\"Massive scope: The DOT's responsibilities are incredibly broad and complex. The new Secretary must quickly get up to speed on everything from aviation safety regulations to maritime shipping laws to highway infrastructure funding. It's like drinking from a firehose of information.\\"May be best to use a previous recycled one there possibly, or a Veteran though a new pick gives excitement and fresh perspective \\"the choice between a previous Secretary, a seasoned veteran, or a new pick is a complex one with no easy answer.\\" . A newcomer would face a significant learning curve and might take longer to get up to speed. So RFK not fitting there possibly, not his expertiseFor DOT \\"Top Tier: Supply Chain Masters1. Frederick W. Smith (Founder and Executive Chairman of FedEx): Smith built FedEx into a global logistics giant, pioneering overnight delivery and revolutionizing supply chain management. His understanding of air cargo, ground transportation, and international logistics is unparalleled. He also has experience navigating regulatory hurdles and managing a massive workforce. ?\\n2. Executives from Amazon, UPS, or other major logistics companies: Leaders from these companies have hands-on experience managing complex supply chains, optimizing delivery routes, and utilizing technology to track goods and improve efficiency. They also understand the challenges of last-mile delivery, warehousing, and cross-border trade. ?Second Tier: Strong Transportation Experience with Supply Chain Relevance1. Deborah Hersman (Former Chairman of the NTSB): While her primary expertise is in safety, Hersman has a deep understanding of how different modes of transportation (aviation, rail, etc.) interconnect within the supply chain. Her experience investigating accidents and identifying systemic risks could be valuable in preventing disruptions to the flow of goods.\\n2. Anthony Foxx (Former DOT Secretary): Foxx has a broad understanding of transportation policy and experience managing the DOT during a period of significant growth in e-commerce and global trade. He oversaw initiatives to improve freight movement and infrastructure development, which are crucial for supply chain efficiency. ?Third Tier: Potential with Transferable Skills1. Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla and SpaceX): While not directly involved in traditional supply chains, Musk has demonstrated an ability to innovate and disrupt industries. His focus on technology, automation, and efficiency could be valuable in modernizing transportation infrastructure and optimizing supply chain operations. ?\\n2. Robin Chase (Co-founder of Zipcar): Chase's experience with shared mobility and urban transportation could be relevant to the \\"last mile\\" challenges in supply chains, particularly in densely populated areas. Her focus on sustainability could also be valuable in promoting greener supply chain practices.\\"Sorry if TL;DR, it's a really deep topic, and tough to communicate and discuss on Reddit etc. Every Department is quite important (obviously)","title":"ANOTHER (awesome) announcement from Trump  Tulsi Gabbard has just been named his Director of National Intelligence (DNI). ??

And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\\"*Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\\"Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\\"Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\\"*In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \\"watered down.\\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot them down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.In response to Putin being labeled a \\"killer\\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \\"diplomats.\\"Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goalsthe weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \\"obsolete,\\" and has reportedly, on several.occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely.Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \\"genius,\\" and \\"savvy,\\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \\"delinquent.\\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\\"*Trump is severely ignorant of how NATO works.in 2014, NATO members agreed to move \\"toward\\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024. The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \\"delinquency\\" involved.Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \\"fund\\", but towards their own defense.Trump has called the U.S., *\\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\\"* Still not understanding that the funding benchmark has to do with each individual country's own defense spending. We're not \\"paying for NATO.\\"NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.Trump and Vance campaigned on the idea of caving into Putin's demands. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, la-dee-frickin-da. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war would have never happened. Not only is that an egregiously false and delusional hypothetical, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place.Trump sees his relationship with Putin as mutually beneficial. The reality is, Trump is Putin's favorite useful idiot. Any of Trump's future \\"negotiations\\" with Putin will be so only in name, instead, it will be more accurate to call it capitulation.With this kind of record, there's no telling what Trump will do to empower Putin and his autocratic, warmongering agenda in the future.Putin couldn't be happier that he has a compliant ally back in the White House, which is unnerving for a lot of reasons, but what gets me most of all, is the simple fact that Putin is an enemy to the United States. He's made a career out of demonizing the West and trying to cripple our alliances and geopolitical positions. And Donald Trump is the perfect tool to help him see his goals and ambitions come to fruition.","title":"Russia won the Cold War with Trump: Pro-Russia agenda certain with second term"},{"text":"The issue is as society becomes more technologically advanced the stakes get raised.

Trump being Putins puppet or a Russian asset are pure fantasy from war-mongerers salivating at the money they haul in during times of war which a Trump presidency threatens, media outlets for ratings and clicks, and those peddling their latest books. Donald Trump believes in peace through strength, demonstrated in his last term as you may recall when Russia did not invade Ukraine, when there were no new wars, period.

They really dont. Im not saying that to belittle minorities, LGBTQ+ people, or non-Christians its just thats exactly why Trumps fear mongering worked. I really dont understand why the left is so stubborn about this. The right took complete advantage of this and won votes with a bunch of crooks.I dont know how people can say rhetoric needs to change yet not acknowledge that Americans are not liking the rhetoric they were using. Democrats need to understand who they are trying to court. If you want to take votes away from Republicans then you have to understand who votes for Republicans. And the crazy part is, they do understand because they demonize Republican voters constantly. 2016 and 2024 are almost indistinguishable. Way too confident in the polls. Way too confident in the assumption that Americans are not single-issue voters. Way too hopeful that spite doesnt drive people to vote or not to vote. Way too complacent that the checks and balances are going to save us.People are ignorant. The average person is not a scholar or poet.

The problem isnt American. The problem is that Democrats think the grass is greener across the border/ocean. The problem isnt convincing Americans they actually have good lives. The problem is Democrats thinking Americans will believe Republicans will make their lives worse. The economy is booming. Yet democrats lost the popular vote. That should tell you something about 72+ million voters out there who despite all the dangers of a Trump presidency and Republican control of government, voted red.Stop underestimating the rubber band effect of progress. Reactionary politics thrive on the naivety of intellectuals. Even Americans fighting and dying to free slaves were racist against blacks.

But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.Rick Scott has not expressed a personal motive to resist encroachment of the powers in the Executive branch.

Lawsuits were filed in lock-step after they lost gay marriage as an issue.They tried bathrooms, it didn't work. Then they tried sports.It was brilliant, because it preys on moderates by making liberals look \\"too extreme\\".The logic that is pushed is \\"Men are stronger than women and better in sports - \\"??\\" - THEREFORE, Trans women shouldn't compete against cis women\\"The  is, of course \\"Trans women are really men, sooo\\" - which resonates, even with moderates/center-leaning liberals. \\"Trans women are men but we call them she/her and use their chosen name because it makes their lives easier\\"So to people who's \\"support\\" of trans people is paper-thin, it's easy to say \\"WOKE LIBERALS are RUINING women's sports by letting MEN compete against them!

If a kid was able to access appropriate interventions at puberty, they'd have zero advantages over a cis womanIn fact, trans women generally have LESS testosterone in their system than even cis women do - and T is a notorious performance enhancer. The question shouldn't be \\"do trans women have ANY advantages AT ALL?\\" it should be \\"Do the sum of their advantages and disadvantages put them in the rough bell curve of other categories of women?\\" And the answer most sporting bodies found was YES, after 1-2 years of HRT depending on prior training level and upkeep regimen.But this is all too nuanced, and most people don't think about topics that much. They just think \\"Trans women = men, men = better than women at sports, ergo letting trans women play = unfair\\"Which, it's fucking WILD that policy affecting 1% of the population is SO DAMN IMPORTANT that it be put front and center of the REPUBLICAN'S CAMPAIGN, and somehow Kamala is the one blamed for playing \\"Woke politics\\" too much.It's goddamned fucking ridiculous.","title":"Krugman: Trump Voters About to Be Shocked at How Badly He Scammed Them"},{"text":"I could not exist with no grill","title":"Disneys Snow White Star Rachel Zegler Hopes Trump Supporters Never Know Peace  Are Part of a Deep, Deep Sickness in This Country"},{"text":"All good.
