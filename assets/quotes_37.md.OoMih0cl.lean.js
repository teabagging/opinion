Its the same bargain white women make when they support misogynist white men in power: if I acquiesce to you demeaning me because of my gender, you will at least allow me to demean others because of their race. https://archive.ph/KPes2It's about having someone beneath you.But let's also not forget that...Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal.

There are some important differences, though:Injection sights are *supervised*, usually with professionals around to monitor and assess the user. Access to the alternatives is controlled. The most important thing, I think, is that the goal for injection sights and alternatives is to get people off the drugs entirely. It's not an \\"outlet\\", it's necessary because usually it would be unsafe for users to abstain entirely. Long term use of the alternatives is a failure.The reason crackdowns inevitably fail is that the users are themselves victims. Drug use is very strongly associated with poverty and loneliness. It is a symptom of other problems. Arresting the user doesn't resolve the deeper, underlying problems driving their drug use. Pedophilia *is* the underlying problem and abusing minors is the symptom. You *might* be able to get them psychological help to control and divert those urges, but there's no deeper issue that can be resolved.

Syria, like Egypt and Jordan (and unlike Lebanon), assumed that in a future war they might conquer more territory and didnt want to be saddled with a binding line.2) If you're going by the 1967 Armistice line:\\n \\"As in the 1948 war, the Arab aim in 1967 was explicitly and openly stated: It ranged from ethnic cleansing to genocide of the Jewish State of Israel. The expectation that the colossal Arab defeat could be followed by a return to the lines from the previous warit too a colossal Arab defeatwould be like the Germans in 1945 expecting they could restore the borders they had in 1919.\\" The armistice lines themselves rewarded aggressive conquest, putting Jordan, Egypt, and Syria in lands that were beyond their own prewar boundaries. Israels territorial gains are a violation of a post-1945 principle but Arab territorial gains (which also took place after 1945) are somehow not?3) If you're going by the pre-1948 French and British boundaries:\\n its not clear which colonial line would be valid: The French and British negotiated one line in 1920 and another in 1922 and continued to make minor adjustments after that. The ambiguity of these lines was the basis of the Syrian argument before 1967 for access to the Sea of Galilee.

All we could all do is stare up in the stage in awe.That said, the opener was... weird in the vibe. They were a music collective out of Seattle called The Master Musicians of Bukkake. Him and I are like 80% sure that we saw the guy who OD'd Kurt Cobain play that show.Whole different conspiracy theory to get into, but Kurt had gotten clean before he died. He'd just gotten back from touring and was filing to divorce Courtney Love and write her out of all of his royalties. Ironically, Buzz Osbourne (frontman of The Melvins who we saw that second show), has never done heroin and accidentally OD'd Kurt down in Brazil at a festival they were both playing. They managed to revive him though. Wondering why Buzz OD'd him? Kurt was terrified of needles. He always had someone else shoot him up. Another reason not to believe a man in boots shot himself up with heroin and blew his brains out with a shotgun. We're pretty sure there were 3-5 people involved that Courtney hadrestraining and forcefully OD'ing him then covering it up as a suicide to prevent that from happening.","title":"AstroWorld 2021: One of the  darkest events of our timeSomething was seriously off."},{"text":"25 yr Union member here and she got maybe 20% of the memberships votes.

Prior to 2021, the American Saturn V and the Russian N1 were the only two rockets ever built capable of putting humans on the moon. Both were decommissioned in the 70s after the final manned Apollo mission.Here is an [infographic](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comparing-the-Size-of-The-Worlds-Rockets-1200px.jpg) to give you an idea of rocket scale. The Saturn V would serve absolutely no purpose other than a manned moon landing. It served no military, government or commercial application and was enormously expensive to launch. The only reason it was built was because smaller rockets could not carry the payload (learned the hard way).So why not build another one and go again?Nobody gave a shit about the 6th landing. Relatively few watched it on TV. (Does anyone know the name Eugene Cernan? No? Last guy to walk on the moon? Anybody? Of course - nobody gave a shit.)  Russian's gave up. NASA didn't need another mission - the 6th mission included an almost an over 7 hour moon walk. Here's 6+ hours of it, unedited: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Y4uu21sKESo...no public interest, no military reason, no political reason, no money.Pretty simple stuff. Also - there's a reason all conspiracies focus on Apollo 11, and not the other 5 landings. Because none of this conspiracy nonsense holds up when looking at all 6 landings, nor the preceding successes to eventually land on the moon, including a full manned dress rehearsal (Apollo 10) in orbit. Also have to ignore the Russian's own attempts as well, which occasionally were coordinated with NASA...For example...During the Apollo 11 moon walk, the Russian's crashed their own lander[ \\\\(Luna 15\\\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_15) on the moon's surface, and had to coordinate flights paths with the US so ensure there were no complications / collisions. Specifically the Luna 15 crashed on the moon at 15:50 UTC, 21st July 1969, and the Apollo 11 lander left the moon's surface at 17:54:00 UTC.The Soviet's were quite literally orbiting and crashing shit into the moon at the exact time Armstrong was walking on the moon. Within a few hours of each other. :D","title":"Did they fake the moon landing?"},{"text":"Is this guy supposed to be the antichrist that religious groups have been warning for decades who will one day take power as president?

You seem to be confused about how the Process actually works.   The Senate can't prevent a President from nominating someone.    Biden in fact did nominate Garland to the Supreme Court.   McConnel wouldn't confirm the nomination, saying that the Senate has the option to not confirm, because it was a Presidential Election year.  Do you know who invented the excuse of not confirming a Supreme Court Nomination during a Presidential Election year?   It was Joe Biden when he was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1992.Interestingly enough Biden changed his mind about in 2016, when  a Democrat President had a chance to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat in  2016.   And then 4 years later in 2020 when a Republican President had the opportunity, Biden was once again- against the idea.       Biden's position on this changes based on which option benefits the Democrat party the most. ?Or back in 2015 when republicans put a 2000 page bill for a vote but didn't give democrats enough time to read more than a few pages before they had to vote on it in congress?I'm not familiar with the bill that you are talking about,  but for the sake of argument it doesn't matter.  Democrats have rushed bills through Congress before.      Also remind who was President in 2015?  That was a Democrat.

A stable nation-state has the ability to enforce its laws within its own bordersmaking its laws real. (Just to be clear, Im not making some\\nnut job Sov Cit or An Cap point here; Im actually a practicing attorney).  As others have said, true, broad scale enforcement of international law would require warwhich most nations are understandably not willing to do unless the offense directly threatens them. Of course, some nations have written provisions into their own, domestic laws that make them subject to international, or multi-national law enforcement: e.g.; the member-states of the EU.  Although, even then, the EUs enforcement of some of its own lawsor at least foundational principlesis being tested by members like Hungary. In other words, I dont think its accurate to say international law doesnt exist. Rather, international law isgenerallvery weak. That said, I do think there are examples of international law, or what essentially amounts to law, that are about as real as those of a stable nation-states: * The EU is a clear instance of stable, generally enforced multi-national law (with the one semi-caveat I mentioned above).  * For another, Article 5 of NATO is essentially a declaration of international (or at least multi-national) law that NO ONE is allowed to directly attack a NATO member. That declaration is enforced by the very real, very credible, and very deadly threat of having the mightiest military alliance in the history of humanityspear headed by the US: the most astoundingly, peerlessly mighty, single-nation military in the history of humanitycoming down on you like the hammer of god.  Regardless of what any state-level NATO adversary thinks about the validity or virtue of the arrangementnot a single one has yet attempted to violate that law. * Id also argue that the UNs joint military action during the Korean War was a clear example international law enforcement.  * As a more mundane example: the international agreement of the freedom of international waters and associated anti-piracy actions are widely enforced and adhered to as law.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"With the FF+ in particular, I've heard that they're counterintuitively one of the most accommodating coalition partners (in constrast to the reports, warranted or not, of DA arrogance), so that's part of it, but you're definitely right that the ANC sees value in eroding the DA's Afrikaner support, and they're two parties with absolutely zero overlap in voting base, so they pose almost no threat to each other; the DA is effectively a common enemy. ActionSA is tougher because it's hard to tell how much of what's going on in Gauteng is at the behest of the province and Lesufi vs. national leadership; Lesufi and Mbalula openly sniping at each other doesn't help things.

Saying the Senate wouldn't consider the nomination if he did. Biden stated that Bush shouldn't even bother naming a replacement, and stated that a majority of his predecessors didn't nominate a replacement when they were in that situation.

Occupying another country is simply expensive and very troublesome. It's all a profit and loss calculation and it seems that the problems associated with maintaining order in occupied territories outweigh the potential gains. In addition, there is the issue of native societies. If the US were to annex a another country to its territory, it would have to regulate the legal status of its citizens in some way. Creating second-class citizens seems very controversial and I suspect that in the long run it would lead to major abuses.\\nIt would be much more likely that along with the annexed territory, its citizens would become US citizens. This is not a good solution as well, because having all the rights of citizens, they could internally sabotage US politics and strive for independence. I think that the method that the US has tried to use so far is much more rational. Which is maintain a broadly understood  influence zones. Another solution may be in a way that Russia has often used in history in countries that were in its sphere of influence. Creating a pseudo-sovereign state with its own government established as a result of imitation of democratic elections, which has a lot of autonomy, but is most importantly a matter of subordinating Russia's position. This is a very convenient solution because it really comes down to issuing orders that the government of the subordinate country implements.Perhaps in the case of Greenland, territorial annexation could be effective and profitable. It is a very depopulated area rich in resources.\\nIn the case of Panama, it's really about maintaining tight control over transit through the Panama Canal. To achieve that, you don't really have to conquer the territory, just allocate a few naval units there.","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"Seems to be.

I'm from a white Southern family for reference. Since the Civil Rights Act the official position of our mainstream  culture has been \\"racism bad\\".  That doesn't mean that all racism suddenly went away, but it meant that people tried to deny it, hide it, did mental gymnastics to convince themselves that their biases weren't racism. And so even former Dixiecrats were telling their kids \\"racism is bad\\" even if they weren't always walking the walk yet.We were all raised on Sesame Street and Mr Roger's and Soul Train and believed our parents and grandparents that racism is bad.  It wasn't til we got older that we realized that racism is still all around us-- but still, that's something to overcome, because racism is bad. Getting better over time was the goal. Grandpa is embarrassing; our parents don't always get it, but all generations accepted the premise that racism is bad. To suggest that someone was racist was a huuuuuge insult because being a racist is bad. The acceptance of racism as a laudable goal feels like a big cultural shift. It's really distressing to see this become accepted in mainstream society in a way it hasn't been since before I was born.

The Constitution is split up into three sections: 1-- Congress; 2: Presidency; 3: Supreme Court, before addressing less relevant topics.  Two of those first three sections (Articles 1 &amp; 2) are responsible for making (1) and then executing (2) the laws of the country, which makes them the political branches.  3 was supposed to only determine what is and is not within the Constitution (they have since embarked on goals and designs elsewhere).The problem with this title is that it creates some dilapidated expectation on one branch of government (2) to do what the primary branch of government (1) was supposed to do.  The President isn't supposed to do shit to the Constitution.  Congress OR the States, by way of amendment (which is a process specifically outlined in Article V of the Constitution), are the only organized entities, or nouns, that need be discussed.If you are mentioning the President and some verb involving constitutional amendments, you're most likely already wrong in terms of process; but in political substance, the President would rightly marshal political forces towards using the proper mechanics to institute the A part of ERA.  Both the attorneys mentioned in the opening sentence of this article (Meiselas and Biden) are aware of this.

If an individual refuses to pay taxes, the government can forcibly seize their assets or imprison them. This is the very definition of coercion. On the other hand, employment or business transactions are agreements between private parties who are free to negotiate or walk away. A person working for a \\"low wage\\" still has the option to seek other employment or pursue education, whereas refusing taxes results in legal punishment, not mere inconvenience.Second, suggesting the wealthy can \\"just leave\\" ignores the reality that governments enforce tax collection through international treaties and penalties, often making it impossible to fully escape taxation. Forcing someone to move to another country to avoid punitive taxation is far more coercive than negotiating wages in a free market.Finally, comparing taxes to employment choices misunderstands the nature of private versus governmental interactions. A worker and a company enter into a mutually beneficial relationship voluntarily, while taxes are imposed unilaterally by the state. Youre conflating two distinct systems of exchange: one based on voluntary agreement and the other based on legal compulsion.If your argument is that coercion is acceptable for taxation, that's a different discussion. But attempting to redefine taxation as \\"voluntary\\" to equate it with market transactions is flawed.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"The problem with the originak version of the meme is the assumption that cops are ever working.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/72z2vw6fgz8e1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8196b996b83a2431a0c15a07fd8225ee440ea2c8","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"\\"For my own part I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country.

Although Chile had some educational reforms, which is true, Chile completely failed economically wise. It nationalized nearly all of its major industries while already having an extremely corrupt leadership, causing massive inflation and loss of foreign investors in what was an otherwise relatively stable economy. Due to that, there was massive shortages, not to mention the fact that Chile was severely deindustrialized to begin with. The purges and mass social alienation campaigns led by Allende caused massive strikes even with Truck drivers, which ironically, didn't subdue the far-left, instead, it radicalized it. Allende's election was democratic, true, but Allende absolutely bypassed the Congress, as well as radicalized the military, which causes issues in Chile to this day. It wasn't Allende's election which caused the coup, it was the massive unrest at the time. The Chileans went from having everything to having to form lines for bread and fuel. I'm not excusing American involvement under Pinochet's rule, or his tyrannical rule, but please consider that free commerce near the end of Pinochet's rule is a large part of the reason why Chile relatively thrived economically, not to mention American support. Most Latin American countries look more down on the USSR than America due to these reasons, as well as America being overall more aligned to their personal beliefs than to anything else. Far-left economic reforms failed Latin America. Look at Cuba, look at Bolivia, look at Argentina, look at Venezuela. And the sad thing is, it's not a big shock to me that they are turning to the political right more and more. Communism in Latin America is synonymous for many people with the type of Populism that only emerges from MAGA in the States.","title":"CMV: Class consciousness in the United States will be next to impossible"},{"text":"I think this response is very telling.

Choosing to pay for medicine or rent isnt coercion; its a reflection of the reality that resources are finite. The alternative where the state decides what people \\"need\\" and redistributes accordingly is coercive, taking away individual choice entirely. The power disparity between rich and poor exists, but that doesnt invalidate the principle of voluntary exchange; it highlights the need for systems that improve access to opportunities, not punish success.Second, claiming wealth inherently leads to buying politicians and corrupting regulation is an overgeneralization. Corruption and regulatory capture are issues of governance and accountability, not wealth itself. Many wealthy individuals and businesses operate within ethical boundaries. Using the existence of bad actors to indict an entire group is like punishing all black people because some of them did something morally or legally wrong.Lastly, suggesting that arguing wealth is earned is an argument against regulation is a strawman. Advocating for fair recognition of wealth creation and voluntary exchange doesnt exclude supporting regulations that ensure accountability and fairness. Blaming wealth instead of addressing systemic governance issues is a distraction that avoids tackling real problems.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"He's just quoting bullshit that he is told by \\"debunker\\" lists lmao.","title":"Did they fake the moon landing?"},{"text":"And the misspelled last name.","title":"Sen. Kyrsten Sinemas recent lavish travel expenses broke the law, watchdog group alleges"},{"text":"Bro, it's logic at this point. If people can't understand logic and probability, then I guess maybe I get why they can't understand the moon landings are all fake along with the ISS and entire program.Inductive logic gives a great argument as to why the probability goes down into the hole at this point. I can no longer say they probably went to the moon.It's because there are too many long trails of holes with zero explanation, hence no premises to create a solid argument with for the moon landings. All the parrots do is basically repeat government propaganda over and over. It's tired man. This shit worked in the 90s. It doesn't work anymore. You have to put up or shut the fuck up.It's 55+ years later. All this happened during a hugely corrupt Nixon presidency--I mean they all are corrupt at this point--within a THREE YEAR PERIOD lmao. All these trips were done in fucking THREE YEARS. 6 trips to the moon and back without human loss of life or a single failure on those 6 missions.The vehicles then are 100% the most able, best engineered, and most technologically feasible designs ever created. RIGHT? So where are the generational improvements on the moon lander? Where are all the generational improvements on human flight in space and landing capabilities? We went through two MAJOR computer revolutions and the same for engineering since then. Where the FUCK are these generational improvements that should have been right there with these absolutely exponential improvements to tech.There are ZERO. The lander to the eye looks like not a single person could fly that thing anywhere, literally. And if some of the low key sources are true, nobody ever did successfully fly it. Buzz or Armstrong I think almost died trying to pilot it once on earth. Their press conference after coming back is also telling. It looks like what you would expect from people that never went to the moon. They fidget, they look around, they stumble over words. These are quite clearly men who have not gone to the fucking moon lmao.Where are the TENS OF THOUSANDS of hours of testing that would be required to make these vehicles sustainable on the harsh environment of the moon? We never saw that or witnessed one singular, successful test of the lander. The thing is mythical garbage.Even IF you were to ONLY land on the moon in the most perfect spot, your vehicles and everything else would STILL have to be able to handle all the max and min temps that the moon has to offer. Nobody goes to war with a machine that can't handle the environment lmao.There is no vehicle capable of withstanding moon environments still to this day. Not even close. We aren't even discussing radiation. -200 to +200 temps? Are you out of your mind? No vehicle even comes close to being able to withstand this currently available on earth to public knowledge.So with inductive logic all of this shit just falls apart now. We can safely say they probably did not go to the moon in 1969. It's too long. Too late in the game. And NASA is well known as a money laundering facility for the deep state. They have nothing to show. They are killing the ISS because it is becoming obvious the thing is fake as fuck to anybody with half a brain cell. Or again, in the very least it's becoming probable that there is no actual ISS, and we have next to zero capability to build or do anything in actual space. The thermosphere I mean is possible, but it doesn't seem like we have any capability there either. We can literally do nothing up there. It's been so long, and yet we have shown nothing again and again. This is not the logical structure of a solid argument for the moon landings anymore.NASA literally schedules a moon landing, tells you why they are going there, and then cancels at LEAST once a decade sometimes twice. Their ISS program is riddled with flapping doors, green screen shit, and wires. And the astronauts. Don't even get me started on how mentally ill some of these people look and act. These people definitely have a tough job pretending to do all this shit don't get me wrong. Why they do it IDK.Since 1972 like clockwork. Every single fucking time. Delayed. Canceled. But they do schedule them and build up hype. And then you get these padded jammy space muppets who drool on their keyboards with wonder just believing this nonsense like the WWE or some shit.It's hilariously stupid. These muppets believe whatever they are told, whatever they are given. 55 years later look at all the advancements in every single thing from computing to cars to airplanes, et cetera. Nothing has ever come from the vehicles used in the moon landings. Nobody has ever made a generational improvement to these HOLY vehicles that mastered space for a three year period in the 70s and then never again lmao.","title":"Did they fake the moon landing?"},{"text":"A year ago, I spent Christmas Eve with my lazy husband, who I had been with for 23 years.Christmas Eve this year - different boy, way hotter, actually does his dishes, twenty years younger.

Specific harmful actions, like pollution or intensive farming, are issues of regulation and accountability, not inherent to being wealthy. Blaming wealth for environmental or societal problems is a distraction from finding real solutions that apply to everyone equally, regardless of income.This is a neat and utopic vision, but also hopelessly naive.For one, because \\"voluntary exchange \\" is hardly voluntary in the real world. Your choice is to pay for medicine or die; to pay your landlord or be homeless; to work your job or loose the money for the former two items, and so on. There is a massive difference in the power of negotiating positions between the rich and the poor.Edit : To illustrate, you claimed :They cannot eat a million pieces of bread a day, **live in a million houses**, or drink all the clean water. Their success doesnt inherently deprive others of resources.The reality is that the wealthy have figured out that they can charge higher rents, if it appears there are fewer rental units available. So, they take rental units of the market, have houses sit around, completely unused, push people into homelessness, just so that the remaining renters are terrified into accepting their higher rents.The practice of lowering rent to fill a vacancy was a reflex for many in the apartment industry. Letting units sit empty could be costly and nerve-wracking for leasing agents.Such agents sometimes hesitated to push rents higher. Roper said they were often peers of the people they were renting to. We said theres way too much empathy going on here, he said. This is one of the reasons we wanted to get pricing off-site.Unimpeded by human worries, YieldStars price increases sometimes led to more tenants leaving.Camdens turnover rates increased about 15 percentage points in 2006 after it implemented YieldStar, Campo, the companys CEO, told a trade publication a few years later. But that wasnt a problem for the firm: Despite having to replace more renters, its revenue grew by 7.4%.The net effect of driving revenue and pushing people out was $10 million in income, Campo said. I think that shows keeping the heads in the beds above all else is not always the best strategy....During an earnings call in 2017, Winn said one large property company, which managed more than 40,000 units, learned it could make more profit by operating at a lower occupancy level that would have made management uncomfortable before, he said.The company had been seeking occupancy levels of 97% or 98% in markets where it was a leader, Winn said. But when it began using YieldStar, managers saw that raising rents and leaving some apartments vacant made more money.Initially, it was very hard for executives to accept that they could operate at 94% or 96% and achieve a higher NOI by increasing rents, Winn said on the call, referring to net operating income. The company began utilizing RealPage to operate at 95%, while seeing revenue increases of 3% to 4%.\\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rentSecondly, being wealthy means you have the power to buy politicians, to shape the regulation in your favor.

First, gaining wealth doesnt mean taking resources from others. Wealth is created through voluntary exchanges in the market where both parties agree to the terms. The idea that someone getting rich means others are deprived misunderstands how value is generated in a functioning economy. Wealth isn't a zero-sum game.Second, the notion that taxes dont violate property rights because the government grants those rights is completely flawed. Rights are not privileges handed out by the government; they exist independently of it. The role of government is to protect those rights, not redefine or undermine them based on arbitrary decisions about who has enough.Your dismissal of fairness in taxation by saying the wealthy want for nothing also misses the mark. Fairness isn't about judging how much someone needs; its about applying rules equally. Just because someone is wealthy doesnt justify taking more from them. Punishing success because someone subjectively feels its too much isnt fairness but envy codified into law.Finally, no one claimed the wealthy would commit crimes due to taxes. The point is that undermining property rights or targeting specific groups based on their wealth violates basic principles of justice. Respecting rights and fairness isn't about letting anyone avoid taxes. It's about ensuring that principles, not feelings or resentment, guide public policies.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"Sorry, u/Flight_Harbinger C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1: **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OPs stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.

A company is not responsible for ensuring someone is not starving; its role is to engage in voluntary exchanges of labor and wages. If a starving person does not agree with the terms offered by a company, the company cannot be punished for that refusal. The governments role is not to enforce arbitrary obligations on companies simply because an individuals personal circumstances make them desperate.Claiming that a persons limited options turn voluntary agreements into exploitation undermines the principle of free association. A company is under no obligation to hire someone, just as an individual is under no obligation to work for a specific company. Introducing coercive measures to penalize companies for offering market-determined wages undermines the foundations of a fair and free market system, replacing it with one based on forced redistribution driven by subjective moral judgments.Employment is a two-way agreement. If the terms are unacceptable to either party, the deal does not proceed.

Class warfare solved nothing, and mostly actually destroyed industries and societies, as well as introduced a purge system where anyone in power could accuse other oligarchs of corruption or incompetence, and getting rid of them anyways. I'm not saying there should be no limitations, but class distinction in terms of social or financial status is equally as redundant as any time of classist system. People overall don't want to kill/overthrow everyone in power. Even if some people do, exceptions would obviously be made, causing further chaos, not to mention that virtually all societies that actually implemented class warfare are no longer existent, or inherently more/about as oligarchic as before. In the U.S, Presidents have historically been completely able to push aside different lobbies. As for \\"shaping narratives\\", all countries have certain influences over others extending beyond diplomacy. As I said before, popular opinion plays a big role above all. In the previous American election, Kamala Harris came fairly close to winning, although she did lose in the end. The voting in itself wasn't rigged in any way, maybe that says more about the average American's education level than anything else both ways. Luigi surely shaped a narrative, is he a multi millionaire CEO? Not to mention the gloriously funny fact of \\"Were the CEOs and exec boards elected?\\" Yes, they are elected by the companies to maximize profits, in order to stabilize companies and therefore maintain jobs that are regulated by laws. \\"Were the families with massive generational wealth elected? They have god-like influence when it comes to fixing the social order in place: they can afford the best schools, the best healthcare etc.\\"So what? Are we denying educations to the wealthy, then? You can have a great education, OD, and no amount of healthcare can save you because you're human. People are responsible for their own actions, and massive generational wealth has nothing to do with the capitalist system. Wealth is an intrinsic tool measuring the worth of someone's time. I have to break it to you, but communist governments used it too. \\"They go work hours in a capitalist system because otherwise they would be homeless and starve. There is no opting-out unless you are independently wealthy.?\\"No, people work hours not only because you need a minimal salary in order to sustain yourself, but because every economy in the world requires you to contribute to it to circulate wealth, because every job out there is linked with each other (if you cut trees for a living, you produce something which is used by other industries, and create comfort products you yourself use), it allows for further career opportunities, as well as funds public infrastructure which you do use.   You can always opt out, by the way. Check zoning laws, and build some kind of homestead, and you can subsist in some level.

Workers and employers enter into agreements based on mutual consent. No one is forced to work for any particular wage or employer, just as no employer is forced to hire a specific worker. The market determines wages based on supply, demand, and the value created by labor, not on subjective feelings about fairness. Claiming that workers are exploited because they generate more value than they are paid ignores the fact that their compensation is determined by their agreed-upon contribution, skills, and market conditions. If the workers' labor were truly worth significantly more elsewhere, they would have the ability to negotiate higher wages or seek alternative employment.Wealth is created when entrepreneurs combine resources like capital, labor, and ideas to produce goods and services people value. The profits they earn are not stolen but are the result of offering something that consumers willingly buy. Workers contribute to this process, but the entrepreneur bears the risk, organizes the resources, and often provides the vision and leadership necessary for the enterprise to succeed. To say the owner profits more than workers because they amass \\"power over workers\\" is to mischaracterize the nature of a free market. Workers have the freedom to seek other opportunities, while owners have the responsibility to ensure the company's survival, often risking their own wealth in the process.Differences in wealth or income are not automatically signs of exploitation. They reflect differences in roles, risks, contributions, and value creation. Jeff Bezos, for instance, became wealthy because Amazon transformed global commerce, logistics, and technology. The scale of value he created justifies the wealth he accumulated. This does not mean that workers are undervalued but that their contribution is one part of a larger system. If Bezos' wealth were redistributed evenly, it would provide only a temporary and negligible benefit to individuals while destroying the incentives for innovation and investment that drive economic growth.The argument that workers have no choice but to accept low wages is misleading. In a functioning market, workers have options to upskill, change industries, or start their own businesses. While not everyone has the same starting point, the principle of equality under the law ensures that people have the opportunity to improve their circumstances. Efforts to impose arbitrary wage controls or wealth redistribution distort this dynamic and harm economic mobility.While progressive taxation is often justified as a way to fund public goods, it must be weighed against the principle of property rights. Taking a higher percentage of someone's income simply because they earn more violates the principle of equal treatment under the law. It punishes success and creates a disincentive for individuals to innovate, take risks, and work hard.The claim that wealthy individuals should \\"contribute significantly more\\" assumes that their wealth is inherently undeserved or that they are morally obligated to surrender it. However, taxation should be based on principles of fairness and efficiency, not envy or subjective judgments about how much wealth is \\"too much.\\"","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"This sounds incredibly similar to my path the last 2 1/2 years!

In a civilized society, fairness stems from principles like equality under the law, respect for individual rights, and non-discrimination. These principles ensure that everyone is treated equally regardless of wealth, race, or other characteristics. Discriminating against individuals based on wealth contradicts these foundational principles, turning fairness into a matter of arbitrary opinion rather than a consistent standard.Defining fairness as \\"how much deprivation is caused by the tax burden\\" leads to absurd results. Imagine if you went to a barber and the cost of your haircut wasnt based on the service provided but on how much money you had. A wealthy person might pay $1,000 for the same haircut that costs $10 for someone less affluent because the wealthy person can afford it without deprivation. Similarly, if buying a car were priced by financial burden rather than the product itself, the wealthy would pay millions while others paid pennies for the exact same vehicle. Such a system would be seen as ludicrous and unfair because it abandons the principle of equal exchange.Applying this logic to taxes creates a similarly arbitrary and discriminatory standard. Taxes should reflect the equal public goods and services received by all, not subjective measures of financial burden.Wealth, in and of itself, is not a moral failing or a justification for unequal treatment. It is typically earned through voluntary exchange, risk, and innovation. Taxing individuals more heavily solely because they are wealthy punishes success and violates the principle of equal treatment under the law. Using wealth as a metric for taxation is a discriminatory practice that undermines trust in the fairness of the system.A fair tax system aligns with the principle of equal burden. If all citizens benefit equally from public goods, it follows that all citizens should contribute equally to funding them. Usage-based taxes, like fuel taxes or court fees, already address situations where some individuals or businesses use more resources. Beyond that, additional taxation based solely on wealth becomes a subjective and unjustified infringement on property rights.Redefining fairness to justify wealth redistribution ignores its broader societal consequences. When fairness becomes a subjective tool for justifying higher taxes on the wealthy, it fosters division, resentment, and economic inefficiency.

These components are typically inert on their own but become dangerous when mixed under specific conditions.Applying to Biology\\nComponent 1: A substance is introduced into a person (e.g., via a vaccine, pill, or other delivery method). This substance could be designed to remain dormant until triggered.Component 2: A common substance like coffee, alcohol, or even a dietary ingredient acts as the trigger.Outcome: When combined, these two components interact in a way that harms the individual, potentially causing disease or other ailments.Key Requirements for This to WorkAdvanced PersonalizationThe weapon would need to account for an individuals unique biological makeup (e.g., genetics, metabolism, microbiome).Precision targeting like this would require detailed biometric data, potentially collected through medical records, genetic testing, nasal swabs or wearable devices.A Stable Dormant AgentThe substance delivered (e.g., in a \\"vaccine\\") must remain inert and stable until the trigger is introduced.\\nIt would need to bypass the immune system and metabolic pathways to avoid detection or degradation.Controlled TriggerThe trigger (e.g., coffee or another common substance) must react with the dormant agent in a predictable way, causing the desired harmful effect.It must be common enough to ensure exposure but specific enough not to affect everyone indiscriminately and raise suspicion.Complexity of Biological SystemsHuman biology is highly variable. Predicting how two components will interact in every individual is challenging but can be successful with advances in technology.Theres a high risk of unintended side effects or failure in certain individuals.Delivery and ConcealmentDelivering such a substance on a large scale while avoiding detection would would be difficult without strategic co-operation.Trigger SpecificityIf the trigger is too common, unintended exposure could lead to premature effects, alerting authorities.If the trigger is too rare, the weapons efficacy would be limited.Synthetic Biology: Advances in this field are rapidly improving the ability to engineer biological systems with precision.CRISPR and Gene Editing: Technologies like CRISPR could potentially be used to target specific genetic traits or introduce dormant agents.\\nNanotechnology: This could enable precise delivery of substances and ensure they remain inactive until triggered.","title":"Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated"},{"text":"Absolutely.

I mean, if the Moon landings are suspicious because the Apollo hardware has been destroyed, then it means that Boeing 707 is fake too, because Boeing has since destroyed all the facilities used to build it.The point here is that it's *normal* for such equipment to be destroyed.

Before he was caught I even saw posts claiming the police let him get away because they supported him too. Ive never understood comparing police response to him as to the response to school shooters. The vast majority of school shooters are **children** that usually end up dead. The major difference between Luigi and rapists serial killers and mass shooters is that Luigi had a crowd of people protesting in support of him. A large group of people that want a suspect released usually leads to a larger police presence. Otherwise a crowd could easily help him escape. The support is also the reason for the terrorism charge. Terrorism has nothing to do with the amount of people killed, its the use of violence to achieve ideological goals.

Taking more from individuals simply because they have more infringes on their property rights and violates the principle of equality under the law. Taxation should be based on universal principles, not subjective assessments of someones financial status.Roads, courts, healthcare, and national defense are public goods intended to benefit all members of society equally. Businesses, employees, and consumers all derive value from these services. If a business uses these resources more heavily (e.g., roads for deliveries), it already contributes more through usage-based fees like fuel taxes or court filing costs. No additional burden is justified purely because a business or its owners have been successful.The wealth generated by the company is the result of voluntary agreements. Customers choose to buy its products, employees agree to work for it, and investors provide capital. These mutually beneficial exchanges create value for all parties. The resulting profits are not taken from others; they are earned within a framework of free transactions. Imposing additional taxes on this success based on subjective notions of fairness undermines these voluntary agreements and property rights.Your argument assumes that wealthy individuals should pay disproportionately because they supposedly benefit more. This conflates equal access to public goods with unequal outcomes and introduces a discriminatory standard. Equality under the law means treating everyone the same, regardless of financial status. Taxing individuals differently based on their income violates this principle and replaces fairness with arbitrary redistribution.Determining who benefits more from public goods is inherently subjective and leads to arbitrary redistribution. For example, while the company owners rely on the courts for contract enforcement, employees rely on the same courts for job protections and disputes. Assigning unequal burdens based on perceived benefit opens the door to favoritism, resentment, and the erosion of trust in the system.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"...and I'm saying that we're not going to overcome it when it's promoted as a core political strategy, but it doesn't need to be.","title":"CMV: Class consciousness in the United States will be next to impossible"},{"text":"?How is it not inherently democratic ?

Capitalism, in the classical sense, does not support these ideals.Money was created to address the disparity in value between commodities. A shoemaker wouldnt pay up 10,000 shows to buy a house. - Plato (somewhere along these lines). Today, Money creates commodity, rather than commodity creating money. Most of the people who are extremely wealthy today had money to begin with. That money helped produce commodity, and selling commodities creates more money. An example of commodity for money: A man sells a Y for $30 to buy X. This doesnt happen today like it did in the past. Marx points this out as he got to witness some of the industrial revolution and the start of factories. Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, didnt account for this as much as he focused on the Human condition and the value of labor.Now, the value of labor is interesting. Do you believe that its fair to pay a worker $10/hr for producing $1000/hr in profit? Regardless of technologys impact on productivity, you would expect that workers still get paid a fair wage for their labor. The commodity they created is being sold for signifcantly more than what it cost for them to make it.You could argue Well, they wouldnt have created it without the person reaponsible for bringing those resources together - including the labor- to be created. True, yet nobody is simply buying these resources themselves. If I sold you wood and iron instead of the hammer, would you find that valuable? Similarly , even if you had the skill to build the hammer, would you have the money to buy those resources to build the hammer? This is the issue: the workers dont have the money to put it together and the owner doesnt have the skills to create it. Yet, when the two come together to make it happen, you get a wonderful hammer. Recognizing this, do you consider it fair that one person profits more than the other? I dont thinks fair at all. There needs to be a fair balance between the two, and the system we today reflects that unfair treatment.Now, if the owner (the guy with the money; the billionaire, bourgeoisie, whatever you want to call it) is able to pay a laborer a half days worth of work and still get a full days worth of labor out of it, thats unfair, especially if they can continue to increase prices and make a significant ROI. The workers still make the same amount whereas the owner makes significantly more. Its normalized exploitation. Consider how the people at the bottom work paycheck to paycheck. They cant afford housing nor necessities. They dont even have money to invest in the stock market, which also takes a considerable amount of time to study, understand, and practice. Overtime, this impacts their children, wholl have less access to quality, educational, productive resources. *Side Note: shareholder profits are stolen profits. Its absolutely a corrupt system where those who have money make more money from companies they contribute no labor to while workers make the same.*But look at the owner: likely comes from wealth or at least a quality, educational, and productive education. They had more access to wealthier folks, more time to engage, and all they needed was a good word in for them to go far. Overtime, their families become wealthier and continues to rise.The disparity has grown tremendously since now we have billionaires while people continue to get poorer. The cost of goods increase, corporations profit, and the workers dont get much for their contribution to that success. There is a level of exploitation taking place here.Its all consensual though. Is it? Do people choose to work minimum wage?! Do people have a choice if they dont have the resources to access greater opportunities?! Youre saying there is a choice, but its merely an illusion of choice with limited options. Now Taxation: If we created a tax bracket system based on income - which we have - we can some strain off the working classes. The top 1%, comprised of MULTIPLE billionaires, is going to do just fine. Taxing $1M at 40% still leaves them with $600K. Tax someone who makes $200K at 25%, they still make $150k. Tax someone who makes 100K at 10%, they still make $90K. Tax someone at $50k at 10%, theyre left with $40k.The contributions of the Millionaire is more than all these hypothetical net incomes combined, yet they would still be making enough to buy multiple houses. Everyone else still has to contribute more labor to achieve the same outcome years down the line.To wrap this up: \\n- We explored the concept of labor, slightly\\n- We compared the access to resources between the wealthy and the working class\\n- We talk a bit on the exploitation of workers that never seen the record breaking profits hitting their pocketsAs a Capitalist, I am DISGUSTED with the normalized exploitation in our free and fair market. Prices go up, profits increase, and the only people winning are those at the top, whose labor isnt worth billions. I respect their contributions - since its their ideas that created the commodities we love today - but I am not blind to how it impacts those at the bottom.I dont think it would be a problem for them to contribute significantly more to society if it helped create a more free and fair market.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"Palestine has ratified the Rome Statute which gives the ICC jurisdiction over the Occupied West Bank and Gaza and therefore any criminal actions that Netanyahu and Gallant might have done there.

Instead, its about consistent application of principles to everyone. When we start redefining equality based on outcomes or perceived needs, we abandon fairness and replace it with subjective judgment, which opens the door to endless justifications for unequal treatment. Taking more from someone because they can afford it undermines the principle of equal treatment. If a loaf of bread is taken from a rich person, its still their property, and fairness demands that everyones property is equally respected, regardless of wealth. Similarly, giving unequal benefits to certain groups violates the idea of neutrality in governance, replacing fairness with favoritism.Investing more in struggling areas is not inherently at odds with equality. Public services like law enforcement or infrastructure can be allocated based on objective needs without violating principles of fairness, so long as all individuals are treated equally under the law. This is different from targeting individuals or groups for unequal burdens based on subjective perceptions of their ability to give.True equality focuses on principles, consistent rules for everyone, not on constantly shifting the scales to achieve specific outcomes. When the law abandons neutrality for subjective assessments, it ceases to be a shield for justice and becomes a tool for arbitrary redistribution, which history shows leads to inequality, resentment, and abuse.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"Y'all just wait :3 the devil is going to resurrect Jesus and bring paradise to the realm!","title":"'Dear Santa is a dangerous trivialization of the devil; encourages writing of accidental letter to Satan with misguided belief that one can have their wishes fulfilled while outwitting demons'"},{"text":"The 3 that Biden did not pardon are gonna get killed so fucking hard, and maybe on PPV because ridiculous reality tv president","title":"Trump vows to pursue executions after Biden commutes most of federal death row"},{"text":"Santa exists, but he's stingingly classist.

Specific harmful actions, like pollution or intensive farming, are issues of regulation and accountability, not inherent to being wealthy. Blaming wealth for environmental or societal problems is a distraction from finding real solutions that apply to everyone equally, regardless of income.Throughout history, totalitarian regimes and corrupt leaders have exploited envy and resentment to justify confiscating property from others. By appealing to emotions like jealousy or anger, theyve stripped individuals of their rights, leading to oppression, poverty, and societal collapse. Respecting universal principles like private property, voluntary exchange, and equality under the law is what safeguards societies from such abuses. Systems that ignore these principles in favor of subjective feelings inevitably harm everyone, especially the most vulnerable.Fairness isnt determined by subjective notions of who deserves wealth but by adhering to principles that uphold justice and freedom. Wealth acquired through voluntary, legal means isnt random or unfair but it reflects choices, effort, and value creation. Arbitrarily redistributing wealth based on feelings of envy or perceived inequality undermines these principles and replaces fairness with force.If the concern is environmental impact, it should be addressed through universal, principled solutions like emissions regulations or sustainable development practices, not by targeting the wealthy simply because they have more. Wealth doesnt inherently cause harm; harmful actions do. Principles ensure accountability for specific actions, rather than scapegoating individuals based on their success.\\nThe idea that wealth is a closed system, passed only within elite circles, ignores the dynamism of free markets. Many of the wealthiest individuals started with little and succeeded through innovation and hard work. Even inherited wealth contributes to the economy through investments, philanthropy, and job creation. Redistribution based on subjective feelings of unfairness destroys incentives, fosters resentment, and damages social mobility.Finally, subjective emotions like envy and resentment have historically been used to justify some of the greatest injustices, including property confiscation and systemic oppression. A just society is built on universal principles that protect individual rights and freedoms, not on arbitrary redistribution based on feelings. Respecting these principles ensures fairness for everyone and prevents the abuses that totalitarian systems thrive on.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"It is a Luciferian ritual.

Class consciousness is highly unpopular in a large part of the entire world. It's a Marxist belief, which in the Marxist sphere, is supposed to be the spark of a Communist revolution. However, in the real world, this plays incredibly differently, as nobody is that obsessed between social/economic classes, just like any other overgeneralized class. People go work hours in a capitalist system because it's stable, and the reward is generally decent. Billionaires can exist in any socialist or democratic system, hell, in most Communist societies, the oligarchy is billionaire. An industry is an industry, it exists to profit, and the leaders of the \\"freedom movements\\" you mention which are \\"killed by the FBI\\" don't follow suit to your beliefs.2. The ruling \\"class\\" holds all the power by definition, because they've been voted into power. See, in a democracy, there's Judicial as well as Executive power, which both work together to make sure that laws are applied. You can do whatever you want, as long as you function according to the rules of your country. Why don't you go make your own political party, if you're so passionate? 3. There is propaganda both ways, you know. You can go to any \\"third world\\" nation and live in it, and I would know, I come from one. Capitalism didn't ruin my nation, neither did America. Tribalism is more present outside of America than inside of it. I would say very few people do actually share your sentiment on that one. The internet shouldn't be your main source of information.I understand/sympathize with a few of your points, but I feel like your world view is incredibly centric on a very local area in which you live. Have you tried going abroad? It might change your worldview drastically. I get that my point essentially does invalidate your title, as it's a POV that most people don't have. I don't see social casts so antagonistically as you do, as it's been proven time and time again that these social casts are virtually impossible to destroy, but it seems like a highly toxic mindset to have overall.

Public goods like roads, law enforcement, and national defense are equally available to everyone, and if someone uses more (e.g., more roads), they often already pay more through mechanisms like fuel taxes. Thats fairness based on use, not subjective feelings about wealth.Theres no principle in a free and just society that states someone must contribute more simply because they are rich. Wealth isnt a measure of how much someone benefits from public services; its often the result of creating value for others through voluntary exchange. The demand that the wealthy pay disproportionately more stems not from fairness but from emotions like envy or frustration. Principles, not subjective feelings, should guide taxation. Punishing someone for their success or demanding more from them without a principled basis undermines the foundation of a fair society.

In order to produce that, they hire 200 CpAs at 115k, 200 lawyers at 250k average, and fund themselves 35m/yr in upper management.

Dems would essentially be wasting legislative days to accommodate Musk's schedule. He is a billionaire who owns several large and high-profile corporations. I doubt he has room in his schedule to jet off to Washington, D.C., for days or weeks at a time. It would only make sense if a handful of Republicans nominate Musk as Speaker of the House, he accepts, and Dems join in to take him across the finish line. However, this would likely alienate their base. After all, they would essentially be elevating a controversial billionaire who owns one of the world's most influential social media companies to a powerful position in government. Every Dem congressman would be handing a primary challenger a major talking point for 2026.Second, however bad you think Musk and his ideas are, you're essentially granting him *even more* influence over the policymaking process. Closed-door negotiations can get pretty technical and wonky. You're inviting  Musk to have a direct hand in legislative language, specific programs, and so forth. Yeah, he jettisoned the CR Jeffries and Johnson hammered out, that sucks. But there are limits to his pressure campaigns. Musk backed Scott for Majority Leader and lost that battle, for instance. There's no guarantee Republicans will fold on issues where Musk and Dems align. Remember, Musk's influence comes from his ability to tap into and animate Trump's base. Are MAGA Republicans going to follow his beck and whim on EVs and stricter emission standards? Or will they prioritize Americans who work for the oil &amp; gas industry? Who can exert more *individual* pressure on legislators during the primary season - Musk or industry groups representing oil tycoons? Third, who the fuck knows what kind of staying power Musk has. Trump is mercurial and so are his most ardent followers and advisors. Six months from now, Musk could be Public Enemy No. 1 and his input might be next to useless. A month from now we might have a completely different Speaker - one who could be a better or worse negotiating partner than Musk.Finally, Dems have little to gain and much to lose from a cohesive Republican party. GOP chaos benefits Dems politically. If Musk being in the room makes the Republican party more efficient, then that is not a good thing. It's much better for Republicans to be tripping over themselves in intra-party knife-fights and trying to balance a multitude of interest groups in their coalition than working lockstep towards Trump's agenda.","title":"CMV: Congressional Democrats should insist on the presence of Elon Musk for any kind of legislative negotiation"},{"text":"Cenk actually thinks progressives and fascists can come to a mutual understanding.

This is actually an abstract topic that is not as cut and dry and it would first appear.We can defined equality in negative terms - what is taken from you. Or we can define it in positive terms - what is given to you. And while we may consider that the positive definition may be inherently unequal, they have their appeal also. Likewise, what is taken from you can be regarded in absolute terms, or in relative terms. If We take a loaf of bread from a rich person it is no skin of their back, but that same loaf of bread from a poor person may be yesterday's meal. The impact of the law is unequal. So how do we define equality? in terms of action or impact? in terms of giving or receiving? each decision of equality requires unequallness in all others. And I think its very clear to anybody who's reading this who's not stupid that everything i said is one big muddying of the watersexempt that it is not without utility.For instance. Do we want to give all people the ability to walk safely in all streets at all hours in all manners of dress? This requires an investment. But some neighborhoods require a bigger investment than others. Are we going to cry about the increased involvement of police in certain places? or are we going to applaud it? Here equal law requires unequal investment. And I can tell you very clearly - the poor require more investment than the rich. But if we fail to invest in them, the core of the nation will become rotten. So these are all arguments against what you may call true equality in taking. There should be some divergence. Some not taking a person's last loaf of bread, balanced by taking more of the person who isn't injured much by giving more.","title":"CMV: the \\"Fair Share\\" is Actually an Unfair Share"},{"text":"I dont believe this post is in good faith, this isnt a view to be changed.

I felt some of it went off topic so I removed it. I rather try and keep my comment short and concise instead of going off tangent.when politicians including the leader of the country push genocidal rhetoric.There hasn't been any clear genocidal rhetoric **from the leader** of the country itself, as far as I am aware. If this was the case, the ICJ court case would be much more clear cut and wouldn't need any nations making requests to the court to expand their definition. genocide its hard to make excuses for the conduct of many of its soldiers when they make posts metaphorically showing their whole ass to the public Individuals are individuals. As long as a nation is not trying to facilitate these crimes, and is actively trying to mitigate them then I am not sure what else can be expected to be asked. A war crime can be perpetrated down to the level of an individual. It is not reasonable to demand a state must not have a single crime committed by a single member of their society. All nations will have crimes committed by their individuals in a society, Israel is not unique there. What is the value of a Palestinian in comparison to the value of an Israeli? At what point do we say that the harm caused to Palestinians in vengeance towards what Hamas did is excessive?If it was nothing more than a simple numbers game then America killing more Germans and Japanese in ww2 would have been indisputably in the wrong, yet that isn't the case. And if you were to suggest military intervention against Israel as necessary, the fact that more Israelis will likely die than the opposition would not mean the opposition was operating in the wrong either. Mind you, I think the ICJ **is the official arbiter** of this, so I don't think there is a lot of relevance in you and I discussing the idiosyncratic details of international law on reddit (for various reasons) and am much more inclined to just let the ICJ do their job and follow the reasoning for their ruling. I personally think its just because many of its neighbors have grievances against Israel and thus we have more records regarding conduct vs the conduct of China against the Uighur people. Many of its nearby neighbors were the oppressors of the Mizrahi population, which now makes up the largest group of Jews in Israel. I very much dislike how often this gets brushed over because this is a rather major contention in the conflict in my honest opinion. Arguing about why the judge hasnt sentenced other people who havent been tried yet is a bad argument. Its a whataboutism. Should there be a trial for Maduro? Yes. But we arent talking about Maduro. We are talking about Netanyahu and his conduct.There has been no sentencing by any judge in regard to the ICC for any case. Israel or Venezuela. My problem is that the prosecutor has not followed the same standards and applied for arrest warrants like he did with Israel. Likewise, I believe the court has generally behaved with impropriety, especially by not abiding by their own explicitly stated conventions. But this is a bad argument.I disagree. If a court operates in a manner of rather gross impropriety, that does in fact weigh heavily on the court. A court that seeks validity and legitimacy must place the utmost caution in ensuring they do not behave with impropriety. I don't think anyone can claim the ICJ has behaved in a manner of impropriety, unlike the ICC currently.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"It's weird that a sizable group on the left are really pushing for Musk presidency.","title":"CMV: Congressional Democrats should insist on the presence of Elon Musk for any kind of legislative negotiation"},{"text":"Check out Chris Thile.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I don't think Cenk is grifting, I think he's ending a grift.

Given the fact that some countries have outright requested the ICJ expands their definition of what is considered a genocide, my guess is the case is far from a clear cut case that anyone on reddit, you or I, will be capable of knowing.I am willing to negotiate about if Israels conduct during the war counts as genocide. But again1. What is the line that needs to be crossed for what Israels doing to become Genocide 2. Even if what Israels doing doesnt count as genocide its hard to make excuses for the conduct of many of its soldiers when they make posts metaphorically showing their whole ass to the public and when politicians including the leader of the country push genocidal rhetoric. I also find it a bit hypocritical that people would suggest that Israel should halt their attack but be forced to compliance, even through bombings back to the stone age- yet when Israel fends off a rather gruesome attack and has a goal to rescue the hostages we see many of the same people go and act as if their hands are tied and that nothing can be done except perhaps asking the terrorist group nicely and that they might let the hostages go. I also find the fact that the calls for genocide were occurring while Israel still had militants actively fighting in their borders as something that has soured me on listening to some folks.How many hostages have been killed by how Israel conducted its war? Officially its three. But for all we know way more could have killed through an Israeli military policy that allows for collateral damage. Also we arent talking about Hamas soldiers. We are talking about the average Palestinian civilian and what THEIR rights are. What is the value of a Palestinian in comparison to the value of an Israeli? At what point do we say that the harm caused to Palestinians in vengeance towards what Hamas did is excessive? There is an actual case for genocide, right now, against Israel. It is being handled by the ICJ. The ICC is handling different charges. Granted, I myself have some frustrations with the ICC, given the fact that the same prosecutor has been fighting tooth and nail to overlook Venezuelas actions in the name of complementarity, yet couldnt bother to do to the same with Israel when the alleged sexual predator prosecutor decided to spontaneously and arbitrarily cancel his fact-finding trip to Israel that was promised and planned beforehand. If the guy is going to break the ICCs own conventions and standards, at least be willing to also do so for a blatant dictator at least.Again. I am willing to walk to the bridge of this not being a genocide. But this is a bad argument. If I am being accused of robbing a bank. Arguing about why the judge hasnt sentenced other people who havent been tried yet is a bad argument. Its a whataboutism. Should there be a trial for Maduro? Yes. But we arent talking about Maduro. We are talking about Netanyahu and his conduct. \\nI also find it rather objectionable that a single country can reap as many UN condemnations as the rest of the world combined, yet we seem to be oblivious to the idea that there may also possibly be some rather blatant bias and systematic persecution at play here. It definitely does seem questionable to suggest that a single country, representing significantly less than 1% of the worlds population, is somehow capable to contributing to nearly 50% of the worlds problems.Again. This is a whataboutism. Sure no system is going to be perfect because all systems are made by flawed men. But it doesnt make Israel justified in its conduct. I personally think its just because many of its neighbors have grievances against Israel and thus we have more records regarding conduct vs the conduct of China against the Uighur people. But again, its not an argument that Israel is innocent. But that the accusers have an agenda against Israel. Also, this next one is just a personal pet peeve of mind, but the hypocrisy of some of the loudest critics towards Israel does vaguely irritate me at times. Not that I dont have my own personal criticisms towards Israel, especially in regard to things like the WB, but if people are going to criticize Israels bombing campaign then I 100% expect the same people to be opposed to a bombing campaign aimed at Israel to enforce compliance. You cant criticize the very action that you yourself are going to be committing, that is absurd.I agree with you on this. But there is also the issue of Israel (the government ) creating the circumstances  that allowed an organization like Hamas to exist (even funding them to fight the PLO) and violently suppressing (what were largely) non violent protests. This isnt to excuse the terror of Hamas but that these actions didnt come out of nowhere and that whatever happens after the war, there must be change to stop this endless cycle of violence. \\n(Using your first comment since I typed all this out before you deleted it)","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"You said it not me, beyond lower_kitchen822","title":"What pre-pandemic trends do you think should be revived?"},{"text":"I'm surprised it didn't also include $5b for Ukraine and 10% for the Big Guy.?","title":"It's official: Biden signs new law, designates bald eagle as 'national bird'"},{"text":"Interesting, a lot of civil rights were conquered during WW and Cold War, when immigrants and Black people were needed by the Army, so they feel included and part of a single nation.

For crimes committed on the territory of or by nationals of states that have accepted the ICCs jurisdiction, any ICC member state can refer the situation to the court, or the prosecutor can initiate his investigation. The third avenue is through the UN Security Council (UNSC), which can refer any situation to the ICC, regardless of a states membership in or acceptance of the court. Despite a widely-supported attempt in 2014 by thirteen states on the UNSC to refer the situation of Syria to the ICC, Russia and China used their veto to prevent a UNSC referral. Furthermore, because Syria has not ratified the Rome Statute or otherwise accepted the courts jurisdiction, the prosecutor could not initiate an investigation on his initiative, and member states could not refer to crimes happening exclusively on the territory of Syria.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"Rare Biden W","title":"President Joe Biden signs defense bill, the first federal anti-LGBTQ+ bill in decades"},{"text":"Amen, and thank you!","title":"I can no longer relate to the world around me"},{"text":"rhymes with enema","title":"Sen.

We should try to avoid treating Israel like we did Serbia. But there needs to be a willingness to acknowledge  what Israel is doing, have an honest conversation about it and then do something about it. If we run out of all other options only then should an intervention be on the table. But above all else we need consistency in how we deal with bad actors.With that said my issue is more about the hypocrisy of the sub who claims to be believers of international law, democracy, rule of law, and human rightsuntil its a nation aligned with America who does violated these ideals. Suddenly there is a bunch of hand wringing about if what Israels doing counts perfectly as an act of genocide by arbitrary metrics which vary based on your own personal feelings.

[Emphasis mine]This language is copied from the Genocide Convention, though you are correct that so far, the ICC has only charged Netanyahu and Gallant with extermination.

Despite that, the broader campaigns that those incidents were part of were fought legitimately and relatively humanely. They certainly were not indicative of systemic or organized war crimes or genocidal intent.You can bring up incidents demonstrating indiscriminate behavior from Israel but the evident *pattern* of behavior, the actually important part of the equation, is clearly highly discriminant, as evidenced by demonstrated tactics and procedures, death tolls, and estimated militant to civilian casualties.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"Once a bill has been passed by both houses (and it must be identical versions with identical text) the President has 10 days (excluding Sundays) to sign or veto the bill.  If he signs it, then it becomes law.  If the President vetoes it, then it is sent back to Congress - 2/3rds of both chambers will override the President's veto.If the President does neither, then it's a little weird.  After the 10 day period, it automatically becomes law unless Congress is no longer in session, in which case it is vetoed.  Our Congress has adjourned at this point, and a new Congress will be sworn in on January 3 (the legislators who won in the Nov election) so if Biden ignored any bills sent to him by Congress, they'd be automatically vetoed at this point.It is typical for Congress to cram stuff in at the last minute like this.  In short, Congress waited to the last minute for much of these, and Biden only has 12 calendar days max to respond.Edit: adding a Congress last 2 years, matching the House terms (they are reelected even 2 years). So, each chamber of Congress just need to pass identical text sometime in that 2 year period to send it to the President, at which point he only has 10 working days to respond.  You can have it where one chamber passes a bill in Jan 2023, and the other chamber pass it in Dec 2024, and at that point Biden has his 10 days.

They work with businesses on climate change, maintain mixed healthcare systems, and worry about being competitive in the global economy. Just like the Democrats.Your argument about Democrats trying to repeal European policies makes no sense. The party platform literally calls for the same kinds of programs. The real difference is that passing major legislation in America requires 60 Senate votes, while European parliaments can do it with a simple majority.Heres the kicker, European center left parties have been losing working class voters precisely because theyve moved to the center on economic issues. When you compare actual policies instead of stereotypes, Democrats fit right in with their European counterparts.

The current median salary for a person with a masters degree is around $81,848. If we go by your own numbers on teacher salaries, we can see that teachers are making around 30% less than peers with similar levels of education, which is a massive gap. When you consider that the education in question is often quite expensive, this can make teaching a financially risky profession to enter. And how much of that is truly *necessary* or even *useful* for the job? And how many of these masters and EdD degrees are merely folks going to a diploma mill for the sake of moving up a pay-scale that teacher's unions negotiate in order to avoid any discussion of performance-based pay that most other industries have?  They all advocated for this system of giving pay incentives for having more diplomas. That's a policy choice we've made here. It can be un-made pretty easily.I'm pretty deeply opposed to meaningless credentialism. Having a degree doesn't make you a better person, not does it necessarily entitle you to a higher pay-rate. I think our students are better served without these kind of degree requirements in their teachers.  Their pay is mediocre, and their actual work hours are often very high, far outside of what their job description would suggest. The average teacher works a shocking 53 hours a week, and that number is likely a good deal higher for brand new teachers, who are developing lesson plans from scratch. Anecdotally, I know a former corporate lawyer who decided to become a history teacher. They shared that their workload as a teacher massively eclipsed what they experienced as a lawyer, to a point they were often working 5+ hours a day on weekends their first year just to keep up. And you think that other salaried professionals are not working similar hours for similar pay?  Ok, but the problem here is that low teaching pay has pushed the brightest students away from becoming teachers. Of course the highest scoring folks are going to be disincentivized, theyre going to get screwed out of tens of thousands of dollars per year by following the noble aspiration of educating a younger generation. The issue isnt that teachers are dumb, its that our broken system pushes potentially excellent teachers away from a career in education. Does primary and secondary education really need the best and the brightest? If these people could produce more value for society elsewhere, is it that bad that they're taking those roles instead of teaching? If we were talking about some members of the kitchen staff leaving for better paying jobs in the restaurant business, we wouldn't mind all that much so long as we can find someone to do their role in the school cafeteria. The children are getting fed either way. So long as there is someone who *can* and is willing to do the job at this pay rate, there isn't a problem here. By definition that means that their pay is adequate.   Risk of harm is an inherent part of the jobs payment calculation. In contrast, teaching shouldnt involve the risk of harm from anything greater than paper cuts. Sure, but this isn't directly tied to teacher pay. And I'd push back at the idea that teaching is any more hazardous than any other role that involves working with the public.  The fact that teachers need to worry about being personally endangered by violence from or between their students speaks to a profound social failing. Can you blame them for being upset?Sure. But this is far from unique to teaching. Folks who work retail have the same kind of risks with customers, for example. That's also a profound social failing in the exact same way.  Actually, its one of the core failings inherent to pure capitalism, widely known as the tragedy of the commons. As a society we all benefit from a strong education system, which is needed to train skilled workers, who in turn keep America economically competitive. Kinda? The folks receiving the education themselves (or their guardians who in theory have their best interests at heart) are the primary beneficiaries of the education. Schooling isn't a public good in the technical economic sense. Schooling is excludable in that you can prevent folks from attending if you'd like and rivalrous in that each spot in the classroom can be occupied by one student. Thus we avoid the the 'tragedy of the commons' problem here. Those who benefit can pay for it and directly receive the benefit.   As a result, teachers end up underpaid, schools go underfunded, educational attainment scores drop, and our workforce becomes less competitive with that of other nations. This is exactly the scenario where state and federal government authorities are supposed to step in. Its their job to tell everyone to suck it up, and to fund the common good of education through taxes, as this is ultimately to everyones advantage. When governments fail to do so, as weve seen recently, it creates crises for teacher recruitment, retention, and student success. Except the US pays more per pupil than just about any other major developed nation in the world for primary and secondary education. Some of the *best* funded districts are some of the worst preforming in terms of student success.","title":"CMV: Teachers in the United States are compensated enough and further complains about low pay will only alienate more taxpayers."},{"text":"Meanwhile, Trump is appointing a bunch of unqualified people he saw on Fox News.","title":"No, Kamala Harris Will Not Be the Democratic Nominee in 2028"},{"text":"I almost fell asleep while reading it.

The rate of death (about 130/day in the first three months, about 100/day over the entire war so far), which seems to have dropped off since the early days, has always been broadly comparable to the high intensity portions of the Iraq War (or, if taking the ridiculous OBR International or Lancet numbers at face value, actually substantially less deadly). Comparing the rate of death, either by total or proportion of the targeted population shows the accusations of genocide to be farcical. The Srebrenica Genocide killed its victims at a rate no less than 400/day, and possibly closer to 750. The Rwandan Genocide killed around *5,000* per day, and the Jewish Holocaust came to around 8,000 per day at its peak. In each one of these genocides, double digit percentages of the targeted populations were killed: 25% in Srebrenica, 60% in Rwanda, and two-thirds in the Jewish Holocaust. Compare this to the sub 2% rate in Gaza which is, once again, broadly comparable to the rate in Iraq and other conflicts uncontroversially considered wars rather than genocides. For that matter, in a single day, Hamas managed to massacre around 1,200 Israelis, take hostages on top of that, and decimate the populations they came across (both the kibbutz of Be'eri and the Nova music festival, among others, for instance, saw \\\\~10% of the population/attendees murdered within that day).With this sort of background, it it ludicrous to accuse Biden of hypocrisy. If Biden has previously supported ICC actions, it's probably because he thought they'd gotten it right *in those specific* *actions*. By no means does that obligate him to think they always get it right or got it right in this specific case. Regarding the case against Israel, which is on shaky grounds procedurally, legally, and factually, it would have been outrageous for Biden to come out in support of the court. In fact, international organizations or leaders ignoring their own laws or the actual facts of the matter is something Biden ought to be incredibly wary of. After all, if international law becomes more aesthetic than fact, then American presidents might find themselves in serious peril of facing warrants for entirely legal actions. The oft repeated illegality of the Iraq War, for instance, relies on entirely ignoring the resolutions the UNSC was passing regarding that matter; and yet former UN Secretary Generals are among those who should know better nevertheless repeating that lie. Allowing cases of self-defense (such as Israel in Gaza), which are allowed by international law, or UN sanctioned actions (such as Korea or Iraq) to be made equivalent to illegal wars of aggression (such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine or Hamas' genocide in Israel) is what truly makes a mockery of international law.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"Dems are like the intelligentsia of the Soviet Union.

It would therefore have behooved them to avoid any implications of impropriety or malpractice. They utterly failed in this regard. Under their own rules, the legitimacy of how they've handled this case leaves much to doubt and the process, when considered outside the strict (but, once again, doubtful) legalities seems comically at odds with the idea of justice.The ICC warrants seem not only to have incidentally ignored all principles of complementarity, but in fact seem to have been designed specifically to avoid that principle deliberately. After all, though Netanyahu and Gallant are explicitly being accused of war crimes related to the current war in Gaza (including, for instance, actions that are specifically identified as beginning in 2023 by the ICC\\"s own press release), the ICC justifies not giving Israeli authorities the chance to conduct their own investigations with the reasoning that notice was given in 2021, more than a year *before* the war started. See also the rather bizarre episode of ICC investigators canceling their arranged trip to Israel to instead announce the charges without consultation or explanation.In terms of accusations of organized war crimes or genocide against Israel, the well has been *thoroughly* poisoned by this point. Despite a well documented history of extremely discriminate targeting, even when compared against other liberal democracies, Israel is accused of being indiscriminate. Despite the mere handful of deaths alleged to have been related to starvation, Israel has nevertheless been accused of inducing a famine, not just over the past year, but over the past decade. Israel is being accused of denying food, water, and electricity as a method of siege even as Israel has, in fact, either been facilitating the supply of or supplying itself those self-same items to the quasi-state they have been at war with for the past year.","title":"Bidens ICC hypocrisy undermines international law"},{"text":"Thats mathematically impossible.

Yes, the USA has a \\"better\\" economy but that better economy is built upon exploiting workers even more and lowers the standard of the living for most. HDI ranking has Denmark at 5, Canada at 18, and USA at 20. And basically any kind of ranking by quality of live has Denmark significantly higher than the USA. Canada and USA are usually way closer.For the US itself it also won't play out favorably. If the US forcully annexes Canada or Greenland that almost certainly means war with NATO. Which is not good for the USA or anyone. It means millions of people might die. Sure after the war there might be a \\"miracle recovery\\" but if the resources spent on that war would be focused on improving the life of the citizens, everyone would be better off.Even if a war is somehow prevented, which is likely in case of annexing Panama, there would be still a shit ton of economic and political sanctions placed on the US. Which will hurt the wellbeing of american citizen more than anything they would gain from annexing Panama, Greenland, or even Canada. Especially since the USA will have to pour significant resources into that area to actually make use of it. Canadians won't just simply say \\"welp\\" and continue on with their life. At the very least there would be countless protests. Worst case scenario (for the USA) there would be a full blown resistance that sabotages US industries that open up.It also makes the US more vulnerable against other enemies.

However, I remember that CNBC reporter going off on the idea of helping distressed homeowners right after we had bailed out the banks and that really igniting the tea party fuse. As far as Trump goes, my point is premised on his policies hurting average consumers with tariffs and deportations. Trump barely accomplished anything in his first term legislatively. He talked a lot of shit and his hardcore base thought he did so much but objectively he passed a big corporate tax cut and thats about it. If he is successful and putting in across the board tariffs and mass deportations its going to cause worse inflation than we just experienced. I say this because he will almost certainly get another tax cut through and balloon the deficit. This will lead to more inflation. Its going to come down hardest in areas that have the largest proportion of people that voted for him.So, while you may not agree with my take and of course I could be wrong, Im not pulling it out of thin air.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"You really are missing the point completely. Moderates aren't dictating the party. They are not the only group Dems have to negotiate with. They have to do so with progressives too.  It's how politics works. The reason I keep pointing out why progressive ideas are unpopular is to illustrate exactly why we have to compromise. It's because progressives make up a fringe minority that struggle to get elected outside deep blue areas. If Progressives were winning the overwhelming majority of elections, you wouldn't have to do this.The problem is, their success is mostly confined to deep blue states.YOU CAN'T PASS LEGISLATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE SENATORS. That is the whole point I am making. And if your ideas are unpopular, YOU WONT WIN ELECTIONS. That is the whole reason I bring up it is unpopular. We wouldn't have had a senate majority without Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, John Fetterman, and Jon Tester. You sort of have a point with Sinema, but with a lot of these people, we would never have had dems in those seats without them. They are responsible to their constituents, not progressives living in deep blue states. They would lose re-election if they voted like Bernie.Has it not occurred to you that progressives do exactly what you accuse moderates of doing? Holding the party hostage and try to dictate what Dems do? Seriously, in every single election since 2016 the Bernie bro mob has thrown a fit because Dems don't want to risk embracing a platform that isn't even popular among themselves just to pander to people who will vote for Trump or abstain if they don't get what they want. Moderate voters have genuine concerns, they are not ideologues and can be reasoned with, and they give more votes. That's why the dems put more effort in there.Has it not occurred to you that people like Cori Bush represent a laughably small amount of people. You do not seem understand the fact that there are over 300 million people in this country, progressives are in the minority and you have to compromise when you are in the political minority. Especially when you are the minority among your party. It doesn't all revolve around you, EVERYBODY has to compromise in politics. You guys aren't special. And then what gets me is the fact you are okay with FORCING it on the rest of the party that doesn't want it, and the rest of the country. It really amazes me people don't see the problem like this.?When a party has the opportunity to institute programs that actually benefit Americans, they ought to do that and not hide behind opinion polling.That is the whole basis of their whole argument. Bernie would have won because polling shows he would have. People like M4A because a poll says 99% of Americans responded yes when asked if they want free shit. I only bring up polling in response to people using this as \\"evidence\\" your ideas are popular.Progressives are not sabotaged. They are doing the sabotaging. Cori Bush was primaried because of her filthy remarks about October 7th. She is in a deep blue district that is 80% Democrat. Her challenger was successful because of her extremism and it didn't hurt the party. It means an already democratic district has a congressperson that isn't dragging down the whole party. It would hurt the party to primary Joe Manchin with someone more progressive, lose the Senate seat, and give the whole Senate to Mitch McConnel.Do you not remember RGB's passing and the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett right before an election, the exact opposite of what the GOP claimed should happen just a few years prior?You are really out of touch with reality if you think Dems haven't been doing it too. They haven't been as bad, but they still do this. And it amazes me you don't see the problem with this. Abandoning the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court are things that would change our democratic system permanently and that will be exploited by the Republicans as soon as they get into power. This is literally how democracies die is by throwing institutional norms down the trash just to push. their own policy goals. Do Republicans do it? Yes. Will it make society better if we have two authoritarian anti-democratic populists movements competing to force their agenda on the public?No. It just means there is no democratic option to vote for, and it means that we will end up being a hybrid regime much sooner. And I find it absurd you accuse me of \\"defending behavior\\" like I should abandon any skepticism of the idiotic views progressives promote and just jump on board with zero skepticism to the largest expansion of government power in U.S. history.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are not a \\"right-wing\\" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries."},{"text":"We're just saying the same things over and over at this point.","title":"CMV: significant aspects of the Big Bang Theory are faith based."},{"text":"Since you mentioned comments about annexing Canada (which will never happen and are just typical Trumpian bluster, but let's pretend for the sake of argument this was a serious proposal), could you sketch out how my country (a first-world nation that regularly tops happiness indices, and which is consistently one of the world's 10 largest enconomies by GDP) would be improved by being forced to become part of the U.S.?","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"The maratimes and Newfoundland have long been neglected by the Canadian government.

The actual natives of the land number so few that there's no large internal squabbling in the USA. But take other countries, like in Turkey there are the Kurds. Kurds used to have their own country, but now their population is split into three countries. Turkey tries very hard to keep this setup, because the Kurds, in reality, would like to be in their own country. And the Kurd population is LARGE. It would not be unthinkable to destabilize Turkey simply by arming their Kurdish minority and helping them get their own country violently.It's difficult to do that with the USA because the natives are simply not a large enough percent of the population, nor are they centered in one area, nor are they even one people; they come from many tribes. Point being, if the USA starts conquering new areas, the new areas are not going to consider themselves American. They'll consider themselves, for instance, Mexican, under the occupation of America.This is what slowly killed empires like the Roman Empire. They had to constantly put down rebellions as the groups of conquered people often hated the Roman Empire and gladly joined rebellions. Rome was in a constant state of internal civil war.If I'm not mistaken this was a part of the logic behind the Monroe Doctrine. Everybody is better off if we remain in our groups that we actually want to be a part of while helping each other. You can see how well the USA's attempts at getting an ally in the Middle East has gone. We spent 20 years and billions of dollars trying to give Afghanistan a stable democracy and good education systems only for it to all fall apart in a week. You simply cannot force your way of life on other people long term. It has always lead to collapse in the long run.The USA may well conquer Canada and Mexico. Heck, it may conquer all of the Americas with its incredible military might. But that will just lead to a dozen different civil wars which need to be violently silenced. And all that effort on internal squabbles makes the USA weak to Russia or China. We'd slowly lose our ability to help overseas allies and fight proxy wars until we had no global hegemony at all.I mean, also, the moral implications are obvious. But even geopolitically it seems like a terrible idea.","title":"CMV: the expansion of the US is a natural result of its power and would be good for the nation."},{"text":"I disagree with your assessment of what passing his policies will do to Trump, at least somewhat because I disagree with your assessment of why 2010 was so red.I don't think 2010 was red because Obama passed his policies, especially since he failed to pass universal healthcare, the big promise of the Democratic Party. The 2010 midterm is anomolously red. Looking at the popular vote swing from the 2008 Presidential one to the SHAVE'd 2010 House one (12.34 points), it's a major outlier, only possibly matched or passed by the anti-Clinton swing in 1992-1994. A major source of complaints I heard about Democrats knowledgeable about that time was that Obama, unlike Clinton or even Biden, was just massively lazy and didn't help downballot Dems much, which combined with his ambitious platform being watered down just caused his base to completely dry up and the decently competent GOP to handle the rest.I think Trump actually *does* need to pass as much of his big planks as he can, through EO's or Congress, to do good in the 2026 midterms. His more low propensity supporters backed him because they see the nation as broken and no one doing anything, and as such want action. As long as a second Great Depression doesn't happen beneath him, no matter what he does, there's people in this country who will be satisfied to just see him doing *something*.

People had already been primed by the blundered response to Katrina and the quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan.In 2006 they picked up seats in Missouri, Montana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island, Maryland and Virginia. In 2008, democrats picked up seats in Alaska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, New Mexico, Minnesota, Colorado and again in Virginia.We are polarized for sure but enough of the electorate isnt hardcore partisan and just vote based on vibes. That can be good and bad of course as we have just seen. I think the odd part here will be how well the democrats do will likely a factor of how successful Trump is in enacting his promises but not in the way that it would seem. The red wave in 2010 was in response to how successful Obama was at enacting many of his campaign promises. In the long run it was beneficial, but people were fucking pissed. In this case, I think if Trump is successful he will send us into a deep deep recession and likely spark some major international incident.That will piss people off and can result in unpredictable results in red states. However, if he ends up failing a lot of government function will just keep puttering on and there wont be the same level of blowback.","title":"Battlegrounds, primaries and potential retirements mark the key Senate races to watch in 2026 | Democrats need to net four seats to flip the Senate in two years, a tall order with just one Republican running in a state Kamala Harris carried in November."},{"text":"I feel you brethren..
