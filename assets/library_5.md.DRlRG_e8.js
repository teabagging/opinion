That's why there's strange apparent divide between Pentagon complaining about readines vs stock number - they don't want to hand over active / hot storage units which I guess are also congressionaly mandated numbers, and activating old ones takes time = money, which they never got. For all the flak Germany got, their MIC have started a pipeline that is now steadily supplying Ukraine with short and medium range SAMs, Leo1s, Marders, MRAPS, drones, Gepards (even set up ammo line for them after Swiss went full rslur), and so on. But alone, it's not enough, and importantly lacks long range SAMs and interceptors (though they will have their own PAC production, that won't start till like '27).The irritating part is that even with all the Congress holdups, Biden had both the Ukraine Lend-Lease act (expired 30.09.2023 without ever used) and always had the Excess Defense Acts to transfer weapons (as an euro I may be missing some legal/political nuance here I give that). But they always acted too late, too slow, and never enough.I'm really clueless, and while I used to be mad at it at this point I'm just exhausted thinking about it. I really wonder what went/goes behind scenes, what kind of political games and calculations resulted in this. I think at best they decided to bleed out Russia which naturally takes time and a quick shock defeat in late '22 would have precluded that; Realistically, they try to balance aid with any potential RU countersteps (like arming Houthis) and not wishing to deal with the headache of RU collapsing; at worst they are really taking RU nuclear saber rattling seriously. Or are this incompetent and in this case, I'm unironically agreeing with the common Ukrainian opinion here : A new Dem admin would have been slow death, Trump is russian roulette, and at least you can win the latter.Suprising it may be, there's more than a handful hawkish maga guys (at least im in a large discord dominated by them) who want to see Russia lose and think Trump will be beneficial for Kyiv, so my copium at this point is trusting what they say.","title":"Biden to Leave Trump With Billions for Ukraine Weapons"},{"text":"Well, 74 million voted for harris and 77 voted for trump which is considered the majority of voters.

The nature of this position (no pay) means that the only other thing it offers is power.This really isn't true at all. If moderating a big sub were a power trip, it would be the most frustrating and dreary power trip you can imagine, and the tour operator should be sued. Most moderators are doing their job because they think the sub they are moderating is useful and engaging, and in order to remain useful and engaging *someone* has to do the work to keep it useful and engaging.But a few specific points based on my perception that you seem to have no idea what's involved in moderating a large sub with millions of people:1)  Based on evidence from this sub, a moderator is lucky if they can do a thousand actions in a month, and that's if all they do is quickly remove reported comments that clearly violate the rules. To individuals that are banned, it seems like a \\"lot of power\\", but the power to whack moles that just pop up faster than you can whack them is... not really making a huge dent in the moles, and it certainly doesn't feel \\"powerful\\". And the \\"power mods\\" that everyone complains about moderating hundreds of subs? Yeah... they aren't doing a thousand actions on all of those hundreds of subs. Their impact on any one of them is tiny. 2) About that \\"reported comments\\" bit... almost all moderating is just slogging through a giant queue of comments that users have reported. It's the least \\"powerful\\" feeling you can imagine... but it's also the reason moderation isn't itself \\"the problem\\". If, as you say, most of reddit is (center-)left, the users are naturally going to *report* comments that violate their perception of the rules more often if the comment is conservative (or very leftist). Even with mythical moderators that were 100% unbiased, you'd *still* see the effect you're claiming. And frankly, most of them don't have time to be excessively biased. 3) And about that \\"slogging through the queue\\". All the moderators see in the queue is the actual reported comment, not its context. Things that seem to users like they are completely reasonable in context look *way* different when you're trying to do thousands of actions without that context. 4) The automoderation tools that help moderators keep on top of actual rule violations beyond user reports are crude at best. If reddit ever starts using AI to do moderation actions... well... that has some dystopian overtones, but it's about the only thing that could fix #2 &amp; #3. But be careful what you ask for, you might get it. and finally:5) Being a moderator is a great way to get frequently harrassed and be accused of bias by everyone, in every direction you can possibly imagine. This is one of those kinds of \\"power\\" that is analogous to a woman's \\"power\\" to get a ton of unwanted attention walking around the streets. You can only be accused of being a communist *and* a fascist for the *same* moderation actions so many times before you just have to laugh, albeit with a lot of black humor.","title":"CMV: Reddit has a moderator problem"},{"text":"Could be the eye patch","title":"Rep.

For your follow up question, I think Trump is pushing the idea of tariffs because he can pick winners and losers in a global economic system. Its consistent with Art of the Deal - create a certain amount of chaos and then leverage that crisis. The jaundiced view is that the way he will negotiate out of that crisis will be whatever is financially best for Trump and his inner circle. The more optimistic view is that he will leverage the crisis to put America in a better position to be more competitive among the players in the great power competition. Both exist. The personal and inner circle financial interests and the great power competition.  They arent necessarily mutually exclusive.   But this is to my mind about creating a crisis, whether his supporters know it or not, and time will tell whether he puts country first. Given the relative weakness in the Democratic Party, that hasnt found an effective rebuttal against this stuff, the Republican Party can probably get away with it either way.

As President he always seemed so content to bilk the taxpayer by charging Secret Service to stay at Mar-a-Largo or something insignificant. Compare that with someone like Nixon, who if he intended would have screwed the US taxpayer out of hundreds of billions.  The optimistic case is that he basically carries on like this in his second term. He spends most of his time golfing, letting his appointees mismanage the country in the way that orthodox Republicans do; letting companies put more shit in the water and blowing up the deficit with unfunded tax cuts. He uses tariffs as blackmail for personal enrichment and the illusion of bossing people around, but ultimately he doesn't knock the strong economy he inherits off course.

From the first: Such as this one on the r/ medicine Subreddit. He got deleted for asking questions. A person said Trumps NIH nomination caused large scale needless death. When he was asked what the large scale death in question was, his comment was deleted by the mods.If his only question was What were the large-scale deaths he contributed to? with otherwise total neutrality, well that question isnt political. A left-wing moderator wouldnt automatically know his political leanings. For it to have seemed to be a politically-motivated deletion, the question must have also included political charge not conveyed in your example- though not necessarily in that specific comment. It may have been, for example, that they were [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning) over several comments, which the mods had brought to their attention in reports, but which you did notNonetheless, the right doesnt have a good track record regarding Covid misinformation, and is seems likely he was banned from a medical subreddit for medical misinformation, which does not seem politically motivatedMore pertinently, however, the other example you gave was:Along with a person being perm banned for saying orange man bad. Laugh at joke. Unga Bunga in r/ comics.This is literally a person engaging in low-effort trolling- that it was politically-geared shouldnt mean anything. It should be about as noteworthy as banning anyone else for trollingAnd lastly, the example you gave from r/pics was: The most notable case of moderation abuse is from r/ pics, where they just ban you for participating in a bad faith Subreddit. Even if you just commented.While this is true, their rules state that they ban those who participate in some fairly reasonable subs: brigade-organizing subs, racist subs, that sorta deal. While exactly *what* subs are considered racist or centered around Covid-denial or something may be very subjective and therefore subject to political bias, he ultimately goal of keeping that stuff off their subreddit is normal. If its political- because combatting racism is certainly political- its basically the least political way you can be political. Like, based on what youve pointed out and their own rule page, theyre not going after right-wingers in general- theyre not coming after you because of your views on government spending and taxation law- theyre going after racismAnd, again, that may be done in a political way, but you didnt give any specific examples of that, and Im not gonna step on your toes by putting words in your mouth trying to argue them for youAnd you can certainly question the efficacy of banning people who have merely participated in such subs without concern as to exactly *how* they did- say, by telling off Nazis in a Nazi subreddit- thats ultimately a problem of pragmatism, not politicsCoupled with: Unfortunately, due to a lot of Reddit mods and Redditors in general being left-wing, there are a lot of examples of right-wingers being the victims.Im left under the impression you may have a bit of a bias you may wish to account for. That doesnt mean your perceptions are invalid- far from it! The law of large numbers all but guarantees you see it here and there so long as you spend an appreciable time on RedditIndeed, this aint a binary system where mods either have political bias or they dont, after all. Rather, its a boundless spectrum: theres always room for improvement in any individual mod, and it could always be worseTheres almost *certainly* a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) of *degree* of moderator bias stretching from a few very good moderators, to a lot of moderators with an average degree of political bias, to a few very bad political moderators. And theres likely to be a second normal distribution for any particular percentile of that group describing the political leanings of those moderators, with a buncha moderators of average political slant, and a very few radicals to either side. This probably holds true for all mods of a given percentile, including the few ones most capable of suppressing their political biasesBut to get back from that tangent, nonetheless, your own rightward political leanings may prime you to perceive any bias against the right much more readily than towards the left (or towards non-political individuals). Given your examples included a troll and you dont seem to have noticed any political sentiment in the guy asking what you related as a non-political question, this seems likely to meAgain, that doesnt mean your perceptions should be disregarded out of hand, merely that- like I mentioned before- theres always room for improvement no matter how on top of your political biases you may be, and I think you may have identified some ways right here","title":"CMV: Reddit has a moderator problem"},{"text":"The call is coming from inside the house.","title":"Deportations, lawsuits, increased scrutiny: How the Trump administration could handle campus antisemitism"},{"text":"Mass deportation = human rights violationjust in case that was not clear.

Meanwhile, stating even milquetoast, basic GOP positions are liable to get you warnings, if not bans. If Reddit were still the size of a bunch of IRC channels, or random forums in one spot, that would be one thing. But it's not... it's the self-described \\"front page of the internet\\" for some, and has the ability to drive discussion. And at one point it leaned toward open debate and let issues hang out there. But individual subreddits ended up engaging in a sort of \\"silent purge\\" that not everyone visiting here realizes, because those banned or silenced don't really have a way of publicizing that fact. The best you can do is create another sub-reddit on a similar topic (like a good old channel war on IRC), but it's difficult to publicize that very well. What you end up with are complete and total echo chambers. That's fine (I guess) if we're talking about r/NPR , but I think it's less fine with local city resources and things that should really be unrelated to politics directly.Something else to keep in mind is that those who aren't banned are much less likely to speak up about things, because they can see people with a position they have getting downvoted into oblivion, and/or mysteriously disappear.

They had the capability (authority and logistic) to send long range munitions that would have put real pressure on Russia more than a year before  they actually did and they could have authorized long range strikes, a year and a half before they did. They slow walked other equipment too, but that is the clearest example. And they repeatedly said the reason they weren't allowing long range strikes was so as to avoid escalation. If you want to argue that it was reasonable, then go ahead. Maybe you think that giving Ukraine a decent chance of victory (not just survival but actually taking back their territory) would have caused a 5% chance of nuclear war, and that risk is unacceptable. But you can't claim that the administration did everything they could when even they acknowledge that they did not.One more thing, wanting a military stalemate is not the same thing as wanting the status quo forever. I suspect that the administration thought that a military stalemate plus mounting economic pressure from sanctions would have been enough to get Russia to back down and agree to some sort of ceasefire in exchange for giving back some territory and that Ukraine might agree to it.

Psychologically speaking shes talking about the arrogance in that people think theyre right without stopping to look at facts or well reality in this case. This comes from a lack of world knowledge. This isnt all Americans though she generalizes it. For the people that said people are old and didnt change their vote or still voted for trump. Im curious to know why? Did you think a self-serving Trump, was really going to help you? You said you dont want change, but youre voting for horrific change. Its contradictory. Lets say you dont want change per se. So, deporting immigrants is a change. Is that going to help you on your daily life? Are you regularly threatened by immigrants or drug dealers? Probably not. So, you dont want change. Wanting abortions banned is a change. Does that change benefit you personally in the long run? Are you as an old person planning to get an abortion in your old age? Probably not. Does changing the state of the educational system impact you? You planning to go to college again in your old again? Im guessing not. Assuming you dont want change, Trump imposing tariffs on goods is a change that will impact the affordability of goods in America. For the people who said they didnt want to change out of laziness or old age. You voted for a lot of changes to our current system. Making America Great Again, the slogan sounds great. But what it sounds like its tons of racist, sexist, and unconstitutional masked by a glorious idea. We all want America to be great. But making it great again implies that at a certain point it was. Thats an opinion from someone who thinks America would be America without immigrants, and womens rights, and an economy that functions. All of the things Trump is proposing with cripple all of these things. We are not only not making America great but we are making it WAY WORSE. I think Stones ideas are speaking toward Americans who voted for an idea that maybe sounds good, but the means and way to get there are absolutely f*cked. Sh*t I want America to be great but kicking people out who formed this nation is not the answer. Also, its funny. For all the people that want an abortion ban. So by your logic abortions even medically necessary ones are bad. Ok so why do you care if you think democrats are getting them. One less democrat right? Because obviously republicans voting for Trump arent getting them. So whats it to you? Youre obviously not going to get one whether youre a person who cant physically get an abortion or whether you dont believe in it. Good for you All that to say, people are taking Sharon Stomes comment too literally. Some people are arrogant but thats not everyone. Not all Americans voted for Trump. Not all people are uninformed. Not everyone. And some people got sold on an idea that realistically doesnt plan out with our government system.Who cares what Sharon Stone thinks. At the end of the day, all that matters is that you are surviving to live another day, and that youre constantly trying to learn grow, and challenge your beliefs. I can see why people voted for Trump, but I also know that many people are struggling and want change. Albeit any change at all. Life is hard but people appeared to not realize the implications of another Trump presidency. And if you did, then you know you voted to raise prices. You voted to take away womens rights. You voted to divide the country. You voted for racist ideas. If you knew, thats a choice you have to live with.","title":"Sharon Stone Says America Is Naive and Ignorant and Arrogant After Donald Trump Win: My Country Is in the Midst of Adolescence"},{"text":"Elon Musk is a douche.

Keep in mind that you have a fulltime job, and other responsibilities in life. This moderator thing is, technically, a hobby for you, because it's something you do in your free time that you aren't getting paid for.Now, the subreddit you moderate is quite large. That means hundreds, or thousands, of reports coming in, probably your own Automod is flagging hundreds of items for you to look at, dozens to hundreds of people messaging you with questions, complaints, abuse, requests, etc. Your inbox is a never-ending list of shit to do.Now, try to imagine this: how much time and attention could you allocate for one specific issue? What about the one after that? Day in, day out, what do you think will be the average amount of time/attention/effort you can spare on any individual item, knowing there are hundreds or thousands more waiting for you to deal with?In your post, you mentioned that \\"this is Reddit offloading its moderation responsibilities\\". You are 100% right. Online moderation is a difficult job, even when you're actually being paid for it. It's easy to mess up, in any number of ways. And the result of messing up is, you've caused an unfair outcome for someone. And you probably cause dozens to hundreds of these per month at a *minimum*, because how much time do you really have to evaluate each issue with *perfect* fairness and nuance?As a moderator, it's *easy* to just say \\"hey automod. remove comments from any user who was active in one of these subreddits\\". It saves you time. The alternative is an incredible amount of more work for you.And I say this as someone who has, unfortunately, had multiple instances of joining a cool new subreddit, and getting all my comments removed because one of the subreddits I commented in one time turned out to be a Bad Subreddit. It sucks. But at the end of the day, the issue is not with the moderators, it is with the structure of this whole system. It does not scale. And because moderation *has* to have a human element (yes, it really, *really* does), I don't see how it *can* scale, unless more people start becoming moderators.

What he didn't want is virtue signaling which is all that Biden was willing to give in the months leading up to the invasion.Let's see what actual reportage says about the state of mind of the various major players:Were going to link you up with our intelligence people, Blinken said. Theyll give you chapter and verse about what we know and what we dont know. But I wanted you to hear it from me on behalf of the president. This is what were concerned about and what were seeing happen. **Zelensky was skeptical.**_______Austin met with Ukraines defense minister Oleksii Reznikov in Washington to go over the latest Russian troop movements along Ukraines borders. **Just like Zelensky, Reznikov was dubious that Russia would actually invade**. Putin, he reminded Austin, had sent the same number of troops to their border in the spring. And what did Putin get? Reznikov said. He got two phone calls with Biden and a personal meeting in Geneva. The Ukrainian defense minister was convinced Putin was merely trying to get more attention and concessions from Biden and NATO._________Thank you for your information, Zelensky said. But **please stop going out publicly and saying this because its hurting my economy.**__________ Zelensky remained doubtful that Russia could be planning a full takeover of a country of 44 million people. The U.S. was focused in on the most aggressive and least likely option, Zelensky said. **European leaders had told him the American forecasts were exaggerated and that Putin had insisted in private conversations with them and publicly that he wasnt invading.**______**What can I do for you? How can I be of help? Biden asked Zelensky. Gather the leaders of the world, Zelensky said. Ask them to support Ukraine.** Sullivan and Finer, who were listening in, could tell Zelensky was frightened. The Ukrainian presidents usual cowboy rhetoric on phone calls with Biden was gone.____________The only thing they differed on in this early hours was Zelensky wanted a no-fly zone, which Biden declined.- From Woodward's _War_, mainly Chapter 26 and environs.And that's the short version.

If what the republicans are doing is consistently getting them marginal victories - which it is - it's more rational to stick with that than to try and get a bigger margin. That risks losing their voter base if it fails, and doesn't give them anything better than they currently have if it succeeds. So why bother?The way to change this is to change the voting system but, under the current voting system, yes. Any votes past 51% are irrelevant and it's far easier to get a marginal victory than a landslide, so that's what both parties are aiming for.

These self-commissions often coincide with significant and sometimes controversial actions during their tenures. Below is an examination of several such leaders, detailing the statues they commissioned and notable acts associated with their rule:1. Augustus (63 BCE C 14 CE)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: As the first Roman emperor, Augustus extensively utilized portraiture and sculpture to propagate his image across the Roman Empire. He commissioned numerous statues portraying himself in idealized forms, such as the famous Augustus of Prima Porta, which depicts him as a youthful and divine leader.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Augustus established the Pax Romana, a period of relative peace and stability across the empire. He reformed the Roman tax system, developed networks of roads, and initiated major building projects, including the Forum of Augustus. His reign transformed Rome from a republic to an imperial power.2. Louis XIV of France (1638C1715)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: Known as the Sun King, Louis XIV commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s to be placed in Paris and various provincial towns, serving as physical manifestations of his rule. ?\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Louis XIV centralized power, epitomizing absolute monarchy. He revoked the Edict of Nantes, leading to the persecution of Huguenots, and engaged in multiple wars, such as the War of Spanish Succession, which strained Frances resources. His extravagant spending on the Palace of Versailles exemplified his reigns opulence.3. Joseph Stalin (1878C1953)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: During his rule, Stalin orchestrated the erection of numerous statues and portraits of himself throughout the Soviet Union, reinforcing his cult of personality. These statues depicted him as the embodiment of Soviet strength and unity.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Stalins tenure was marked by rapid industrialization and collectivization, leading to significant economic changes but also causing widespread famine. He conducted the Great Purge, resulting in the execution and imprisonment of millions. His leadership during World War II was pivotal in the defeat of Nazi Germany, but his regime was also characterized by severe repression.4. Saddam Hussein (1937C2006)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: As Iraqs president, Hussein commissioned numerous statues and portraits of himself, prominently displayed across the country to assert his dominance. One notable example was the statue in Baghdads Firdos Square, famously toppled in 2003. ?\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Hussein led Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War and the invasion of Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf War. His regime was notorious for human rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish populations. He maintained power through oppressive measures and was deposed following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.5. Kim Il-sung (1912C1994)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: The founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, commissioned grand monuments, including the massive bronze statue at the Mansu Hill Grand Monument in Pyongyang, to immortalize his leadership.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Kim Il-sung established a totalitarian regime characterized by strict state control and the suppression of dissent. He initiated the Korean War by invading South Korea in 1950, leading to a protracted conflict. His policies isolated North Korea and created a pervasive cult of personality.6. Muammar Gaddafi (1942C2011)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, commissioned various statues and portraits of himself, often portraying revolutionary themes. These were displayed in public spaces to reinforce his authority.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Gaddafis rule was marked by the implementation of his political philosophy outlined in the Green Book, leading to the establishment of a unique form of governance. His regime was implicated in international terrorism, including the Lockerbie bombing. Domestically, he suppressed political opposition and was eventually overthrown during the Libyan Civil War in 2011.7. Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov) (1940C2006)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: Niyazov, self-declared Turkmenbashi (Leader of the Turkmen), commissioned numerous golden statues of himself, including a rotating golden statue in Ashgabat that always faced the sun.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: His presidency was characterized by authoritarian rule and an extensive cult of personality. He renamed months of the calendar after himself and his family and implemented eccentric policies, such as banning opera and ballet. His governance isolated Turkmenistan and curtailed freedoms.8. Daniel Ortega (1945CPresent)\\n\\t?\\tStatues Commissioned: As Nicaraguas president, Ortega has overseen the installation of large metal silhouettes of himself and other revolutionary figures throughout Managua, symbolizing his enduring influence.\\n\\t?\\tNotable Acts: Ortegas tenure has seen allegations of electoral fraud, suppression of political opposition, and human rights abuses. His administration has been criticized for undermining democratic institutions and restricting press freedom.The commissioning of self-statues by these leaders often coincided with efforts to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and promote a specific ideological narrative. While intended to immortalize their legacies, such actions frequently accompanied controversial and oppressive policies, leading to complex historical assessments of their tenures.","title":"Majestic Trump Statue Under Construction, Will Debut on Inauguration Day"},{"text":"I live in a deep blue state. Over the past 3+ years many of my older neighbors and family have become addicted to Fox news, the younger men are Rogan fans. If you have ever watched Fox news with an open mind, you laugh, because it is just so ridiculous. But, the avid watchers are brain washed. It is propaganda at its finest.  I haven't watched Rogan very often, but he seems less a journalist than a talk show host. But he is revered by many. A real man's man. On the flip side, MSNBC and the \\"woke\\" agenda really pisses off the white hetro population with concepts such as, defund the police, boys playing on girls sports, affirmative action etc... and this is manipulated by Fox and friends. Also, we can't forget about the economy. Even though it is improving and its not just an American phenomenon, most don't bother trying to understand the basics. They worry about their own self interests. In fact many of my right wing neighbors think the president is responsible for their high grocery and gas prices, high rent and impossible dreams of home ownership.  This is obviously capitalism and the wealthy make up the rules. But most think of the rich as just smart people who deserve their riches.

She even reiterated that Mexico does not support closing borders, undermining Trumps framing.2) Semantics Dont Excuse Misrepresentation:You argue that Trump didn't literally say Mexico agreed to \\"close the border\\" but to \\"stop migration.\\" However, Sheinbaum's clarification that caravans are already being addressed and not reaching the U.S. border shows that no new commitment was made during the call.Whether you interpret effectively as a softer claim or not, Trumps choice of words clearly exaggerated the outcome of the conversation to make it appear as a major agreement when no such change occurred.3) Irrelevance of Migration Statistics:Bringing up the 60,000 border encounters vs. 250,000 last year is interesting for broader migration policy discussions but doesnt prove Trumps claim about the call. Those numbers reflect an ongoing trend rather than anything specific to this alleged agreement.The core issue here is not whether migration is being addressed effectively but whether Trump misrepresented the call's outcome, which Sheinbaum directly disputed.4) A Pattern of Exaggeration:This isnt an isolated case. Trump has a history of inflating outcomes to claim victories, even when agreements or results are minimal or non-existent. This tendency lends credibility to those who view his statement as misleading in this instance as well.Its not 'Reddit being unfair to Trump.' Its holding him accountable for presenting a misleading version of events.

He ended the Glass-Steagall act which directly lead to the 2008 financial crisis with millions of Americans losing their jobs, suffering bankruptcies, and evictions when their homes foreclosed. Bill also signed NAFTA which destroyed the middle class in this country. Unions couldn't compete with cheaper labor in Mexico or China and lost bargaining power for benefits and jobs. People remember when a good union job in a factory meant they could afford a middle class house, trade in their truck every couple years for a new one, send their kids to college and afford the tuition, they had sick days, go on vacation with the family a week or two each summer, the entire family had fantastic health insurance, and when he retired, the company had a generous pension. People weren't rich, but they didn't have to work two or three jobs to get by or stress about money. My students today can't even imagine a time like this, but the older generation remembers. I don't think it's not an accident that the swing states are the rust belt states. They voted for Bush thinking their lives would improve. It didn't. They voted for Obama's hope &amp; change. Obama didn't bring back the good, union manufacturing jobs. So they voted for Trump who \\"told it like it is\\" that the middle class got hosed.

Dr. Oz is a big supporter of Medicare Advantage C an alternative Medicare plan run by private insurance companies that contract with Medicare.Though Dr. Ozs financial disclosure form does not provide an exact investment number, he holds anywhere from $280,000 to $880,000 worth of stake in UnitedHealth Group.He also listed family stocks that included a $2.4 million investment in Amazon - which operates an online pharmacy.In total, Dr. Oz holds tens of millions of dollars worth of investments in healthcare, pharmaceutical and tech companies C all of which could benefit or hinder policies laid out or implemented by CMS.Dr. Oz has holdings in Johnson&amp;Johnson and Bristol-Meyers Squibb.

Really interesting read. Leaving an highlight down here. The arrangement that perhaps comes closest to being justified [...] at least for primary and secondary education  is a mixed one under which governments would continue to administer some schools but parents who chose to send their children to other schools would be paid a sum equal to the estimated cost of educating a child in a government school, provided that at least this sum was spent on education in an approved school. This arrangement would meet the valid features of the natural monopoly argument, while at the same time it would permit competition to develop where it could. It would meet the just complaints of parents that if they send their children to private nonsubsidized schools they are required to pay twice for education  once in the form of general taxes and once directly  and in this way stimulate the development and improvement of such schools. The interjection of competition would do much to promote a healthy variety of schools. It would do much, also, to introduce flexibility into school systems. Not least of its benefits would be to make the salaries of school teachers responsive to market forces. It would thereby give governmental educational authorities an independent standard against which to judge salary scales and promote a more rapid adjustment to changes in conditions of demand or supply.The adoption of such arrangements would make for more effective competition among various types of schools and for a more efficient utilization of their resources. It would eliminate the pressure for direct government assistance to private colleges and universities and thus preserve their full independence and diversity at the same time that it enabled them to grow relatively to State institutions. It might also have the ancillary advantage of causing a closer scrutiny of the purposes for which subsidies are granted. The subsidization of institutions rather than of people has led to an indiscriminate subsidization of whatever activities it is appropriate for such institutions to undertake, rather than of the activities it is appropriate for the state to subsidize. Even cursory examination suggests that while the two classes of activities overlap, they are far from identical.","title":"Republicans push plans to dramatically expand education vouchers  despite voter resistance."},{"text":"Annoyed","title":"How do you feel about Trump winning election?"},{"text":"((Sheinbaum)) everysingletime","title":"Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has agreed to close the Southern Border by stopping migrant caravans after Trump threatened her with 25% tariffs."},{"text":"This should be voted higher.","title":"First Buddy Elon Musk accuses Trump impeachment witness of treason and calls for appropriate penalty"},{"text":"The media was cutting up interviews to make Harris look coherent, but an autist on shitter is the problem.?","title":"CMV: money in politics will lead to a new age techno-feudalism in the US"},{"text":"Idiot companies like **Skydio** can suck a lemon.

The victims were predominantly male (62.8 percent) and children under the age of 14 (66.7 percent). In 80 percent of cases, the sexual abuse involved bodily contact.Another study of French Catholic priests found systemic sexual abuse that had been carried out by almost 3,000 priests and members of the clergy since 1950.

If the median voter wanted to force God into the public school curriculum, he could have done so decades ago when the majority was actually Christian. Now that the median voter is at most vaguely Christian, doesn't attend church, you're worried that he'll achieve this with... school vouchers??\\nSchool vouchers are the **worst** method imaginable for achieving theocratic control. School vouchers have no curriculum requirements attached, they just go to whatever parents want. The only way for them to result in an environment with only Christian content is if that's what the vast majority of consumers want, far more than the 50% needed to set the curriculum in a democratic system.\\nI don't think this is the concern though. I think the objectors hate the idea that **any** parents will have the option to send their kids to a school with **any** amount of Christian branding. This strikes me as deeply illiberal. If some people want a somewhat Christian education for their children, who are we to say that's worse than a Jewish education, an Islamic education, or a woke education?

Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You dont want to act, or even talk alone; you dont want to go out of your way to make trouble. Why not?Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty. Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, everyone is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, Its not so bad or Youre seeing things or Youre an alarmist. And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you cant prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you dont know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have. But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent toto what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait. But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. Thats the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shockedif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in 43 had come immediately after the German Firm stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in 33. But of course this isnt the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D. And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying Jewish swine, collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live inyour nation, your peopleis not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way. Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you havent done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late.
