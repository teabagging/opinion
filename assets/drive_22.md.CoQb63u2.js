There are few people in the world I would trust more to develop a model for something this important than Andrew Gelman.Edit: someone claimed I was making an argument from authority. I want to make clear, you shouldnt trust his model because hes famous. I mean, its not like he actually is. Have you ever heard of him? Probably not. Hes well known and well respected in the field of statistics. You should trust his model because hes one of the foremost eminent scholars in the field. He literally helped develop the methodological and theoretical foundation for what Bayesian methods are today. He understands the intricacies and working of these models at the most fundamental level better than almost anyone in the world. Were at a point in society where anyone with a computer and a little time can feed numbers into software, create a model, and give you probability estimates. There are a ton of data scientists out there who have no business doing data science. Underlying statistics/data science/machine learning is a whole lot of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. The way these models are set up, defined, and tuned can have fairly substantial implications on their downstream results. My point is, Andrew Gelman has the background and expertise to understand all this better than almost anyone. Im not claiming any specific other model is necessarily wrong. In fact, Nate Silvers model is actually based on the same principles of Bayesian statistics, and is seemingly fairly well developed. I trust Silvers modeling approach second to Gelmans, which largely agree. But what Im saying is that of all the models out there, Gelmans model in the economist is what I trust most because he is one of the most qualified people, if not *the* most qualified, person in the world to develop a Bayesian forecast model.","title":"Kamala Harris' Chances Surge in Major Election Forecast"},{"text":"Gd, I wish I could have been in the crowd and seen their faces and heard the jeers.

I don't think matter displaces space, I think it compresses it., or consumes it. In the immediate area. Matter exists only in space. Space allows for our three-dimensional existence. The attenuation of the compression in space from the center point of the large mass of matter causes other matter to push inward towards the center of the mass. For some reason matter seems to move away from where it's easy to exist to where it's hard to exist. It's harder to exist where most of the space is \\"used.\\" Yet for some reason, matter has an affinity of moving in that direction. Away from easy existence. Is it perhaps that when space has less of a power to support existence that it creates some sort of vacuum that is looking to absorb everything? As if perhaps space is filling some other void in the universe, and when it becomes weak by supporting the existence of a large mass, like a planet, there is this inward push towards a void that needs to be filled. But space is best at filling it.","title":"What is an example of gravity being proven while it disproves density theory?"},{"text":"Same!","title":"A Bala Cynwyd woman got a fake letter notifying her shed have to house migrants under a nonexistent Biden-Harris program"},{"text":"Aren't Atlas like...based in Peru or something?

As was the case in Darfur at that time, there have been substantiated reports of summary executions of men and boys, and Masalit women being subjected to horrific gender-based violence including sexual slavery and rape.The UAE is far from the only outside power intervening in the 18-month-old war, which pits Mr. Dagalos RSF against whats left of the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, commanded by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Indeed, as has unfortunately been the case for many of Africas internal wars throughout history, this one has morphed into a proxy fight among geopolitical rivals. The UAEs long-standing Middle East rival, Iran, backs Mr. al-Burhan; it has supplied drones to the SAF that helped it retake territory from the RSF. Russia formerly backed the RSF but now supports Mr. al-Burhan. Moscow and Tehran both covet future access to Sudans strategically important ports along its 530-mile Red Sea coastline  as does the UAE.The United States, too, seems to see Sudan through the prism of geopolitics. Aligning with the UAE as a moderate Arab state might make sense in a broader strategic context; that country can serve as a regional counterweight to Iran, and the UAE is being eyed for a future role in rebuilding war-torn Gaza. The UAEs role in Sudan makes it Russias enemy, too. Hence the implicit tension between Mr. Bidens warm words for the UAEs president in Washington and the valedictory speech he delivered to the United Nations the next day. The world needs to stop arming the generals, the president said, to speak with one voice and tell them: Stop tearing your country apart.For now, at least, this is the administrations position: to decry the human cost of Sudans war in general terms, while pursuing closer ties to the UAE, without demanding a clear public commitment that the UAE stop supporting a faction responsible for some of the conflicts worst atrocities.

So if Hezbollah is weakened to the point of paralysis or goaded into using those weapons while the US Aircraft carriers are nearby to help in the Israeli defense then the detterent will be wasted and the IAF can strike Iran directly and knock out it's nuclear and drone programs.  Also if Iran were to be goaded into seriously attacking Israel directly then the US would have the excuse to attack Iran directly and hit those same targets.In short its all about exposing Iran's nuclear and drone programs to attack because that will weaken Iran as a regional power and also shut off a large source of Russian weapons in Ukraine.

You seem to be in the know about thatOnce he had his stroke in Las Vegas they quickly mobilized to remove him as the candidate. Stroke in Las Vegas? Joe Biden? Obviously thats going to require a source because that sounds like typical Reddit speculation based on facts pushed by Kremlin trolls to turn a Covid infection into a stroke. Idt its asking too much that conspiracy theorist go back to including a motive with at least some basis in logic, its like theyve become too lazy to bother and people just accept the subpar conspiracy theories because people accept those. You really should demand a higher quality. A motive should answer the question why? without it having to be asked. Example: Why lie that it was a covid infection instead of a stroke? If the DNC wanted to remove him as the presumptive nominee, itd be weird to hide that he had a stroke instead of hoping hed voluntarily drop out of the race. Taking over as president if necessary is the whole purpose of the VP role (even though people are currently pretending the VP has the same power and authority as the president or any constitutional powers in the executive branch.) Its well past the point in the term for that to prevent Harris from being elected as President twice. Considering Biden endorsed Harris right away, itd actually make more sense to claim a Covid infection was a stroke to give her the benefit of being referred to as Madam President and President Harris to get people used to hearing and saying that.

I get it, your conspiracy theory is dependent on ignoring that the unusual part is why a June debate was an option.  Debates are usually held after party conventions. This time the one party had an incumbent and the party forced all the other candidates out of the race to prevent primary voters from disrupting the mirage being created that Republicans want the guy that lost the last election to be their nominee. New Hampshire GOP primary voters were able to make it clear. because they planned to trot out the un-juiced old man Biden so they could social engineer public sentiment to demand a new candidate. It was always about updating the old its just a stutter programming.The timing of the first debate may seem more relevant if there is a misconception about who they are. Biden pushed for that debate to trot himself out un-juiced so he could social engineer..Biden pushed for it and CNN sent both presumptive nominees an invitation. You werent paying attention if you think calls for Biden to step down didnt start until after the debate.

Trump didnt magically disappear into the shadows after 2020.In order for that to be accurate you have to ignore that Trump left office with his lowest approval rating and highest disapproval rating from his 4 years in office along with the fact that candidates he endorsed in the midterm primaries did well in those races but underperformed in the general election (general election voters were rejecting MAGA Republicans-election deniers). You also have to disregard the fact that DeSantis was the front runner even before announcing he was running in the GOP primary for this election. Trump had already announced he was running, but the guy that hadnt made it official yet was polling ahead of him and that continued into the first part of the race. There were also polls with Biden vs each GOP candidate, people chose DeSantis, not Trump, as the candidate that could beat Biden. Why do you think FoxNews was boosting DeSantiss support by giving him airtime and reporting on whatever he was doing in FL without giving Trump much attention at all? Trump didnt move ahead of DeSantis until spring of 2023 and it took months for there to be a wide enough margin that indicated Trump would likely be the nominee. That was a little over a year ago. Those of us who have been paying attention to more than just headlines and reddit fearmongering Thats so far from the truth it made me LMAO. Thank you! knew that the DNC changed their bylaws in January so that any delegates won in the primaries/caucus would default to DNC candidate. Not Joe. Not Kamala. Not anyone with a name. Do you have any sources to support that claim? I havent seen headlines or read any Reddit fearmongering about that. This is the reason why RFK was forced to reregister as independent despite having real grassroots support among democrats.Let me make sure I understand correctly. RFK Jr dropped out of the race and the party in *Oct of 2023* because the DNC changed their bylaws in *January of 2024*? Are you sure it didnt have anything to do with the fact that he was not going to be able to gain enough support to have a chance at winning the Democratic nomination? Or that RFK Jr switching to an independent candidate had nothing to do with the fact that more than half the donations to the SuperPAC supporting him came from Republican donor Timothy Mellon as a $5 million dollar campaign donation not long before he announced he was running as an independent? I dont consider Republican donors grassroots democrats but I guess you can label them as whatever you want.RFK Jr knew his role was to be the Ross Perot of 2024 but to sway left leaning voters, not right leaning like Perot did. He dropped out and endorsed Trump because he was proving to be more popular with right leaning voters than left leaning, it was a 2:1 ratio in some of the swing states. Thats why he went from focusing on trying to be included on the ballots in every state to trying to be removed from the ballots in swing states.","title":"If the Democrats aren't actually scared of a Trump presidency, why should we be afraid of a Trump presidency?"},{"text":"I never said there isnt any subjective experience to music.

And then try to figure out how to explain to someone else why that music moves you and why it connects to you. You end up saying as much (or more) about who you are than what the music is.","title":"CMV: Music is objective."},{"text":"Palestine is still being illegally occupied by Israel.

Famously, the Israeli invasion and attempted annexation of Lebanon in the 80s was so horrific and led to so much civilian death and destruction that even hawkish Ronald Reagan expressed dissatisfaction of it.There is a mountain of evidence showing clearly that what Israel is doing is horrific, and intentionally so. Does the fact that they let women vote and tolerate homosexuality excuse this?I guess that's just a matter of personal opinion at the end of the day. I don't think it does.

If we were to imagine AI would have produced some of the songs made popular by bands during the last century, chances are high that these would not be regarded as good songs if they had been released today. I would also argue that it is impossible for us to discuss a piece of music without looking at it in the cultural context in which it was created.Second, while there are certainly elements of music that can be objectively good or bad, like the musicianship, rhythmic variation and complexity, or harmonic and melodic complexity, in my opinion, this does not mean that the music itself is objectively good. Imagine again if we were to let AI produce music which exhibits all the elements above, the musicianship or complexities would no longer matter to us.Third, I read somewhere that it has been proven that cultures respond to certain musical elements in similar ways even without being exposed to certain ideas before, like say major keys sound happy, while minor keys sound sad. While it may be true that we respond to certain aural impulses similarly, that still does not mean that we find these traits good or bad, they just are.As a conclusion, I would say that  words like good and bad are terms that describe a perception of something, rather than an objective truth.I used to study music, and had a music theory teacher who used to say a piece of music is not necessarily good even though it might sound like it.

An example- my parents had very wide and varied music tastes which I was exposed to as a very young child. As I grew up I was further exposed to wide and varied music because I sought it out. I have sung everything from German Lieder to modern contemporary music.

They couldnt be objective due to lack of experience and exposure. Anyway. Explain to me how we objectively classify good vs bad music. Sales? Concert attendance? Longevity? Popularity?

Music is good if it elicits emotions.This doesn't seem to me to be a good measure. Fingernails on a blackboard elicits motions, so does the banging of trashcans or the yowling of cats in the early morning hours.So we need to qualify what kind of emotion, and in that we are back in the realm of subjectivity.I'm of the view that art is best viewed as communication in which what is implicit is more important than that which is explicit. Consider poetry. The literal meaning of the words isn't all that important, or in the case of nonsense poetry, there's no literal meaning; it's all implicit meaning.We can judge art as good or bad based on effectiveness of communication. Does it communicate as intended? What is intended depends on who we ask. The composer? The director? The individual musicians? The audience? The producer? Again we are back in the subjective realm.Despite the subjectivity, we can make some general determinations. We can weed out music that communicates almost nothing. It falls by the wayside, forgotten. We can also identify music that audiences have reliably responded to in the past: Handel's Massiah, Beethoven's Ode to Joy. We can't say that one is better than the other because the audience and performers are always changing and the composers are no longer available. We can't ask what they intended. Furthermore, the audience becomes jaded by repetition. The music no longer elicits the same emotions that it did initially.","title":"CMV: Music is objective."},{"text":"Youre joking, right?He was a terrorist.

Firstly, Australia scored very low in entrepreneurship, which isnt just innovation, but bringing innovation to market and selling it. The article then proceeds to point out that Australia has very low economic complexity and we do not export a lot of tech products. The issue here is that Australia actually does innovate, we have world class RnD here.?If we have a look at the 2023 global innovation index, we can see that Australia is ranked 7th in the world for human capital and research, 9th for scientific and technical articles and 6th for university rankings. Our academic institutions are a strength here. So if this is the case, then in the entrepreneurial equation of bringing RnD to market, its the bringing to market part that Australia really struggles with, not the RnD and academia part. We can see this in the 2023 GII with Australia ranking?32nd for finance for startups and scale ups,?37th for entrepreneurship policies and culture and?90th for production and export complexity. Based off the data in this report, it would appear that Australia needs to improve policies that encourage entrepreneurship, encourage more private capital to be invested into start ups and by far most importantly, heavily invest into production and manufacturing capabilities?to get more out of its innovation than anything to do with the academic side of things.?\\n \\n Australia's data is on page 85 of the report.?\\n \\n https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo-pub-2000-2023-en-main-report-global-innovation-index-2023-16th-edition.pdf!deltaAustralia does not really lack innovation (#7 in the world for human capital and research doesn't sound so bad), but rather as you and others point out, it's not a fertile ground economically speaking for startups.","title":"CMV: A nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem."},{"text":"Me?

But she does need to win in Pennsylvania, which has a mix of rural, suburban, and urban voters who might all have varying concerns over immigration. Philadelphia, for instance, recently voted for a rather pro-police and tough-on-crime mayor, so Harris wants to align with that kind of rhetoric which can include migrants. She also wants to win in Arizona, a border state which has been generally anti-immigrant. No doubt white moderates are driving this as much as anything and they're likely more important for swing states. But polls have shown a general trend toward anti-immigrant beliefs in the US lately, and it's not only the white moderates anymore.

A friend of mine, in attempting to convince me that it should be government insurance for both, convinced me that it should be neither. That was 20ish years ago, so the details of his argument escape me now.My rationale for the original idea though, is that it's the cheaper of the two. Considering Canadians love their government healthcare when it's routine and preventative but die waiting for major medical procedures, it also seemed like the least likely to screw up (until they try it, right?)I'm also of the mind that no ideology is 100% right on every issue, and that if the magic formula is dicovered to blend concepts to emphasize strengths and minimize weaknesses, it would be better for everyone. Not that I have faith that government will ever discover this ... they would probably put concrete over asphalt if they were making the roads themselves.Really, the solution is to remove the government red tape and special privileges for the medical industry that make medicine so expensive. Stop artificially limiting the number of doctors we can produce every year. Review and implement Rand Paul's solution, like allowing insurance pools to extend across state borders and allow organizations, like the Catholic Church, for instance, to provide it outside of one's employment.","title":"Libertarian Perspective"},{"text":"Cool.

They are not cool with a two-state solution. Hamas is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement. It has called on members of the other two Abrahamic faithsJudaism and Christianityto accept Islamic rule in the Middle East. It is the duty of the followers of other religions to stop disputing the sovereignty of Islam in this region, because the day these followers should take over there will be nothing but carnage, displacement and terror, it decreed. Hamas also rejected any prospect of peace or coexistence with the state of Israel. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors. The Palestinian people know better than to consent to having their future, rights and fate toyed with.\\nhttps://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/doctrine-hamasHamas charter article 7:\\nMoreover, if the links have been distant from each other and if obstacles, placed by those who are the lackeys of Zionism in the way of the fighters obstructed the continuation of the struggle, the Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allahs promise, no matter how long that should take. The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said:The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews. (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).Hamas charter article 11:\\nThe Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up. Neither a single Arab country nor all Arab countries, neither any king or president, nor all the kings and presidents, neither any organization nor all of them, be they Palestinian or Arab, possess the right to do that. Palestine is an Islamic Waqf land consecrated for Moslem generations until Judgement Day. This being so, who could claim to have the right to represent Moslem generations till Judgement Day?This is the law governing the land of Palestine in the Islamic Sharia (law) and the same goes for any land the Moslems have conquered by force, because during the times of (Islamic) conquests, the Moslems consecrated these lands to Moslem generations till the Day of Judgement.Article on how claims that Hamas would accept the 1967 borders are extremely dubious:\\nhttps://www.cfr.org/blog/hamas-and-two-state-solution","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"I thought he wanted to pull out of Afghanistan, but Congress prevented it somehow.

He frequently used illegal immigrants on construction projects and was notorious for worker rights violations. He continues this even AFTER he was elected, as a lot of the Mar-a-Lago housekeeping staff were illegal immigrants. No reasonable person who wanted better salary and worker rights would vote for Trump. Literally every policy action he took as President was a pro-corporate and anti-union position. Even his tariffs, which were designed to create more jobs were aimed squarely at corporate profits for US companies. He openly has contempt for regulations and has an almost Ayn RAnd-ian fantasy that corporations will be good stewards without the EPA.As for the LGBT stuff, Trump has voiced his support for gay people. He openly said that he thought gay people deserved rights and deserved to get married. As for the rest of it, he obviously doesn't give a shit. Even though it is a hot-button conservative issue, he rarely discusses the current book debate or anything like that.

They have skills that we need that we don't have. That's the entire point of the program. You're literally describing a skill issue.

Before Trump, most US presidents did demand more moderate policies from Jerusalem, especially with regards to settlements. George HW Bush famously made loans to Israel dependent on freezing settlements, while Obama pressured Netanyahu to suspend new settlements. Previous presidents would have lost their minds if Israel attempted a full West Bank annexation.?And even in the modern day, Russia and China, who take a comparatively pro-Palestine stance purely to spite the US, would respond with sanctions and international condemnation if Israel tried that.","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"Why does the MSM keep saying Trump is white when he is clearly orange?","title":"So is Kamala Harris still Black ?"},{"text":"You concede that Israel is an apartheid.I don't think it's an apartheid, I think it's occupied territory in a low grade war.

It's a disparate impact strongly suggesting systemic bias.The UN is not set up to stop human rights atrocities. The UN was set up to keep the great powers from fighting each other again and give the rest of the world a place to talk. Everything else they do is ancillary to \\"keep nuclear armed Russia (nee USSR) and USA from direct conflict.\\" The UN has no real power or ability to enforce its decrees. You just dont care if they are committing atrocities.I think it's a little more complicated than that. Reprisals for breaking the rules of armed conflict are allowed.

Mutual funds do this - and have been useful in making stock trading available to smaller investors. In Canada (where we have similar property/housing problems, and similar economic and immigration issues) there are now schemes where you can invest in rental properties as part of a larger group. It's not ideal, but it's a way to get somewhat on the property ladder. Of course, the biggest beneficiaries of these schemes are, as with all investment schemes like this, the ones setting up the portfolio and running it. They charge fees for administration, for rental management, for property maintenance, etc. It's way less profitable than buying your own property, but ...And hey, you can always consider whether or not coming up with this scheme counts as innovation or not...More seriously - in my mind, institutional tolerance of failure is the biggest factor towards embracing innovation. Until there are more investors and institutions that willingly and wholeheartedly embrace the fact that x% of innovators are going to fail (and x is on the high side of 50) then innovation is going to continue to lag. Want to see people try to innovate? Keep funding them **even if they've failed before**. Failure is the great teacher - each time you fail, you learn a new set of lessons. It's like smoking - the more times you try and fail to quit, the more likely you are to succeed. Fund people - not just business plans. Banks don't do that - they pretty much want to have a guarantee before they will invest. Venture Capital funds do this, and angel investors, and so on and so forth.

I'm pretty neutral on immigration as a subject but strongly believe developed countries need conservative policies. When large numbers of Italians and Irish immigrated to the US there was not really a welfare system. While there was clearly a government, most of those immigrants stayed within their community and were governed by their community. Largely some Irish guy off the boat wasn't placing his 4 kids into a school that was already struggling with resources. At that point the US was also high industrial and we needed unskilled labor to work in the factories that made the country an economic powerhouse. Our workforce needs currently aren't centered around large numbers of jobs that require no skill or education. So it's not apples to apples to compare immigration in the early part of the US to now.I know, I work in construction, if it weren't for immigrant labor the housing shortfall we have right now would be ten times worse.That's not true at all. Every day we're seeing more people wanting to jump into trades. Why? Because the narrative of college for everyone is not pushed as hard. Additionally, trade wages are up. Immigrant labor helped construction over the past couple of decades because in many areas there was a huge suppression of construction wages. After college some sites were paying half of what they had when I was in HS because they were flooded with workers willing to take less. It's not like we had no construction before those workers. Yes a huge problem is laws but let's not pretend like we need massive amounts of immigration into the US to be productive or to maintain the population. Let's also not pretend that a lack of immigrants is what causing shortages in certain work sectors.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"Its not about just race.

If you open a grocery store in a Hispanic neighborhood but the store down the block closes did you create net new jobs? Depending on the immigrant community, they may shop but not at the levels of natives. One huge issue with H1B workers from some countries is they can be massive savers and not drivers of the economy. And sure they pay rent, but generally the space would have been rented anyway. Those higher up the ladder jobs eventually see displaced native workers. In the 90s and 2000s many tech companies outsourced heavily to India. That was followed by a wave of Indian visa workers to the US because a lot of mid level talent had been developed off shore. While initially natives held management positions, now you see those positions often held by former H1B workers who have risen up the ranks and who in some cases unapologetically prefer to work with people like them. This is why Springfield IL specifically asked for the government to send those Haitian immigrants.I'm not overly familiar with the situation there. I do know that while immigrants around generation 3 often surpass their native counterparts, the first two generations often use services and have to cut corners. How can someone who can't speak English well but has a family be a net contributor to the tax base or economy? Sure they can sell goods and services within their community but is that enough to offset the resources they need? Do you confine them to that area or do you let them leave once they save a certain amount and want better? Immigration policy needs to be driven by needs and not feeling good. If Springfield needed workers and had open jobs then sure.

If you can't compete in the job market - your faultThe old it's your fault if you can't/won't race to the bottom. Here's an anecdotal tale from my life. Growing up we had lots of guys who did day and seasonal labor. You show up to a site or get picked up and end the day with cash in your pocket. When I graduated from college in the early 2000s I struggled to find work so I went to a construction site, found the foreman and asked if he had work. His response was he'd love to hire me but he didn't really run the crews he ran the site. He told me that the guy who ran the crews was Hispanic and only hired people from his country or who at least spoke Spanish. The guy also told me wages were down and recommended I go into the hospital and speak with HR since I had a resume and college degree. Turns out wages were down and lots of black as well as white laborers had been displaced. 10 years after that wages were back up because the market had been cornered and there was less downward pressure on wages. But those who had been displaced had lost home and in some cases weren't able to get back into that sector of the work force. Do you really think they just didn't compete hard enough?Most of the immigration problems in the US result in the fact that this immigration is concentrated in places rather than fairly spread out through the nation, like you see in New York and even in Springfield, Ohio (where they eat dogs, of course).True but a lot of jobs and capacity are also centered around location. Dumping 10000 low skilled workers and their families in NY is going to have less of an impact on the native population than putting 2000 in 5 small towns because NY has the infrastructure and services for that influx. Even if you dropped all 10k in the rot belt and gave them a town, they'd still need resources and support from the surrounding area.The US' character is built upon immigration and allowing Americans to rise and fall to their own accord. I don't believe that the US' age demographics are as poor as Europe and others. But, just the history of the US, makes anyone a hypocrite who argues against immigration (unless you are a Native American). During times of Italian immigration, they were not considered to be white, and faced the same discrimination and rhetoric as current immigrants. Personally, I believe that the same has occurred with Mexicans and other Latino groups.Arguing against immigration does not make the US a hypocrite. During the early days of the country we burned through factory workers, abused humans under the system of slavery, had land grabs...We're currently at a post industrial point where everyone can get a free k-12 education. We have labor shortages but don't need large numbers of unskilled immigrants and their families to make up for a labor shortage or to expand the country.Arguably the Italians and Irish were only allowed to be white to get them to fight against other groups. It wasn't some kumbaya moment of the country coming together for a positive purpose or people accepting being displaced.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"You still believe in the TV's left vs. right narrative?Maybe you dont realize it, but by pushing that idea, you're playing right into the hands of the mainstream media.A product of your television.If you havent heard it before, listen closely: the television tells lies.Both sides are controlled, with actors playing presidents and world leaders.The world is run from behind the curtain, and we live in the illusion.","title":"What if the left wing is creating fake political accounts online in order to sway peoples opinion?"},{"text":"I'm 42 and live in Oklahoma.

Firstly, Australia scored very low in entrepreneurship, which isnt just innovation, but bringing innovation to market and selling it. The article then proceeds to point out that Australia has very low economic complexity and we do not export a lot of tech products. The issue here is that Australia actually does innovate, we have world class RnD here.?If we have a look at the 2023 global innovation index, we can see that Australia is ranked 7th in the world for human capital and research, 9th for scientific and technical articles and 6th for university rankings. Our academic institutions are a strength here. So if this is the case, then in the entrepreneurial equation of bringing RnD to market, its the bringing to market part that Australia really struggles with, not the RnD and academia part. We can see this in the 2023 GII with Australia ranking?32nd for finance for startups and scale ups,?37th for entrepreneurship policies and culture and?90th for production and export complexity.\\nBased off the data in this report, it would appear that Australia needs to improve policies that encourage entrepreneurship, encourage more private capital to be invested into start ups and by far most importantly, heavily invest into production and manufacturing capabilities?to get more out of its innovation than anything to do with the academic side of things.?Australia's data is on page 85 of the report.?https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo-pub-2000-2023-en-main-report-global-innovation-index-2023-16th-edition.pdf","title":"CMV: A nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem."},{"text":"Wait... yall don't have the app??

Australia has a lot of business  every major US company has a regional office there. So its not unfriendly to biz (as you pointed out), but companies building new things (developing patents, commercialization of products, startups, biotech) is lacking. This tells me its probably some combination of:1) costs or other barriers to entry that large businesses can absorb if they open a new office there, but are really difficult for startups to afford. Could be hiring regulations, licensing, any number of things.2) industry incumbents have disproportionate market share in AUS and pricing power, and its difficult for startups to gain a foothold. Australia isnt a huge domestic market, so if its tough to get customers in AUS, many promising startups might move to the US market 3) maybe there are regulatory burdens or taxes that make venture investing riskier.

It just means that there is at best a bias or at worst an agenda against the second group. Heck, some individual members of the first group might even be exactly the opposite, even support the second group.?Now the data points to help the case:1. Many UN member states are places in which Jews were literally ethnically cleansed and/or in which to this day Israel or Jews have very bad or nonexistent public support and have many antisemitic chants directed against. Many of these places are also dangerous for Jews to be in to this day. This proportion of the member states from all member states is larger than if you just sampled a random amount of people from the population (at least in western countries) and checked how many antisemites there are, so ergo, we are already starting off as a baseline of the UN being more antisemitic than the general population.?\\n2. Israel is the only country with a permanent agenda item for its \\"human rights abuses\\". I think there are quite a bit more countries that would fit this bill if the UNHRC wasn't antisemitic.?\\n3. This differs between UNGA and UNHRC and UNESCO, but depending on the suborganization, Israel has between 50% to 59% of all resolutions for human rights abuses when including all countries combined. You can say Israel is abusing human rights, okay, but more than all the rest of the world combined? Really? Israel doesn't even cause most death, or starvation, or dislocation, or refugees from some **SINGLE** countries, so again, to have more resolutions than the whole rest of the world combined? What explanation do you have for this if not antisemitism??\\n4.

More often than not it's up to thirty and many public education teachers feel like they're hosting lectures more than teaching a class.A quick google shows for the UK that the average class size is twenty seven point nine.Does anyone have any policy to fix this? Hopefully you can link me to a long pdf file explaining exactly what needs to be done and by what year you can attain the developed countries' standard?I fully admit across the world the Conservatives don't have the will to fully fund schools and teachers but whataboutism aside let's examine California for a moment.Richest state in the world from Silicon Valley to generous oil deposits and their standard of living is twenty three on average according to the NCES.Where is the policy to fix this? That's sort of a massive quality of life problem that stretches to every domestic system. Hospitals, housing, policing.

To give those standards of life. Half of everyone who votes generally believes it does tie back into immigration.I fully respect that the USA and the UK in particular owe the world a lot in reparations for admitting immigrants in light of colonial world history but have you ever considered the possibility that the best way to help undeveloped nations is to raise our children up to proper standards that will let them become rich and famous enough to effect more meaningful change?As opposed to an endless open door policy which drags down both hypothetical nations.Lefties often say that they want to put our children first so again i must ask for a specific policy that you can link to me and show me in detail to give our children a class size of fifteen on average. That shouldn't be asking for the moon.

The U.S. has 333 million people. India has 1.5 billion people. If 1.2 billion Indians decided *tomorrow* to come to the U.S. and we let them, it would be immediate chaos. Not enough jobs relative to workers, not enough housing, every indication would collapse.Right?Okay, so now we are simply debating *how much* immigration should exist.So the advantage of immigrants is they bring in skills and a hunger to work. They can fill in big gaps in labor force and grow the economy.The disadvantage of immigrants is they do put additive strain on housing, education, health, food resources.  If you bring in more labor than you need for a specific field, it drives down the price of that labor - and drive it down too far it means your workers have no negotiating power. These risk obliterating your middle class.You also have the cultural / immersion aspect. Immigrants assimilate at a particular rate. Individuals blend in, but large groups will tend to create segregated enclaves and not integrate as quickly.Okay so if you are to look at immigration in the U.S., its perhaps obvious why the debate is split.Undocumented immigrants to the U.S. have stuck to particular regions (the sun belt) and industries (agriculture, construction, etc). This has caused particular fields &amp; locations to incur the costs of housing demand and wage suppression, but other regions to enjoy lowered costs (particularly the coasts).The fact that immigrants to the U.S. tend to be heavily Latin American means the integration is easy. Culturally they are *very* similar in terms of values and history.This kind of split benefit in the US to me suggests were *pretty close* to right levels of immigration overall, but are probably taking in too many unskilled and undocumented.Particularly given spikes in housing costs and sustainability concerns with more automation looming (which means less need for unskilled) I do think the U.S. should be aiming for population equilibrium or even very slight / controlled decline and not growth, and we need to focus on importing the best knowledge workers &amp; protecting US unskilled workers. Not importing every bleeding heart case at the expense of US interests. Europe has seen *way* more friction with immigration spikes, as those that have come are from regions with much less shared cultural identity (ie, Syria / North Africa). They integrate less and commit far more crime.","title":"CMV: There are little problems with immigration, and more benefits than downsides"},{"text":"Do it for them!","title":"New poll shows Kamala Harris pulling away in Nevada with 7-point lead over Donald Trump"},{"text":"I don't actually think this falls into the category of SLAPP suits.

Welfare dependence and being a burden on the tax payer can be fixed through other means (slow and steady assimilation, education and work programs).

Illegal immigration is like a person breaking into your house.Immigrants are great for big corporations and billionaires, and terrible for working class people. Adding more people competing for a limited number of jobs, and a limited amount of benefits programs, and charity causes harm on top of over crowding the classrooms and other things.Illegal immigration has even more problems than legal immigration. The illegal immigrants are not vetted. Because they are not vetted they are dangerous to the local population.Their criminal record is not checked. They could be a fugitive on the run.Their vaccination status and medical history are not checked.

The immigrants we get are largely uneducated and low to semi-skill workers or high skill workers who aren't big spenders. In both cases those immigrants potentially displace large numbers of people. Let's focus on the low end. In the US we have a large working poor. If you flood the market with people willing to do their job for a little less then what happens to them? If you compound things by allowing the immigrants to take over industries and set the language for that industry, what happens to the people they displace? In the US we don't have many free jobs programs to retrain and upskill those who are displace. So they turn to crime, self delete, harbor hatred, give up the American dream, work 10-15 years longer than they'd hoped...As to your fixes...yes work programs would be great. But those work programs would need to send 90% of people back home after working for a certain period.

Four companies manufacture insulin already.  I dont think patents alone explain this.Any time we are looking at pharma products we need to look at patent exclusivity *and* exclusivity granted by FDA approval.  Both matter because even after a patent expires or is licensed then new products still have huge administrative and financial barriers to market.  Martin Shkelli got rich by buying the rights to a drug that was long out of patent protection but it had been so cheap for so long no one bothered to make a generic.  So he was able to raise the price arbitrarily knowing that no one would catch up for many years regardless. Epipens are another related example where a company has a patent on an injector device and injector devices are governed by regulations written around that patent.  So a competitor cant make something consistent with the patent and and anything inconsistent with the patent cant be approved because it isnt consistent enough.   So I support your position in so much as we only need one type of exclusivity on pharma products to ensure financial reward for the firms that make them but also that the problems of exclusivity arent solved by eliminating patents either.

The frustration is the UN finger waves at Israel with basically zero solutions for the dynamic.It tells Israel to be more precise with its targeting despite it fighting a paramilitary using human shields that targets civilians and then when they use the most precise targeting in history, people gripe about it too (the pagers). the UN has yet to exercise power against IsraelPointing out that the UN hasnt exercised power is as evidence of lack of bias is just wrong.Fundamentally the UN cant directly exercise power on anyone. The UNs power is soft - its a dialog that shapes international opinion and *influences* policy.The disproportionate air time and one sided finger waving at Israel is sufficient evidence of anti-semitism.The UN is a political body, and the incentivizes here are somewhat obvious.There are about ~27 Muslim nations who have an inherent bias against Israel. 27 to 1 vote right off the back.Many of those 27 nations are oil producers, and influence the votes of other nations economically dependent on them. Quite simply many nations kowtow to OPEC and it influences their vote.The ~25-50 European nations are particularly energy dependent on external sources. And the EU, despite being in most respects a singular country the same size as the U.S., has each one of its member states getting a vote to the USs one.The fact that Europe slaughtered half the worlds Jews and is now back to condemning them doesnt exactly dispel perceptions of anti-semitism.The developing world has an anti-west bias and will pull for the smaller entity with a grievance over a western power - so add another 50 African states.So you have this built in 100+-2 vote in the UN thats a simple reflection of the voting structure of the body based on incentives, before you even begin to explore objective reality of the individual case.Throw in the fact that Palestine has its own refugee agency of the UN (UNRWA) that uses separate definitions and separate funding from the UNs other refugee agency for *everyone else*.Institutionally the UN is kind of designed to get nation states to talk to prevent a WW2 like battle, and all its human rights / war crimes definitions are oriented around those types of wars. It quite simply has no real meaningful answers, guidance, or accountability for modern asymmetric warfare.It seems fairly obvious that the UN has massive anti-Israel bias.At best you can say that the bias isnt pure antisemitism. From the Muslim states it is, from Africa its more anti-rich west, and from Europe its more minor antisemitism / ivory tower finger waving and kowtowing to economic incentives.","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"Fresh Air interviewed an author about Constitutional Sheriffs.

If you wish to really delve into the problems of patents, the history of AT&amp;T is a far bigger, and more egregious example of what is broken on the system, as are the problems with patent trolls.Nintendo is indeed probably trolling a bit and stretching vague patents into strongarming yheir opponents. But PocketPair is not a sweet, innocent developer that is being bullied by Nintendo. They have heavily leaned into the Pokemon comparison, instrad of the survival mechanics and where definelty skirting on the edges of potential copyright infriction. Pal Spheres are to me (as a non-player)one of the most overt things, as not only mechanically they are the same as Pokeballs, the name is basically the same. One company was on the edges of cooyright and the other found a legal recourse that they could take. It is not great, but it isn't a purely white and black issue.And Nintendo in general I don't ghink have been especially problematic with their patents. The monster catching genre has not been quashed or really interfered with. Palworld isn't even a real innovative game. It is Ark with Pokemon, is not a huge game changer, and fhe survival mechanics and/or monster catching mechanics, neither seem all that deep (and I would say thr decline in llayer base going from over a million in January, to less that half that in February and down to about 18k in the last 30 days according to Steam Charts helps support that). It isn't really bringing someyhing to the table. The game has, from an outsider perspective, died off after the inital launch and controversies. This is a feud between two companies that care little about consumers, and that isn't indicative of anything.

That is focus on if mandatory voting adresses the issues you raised: 1. Voter apathy \\n2. Money in politics \\n3. Intrest groups \\n(1) From my experience voter apathy is the result of people not believing in (A) the politcal system (B) the candidate(s) on offer. In regards to (A) I can say that mandatory voting could assist in fixing the system to an extent. At the local level ( councils, mayors, sheriffs etc..) in smaller communities people would have to engage with the  system as they will most likely personally know the candidates. The policy of the community will reflect the people as the people are voting for the people. However in larger cities and at a federal level it won't change anything. Depending on how candidates are selected the people will feel as if they are being forced to pick between two bad candidates. Which leads into (B). The issue isn't that people arn't voting; it's that their vote doesn't countIn a small town the candidates most likely are independent or self financed. It's easy for anyone to run. But the larger the election the bigger the political system needed to run a campaign. Thus the candidates are most likely selected inside a party structure and the public votes along party lines. Forcing everyone to vote dosn't fix this. As the issue is the party system. Which itself is the result of the size of the election. Which leads us to (2) (2) If you running for Federal office in any country you going to need a lot of money. You can get it by (C) a few rich backers ( D) public fund raising ( lots of backers or (E) a combination of (C) and (D). Regardless you going to need money. To get that money you going to need to sell your views. Which is (3). Making everyone vote dosn't solve any of this. You will just end up at ( B) as people are being forced to  vote for someone they didn't \\"buy into\\". Furthermore due to wealth inequality a few wealthy people will always dominate the political space. \\nThus the real answers to fix the issues would be: I. Stricter campaign financing laws; possibly federal campaign funds for each candidate. So everyone running gets $X only from the elections committee II. Open primary elections. People vote on candidates then they go to the committee to get (I)","title":"CMV: I believe that mandatory voting is a crucial step toward achieving a more representative and functional democracy"},{"text":"Fight for what lol?The continuation of the 60hr workweek?The continuation of the surplus of my labor being funneled up to rich cunts by politicians?To defend my countrymen/women well are so fucking dumb theyve allowed themselves to be fully consumed by propaganda and their entire identity is now politics which is nothing more than culture war bullshit?The continuation of the modern education system that of nothing more than an indoctrination factory which is based upon the Prussian education system?Bro, Im not fighting for any of this shit.

Everyone's participating now!\\"Mandatory voting has nothing to do with the massive influence of money in American politics.  American elections are a financial arms race - whoever spends most usually wins.  Even if the number of voters you need to target increases due to mandatory voting, the sources of election funding remain exactly the same and would still tie their financial support to the same issues as always.  If 18 year olds suddenly are forced to vote it's not like big corporate or lobbyist donors are suddenly going to be insisting on policies that appeal to 18 year olds - they'll be promoting the same policies that benefit them as always.","title":"CMV: I believe that mandatory voting is a crucial step toward achieving a more representative and functional democracy"},{"text":"I would have asked the judge what is the legal definition for the amount of solar luminosity  required for headlights to be turned on.

At some point, we cannot care about these politicians, lives and careers more than they do. If Democratic politicians are going to hang their heads and allow the likes of Jim Jordan or Ted Cruz or Matt Gates or Marjorie Taylor green to smear them in the media, and keep on initiating these ridiculous investigations without any pushback, what can we do? Nothing. I think the Democrats actively love losing elections, and getting their asses spanked publicly by Republicans.And the more they allow it to happen, the more likely it is that Donald Trump will steal this upcoming election, Democrats will shrug their shoulders and say there's nothing they can do, And Trump will make good on his promise and throw his political enemies in prison.

I'll throw you some background to help hear your answer.I witnessed something very interesting from the mid to the late 1990's.  When the demilitarized web became available for public use:[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619#abstract](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619#abstract)When we all got our little AOL discs in the mail, like we ALL got 'em, and we loaded them into our newfangled Bill and Steve's Excellent Adventure machines, we got mail!But, we also got chat rooms.  Poorly moderated and unfiltered talk with other little disc holders around the world.I watched information being shared by many, leading to a mass awakening.  I don't mean fully awake and aware, I mean varied from the deepest sleep to light slumber, or lucidity all the way to bolted upright and moving around to face the new day.It would seem to me that although the baddies wanted to collect data and monitor conversation, without direction, they got a chance to see the growth of the numbers of those who weren't going to gleefully participate in all of their bread and circuses as much as before.If I'm right to any degree in my analysis, this might have been their biggest mistake of the history timeline you've presented.  I think this scared them, and the reaction was to take control of the monster they unleashed.  So, they had to throttle their interwebs down and move us towards the \\"Dead Internet Theory\\" being a reality, and quick!Funny how their social media site closes up shop (because more people were catching on to what it was, IMHO), and replace it with something more soft and cuddly, as just one example:[https://whyy.org/segments/facebook-a-computing-pioneer-a-secret-government-program-and-a-strange-coincidence/](https://whyy.org/segments/facebook-a-computing-pioneer-a-secret-government-program-and-a-strange-coincidence/)During the timeline presented, folks only had limited resources for gathering information, the vast majority of those sources had been previously captured.  But, that world wide webbie thingy seemed to be a double edged sword, all the way down to it's handle.  Hold it right and you can do damage, hold it wrong and you'll get yourself damaged in the process.Although there has been an inordinate amount of unnatural migration as of these past few years, there are also a whole bunch of indigenous folks taking to the streets, in protest.  Sure, this could end up with the whole us vs. them unfolding in the favor of TPTB, but, again, that damned double edged sword still must be handled and swung.So, the question begs - although good people grossly outnumber the baddies, amongst them, is the silent minority within the silent majority accounted for by the folks in the shadows?  If so, they win.  If not, history might have stories to tell about new heroes from within the good side of good folk.","title":"The Overton Window has closed.

A morally reprehensible human being.Definitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons.\\"I think that I'm going to vote third party because I can't stomach Trump.

Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us.\\"I do [think hes a total fraud that is exploiting these people] too. [...] I dont think he actually cares about folks. I think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.Im definitely not gonna vote for Trump because I think that hes projecting very complex problems onto simple villains.I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldnt be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that hes Americas Hitler. Hows that for discouraging?At the heart of Trumps immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs. I think its a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I dont think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.Can you imagine running as an anti-AHCA populist who thinks Trump is a moral disaster?

The goal for the regulators is sameness, uniformity, consistency, predictability.

That's what we see in other markets. Now, there may be a solid economic case that our economy is not big enough to support that.

It's pretty interesting from a cultural perspective that Americans, many of whom will go on about the importance of freedom, are conditioned to justify slavery as a result of the way the post-reconstruction lost cause reactionary movements influenced our modern discourse. There's a reason there were hundreds of statues built to honor slavers in the 1920s and subsequent decades.

Note, I am not sure how to phrase that as neutral as possible, but to be clear I'm not suggesting the only way is for someone else to do it FOR (or TO) Mexico, I just want to have some reason to hope basicallyMy priors are that if the cartels are as entrenched as they are, someone is going to have to physically fight them to get them to lose power.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"LinkedIn couldnt possibly be anymore cringe than it already isLinkedIn:https://preview.redd.it/v5oybnt0fjrd1.jpeg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=663e8062cce577be9b277610cd7028571ca466b2","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Israel is a rich country.

I mean, it will take a while until Ali Bahreini's pride recovers from losing a debate with a bunch of Athenian school kids. Not to mention, putting a high-ranking Iranian official into the same room as a bunch of women's rights activists and organisations like Justice for Iran, all of which are diametrically opposed to the Iranian regime, leads to some hilarious situations. Basically, thanks to Iran, the whole event turned into an Anti-Iran event, which Iran was also forced to take part in, and even write a report on, based on established guidelines and values of the UN Human Rights organs. The whole thing turned into forced exposure therapy session for Ali Bahreini, which was kinda hilarious.That doesn't mean they should have been the chair tho. But because the chair can be chosen only from the nominees, made by the regional group whose turn it is to nominate the chair, and the fact that Ali Bahreini somehow ended up as the only nominee, they got the job. Because there was no one else for the job. Basically, their participation was wrong, but there was no alternative within the established procedures and rules of how the chair is chosen.

In fact it also matches with some of the stories that the UN tells and teaches in UN schools in Gaza so it's also on topic.  my grandparents liked in Yafa and [told] me they woke up in the middle of the night to terrorists burning their homes and killing their neighboursThis bit acts as if the history of the Arab Israeli conflict begins in the middle of the night in 1948. It is a family story and it is a completely legitimate *personal* experience and so I don't want to negate that from the point of view of your family, however.In 1947 the *Arab* armies of five countries, recognizing the Palestinian Arabs as their own people, came to Palestine to kill all the Jews. Your family knew that and yet were sleeping happily in their beds. In other words, the only suprise for them was that it was them, rather than the Jewish Neighbours they had lived togeter with for decades that were threatened.  The creation of Israel in itself is anti semetic, European leaders get rid of most Jews in Europe and sent them to the middle eastAgain, this shows how the entire debate is set in antisemitic propaganda. What you say is honestly what is taught in all Arab countries and especially what is taught in UN schools. In fact, in 1970, long after the creation of Israel there were still 3million Jews in Europe, which represents the majority of the survivors of the Holocaust. About 1.6 million then emigrated from Europe from then till 2010 with a complex interchange between Europe and America. What that says is that the majority of the Jews of Israel in 1948 were not escapees from the Holocaust at the end of the war. They were, rather a mix of indiginous Jews from Palestine, Jews escaping from Arab persecution throughout the middle East and of course, some Jews who had emigrated from Europe both before, after and during WWII.  In conclusion, Israel brought all this onto itself, and maybe on purpose because they need Jews to feel afraid so they can convince them that murdering their neighbours is okay. There is a huge amount of projection in this statement. Whereas the previous parts are rather about facts, this really states, from the other side, exactly what is going on in the Arab education system generally but in Palestine in particular. Why is nobody taught about Arab persecution of Jews before 1948? Because then the current attacks seem justified?Why is nobody taught about the Jews being one of the indigenous people of Judea ever since the earliest times of the bible? That they formed an interconnected community between Europe and Jidea for all that time? Because then it seems reasonable to try to ethnically cleanse them from the lands of Judea (Palestine).Why is nobody taught about the Arab attacks on Israel in 1947? Because then the Nakba Genocide, which is actually an attack by the Arabs aginst the Jews can be twisted into an a victim story for the Arabs.Why do pro-Palestinian outsiders make accusations of Genocide against Israel? Becuase then, in their antisemitic minds genocide against the Israelis can be justified.  my grandparents liked in Yafa and [told] me they woke up in the middle One last thing. You tell us nothing else, so I assume that this is all that your Grandparents did. I assume that they didn't help the local Jews, but I also assume that they didn't help the Arab genocide attempt agaisnt the Jews. In this case they *were* innocent civilian victims of an awful war. Each individual should be judged for the acts they have committed. The Arab armies that set that up were wrong to do so, but the specific Israelis that did that were wrong and criminal to frighten them from their homes.","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"(Not the person you replied to) Its obvious complex and an exact comparison isnt possible or necessarily accurate.

(Israeli citizens is being used here because there are non Jewish Israelis, they have a huge Arab population there.) These differences exist though because Palestinians don't want to be Israeli citizens, and therefore exclude themselves from the associated benefits and legal obligations it would come with.They can't just leave Gaza or the Westbank onto mainland Israel true, that's because there's a custom border. Palestinians don't consider themselves Israeli and hold they're their own nation, as such to respect that a customs border must exist. They also don't hold themselves as Israeli citizens and as such need to be stopped in order to figure out why they want to enter. Same as any other country in the world behaves.Legally there is a difference between how Palestinians and Israeli citizens are treated. This is because Palestinians insist they aren't Israeli citizens and therefore Israeli courts shouldn't apply to them. So they have ti be treated differently. Same as any other country in the world behaves.There is a difference but that difference in many cases born from a refusal to consider themselves Israeli, and this a refusal of the associated legal benefits and obligations. There are really only two options Israel can take here, the first is what is happening. Respect their wishes but have essentially a two tier system, those who are citizens and those that refuse to acknowledge Israel at all. The second is for Israel to force citizenship and these legal obligations on every Palestinian, open their own administrative centers in each associated area to force these standards, and not do this to an unwilling population.

So while Hezbollah, Houthis and Iran to a greater extent Iran are a problem against peace in this world, not all neighbors are on their side.The issue of Israel is simple.  Israel is the only apartheid on earth. There is no way for Israel to be both an apartheid and a democracy that has human rights as a core value.Apartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave violation of internationally protected human rights, and a crime against humanity under international criminal law.Its ironic, because part of the reason for my personal human rights values came directly from my experiences going to Yad Vashem.  Much of my compassion for humanity was learned from the mistakes humanity made during the Holocaust.The apartheid separating Jews from non Jews, prohibition of marriage in some cases to Palestinians, taking of Palestine family land in Jerusalem, controlling all the water in the West Bank.- Fragmentation into domains of control, At the heart of the system is keeping Palestinian separated from each other into distinct territorial, legal and administrative domains- Dispossession of land and property. Decades of discriminatory land and property seizures, home demolitions and forced evictions- Segregation and control. A system of laws and policies that keep Palestinians restricted to enclaves, subject to several measures that control their lives, and segregated from Jewish Israelis- Deprivation of economic &amp; social rights. The deliberate impoverishment of Palestinians keeping them at great disadvantage in comparison to Jewish IsraelisThese are legitimate criticisms of Israel.  And these criticisms are not antisemitism.  These are the same criticisms that the UN has been pushing.The patients in the United States is waning.

Every treaty for a two state solution came from or was agreed to by Israel with the Palestinians rejecting it.

Because I am under the impression that the Palestinians would have a desire for independence and autonomy regardless of if it was Jews, Christians or BhuddistsThen why is all the focus of their attacks and rhetoric targeted against Jews and not the Arab Israelis?

Notice that throughout history, recent or not, there were events where Muslim countries attacked other Muslims, where Muslim countries fought other Muslims and things like that. Notice that quantitively, it affected significantly more people than the Isr/Pal conflict. We don't see the same hatred, and delegitimization from MENA countries towards them. Notice also, that in some cases it's not even hidden. the slogan goes in Arabic \\"from water to water Palestine will be Arab\\" hinting that if Jews were Arabs they wouldn't care. The Houthi slogan is \\"death to the Jews\\". You can see numerous speeches from many leaders, religious leaders or cultural leaders from MENA countries where they explicitly say that the problem is that the land is not Muslim as it should be, or not Arab as it should be - two things that the Jews are not.  \\nNotice also that consistently, polling in MENA countries show strong antisemitism vibes. [https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-3-views-of-religious-groups/](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-3-views-of-religious-groups/)  \\nAnd this includes even the countries that are more favorable towards Israel. in the UAE they changed the school curriculum to remove antisemitism, which is awesome, but it's an indication to how much it was needed.  \\nEven in the UK, there is a Mehdi Hassan article that says that the Muslim community in the UK has an antisemitism problem [https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/03/sorry-truth-virus-anti-semitism-has-infected-british-muslim-community](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/03/sorry-truth-virus-anti-semitism-has-infected-british-muslim-community)(there are claims btw that the Europeans brought this idea to the Middle east but that's irrelevant to the argument, even though it could be true).Notice that Muslim countries or Arab countries are about quarter of the world's countries, and often they are the driving force against Israel in the UN. There is antisemitism in other places as well, but they are usually the driving force.Given all this, do you not think there's a possibility that all of this antisemitism translates to action against Israel in the UN? Do you think that if instead of Jews from Europe, the Syrian army would go down and take the land, kicking the Palestinians to Jordan, do you think it would look the same today?Also, you haven't responded to the other part of my argument about Jews leaving Israel, do you agree that your argumentation there didn't really show what you claimed?","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":" 1) There is a notion that innovation = academic research.

Taking that into account isn't this statement just saying that an organisation which is antisemitic won't stop Jews defending themselves from an attack they never started?Because the burden of proof rests on people who propose its antisemetic.

Western countries do not want to be implicated with war crimes and similar acts, and do not want to generally aid the escalation of wars. It is why to this day they forbid Ukraine from striking on Russian soil with US supplied weapons. Israel as a state is west aligned, and thus under greater scrutiny by the west and its allies, thus they are put under more pressure.  \\n  \\nThe point about UNWRA. Israel has always been opposed to it and has also always been free to lead an investigation to present its evidence to the world. Recent investigations have found that Israel's accusations have been mostly unfounded and exaggerated, with most of the countries that suspended funding having restored it.  \\nAnd to circle back to the safe haven idea, you bring up historical oppression of jews, but this is the case for basically every religion that has ever found itself from its core, the case for every ethnic and religious minority ever.

But why are we disregarding the antisemitic criticism? You haven't even given a reason to do that yet, you just jump into taking it for granted. Why? Taking that into account isn't this statement just saying that an organisation which is antisemitic won't stop Jews defending themselves from an attack they never started? They seem to be taught that any conflict in the region stems not from broader and more complex political reasons, rather their neighbors just hate Jews and their liberal democratic state (ala Bush telling Americans 9/11 happened because the Muslims hated American freedoms.What are these broader political reasons other than the desire to a) destroy Israel, b) more specifically remove the Jews from Israel, or c) make Israel more similar to the Muslim States surrounding it?As for Bush please do a favour and read Bin Ladens letter to the world explaining why he did 9/11. (Yes this letter exists.) Find the section where he discusses his motives and goals. Please find one such goal that is different than: a) punishing the US for not bowing down immediately to another Muslim state/group, b) seeking ti destabilise the US' institutions of democracy and government, c) wanting the US to become a Sharia state where homosexuality is banned, women have no rights, and everyone must be Muslim.Please do mention it cause I've read that letter plenty of times now and there ain't nothing there. And note, I do not completely disregard that there IS often antisemitic sentiment shared among Israel's opposition, it's just that its far from the prime driving motivator of their actionsPlease explain why when the primary motivator isn't anti semitic that these groups keep making destroying Israel and Jews their primary goal in every mission to achieve it. Another argument made is that Israel faces disproportional scrutiny by the UN, when there are worse states floating around that get less flak.

Am I getting you correctly?I'd argue that scrutiny by the UN has serious repercussions to Israel. And if it's only the general assembly and other UN bodies that show such anti-Israel, and sometimes anti-Jewish bias, but the US stops it on the UNSC - it doesn't mean that the UN doesn't have an anti-Israel bias, it only means that the US is in favor of Israel.Would it change your mind if I show how UN condemnations affect Israel?About the \\"Israeli Jews left the country so there are places without discrimination\\" argument - as a Jewish person I highly disagree. Jewish people are just about the group that suffers the most hate crimes per capita in almost any country around the world (where they exist in significant numbers). Many Jewish people around the world hide their identity when they are \\"in public\\", and I was taught at young age to hide mine in certain cases (today I don't do it, because it's not my style, but I know many people that do). Even if it's not physical safety there's a sense of otherism in many communities. Does it necessarily affect every Jew? no. but it's something that affects many. If your name is Malchiel Cohen and you have a large nose and wear a Yamaka, you'll probably suffer less discrimination in Israel than just about anywhere else. That doesn't mean that there aren't other considerations. Some people prefer their physical safety, or economic status, which ATM aren't the best in Israel. but that doesn't mean that Israel doesn't offer a unique environment where Jews can feel safe in many ways that simply don't exist in other places. Eventually, this is what self determination is all about - which regardless of safety - Jews deserve. This is my experience at least as a Jewish person that lived in few places around the world including Israel. We don't have a perfect choice so people choose between not so perfect alternatives.","title":"CMV: The UN is not antisemitic"},{"text":"Im confused can someone point out where democracy is on the declaration of independence or constitution?","title":"CBS Poll Upends Democrats Insistence That Trump Is A Danger To Democracy"},{"text":"So this is less a view you want changed and more a vent/self harming process??To simplify my CMV, the main thesis is that a nation's lack of innovation is a very stubborn problem, as spending generously on R&amp;D does not fix the problem, and the problem has multiple roots in society too.

Literally a week after oct 7th the head of the UN said \\"it did not happen in a vacuum\\", even if true, it is uterrly disgusting and absent of any and all remorse to say such a thing so quickly after oct 7th. In addition, Hamas is somehow not considered a terrorist org. Israel and other NGO's have told the UN for literal decades now that UNWRA is corrupt and straight up brainwashes palestinians. The UN is currently trying to shield it's workers who are directly implicated in the massacres of Oct 7th. They have had reports in the past say utterly ridiclous and slanderous stuff to demonize Israel. One report for example quite literally blamed ISRAEL for palestinian men beating their wives.Part of the reason we are not sanctioned to high hell is because 1, we still have America's support and 2, Israel is a very produtive and useful country. They contribute in many fields and in many day to day products that are used all over the world.

Antonio Guterres, a weak and cowardly man, has no problem not mentioning Hezbollah because why on earth would you ever try to hold terrorists accountable?The problem that you people either dont understand or just dont care about is not that critiizing Israel is inherently antisemetic.

It's a literal \\"kill a Jew, set up your family for life\\" incentive scheme.The PA preaches and teaches antisemitism and Holocaust denial at every level, starting for its president who has a literal PhD in Holocaust denial, down to the school system which encourages children to become martyrs.The \\"peace\\" the PA keeps is in the form of not directly organising violence against Israel, but they're more than involved in promoting it and rewarding it, and they let terrorist groups operate under their nose as a matter of course. Also, it's no coincidence that Fatah stopped directly organising violence against Israel only when collaboration with Israel became essential to its own survival, ie after 2006 when Hamas took over Gaza and has since credibly threatened to gake over the West Bank as well.Members of the Israeli government are rightfully scorned and denounced as crazed extremists when they defend racist violent settlers, or spew Jewish supremacist and anti-Arab rhetoric. Netanyahu's coalition is rightfully called extremist.
