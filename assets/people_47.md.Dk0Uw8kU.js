Frank Kenny, a 54-year-old life coach from Boston who voted for Trump, said he expected his candidate to win, and wasnt surprised to wake up to news of a decisive victory. Despite all the heated rhetoric, he suspects people voted with their wallets.People were saying Trumps an animal and all this stuff  the media has just ruined it. But things were better \\\\[during Trumps first term\\\\].  he said. People were making money.Just as the sun came up across New England, Trump, a Republican known for his caustic divisiveness who was previously elected president in 2016, was projected to return to the White House. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.Tuesdays result represented an extraordinary comeback for Trump, who refused to accept his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020, sparked a violent insurrection at the US Capitol, was convicted of felony charges, and survived two assassination attempts.Soubane was on her way to work and had yet to see that the race was called Wednesday morning. She said she voted for Harris and, hearing from a reporter?that Trump had been projected the winner, said she was concerned about my reproductive rights and my rights as a person of color.Its always important for children to see someone who looks like them do big things, things that seem completely out of your league, Soubane said of Harriss historic candidacy as the first woman of color nominated by a major party. Even if it doesnt work out, its always important for them to have that view so I think that was good either way.Others at the Eastie T station had similar thoughts.Im feeling similar emotions to how I felt in 2016, kind of hopeless, Hannah Kim, 27, said.Kim, who is undergoing the naturalization process to become a US citizen, so could not vote in this election, was among the Massachusetts residents disappointed by Harriss loss.I started my process to get my naturalization back in 2016 and I havent ever felt like not doing it, but it also does kind of feel like is it worth it now? she said.Kim also said at the school she works at, there were a lot of concerns and worries about what the future of education is going to look like . . . and a lot of us rethinking what our next steps are.Waiting for her train at North Station Monday morning, Evelyn Council, a 30-year-old cook who lives in Cambridge and voted for Harris, said she was in shock.Her impression was that voters who might have otherwise voted Democrat were demoralized by the process, and that the Harris campaign was never able to sufficiently gain their confidence.I felt like America gave up, Council said. It just shows you that America will really rather go with someone that says the things \\\\[Trump\\\\] says rather than going with the Democrats and not trust them.","title":"In shock.

Financial autonomy is about independence in economic matters, while bodily autonomy is about independence over one's physical body and health decisions. Both are considered critical to individual freedom and self-determination, but they apply to different aspects of life. The issue of abortion is rooted in an individuals right to control their own bodydeciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term is a deeply personal choice with significant implications for ones health and well-being. Financial obligations, while impactful, do not directly affect the body in the same way.That said, its important to recognize that financial obligations dont always require physically taxing labor. While many people do work for their money, others may receive it through inheritance, universal credit, or even lottery winnings. Even if a person depends on their job, its not guaranteed to cause long-term physical harm to their body. If the work becomes harmful, the individual can quit the job and potentially rely on benefitssomething that would allow them to maintain financial stability without enduring physical harm.It is also worth noting that in the U.K., where both the original poster and I are from, maintenance payments are adjusted according to income, providing a degree of financial autonomy while minimizing the risk of physical hardship. If a job is harming someone, they can leave, and the maintenance will be reduced to around 7/week while they are on benefits. This is far from ideal but still represents a flexibility that doesnt result in permanent or life-altering physical changes, as is the case with pregnancy.Ultimately, while financial responsibility is a serious issue, it doesn't violate bodily autonomy in the same way pregnancy or abortion does. The ability to quit a job or adjust ones income to minimize harm to the body highlights that financial obligations, even when burdensome, are fundamentally different from the profound, irreversible physical consequences of pregnancy.","title":"CMV: You can't be pro-abortion and support unconditional child maintenance."},{"text":"I just want to know what color the Republicans are going pick for their new tent cities?After his new policies crash the global economy and millions of American are homeless, you still gonna pick Red as the color for your new tent home?","title":"Foreign leaders react as Donald Trump wins 2024 U.S. presidential election"},{"text":"He is going to make China pay Americans to buy eggs the same way he made Mexico pay Americans to build a wall.

Now we must learn to live in an America where an overwhelming number of our fellow citizens have chosen a president who holds the most fundamental values and traditions of our democracy, our Constitution, even our military in contempt, David Frum writes.Perhaps the greater and more insidious danger is not political repression or harassment, but corruption, he continues.? As the result of a massive shift in the countrys bureaucratic culture, Trump-connected companies will prosper, even as America becomes less safe for consumers, for workers, for children, for all of us.But the most difficult, most agonizing changes are the ones that will now take place deep inside our society, Frum writes. Radicalization of a part of the anti-Trump camp is inevitable. A parallel process will take place on the other side of the political spectrum, as right-wing militias, white supremacists, and QAnon cultists are reenergized by the election of the man whose behavior they have, over eight years, learned to imitate.There were many chapters of history in which America did the wrong thing for years or decades. Maybe we are living through such a period now, Frum continues. Or maybe the truth is that democracy is always a close-run thing, always in contention. If so, then we too mustas people in other failing democracies have learned to dofind new ways to champion wobbling institutions and threatened ideas. For supporters of the American experiment in liberal democracy, our only hope is education, organization, and the creation of a coalition of people dedicated to defending the spirit of the Constitution, the ideals of the Founders, the dream of freedom. More concretely: public civic-education campaigns to replace the lessons no longer taught in schools; teams of lawyers who can fight for the rule of law in courts; grassroots organizing, especially in rural and small-town America; citizens and journalists working to expose and fight the enormous wave of kleptocracy and corruption that will now engulf our political system.Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/pN1uZ4dY](https://theatln.tc/pN1uZ4dY)?

The average person is a complete idiot. We know social media has made this worse. People vote for Trump because he will say anything and they are too dumb to know either it can't happen the way he says it will or just don't understand the broad topics. You could poll people right after they voted for him and ask them what tariffs mean. I guarantee that over half think it means the country we get the goods from pays a higher price. Having abortion bans. Do you think a MAGA person that is watching his wife die isn't going to want to get her help? Of course they will. But they don't understand the implications of a doctor losing their medical license or a hospital being sued. They will turn you away. I can't tell you how many Trump supporters are using Obamacare.

Oh and back then they could deny you for preexisting conditions or you paid more. The Republican party has done a master class of making up enemies. Now it's immigrants. And along with immigrants fentanyl. Do you know how much illegal drugs are brought through actual checkpoints by US citizens? Like 80% How many illegal immigrants can you name? I've lived all over and can't tell you one that I'm certain is. Who do you think is hiring them? I would guess probably mostly conservative people that have farms or are using them for some sort of construction labor. Why because they will do the same job for less money. Ok so great we need to deport them. Who does those jobs now? You think the employers are going to pay US citizens way more money to do the same work for free? Of course not, they are going to jack up building prices and your food. I mean I can go on and on. And ultimately as evidenced by the election people don't care because they are dumb.

Other men were bragging about how they dont give their wives a chance, they just fill out their mail-in ballots for them. Bragged that their wives were happy to, said their brains werent meant to think about politics. And then there was a new wave of posts demanding the 19th Amendment be abolished.The truth is that a lot of men (not all, but more than you think) are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists. Even if they dont exactly hate women, they think they are inherently inferior beings (or separate but equal at best) and need to be put in their place as domestic helpmeets and babymakers in order to restore the natural order and RETVRN to prosperity for mediocre men by reducing competition in the workforce.

In that case I do understand the backlash and I'm sure many others do too. So you tell me what the solution is here. Do we build gender-neutral bathrooms for them or what?  \\nBut if you are also referring to transgender women who have gone through all medical, legal and social hurdles to be able to officially say that their gender is female, then is it really fair to them to not allow them in the bathrooms all because of their chromosomes, even though they satisfy all other criteria?But yes I do agree that there must be some form of barriers to entry. \\"protecting the children from indoctrination\\"If it is all forms of indoctrination such as political, religious etc indoctrination then I can get behind this. But we cannot just pick and choose at the end of the day. Indoctrination of children is indoctrination after all, regardless of what doctrine they are being told is the truth.\\"giving power back to the parents over their own children\\"mind to elaborate a bit on this?\\"blocking schools from brainwashing kids\\"So I assume this has to do with sexuality education in schools and the teaching of a few topics that may be contentious such as those in history and sociology? Well then all I can say here is that just expose the children to sexuality education as they approach puberty and teach it objectively with nuance, and for contentious topics teach it objectively with nuance once again. I mean, if the facts are presented, it won't be brainwashing anymore right? But it does depend on what are \\"facts\\" to one and \\"propaganda\\" to another right? But at the end of the day isn't it the objective of schools to impart a sense of critical thinking laced with objectivity and nuance to students? So I don't really see how it is brainwashing provided the aforementioned criteria are met. However, I must concede that schools are not the place for brainwashing or indoctrination of any kind, be it political or religious.now, I won't pretend to be knowledgeable enough to comment on Trump's economic policies so no comment there mate.

Through these grants researchers are paid, students are paid and treatments for diseases are found. I really hope  we (U.S) remain leaders in multiple fields despite this. The abortion ban is also on the table, although I personally think I would not have one if I was if the situation I think people should have the right to choose. At times medical abortions are also necessary for the health of the mother who may be forced to carry a deadbaby to full term endangering her life. In texas several women have already lost their lives because doctors could not perform the procedure. Which circles back to the science thing. People with no experience or education in the field should have no business regulating it. Climate change is another thing, but my msg is already tldr.

Two things -  she wanted prisoners released from prison (claiming that she was concerned for their health),  and she wanted mail in ballots.     Months before the election.    It was obvious then what they were intending to do.   The prisoners became their hustlers.   People that had no qualms about bending the law, who the Democrats had leverage on,  who could be used to harvest or fill out ballots.    I believe this strategy was leveraged across multiple states,  though admittedly they did it different in each state.  The whole operation was very decentralized.    They got caught pretty badly in Georgia though.  I believe their game plan this election was to do a similar scheme using illegals,  but it never quite materialized.

With this day now coming, what exactly will he do?"},{"text":"Part of the path forward has to be policy change and not just messaging.The Democrats got out of step with where America is. This has happened before. In the 1980s the Democrats were on their heels and Reagan dominated politics. Democrats were tax and spend liberals who were soft on crime. Clinton resuscitated the party around the economy. He had policy changes and focused much more on job growth rather than social welfare spending.Democrats have to get tougher on immigration. This really is the number one Achilles heel. If they dont do this Republicans will have a persistent advantage for a generation. Democrats got on the wrong side of the discussion on social issues. Some of this was pushed by Republicans. But Democrats have no ability to stop the runaway train around social progressivism. People dont like cancel culture and they want to move more slowly on DEI and other top-down government approaches to legislate social equality. This is probably a more difficult issue for Democrats because theres what feels like a genetic defect among Democrats to understand the pulse of American society on these issues and to move at a pace that Americans will accept. Instead the instinctive tendency is to always move faster and then to call people racist if society doesnt just accept it.Democrats are actually quite good on the economy. However, the decades-long transition that cant be ignored is that Democrats went from the party of working class labor to the party of liberal elites. The people that benefited from higher education and the Internet age became Democrats, and everybody else got left behind. Economic inequality is the fundamental dividing line between the parties now, and education level is the key that determines your socio-economic class and party affiliation. Just saying Democrats want to be the working class party isnt going to work. Its fundamental alignment is with educated people with higher paying jobs and that wont change anytime soon.","title":"whats next for democrats?"},{"text":"Do you purposely leave out temporarily or are you just obtuse?

If Dems win the House, Trump is muted. And depends on how many Senate seats Dems nab.If Dems can salvage that, he's not gonna be able to do most of what he says he wants to do. But with that being said, this is what happens when you don't focus on the bigger picture and make impulsive choices. Trump calls himself a fixer, and he will be given a leash to fix things, but the leash is short....elections in two years. And if Trump does cause an economic slide, Dems will probably at least even the Senate again potentially in two years and win back the House if they don't win it tonight. There's actually a good chance of that occurring if Dems don't totally lose motivation.A lot of the things Trump has said he would do, people either don't take him seriously about doing or don't consider the ramifications if he did. There's a reason leading economic markers and experts opposed Trump, but Americans don't listen to them and don't care what they have to say because they feel they're elitist, which makes it really difficult to break through with folks.","title":"Inflation pain helped secure Trump win but his policies mean higher prices"},{"text":"God this comment aged like a pile of shit on a hot day lmao","title":"Donald Trump lawsuit served at Mar-a-Lago: Election Day court filing"},{"text":"Exactly, we are still feeling the effects of Reagan?","title":"Megathread: Donald Trump is elected 47th president of the United States"},{"text":"Sucks for them but our economy is in the shitter and Id much rather flood our economy and families with billions rather than export war to people and places Ill never set foot","title":"Trump victory to reverberate through global economy"},{"text":"\\"Everyone get out and vote, this is to save democracy!\\"#\\"No not like that!!\\"","title":"BREAKING: Donald J.

BUUUT they only studied trans people. Would they find the same characteristics in classical tomboys? Or feminine but straight men? Nobody knows because that hasn't been studied.  \\n[This study here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34030966/) says \\"Rather than being merely shifted towards either end of the male-female spectrum, transgender persons seem to present with their own unique brain phenotype.\\" Once again, they only studied trans people. Would they find the same unique brain structure in people suffering from body dysmorphia? Nobody knows because they didn't study that.  \\nIn my first link they also caution \\"Although the use of MRI scans has increased in recent decades few such studies have focused on transgender people. Its a new research field...\\"  \\nWhat the science is conclusive on, however, is that your very thoughts can change your brain chemistry and brain structure. Do these unique brain characteristics cause people being trans, or does someone being trans cause these characteristics?  \\nOnce again, nobody knows. So for you to outright say \\"I'm right, you're wrong\\" is rather dogmatic, and reeks of \\"trust the science bro\\".  \\nConfident? Yes. Wrong? You have no idea and neither does \\"the science\\".","title":"Trump and Vance make anti-transgender attacks central to their campaigns closing argument"},{"text":"Dear Lord, thank you for helping steer this country back to your guiding light and wisdom.
