But in reality there is a third option in this situation. If a link was found between a vaccine and autism, the third option is to replace it with a different vaccine or treatment that maybe doesnt cause autism. What baffles me is people getting so angry about the link even being studied. I know its been studied over the years. But technology is constantly improving. More data is being collected. Studies have been known to be open to outside influence in the past. There are plenty of reasons to welcome further studies.People will defend sending billions to Ukraine but will get all hot and bothered if someone suggests we spend a relatively insignificant sum on further studies into the link between vaccines and autism. Its true that autism cases have risen significantly over the last few decades and its also possible that this isnt only to do with additional education etc. Ask yourself why you get such a visceral, angry, knee jerk reaction to someone even questioning big pharma. Could it be that youve been programmed to react in that way by the mainstream media? Big pharma spend a fortune annually on sponsoring pretty much all mainstream media channels.

He proceeded to describe a port in California that held over a dozen full shipping containers as evidence for a broken supply chain.Very curious where this sustained pressure on DonOLD was when he was making these dipshit claims for the last 8 years? The big name print and broadcast press outlets REFUSED to pressure him on these kinds of issues because he would abruptly walk out and freeze out the outlets that did.

The original paper that hypothesized this idea was retracted, and the man who composed it was found to have conflicts of interest. But his lie has been gripped by the scientifically ignorant (or the vaccine skeptical) as a reason to continue to demonize Vaccines. This argument, based on a lie, has been debunked multiple times, and continuing to pursue the idea that Vaccines must (again) be investigated because they MIGHT cause Autism demonstrates not a desire for scientific rigor, but continued skepticism in the face of established studies.Secondly, you also bring a Straw Man Fallacy to the table. You suggest that people who are skeptical of the idea of investigating a link between Vaccines and Autism are people who want to see people who are Vaccinated DEVELOP Autism. Why would you want children to keep getting Autism, if a link was found? Nobody said they wanted to see children get Autism.

The US seems really focused on race as skin color, but around the world, there are many more ways we discriminate: religion, ethnicity, nationality (see the 'polish plumber'), etc.The problem with these discriminations is that they highly contribute to people being poor.If landlords in 'nice' areas won't rent to X category people (polish, black, muslim, have a weird accent, look foreign, etc), they'll live in a worse area with more crime and worse schools.If a teacher has a bias, then X kids will get a wirse education (worse relations with the teacher(s)).If employers won't hire X people because they're perceived as less competent, they'll make less money.\\n(Edit: And yes, those things are usually illegal. It doesn't mean that people don't do them, they just do them under another excuse).So yes, the problem of poverty and discrimination are linked.  But presenting discrimination as the one and only issue and disregarding poverty is a huge problem with the discourse today. And it's becoming true in more and more countries  because the US is exporting it's views on racism as the only thing that matters and politician gleefully exploit it because it's much easier to get their electors to hate someone than try to solve poverty and real economic issues.

There are many factors to this: education is valued less because historically it hasn't been a real tool for social mobility and wealth accumulation in that community, the community is generally low-income which means that parents have less time to help kids outside of school, property prices are low so schools are less well funded, etc etc.And yes, some of these reasons are historically rooted in racism.BUTHow this problem is presentented today to Americans is: (I am exaggerating on purpose to make a point here)Right wing: black people are stupid and want to be criminals instead of studying.Left wing: black people are victims of racism and have no agency in their lives which are controlled by the evil white hegemony.If the discourse didn't stard with 'black people' but 'low income' or 'historically disadvantaged', the discourse could be about how to make the educational system work for people in these situations. Suddenly, we're talking about someone in a type of situation rather than a type of person.Skin color is an innate characteristic (though arguably 'race' has a shifting definition, see irish, italian, etc), but how society serves people is something that can be changed.Why tie something that can be changed to something that can't?(And this is not to say that racism, individual or institutional, doesn't exist and isn't an issue.

The concept of \\"whitelash\\" is a real and painful reaction to the progress of Black Americans, and the examples you bring up are valid and crucial to understanding the setbacks that have occurred.However, I think it's important to consider that racism isn't the only thing holding America back. I would argue that capitalism also plays a significant role in these issues. The way capitalism functions often prioritizes the profit of a few over the wellbeing of many, and racism has been used historically to justify the exploitation of Black Americans and other marginalized groups to maintain this system. When people are divided along racial lines, its easier for those in power to continue exploiting labor and resources without facing unified opposition.Take the War on Drugs you mentioned, while its often framed as a response to crime or social issues, it was also a way to incarcerate Black and Brown communities, keeping them out of the workforce and preventing any significant challenge to the capitalist system. Even more recently, the rise of P2025 you mentioned can be seen as an attempt to maintain this economic structure that keeps wealthy elites in power, using division and fear as tools.So, while racism is a major factor that slows down progress and harms many communities, I think its the intersection of racism with capitalism that truly inhibits societal advancement. In a system where the rich get richer and the poor stay divided, progress for anyone who challenges the status quo becomes difficult.In the end, until we address both systemic racism and the exploitative nature of capitalism, lasting progress for marginalized communities will remain elusive. I agree with LBJs quote, but I would also add that those in power will continue to manipulate divisions to maintain their dominance, racism is just one of the tools in that toolbox.","title":"CMV: Racism is what holding Americas progress back."},{"text":"Oh boy, trolls out this morning already.","title":"Very wholesome Trump moment"},{"text":"Asked by Xi to Trump, whats an inauguration ?","title":"Trump invites China's Xi to next month's inauguration"},{"text":"No, selfishness and individualism is what is holding America back, racism is just one of the many symptoms","title":"CMV: Racism is what holding Americas progress back."},{"text":"It's bullshit.

No leftist is going to like to hear this, but America is basically a center-right country. It has been for decades. The people are willing to accept economic populism that has the potential to improve their lives (via Democrats like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama), but they have no interest in left-wing social dogma that runs up against individualism, merit, upward mobility, law and order and self-reliance. The sort of people who come to this country are individualists interested in improving their own station in life economically. They have zero interest in overturning the social order -- and this is especially true of culturally conservative Latinos. The Democrats would be wise to return to their economic focus and try to co-opt certain (current) Republican talking points about trade in order to influence and recapture the white working class in the center of the country.

For instance, looking at the NYT lawsuit I have a very hard time seeing damages for factual information and stylistic elements gleaned from old news articles. The future market for copyrighted news publications seems like it would mostly lie in the ability to make reference to the material, which would remain unaffected by the dissemination of factual and stylistic elements for model training. The main value in news lies in temporal relevance and ability to attract readers, which isnt devalued by using it to train a model in this manner. But setting aside the specific context, my main counterpoint to this is that there is no actual detriment or devaluation to the body of work that occurs during model training. All such problems arise during use of the tool for inference, and thus the education/research/utility of the copyrighted work for training has little bearing on the use of the model by private actors. For example, see the Betamax case: Directly copying media to VHS is totally fine because time shifting is fair use. Does this new tool present some opportunities for abuse by bad actors (piracy)? 100% yes. However, the new time shifting technology was allowed by fair use as settled precedent; we go after individual bad actors rather than the VHS manufacturers (Sony).I wont respond to 1-3 because I disagree on a technical basis (see caveat; not trying to be rude but these are not specific enough).","title":"CMV: OpenAI model training constitutes fair use"},{"text":"There is no such data.

The vaccines have nearly eradicated them. In order to find out the *real* percentage of disease contraction and death/disability vs the autism rate ... we'd have to stop vaccinating and wait for kids to die to get the true stats. ALL of the current vaccines are for diseases that cause mortality or disability -- diseases we have already studied ad nauseum and developed preventive measures for. We have a vaccine because the disease is lethal on a large scale, otherwise why have a vaccine at all? Currently, vaccines are saving hundreds of millions, if not in the billions, of lives (based on world population and vaccine access). That is a much greater percentage than autism. I really don't want to find out the true risk vs reward benefit because that will mean we have a lot of dead kids on our hands. Also, the one vaccine parents have conspiracy theories about is the MMR vaccine only because it's given around the one year mark and autism signs often emerge around that time. Correlation does not equal causation. MMR is the measles vaccine. Measles is highly contagious and kills a lot of kids... we already know this, so why play around to find out again just so we can determine if the predictably high number of blind or dead kids outweighs the number of autistic ones? It sounds like cruel experimentation when we've already had the research for decades.Wanna know what a likelier cause is?

Because zoning law is a complex topic that requires the reconsideration of decades of infrastructural planning, the American car culture, and a confrontation with our past vis-a-vis redlining and racism. So we dont do that, even though there is correlation (which does not imply causation) between rates of autism and proximity to major highways. The general idea may be exposure to brake dust, tire and asphalt particles, and exhaust: air quality issues.But we dont talk about that, because the solution is complex, expensive, and rooted in acknowledging the unhealthy practices of our nation. We focus on Vaccines because theyre simple, and inexpensive to scale down.The entire argument of we should address the question of Autism and Vaccination (let me be clear: Im not saying that Autism and Vaccination is related, since that claim has been debunked multiple times and the origins in this century come from a now retracted Lancelet article) is rooted in the idea that some negative aspect of our society can be resolved through a simple and easy solution.

Fluoridation. Vaccination. Trans-Healthcare. Abortion.

In a Keynesian economy where supply &amp; demand are the only thing controls prices, not costs, stripping demand will result in a glut of supply which then results in a price reduction for the precious few who do buy whatever the supply is. Stripping prices back to a break even point will result in more demand, which will then result in a price rise, until the price is too high &amp; demand drops and the cycle repeats. Now if we cut prices back beyond costs, as Trump is basically suggesting when he wants to double the prices of your imports, we will eventually eliminate supply, and as a result get rid of the price problem.

CNN retracting the story on Scaramucci: CNN wouldnt retract an article and force three journalists to resign if it was only about editorial standards. Forcing resignations implies they knew the article was false or misleading and it was gross misconduct. The retraction itself and the resignations mean the story lacked facts (and that makes it a lie)2. CNN misreporting Don jr email about hacked DNC docs: The original report said don received insider access before the documents were public, this frames him as being complicit in a crime and is a very serious accusation to make. This false claim was headline news and was heavily weaponised against Trump. A simple correction after the damage was done doesnt excuse the initial misleading intent, which is completely reckless at best and complete dishonesty at worst. How many people do you think saw the quiet little correction compared to who saw the initial story?3. ABC lying about Flynn testimony: Brian Ross falsely reported flynn would testify that Trump directed him to contact russia during the campaign. He was literally later suspended for this misreporting, and ABC had to issue a correction. This is easily verifiable through widely available sources online, so asking for more sources is lazy deflection on your part. 4.Time claiming the MLK bust was removed:\\nThe claim went viral and painted Trump as racist within hours of him taking office. The correction came only after significant public backlash. Reporting a baseless accusation without verifying it reflects either gross negligence or intentional maliciousness. Even if it was a mistake, its irresponsible journalism and coincidentally they never seem to make these mistakes against their own side5. NYT claiming Trump hid a climate report:\\nThe report falsely accused Trump of suppressing a public document, implying wrongdoing. If journalists cant verify the availability of a government report and instead speculate publicly, they are either incompetent or intentionally misleading. This claim directly harmed Trumps credibility on climate issues. You probably think Trump is bad on the climate. How many of the reasons why are lies? Makes you wonder. 6. New York Times 17 intelligence agencies claim:\\nThe narrative was widely repeated to inflate the credibility of the Russian interference claims even though we now know that there was no evidence for Russian collusion at all. Their correction proves the original statement was false.Super misleading and desperately trying to convince people of a story that wasnt even true\\n7. BBCs claim about Trump and the G20 earpiece: you hit a paywall and asked for more sources: photos and video evidence disproved it. If they published a story accusing Trump of snubbing translation without verifying visual proof, it shows either incompetence or dishonesty. You could easily find the evidence yourself, so demanding more sources from me is yet another lazy deflection.8. Hunter laptop and 50 intelligence officials: Major outlets constantly reported the intelligence officials completely baseless claims about Russian disinfo without investigating the laptop. This created a false narrative that directly influenced public opinion - at a very crucial time. The officials free speech doesnt absolve the medias responsibility to vet their claims before broadcasting them. Dismissing this as not media-related is literally absurd.9. Trump-Russia collusion claims and the Mueller ReportThe Mueller Report explicitly states it found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia. While it mentioned obstruction concerns, the lack of collusion vindicated Trump. The media, however, spent years pushing the opposite narrative without any proof whatsoever. And it clearly managed to brainwash many people into thinking its true. Even in the face of evidence to the contrary you still think its true. 10. Lafayette Park protest clearing: Investigations later proved the clearing was unrelated to Trumps photo op. The medias initial framing was not cautious or uncertain but definitive, accusing Trump of ordering an attack on peaceful protesters. This was a serious accusation and, given its disproval, is also completely reckless or deliberate lying.My review of your overall attempt to dismantle my points:You rely heavily dismissals, mistakes and corrections after the fact to try to excuse clear media failures and liesMost of my examples show either gross incompetence or wilful intent to harm Trumps reputation. Even if its incompetence its done in a reckless way and always only to Trump. You never see ABC or CNN accidentally report something that is hugely damaging to Biden If you need more sources, you can find them yourself the burden isnt on me to provide endless proof for widely documented events.

I also love horror and have never really been bothered by medical gore type stuff, so that's probably just me having a higher tolerance than the average person watching it. I just saw what happened to her throughout the movie and wondered how they did the effects with the occasional physical cringe thrown in.It was wild how much the audience reaction varied. In my first showing on opening weekend, I went with the friend who recommended it. We were both laughing our asses off through the ending sequence and how absurd it got, but we were the only ones laughing in a roughly half full theater. My second viewing was with another friend who I recommended it to. She was just watching that ending sequence with a very confused expression and mouth slightly agape, which made me laugh even harder than the first time. That theater was full and was an even mix of laughing and people audibly reacting to the gross parts. The third viewing was about a third full and everyone laughing at the end. That was also after it'd been out for a few weeks at a smaller theater, so probably people rewatching who have that fucked up sense of humor.Anyway, probably my favorite movie of the year.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 13, 2024"},{"text":"No, thats not it","title":"Whoops!

It all comes down to one fundamental notion. Republicans believe that only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities, that only *they* are entitled to the god-given rights and freedoms afforded to them in the Constitution.And yes, this notion is steeped in feelings of superiority and a far right, authoritarian mentality.These people believe that they are exempt from the law, while they demand strict obedience from their inferiors.It's textbook...Not just the projection, hypocrisy and double standards, but the scapegoating and fearmongering especially. They get away with it because they run on a platform of identifying scapegoats and enemies as a unifying cause. They whip themselves up into a patriotic frenzy, rallying around this compulsive need to eliminate every perceived threat to *their* country, *their* culture, *their* race, *their* religion, their very identity.And by accomplishing this, they can effectively justify anything, any action, any motive, any law, any measure, even any violence in the name of defending themselves from these illusive dangers.","title":"Meta, Amazon and tech CEOs make $1 million investments in Trump's inauguration"},{"text":"But 2020 was the most secure election ever","title":"B.C. joins Ontario in threatening energy cuts to U.S. over Trump tariffs"},{"text":"They're not Christians, they're sociopaths who have a Christian mask they like to wear whenever they want to say or do hateful cruel things and get away with it.?","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"But sir, those are ours.","title":"Why isn't the military shooting down these drones. ..

They're like 5% for Wisconsin, 7% for Pennsylvania, and 11% in NC. There is something like 350k bullet ballets in NC. The thing that is really concerning is that no one's talking about the 80 bomb threats in voting sites specifically ones that have a high number of Democrats. And again they only occurred in swing states. There's no way he won ever swing state, the house and debate e with less votes than last election without cheating. Somehow in several states down ticket candidates got more votes than Harris. In Arizona something like 99% of precincts showed Harris getting less than the down ticket candidate.","title":"B.C. joins Ontario in threatening energy cuts to U.S. over Trump tariffs"},{"text":"Why are people surprised ?

That specific encoding is a deterministic formatting change which I believe is well-established as fair use (don't go trying to sue a research library for encrypting your eBook), but if there is caselaw saying otherwise that would obviously change my view.Training with that embedding will depend on the type of model and style of training (different training approaches are obviously going to look slightly different), but typically you would run a forward pass of various embeddings through the model, score the output (whether by predicting the next element of the sequence or evaluating the generative output) and backpropagate an error loss function using that score to tune the model parameters and weights. And if you want to get REALLY specific...when these processes are executed on a GPU, you are sampling/vectorizing/parallelizing the operations to such an extend that, even in a transient form, the constituent elements are utterly unrecognizable.I don't find this type of argument particularly compelling because the only non-transient elements are just a bunch of parameter values/weights on a graph...and they are regularly updated during training iterations. Intuitively, trying to frame a copyright argument on the basis of the variables being tuned seems like a nonstarter, if for no other reason than you are trying to claim that they haven't sufficiently transformed something that is, by definition, regularly changing.","title":"CMV: OpenAI model training constitutes fair use"},{"text":"Electoral college is the real dumpster fire","title":"What a circus: eligible US voters on why they didnt vote in the 2024 presidential election |\\nNearly 90 million Americans didnt vote C which is more than the number of people who voted for Trump or Harris"},{"text":"The pro-life party everyone.","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"The only people dumber than Trump supporters are those who let Trump win by not doing the bare minimum and voting against him.","title":"Trump already walking back core campaign promise on prices, inflation"},{"text":"Why","title":"Trump Vows To Eliminate Daylight Saving Time"},{"text":"But the number of daylight hours is the same","title":"Trump says he will seek to eliminate daylight saving time"},{"text":"There's a reason they're sweating Kash taking charge.","title":"Someone In Power Seems To Be Really Afraid Of Trump's \\"Second Bite At The Apple\\""},{"text":"This is why we are going to live for another four years in a dumpster fire.","title":"What a circus: eligible US voters on why they didnt vote in the 2024 presidential election |\\nNearly 90 million Americans didnt vote C which is more than the number of people who voted for Trump or Harris"},{"text":"same as most of Christianity, they totally missed the important part of the bible, that woman was created from a mans rib so they would be equal partners and respect each other.","title":"Republicans take aim at subsidies that help tens of millions of women"},{"text":"Sure glad people tried as hard as they could to beat him by showing up and voting /s","title":"Trump already walking back core campaign promise on prices, inflation"},{"text":"I thought it was Jimmy Carter and the deep state. /s","title":"Trump Is About to Betray His Rural Supporters"},{"text":"So, he will. theWeave, I understand it.","title":"Trump Wont Say If Hed Allow Israel To Annex The West Bank As Gaza Suffers"},{"text":"He plans to deport that extra hour that keeps showing up and then disappearing every year.","title":"Trump says he will seek to eliminate daylight saving time"},{"text":"He still really wants to nuke something.","title":"Trump says he will seek to eliminate daylight saving time"},{"text":"Ok Trump haters!

Heres why:1. Youre underestimating how historians judge presidenciesBidens legacy wont be defined by debates or approval ratings in the way youre describing. Historians evaluate leaders based on the broader impact of their policies, not the 24/7 news cycle takes. Think about Harry Trumanhe left office with abysmal approval ratings but is now celebrated for his foreign policy achievements and rebuilding post-WWII America. Similarly, Bidens work on infrastructure, climate, and international diplomacy (like rallying NATO against Russian aggression) is the kind of stuff historians love to elevate over time.2. Isolationism is cyclical, but leadership during crises mattersYou argue no one cares about foreign policy, but Bidens handling of the Ukraine war and reinforcing global alliances are exactly the kinds of achievements that are re-evaluated positively down the road. Much like how Carters emphasis on human rights became a cornerstone of modern diplomacy, Bidens global stance could be seen as stabilizing during a tumultuous period.3. Biden vs. Trump is not the only narrativeYou frame his legacy entirely around Trump, but thats shortsighted. Theres a good chance that the long-term narrative will focus on Biden as a stabilizing figure after a volatile administration, much like Gerald Ford is remembered as bringing dignity back to the presidency post-Nixon. A return to boring governance isnt as dramatic, but it often ages better historically.4. Impotence vs. pragmatismYou liken him to Carter, but thats not accurate. Carter struggled with stagflation and Iran; Biden inherited COVID, inflation, and global instabilityand actually passed major legislation during a polarized era. His ability to work with Congress, even in divided times, will probably be viewed more favorably as the dust settles.5. Senility narrative is mostly partisan spinThe senility trope you mention says more about political spin than reality. Reagan faced similar attacks, and yet most Americans now remember him as a strong leader. The same could happen with Biden, especially as his accomplishments start to outshine the sound bites.6. Redemption arc isnt necessary for every presidentCarters post-presidency humanitarian work is impressive, but not every leader needs a redemption arc. Bidens success will ultimately depend on how his policies hold up, not whether he gets a post-office halo.At the end of the day, contemporary opinions are always noisy. Bidens presidency might feel underwhelming to some now, but history isnt written in real time. If his legislative accomplishments (like the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure investments) have tangible long-term benefits, people will eventually see him as a transformational figure.

I think that one *cannot* be a Democratic activist and abandon women, visible or invisible minorities, sexual minorities, etc. That doesn't mean I believe we must be perfect; I understand our coalition will have very different ideas of what support means, and I would rather work with people who fumble but try, then never try or actively oppose things in the first place.4\\\\. The reason I'm leaving this response here is, I think many people in their own fight against the forces we deal with have very ingrained ideas of what our opponents look like and sound like.From my perspective, the most difficult thing to address it that it is easier - though still too difficult for many - to fight people visibly opposing us.It is much, much, harder to confront people you thought were good, who would stand by you, or those you love, and are now saying they will happily abandon you and not lose a night's sleep.   To me, people cannot speak of class consciousness if they are talking about redistribution of wealth from minorities and women to young men, and in the last few days I have seen a lot of that kind of talk.    \\nEpisode 8 went into this a bit, and again, you and I would absolutely be for - and have been! for years! - about helping young men, but... C'est la vie.   The fight is difficult, and people are often disappointing.  \\nBut the world is beautiful, and even disappointing people *can be worth fighting for.*   \\nI feel if a tired old misanthrope like myself can feel that way, anyone can.Thank you for writing these. More 'positive' - not that this wasn't entirely negative - feedback will be up in the daily, aha.\\nI am very grateful for not just *that* you presented these topics, but *how* you did.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 12, 2024"},{"text":"Best we can do is the Oval Office: The American people","title":"Trump ordered to sit for deposition next week in his defamation case against ABC News"},{"text":"I just saw a news clip where Ocean County Sheriffs Dept. was launching their own drones to intercept them, but they evade detection because they don't give off heat like regular drones.","title":"Trump Posts About The Drones - Project Blue Beam Incoming?"},{"text":"Sad, but true.  \\nJust like their leader  -  always projection &amp; blame the dems.

This statement comes in the context of some Republican lawmakers criticizing federal EV tax credits and other policies that benefit Tesla. Key Points- Musk reminded Republicans that Tesla employs over 30,000 people in California alone, with thousands more jobs supported through its suppliers.\\n- He emphasized that these are American manufacturing jobs, a point of particular interest to many Republican politicians.\\n- Musk's statement was made during a discussion about U.S. manufacturing at the New York Times DealBook Summit. Political Context- Some Republican lawmakers have been critical of EV tax credits and other policies that benefit Tesla and other electric vehicle manufacturers.\\n- Musk's comments suggest he's leveraging Tesla's significant employment numbers as a counterargument to these criticisms. Musk's Political Stance- Despite his warning, Musk has generally aligned more with Republicans recently, particularly on issues like free speech.\\n- He has criticized the Biden administration and endorsed Republican Ron DeSantis for president in 2024.Musk's statement doesn't indicate ownership of the Republican party, but rather demonstrates his willingness to use Tesla's economic impact as a point of leverage in political discussions. His warning serves as a reminder to Republicans of the potential political consequences of opposing policies that benefit his company and the EV industry at large.","title":"Billionaire traitor, bigot, and racist Elon Musk tells Republican party he OWNS them"},{"text":"I think we quietly take the prize here in NC for gerrymandering.

Essentially, the removal of the FDIC is outlined in Project 2025 as part of general bank deregulation by larger banks who feel they have too many regulators asking the same questions.The FDIC plays more roles than insuring deposits.  The role most banks are upset about is the FDIC is the defacto examiner for safety and soundness along with a banks primary regulator, so many times the FDIC is the 2nd or 3rd voice in the room.  The general view is they are the most conservative voice as the FDIC is the only regulator legally on the hook if the bank fails.  So the theory is remove the FDIC from examination of safety and soundness of the banks and narrow the role to insurer of deposits.  Taking this a step further is desolve the entire agency and put the various functions under treasury, similar to the OCC.  This effectively would kill the most conservative voice in the room.Further, most of the general public do not understand the crisis of 2023.  The President, Treasury Secretary, and FDIC chairman called for a systemic risk exception to insure all deposits at SVB and Signature Bank.  By statute, the banking industry had to pay for the cost of the uninsured deposits at these banks.  The large banks paid billions and an underlying presumption is a focus has been placed upon the FDIC as the agency has special authorities to assess the industry that no other regulators hold.So the Project 2025 playbook that Trump is implementing is asking congress to dissolve the FDIC and have its various functions absorbed by other regulators.  None of this is about the deficit or federal spending as the FDIC is funded by the banking industry, but banks fighting back against regulation.  Its highly unlikely with the slim margins Republicans hold that any of this will happen, but make no mistake that DOGE and the rhetoric of today are about big business interests pressuring regulators.","title":"I mean who needs the FDIC anyway right?"},{"text":"Bummer  I guess all food will come from highly automated corporate farms now.

I'm cautious because I don't like Singal's character, but I don't want people believing shit over a few text words. Can someone fill me in on him or is it hysteria?\\nI actually like the decentralized aspect of BSky but I don't think the mass growth was intended and I feel like people are forgetting to use their own tools to respond... sigh. overreacting is why we alienate other people, I really hate this.

It's basically just handing students a giant and complicated data set over many years and saying \\"Good luck, I hope you're good at inference because we won't actually go over how to construct robust models from this data\\". At least when I was in primary and secondary school the closest we got to this was just learning a bunch of very idiosyncratic causal chains of events with basically no effort on teaching how to properly extrapolate from these chains to the modern world or future. Pattern matching the modern world against these chains is not particularly effective or robust because either a lot of the causally relevant data is omitted or a lot of the included data isn't causally relevant. So you get a lot of weird artifacts in people's mental models. Certainly the bias for schools to teach history chronologically despite the fact that many important lessons from history don't depend much on the chronology is a problem. E.g. if a student wants to answer the question of \\"How/why do wars start and end in general?\\" They shouldn't want to distinguish between wars 2000 years ago and wars 200 years ago. If the resulting model is any good, it should be able to frame the dependencies in technologically-agnostic ways (e.g. information transmission costs or worse/better asymmetric information) culturally agnostic ways, etc. precisely so that it is future proof. But if history is lost taught chronologically it biases the students to overfit mental models to specific time periods. Importantly, it's not clear how this \\"provide data but not inference techniques\\" approach gives people a better forward-looking model at the end than just teaching kids philosophy or economics or psychology or other disciplines focused on predicting agent behavior more directly. E.g. Is it more relevant that Trump pattern matches well against the very specific pattern of Hitler or that he pattern matches well against the more general class of malignant narcissists? We *need* history (the data) insofar as it allows us to generate more accurate forward-looking mental models more economically. But the data is only a small part of that.","title":"Liberal Education and Neoliberalism"},{"text":"Weak young men.

The single best thing he did was win the 2020 election.In the early hours of Jan 6 2021 it seemed like he had pulled the sword from the stone when Georgia miraculously elected two Democratic senators and he got control of both houses of congress. When the insurrection happened a few hours later and what Trump really was finally seemed to become clear to the American people, it felt like a fever was breaking.And like you mentioned he miraculously got the ARP, a climate change bill, an infrastructure bill, CHIPS, Ukraine aid, AUKUS, a gun control bill etc. out of a do-nothing congress featuring Manchin and Sinema. I thought all of that was impossible.But his legacy will forever be the day he walked out on that debate stage looking about 200 years old. Barely able to utter a sentence without drooling on himself. And stubbornly staying in the race for a month after the debate, listening to Hunter Biden over his aides, calling everyone who said he should step aside ageist, and only dropping out when Pelosi made him. Dooming the party to a loss. After repeatedly promising to be a bridge to the next generation.If the best thing he did was win in 2020, the worst thing he did was be so stubborn that he doomed Harris to losing in 2024. Because voters felt like him running in 2024 broke the fundamental promise he made, and acted accordingly. The fundamental message of the Biden campaign in 2024 was \\"I care about you; Trump only cares about himself,\\" but Biden running again made that slogan sound disingenuous at best.It's tragic honestly. He's a fundamentally decent person in the way most politicians aren't.

I don't think you can force education down people's throats. There needs to be a cultural change to excise this anti-intellectualism from society. I fear it is far far too ingrained in society though. It is embedded in pop culture all the way down to cartoons and shows written for children. It is almost innate in children that school is boring and any kid that doesn't conform is ostracized. I wish this was the opposite. I mean I wish kids weren't ostracized, but I think you get my meaning. Until this happens, I fear that any policy change to improve the educational system will fall on deaf ears.None of this is new. Here is a quote from 1987 talking about the same thing.This, then, is the new illiteracy, the illiteracy of those who can read but don't. \\\\[...\\\\] This new illiteracy is more pernicious than the old, because unlike the old illiteracy it does not debar its victims from power and influence, although like the old illiteracy it disqualifies them for it. Those long-dead men and women who learned to read so that they might read the Bible and John Bunyan would tell us that pride is the greatest of all sins, the father of sin. And the victims of the new illiteracy are proud of it. If you don't believe me, talk to them and see with what pride they trumpet their utter ignorance of any book you care to name.Gene Wolfe, \\"From a house on the Borderland\\", Horrorstruck (1987); reprinted in Gene Wolfe, Castle of Days (1992)Another from 1954Unreason and anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies nonconformity; and nonconformity implies heresy; and heresy implies disloyalty  so, obviously, thinking must be stopped. But shouting is not a substitute for thinking and reason is not the subversion but the salvation of freedom.Adlai Stevenson, A Call to Greatness (1954), p. 99And another, from 1963Anti-intellectualism  first got its strong grip on our ways of thinking because it was fostered by an evangelical religion that also purveyed many humane and democratic sentiments. It made its way into our politics because it became associated with our passion for equality. It has become formidable in our education partly because our educational beliefs are evangelically egalitarian. Hence, as far as possible, our anti-intellectualism must be excised from the benevolent impulses upon which it lives by constant and delicate acts of intellectual surgery which spare these impulses themselves.Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (1963), pp. 22-23I feel that last one really gets are the heart of the matter. How many times have you heard that \\"everyone's opinion matters\\"? How many times has a debate on climate change been one wacko versus one scientist? That is the egalitarian way. Most people's opinions do not matter and are not relevant. A debate on the news over climate change shouldn't be one wacko versus a scientist. Based on the consensus in climate science, it should be 97 climate scientists versus 3 climate scientists.How do we get out of this? I don't know. I am quite pessimistic these days and think that maybe we need the idiots to absolutely ruin everything before we will have a collective realization that knowledge and education matter, but even then, I don't think it will change anything and people will double down. We need to be able to say that the average Joe's opinion on the economy or climate science, etc, doesn't matter. We shouldn't give up all dissent though, but it should be confined to evidence based discussions among subject matter experts, not podcasts from some guy that was an MMA fighter once.I really fear that one day, a war is going to be fought over this between those that care about facts and those that do not.","title":"Liberal Education and Neoliberalism"},{"text":"But he doesnt, hes shown that over and over again.","title":"Trump promising to release the January 6th rioters from prison shows he APPROVED OF THE INSURRECTION"},{"text":"People are too stupid to realize why this is a polarizing issue.

Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to any statewide position in 30 years,  and the Republicans have supermajorities in both state houses, so everything that happens there is 100% because of the GOP. This is why they're the only state with their own isolated power grid, so they can avoid any kind of federal involvement or regulations. And yet, in 2021 when their power grid failed during a blizzard, they were able to successfully convince voters that it was because of the Green New Deal in Washington. The Green New Deal, it should be pointed out, was never even drafted as any kind of legislation, nor did it ever go into effect anywhere, but especially not in Texas, but it didn't matter. Republicans are able to lie to their constituents, and because they have a massive propaganda network of things like Fox, Newsmax, OANN, along with AM radio, local TV networks owned by right wing Sinclair broadcasting, as well as the way they dominate non traditional media like YouTube and podcasts, their voters believed the power grid failure was somehow the Democrats fault. This is how they've been able to get away with doing nothing to address the problems that caused it to fail in 2021, and why another grid collapse is inevitable.","title":"Gov.

If the 2024 house vote showed anything it is that the GOP is not really all that popular with Trump voters. Even when buoyed by Trump, the GOP is on very shaky ground and struggles to eek out the slimiest of margins in the house. The house vote this cycle had the GOP win 220 seats while they won the presidential popular vote. In 2012 the GOP in the house was able to win 234 while they lost the presidential popular vote. IMO our course of action should not be to attack Trump. We don't have to run against Trump again, he will be POTUS for another term and then be done. Attack GOP house reps and senators, if you need a hit list of districts start [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html) in the close races. Along the lines of 'X candidate enables MAGA policy (or appointment) Y, they are weak and they don't stand up to the president, they just go along with him', that, I feel, is the most motivating.We need to focus on turning out our own/undecideds.Harris turned out **more** people proportionally than Obama in 2008.

Where we are now is because of our invertebrate representatives that almost every single one are using their position to enrich themselves while making excuses to their voters. Im not a fucking democrat. Im anti-conservative. Ive never once felt represented in my half century on this planet. We have more than enough wealth in this country concentrated to less than 1,000 people, that we could literally solve poverty, homeless, healthcare, food insecurity, etc. The only reason we havent is because we simply refuse to take a goddamn stand. If our elected officials wont take care of shit, and the Democratic Partys leadership refuses to back any progressives, what else can we do? Wrote our congressman? Send petitions? Peacefully protest? None of it works on either party. Democrats are far better than conservatives in nearly every way, but lets not pretend that their inaction and willingness to back down every single time conservatives have pushed back, no matter how insane their demands are. Personally, I see a violent revolution as the only way to restore any semblance of justice and policies that actually help people. The government is infested in every aspect by white nationalists masquerading as Christian nationalists, and conservative media has spent decades pushing the idea that this is a good thing to people too stupid and selfish to disagree.

A world order in which all other nations are subservient and must submit to the whims of Mr. Trump and the Rasputinesque Elon Musk.Tesla's Elon Musk was played by China's President Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader will continue to pressure Musk in an attempt to win concessions from Trump on issues such as tariffs and Taiwan (just two examples). Musk will fail to influence Trump on these matters as it was central to Trump's platform that, if elected, he would be \\"tough on China\\" in regard to tariffs and imperialistic aggression. Recall in Trump's first administration he did impose tariffs on China and funded defense to counter the perceived CCP military buildup.When Musk fails to win the concessions, Beijing expects Musk to win from the incoming administration, Musk will be out of favor with both the Chinese and the incoming Trump administration. In relation to China, Musk will be revealed as having acted with a conflict of interest and to have placed his business interests over the interests of the U.S.Is one to believe that Beijing is going to carry water for Musk in an environment where the U.S. is engaged in policy Beijing perceives as hostile? Musk bet on extensive manufacturing in China and that makes Tesla economically vulnerable. Musk's China business interests make him subject to Chinese influence and perhaps blackmail. At the end of the day, Musk is a pawn for Xi Jinping the leader of the second largest economy. Xi will crush Musk's Tesla the moment Musk ceases to be a good and obedient ambassador for Beijing.","title":"Xi Jinping Rejects Donald Trump's Inauguration Invitation: Report"},{"text":"Didn't Trump say he didn't care?
