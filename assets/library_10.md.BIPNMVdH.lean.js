Thats what the American people deserve.Ms. Wiles said that the Trump transition team did not intend to sign the G.S.A. agreement because Mr. Trump wanted his transition officials to operate as a self-sufficient organization. This organizational autonomy means a streamlined process that guarantees the Trump Administration is ready on Day 1.She said that declining to sign the G.S.A. agreement meant that the transition would be saving taxpayers money, and she pledged that the transition would not accept donations from foreign sources.The transition already has existing security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight, she added.But White House officials said the decision by the Trump transition team not to accept office space and government technology meant that it would be more difficult to share information with them. Biden administration officials are being instructed to find alternate ways to share information that are still secure, officials said.That could involve providing briefings only in person or offering reading rooms in agency spaces that are secure. It may also mean that Biden administration officials who want to share unclassified electronic information may require Mr. Trumps officials to certify that their nongovernment technology meets certain standards.Trump transition officials did not respond to questions about whether they intended to sign the agreement with the Justice Department.

When I feel into a depression while working in my earlier 20's while still in college right after the 2008-2009 crisis. I had to have surgery on my leg, which left me gaining some weight from it and frankly self image declined. I withdrew, and had a lot of self loathing. I turned to redpill and MGTOW since a lot of the concepts were self improvement. However I also was raised always take in additional view points so I also joined TwoxChromosomes, because I wanted the different viewpoint.Redpill got me in the gym. However I left it when I started finding myself not being as open minded.  \\nMGTOW got me into woodworking. However I left it when more of the conversation became only about \\"value\\" women bring, and the members really didn't listen to each others problems other than blaming women.  \\nTwoxChromosones helped increase my emotional intelligence. Then fundamentally changed my approach to communication, and style while in person.  I still haven't left that community, because I'll see something I find interesting or if I think it's misinformation, or only a partial view. I'll post it there, or respond and usually they will bring sources that will usually kindly correct any inconsistency or ask why I had the viewpoint. Sometimes, I'll get attacked but it's like 1 in 10 occurrences whereas Redpill or MGTOW was like 1 in 5 or 1 in 4.I also read posts there all the time to better inform my view because as a man I cannot have or experience life as a woman so the only way I can empathize is if they tell me. So by hearing their stories, and just listening. It's a really good start towards it. Which they encourage. That was very absent from the other movements. Women will always encourage you to listen, you just have to actually open your ears. Once you've shown you have and will. Then they'd be more likely to listen to you. Gotta earn that trust man. Too many others have shown it shouldn't just be given.That's the fundamental difference I experienced. Which is now how I choose to use as the building block of the communities I use in my life now. The listening first approach, and it's worked extremely for me, and it came from TwoXChromosones not RedPill not MGTOW. The biggest improvement in my life started from random women on the internet arguing with me politely.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Oh yeah I see the update!

America would face a choice: either subsidize buying potash at exorbitant rates, starve its agricultural sector of essential fertilizers, or bleed billions propping up an unsustainable food supply chain. This is how you stop a trade war before it beginsAmericas infrastructure for receiving and distributing potash to its farmers is entirely built around imports from Canada.

As far as the US position is concerned right now, these tariffs wont reduce or disappear without tangible policy changes.?The border stuff is really a non-issue, but they have us dead to rights on defence spending. We were supposed to hit 2% this year with a decade to accomplish this. We cut $1B from defence last year with $2B in more cuts coming over the next two, something that former CDS Tom Lawson called horrific on the West Block 3 weeks ago. Now were defending our track record on a plan that has us saying we need *8 additional years* to hit 2%.

The GC just demonstrated its willing to deficit finance ~$7B+ in essentially an 8-week election bribe.

So theyre essentially boycotting the source of all of the issues that those, again, real or perceived, threats would come from- Ie. You cant be forced to stay in a bad marriage (there have been ideas floated around of outlawing no fault divorce, ie. Divorce without hard cause), carry a baby that is unwanted or will live with crippling disability/ die shortly after birth (abortion bans), or be accused of lying about rape/ sexual assault because of embarrassment if you never have sex in the first place. If stuck to, the most extreme result of the boycott is societal collapse due to so few births. So the government has two options; Either force women into these acts and institutions, proving them right, or repeal all of the laws which, whether you view actions such as abortion as morally right, indifferent, or wrong, objectively reduce their bodily autonomy. MGTOW: Came about as an offshoot of MRA (Mens Rights Activism), of which their only really objectively good policy was fighting for fathers parental rights in custody battles. The rest is either raising awareness with no actual ideas on how to address them, because the proposed solutions are seen as non-masculine (how to reduce suicide rates in men) or place blame on women for *mens* own shortcomings (Incel culture- Women hate nice guys, women hate cultured men, etc.). They dont accept their own failures, instead blaming women for their unhappiness and lack of fulfillment in life. Which is right in their basic philosophy; Swear off women, because *theyre* the source of my problems. My life will be better without them. So in the end; One movement stems from actual societal laws (again, whether you see abortion laws and similar as morally right or not is irrelevant when it comes to the objective reality; They limit what decisions women can make with their own bodies. Whether the act is right or wrong, they're literally being told 'you can not make this immense life decision that will affect you in either direction permanently', by lawmakers who are predominantly male. These laws only affect one sex. They have no effect on men in any capacity). You can point to the motivations in your own laws. Their philosophy boils down to \\"I'm going to not associate with men because then I'm not at risk of breaking the law, being accused of being a liar, or put my life at risk in a dangerous relationship\\". The other movement is by their own philosophy blaming the other sex for *their own* failures. Not that they're being oppressed or being held back in any measurable, objective way. But that the opposite sex is responsible for their financial, moral, and sexual failures. Their philosophy boils down to \\"If I swear off of women, I'll be healthier, more financially successful, and happy. Even speaking to them makes all of these things less likely.\\"","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Cartels != Illegal Immigrants","title":"Why Trump deporting 13 million?"},{"text":"Sounds like another $1 a gallon min.","title":"Trump plans no exemption for oil imports under new tariff plan, sources say"},{"text":"While there were clear flaws with the campaign, people really went out of their way to hold Kamala to a much higher standard than they ask of Trump","title":"The Second Trump Transition Is Starting to Get Ugly"},{"text":"About time.","title":"Local law enforcement prepares to ramp up ICE partnership amid Trump's mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Please tell me he ran on Kitchens table issues","title":"Mississippi Runoff Election Results Thread"},{"text":"Having fun doesnt pay the bills.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. It has been said, Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce. But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.It's funny how Republicans focus so much on things like homosexuality and abortion, yet when faced with an issue that Jesus himself expanded upon, they turn a blind eye.  They seem to know where the first stones will be thrown if it's brought up.Just for context, Jesus spent parts of his ministry speaking against the laws established in the Old Testament, either because the pharisees had corrupted them, or the meaning had been lost.  The 10 commandments were an exception to this.  Rather than dismiss them, he expanded on the meanings of most of them.","title":"Some worry no-fault divorce could change under Trump after Vance said divorce is too easily accessible"},{"text":"What an unelectable vegetable.","title":"The Harris campaign's internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"I walked by an older white couple on the street the other day and they looked right at me (a brown person) and said \\"well, at least after the election the streets will have less traffic.\\"That's how they think of us.

There are cultural expectations of masculinity (not just in regards to women) and the current economic conditions are making them completely unattainable causing a crisis or ideals vs reality making them desperate for an explanation or guidance since nothing your elders say applies to the real world anymore. Lashing out against women is only one of the symptoms that many men are falling through the cracks.

Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health C leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.?Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.?As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all C including the vulnerable C falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity C i.e.? the point at which the rate of new infections is stable C and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.?The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.?Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals.?Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.","title":"Trump names COVID lockdown critic Dr. Jay Bhattacharya as pick for NIH director"},{"text":"I cant tell if youre trying to be funny.","title":"Why Trump deporting 13 million?"},{"text":"Astroturf","title":"The Harris campaign's internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"He started campaigning for his second term one week into his first.

Here, he's applying a true statistic: black people *do* commit more crimes \\"per capita\\", because due to the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and etc., they are more likely to live in areas of concentrated poverty and crime. But the result is behavior that, if all white people followed it, would mean that black people (the vast majority of whom are good, law-abiding people, same as with people of all races) couldn't work for Uber. That'd pretty clearly be awful.Now, personally, I think that most white people who actually refuse to take Ubers with black drivers do so because they believe falsely that there's a high risk of a black Uber driver being dangerous to them (i.e., they have false, racist beliefs). In other words, they're not deciding based on a statistical calculation, they're deciding based on actual hatred or fear of black people. In contrast, many more women make statistical decisions like this when avoiding putting themselves entirely in the power of strange men.Still, you might argue that the same is true for women who refuse to drive with male Uber drivers. It'd be unjust if, just because women want to feel a little more safe, they all refuse to drive in Ubers with men, and as a result men can't make a living driving Uber. I think there's merit to that argument; it wouldn't be fair for a woman to refuse to take Ubers with strange men based solely on statistics.I don't think this argument would apply to crossing the street, as I don't think there's any harm done there. If ALL woman ALWAYS crossed the street to avoid strange men at night, then... precisely nothing bad would happen.And I don't think this argument would apply to a woman who's experienced sexual assault and experiences high anxiety while in the power of strange men. If all such women avoided Ubers with men, men would still be able to make a living as Uber drivers.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Yes.

And there are people of both genders who implement these approaches both negatively or positively.One big difference is that, factually, the 4B movement was born in a seriously misogynistic society where women were supported in having equal agency and opportunities in their lives. It is about women living their lives in a way that preserves their agency and avoids entanglements MGTOW came to birth in a more egalitarian but still significantly misogynistic culture, but the part of men, the gender with more overall agency and opportunities. And the complains werent so much we can make choices for ourselves without women stopping us but much more women arent fulfilling their historically subordinate role, and unfairly using their agency to not date us. A lot more bitter and less reality-based perspective.As another way of looking at it, a lesbian can be 4B and live just fine without really changing anything, or having to do anything hostile to anyone. But gay men generally find MGTOW just stupid and not applicable. They dont blame women for not being able to make choices in their lives, and dont resent women in general for failing them.The difference is because 4B is generally about boundaries: I will do what I choose to do. It doesnt require being negative about men, just male entanglement in an environment where society supports male control over female partners and mothers in general. And 4B has the unless and until society treats us fairly and having equal right to agency and choice as men.While MGTOW pretty much doesnt exist in a non bitterly blaming form. It is womens fault we have to nope out! And its not saying until men and women have equal agency but until women get back to serving and deferring to us properly.As a man, I feel like I could get along with a 4B woman just fine. I dont need all women to be willing to date me! And I support her desire to have equal agency.Conversely, as a man I dont think I would get along MGTOW man. Hes going to say shitty and entitled things about women. Hes going to blame them for his not getting what he wants in the way he wants. Hell talk about how women SHOULDNT have legitimate agency to refuse dating or having sex with them.

They are true about some people, and false about others.That's fair - a stereotype means the idea that all or most people in a group possess a trait - so a stereotype is false.What I'm talking about elsewhere in my argument isn't really a stereotype, it's a \\"true statistical fact\\". One question is when it's OK to make a decision about risks based on statistical facts (X group is more risky than Y group). You're making the argument that it basically never is. You should judge people based upon their individual character, not based upon their demographics.Totally agree. Maybe we disagree on what \\"judging\\" someone means?If a woman crosses the street to avoid me (a man) late at night, I don't feel judged. I don't believe that she thinks I'm a predator. I don't think she thinks anything bad about me, as an individual, at all. I would suspect she probably thinks I'm almost certainly a lovely person. But it's late at night and she wants to stay safe, and it doesn't harm me in any way for her to cross the street; her behavior costs me nothing, costs her essentially nothing, and reduces her (very genuine, if small) risk of being assaulted. Taken over hundreds of encounters with strange men at night, this behavior probably appreciatively decreases her odds of being assaulted, without harming anyone.I worry that to some degree, you might be interpreting me as suggesting that it's OK for this woman to actually judge an individual strange man as morally worse. I don't think that'd be OK at all. I also don't think it'd be OK for her to do something rude or harmful to a perfectly nice, innocent strange man, just to make herself a little safer.Anyway, I think I'm circling back to arguments I've used before that you didn't find convincing, so I should probably wind down.

Good luck getting moderate Rs in close races on board with destroying the government.2. The Supreme Court, for its many flaws, has consistently said no to Trump being a dictator.  If they wanted that, they would've let him stay in office in 2020, or ruled that *Moore vs. Harper* allowed state legislatures to ignore the popular vote in 2023.  They have a shitty philosophy, but they have a philosophy besides \\"Trump can do whatever he wants\\".3. States run their own elections.  That's been a source of frustration to us as red states suppress the vote despite the federal government, but now we can use that fact to protect our elections.  There's an election reporting results literally right now, and there'll be plenty more after January 20th.Trump winning is bad.  And it's anything but business as usual.

Republicans took the Congress after forty years out of power and it has been back and forth ever since then with Republicans holding the upper hand.In 2018, Democrats won in a landslide. It was only *after* they won that they moved significantly to the progressive side. RULE: Democrats move more toward progress after they win elections. In 2021 and 2022 with the smallest Senate majority possible, former moderate Joe Biden continued on the progressive side and managed to accomplish more progress than anyone in generations.Since then there has been some slippage back to the right--partially because there were too many people claiming to progressive attacking Democrats in deep ways that indicated Democrats would never win their votes.

It was absolutely partisan, but 30 seconds outside their rhetoric really isnt fair. Also, you made a 30 second response to a reporters question the subject line of your article and your post here. Its a little hard to square that circle.?For example, I think the ratio of attacks to substantive content matters. Maybe its worth using an actual measurement like sentiment analysis to visualize why this is so different and wrong. Ive never seen anything like this in Canada. Its okay to say youre not bothered by it and that it represents some kind of bias.. but I would argue that its a principle and not a bias.Did you follow the 2006 Election Campaign? The volume of attacks by the Martin camp against Harper were so expansive and hysterical that they got lampooned by the media and political satirists over it. This isnt the first truly ugly political campaign weve seen and it wont be the last. Weve always had intense partisanship.I think where Poilievre really derails from past norms is the extension and twisting of the truth, eg the NDP-Liberal Coalition Government. But he is certainly not the only one doing it.??I believe its important to have decorum and to signal kindness and collaboration as a leader, and I think it makes you a tangibly weaker leader with lower moral character when you dont.To be fair, this is also a critique that Conservatives have had of the PM. Blackface being done in adulthood and too many times to remember as well as continued ethical breaches have all been criticisms on the basis of moral character.??It also contributes to our spiraling political discourse- honestly it actually DRIVES itTrue, but what a lot of multi partisan people have also stated is that Poilievre has tapped into an anger that already existed in the electorate. He didnt create it. I continue to remind people that in 2019, before the Pandemic, Chrystia Freeland was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to address the national unity crisis that had arisen -primarily in Western Canada- as a response to controversial federal policies. In both the 2019 and 2021 Elections, the Liberals sustained historically bad results. In 2019, they became the second party to lose the popular vote following a first-term majority government after RB Bennett failed to intervene in the Great Depression in 1930-35. In 2021, they set the record for forming a minority government with the lowest vote share in Canadian history.Poilievre certainly isnt cooling the flames, but like I said, Canadians are angry and he didnt cause that. It is an entirely legitimate political strategy to tap into that. I believe the PM himself has conceded Poilievres done that effectively. I dont agree with his stretching of truths in characterizations, but its hard to really pin any divisions we have at the feet of Poilievre.?","title":"Poilievre Mocks \\"Team Canada\\" Unity on Trump Tariffs and Doubles Down on Rhetoric"},{"text":"So was Robin Williams :(","title":"Now I understand why Trump hates Canada"},{"text":"There's already ample SCOTUS precedent effectively saying that state/local law enforcement have no obligation to help the federal government enforce federal laws.

On the import side, border taxes reduce demand for imports, which decreases the demand for foreign currency needed for these purchases, leading to domestic currency appreciation. On the export side, rebates incentivize exporters to convert more of their foreign currency earnings back into domestic currency, causing further appreciation. Together, you have less demand for foreign currency from importers and more conversion to domestic currency by exporters and drive up the domestic exchange rate until it appreciates enough to offset the border adjustment's impact, while foreign currencies correspondingly depreciate.This appreciation makes imports cheaper in dollar terms, offsetting the import tax, while making exports more expensive in foreign currency terms, offsetting the export rebate. The net result leaves real trade flows largely unchanged . a 20% tax and rebate paired with a 20% dollar appreciation leaves relative prices and incentives where they started.?

A dream come true for his supporters.","title":"Trump's Border Czar Says No Ones Off the Table When It Comes to Mass Deportations"},{"text":"Thanks for your reply.Yes I'm educating myself on this new way to tax corporations. I found this [paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23881) shared by the Brookings Institute back in 2017 when Republicans introduced the \\"A Better Way\\". I sporadically skimmed through it and ran it to ChatGPT and it revealed some valuable insights.First thing I noticed is the thing you pointed out that CapEx will be fully expensed at their year of acquisition instead of spreading the cost as depreciation/amortization throughout the lifetime year of the fixed-asset. (Dunno what will result from this incentive).Now all the other stuff I see is mostly positive (although I still have some confusions). The idea of not deducting import inputs and exempting exports from the tax base is countering the tarrifs narrative and will also cleverly raise revenue (and yep allowing republicans to mindlessly cut taxes in other venues lol). I guess that is why OP is concerned about WTO violations. Although I don't know if the latter account cash-flow of services as well or they will be generally accounted as normal incomes. For example companies like Google pay more corporate taxes in Europe than in the US, despite most Google revenues come from services sold in the US .Another confusion is the difference between taxing wages at the individual levelexempting them from the tax base and the current system of deducting them as operating costs. I understand that reducing corporate tax burdens will incentivize labor demand and increase wages though.Lastly, a very nagging problem, the culprit of inefficiencies in taxing business income the DBCFT would solve is the pass-through system (responsible for around 50% of all US business income). I'm on board of abolishing it all together and assigning every business entity to this new corporate cash-flow based tax system. I wonder how will this affect the individual income of the business owner though as I'm not sure of the dynamics between DBCFT and wages.If you reply to this now it will be appreciated but I might not reply immediately as it's already midnight where I'm from.

Because for how awful the Presidential results were, we actually had some important firsts in downballot races.  There are two theories I have, and I'm not sure which one matters more, but I think they both play a role.1. Some of it is indeed people filling out the Presidential race and nothing else.  Thousands of people in the swing states did literally that.  Trump put a lot of work into targeting those voters.  I know it's not possible to see a demographic breakdown of people who voted for President and nothing else, but I suspect they're very much 'vibes voters' - they don't care about the process or the issues, they just like the vibe Trump gave off.  Which...is sort of an indictment of them.2. In my 4th post in the series, I laid out how women have progressed over time to winning higher offices, and more frequently.  It's no longer unusual to have a female Governor, or Senator, for example.  But the first few candidates to run faced a ton of direct sexism, or were elected with their deceased husbands' seal of approval.  The higher the office, the longer it took for women to win it.  And now it's unremarkable for a woman to be elected Governor, but President?  Well, lots of voters still openly question whether a woman *can* be President, so I think that's worth noting.And the solution is absolutely not to shut women out from running.  It's to help people be less sexist.  That's long, annoying work, but it's needed, and not just for elections.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 26, 2024"},{"text":"The generations who remember fascism are dying off.","title":"Trump's Border Czar Says No Ones Off the Table When It Comes to Mass Deportations"},{"text":"Absolutely.

The standard to force involuntary judicial recusal is higher than a judge getting rulings wrong repeatedly or only ruling for a particular side. Courts would not use the fact that Trump appointed Cannon as evidence of her bias, and nor would they use evidence from before she was a judge about her political affiliations or beliefs then.If such things were relevant evidence to recuse judges, it would be functionally impossible to seat any judge on the federal bench for any politically charged case. It would mean, for example, that Judge Chutkan would have to be recused from overseeing Trump's DC case for the opposite reasons: because she was appointed by Obama and has consistently ruled against Trump's legal defense team on most of their motions, including in several politically controversial decisions that were reversed by higher courts just as Cannon's own rulings have been reversed.But even beyond the difficulty in getting almost any judge recused from this type of the case, you *also* have to remember the political biases of the specific appellate bench in question that would be asked to remove Cannon. That's the 11th Federal Circuit Court of Appeals -- the second-most conservative federal appeals court in the country. They would have taken exceptionally great pains to resist a motion to recuse Cannon because of how badly it would have made the entire conservative camp of the federal courts look. They would have operated under the assumption that removing Cannon would likely devastate Trump's election chances and potentially disempower the Republican Party itself. The last thing they would want to do is pull the trigger on Cannon's case assignment and risk all of those consequences.","title":"Did Merrick Garland blow it?

Not about equality, and certainly not a western concept of feminism.Now, I know that's not gonna sit well with a lot of people as an opener but it's quite literally true. The 4B movement began in Korea, it was started by a bunch of super ransphobic and misogynistic women in Korea in a very specific culturally nuanced reaction to abuse from Korean men.a MGTOW is a about as apt an analogy as conflating them with western feminists.In South Korea femininity is not framed the same way it is in the west. As gender roles are cultural inventions different countries often have different takes on what femininity looks like. Very similar countries will have different ideal representations of femininity, even different cultures within a country's boarders will. But broadly speaking in SK that heightened ideal of femininity is weakness and frailty. That's not super dissimilar to many western ideals, but in the west that frailty tends to be an outcome of another trait. In SK that frailty itself is a trait of idealised feminity, the objectification of women in SK is insane and the fragile porcelain doll who cannot possibly fend for herself image is the height of femininity.The 4B movement is heavily tied to this concept. Many reports ignore this (because why would cultural nuance be relevant to journalism). The 4B movement wasn't about not letting men near women as protest, so much as it was the idea that women were inherently fragile and weak and men were so strong and violent that the only way for women to be safe was to stay away from men entirely. This idea that it was about inherent innate traits led to, of course, a bunch of pretty intense prejudice towards *certain* people. Especially because of the movements close ties to the Womad community. It is also a super insular movement, that punishes and ostracises single mothers. The movement blames women for their own abuse, in the way you'd blame an idiot for breaking into the lion enclosure at the zoo.\\nLiberal women of the US appropriating this movement while paying zero attention to it's foundations and cultural context, and thereby latching themselves onto a movement that stands in opposition to large swathes if western feminist ideology is pretty... par for the course tbh. Instead of looking elsewhere for simple catchy named movements, and co-opting the existing work of non-white activists, maybe do the work to create your own grassroots campaign. So many people seem to only be capable of joining a movement that's been proven elsewhere, even if they never looks at or slightly understand what that proof looks like. Why not actually read modern feminist theory, why not look to the active leftist community leaders in your own country? Looking overseas for a (seemingly) simple solution like this, instead of actually understanding and growing a nuanced localised take just won't work.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Yup.

That goal was [announced in December 2021](https://archive.is/sNBxx). Generously, that's three years of runway to rollout a massive infrastructure build from the ground up (because we currently don't have the infrastructure for it). 5 billion of that is funding for states via the [NEVI program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/). Permitting has been a stumbling block and ankle weight (and whatever you think of when you think \\"impedance\\") for green energy infrastructure generally, and that's no different here. But I learned almost all of this just now from the tweet series that you glibly dismissed in other comment.When it comes to a comparison with the private sector, there might be a devil in those details, but your claim is unsourced so I can't evaluate it. It took Tesla twelve years to get 2550 stations built in the US. Assuming permitting is the holdup with NEVI, we should see bursts in the second half of the decade as the Transpo Sec indicated. At the end of the day, it's quite possible the government will be less efficient in their rollout than the private sector, because that's usually how it is.

Left-wingers blame AG as Trump charges dropped"},{"text":"How is this any different from: I don't think it's bigoted to take precautions with your money around Jews.?I've actually lived your example, sorta - a guy on my soccer team in high school said he'd hire me to be his accountant someday because I was Jewish, and Jews are good with money.Based on your \\"woman on a dark night\\" example, I'd assume we both agree that it's fine to take precautions with your money around *people* \\\\- as long as you don't discriminate between Jews and non-Jews.I'd argue that further, it's always bigotry to believe a false, negative stereotype. In this case, it's just not true that Jews are less financially trustworthy than non-Jews.Now, suppose it were true (which it isn't) that Jews were five times as likely to cheat their clients. Say one in five hundred Christian bankers cheated their clients, compared to one in one hundred Jewish bankers. At that point, in this made-up fantasy situation, it'd absolutely be rational for someone to be slightly warier of a Jewish banker. However, it's important that one's reaction should be commensurate with the risk. In this made-up case, if I refused to ever work with a Jewish banker, even one with stellar reviews from a wide range of clients - that'd suggest that I wasn't *really* basing my decision on this one in one hundred statistic.Interactions with police is another example like this. Only a tiny, tiny fraction of police officers have killed civilians - but I'm *more likely* to get killed by a police officer during a traffic stop than I am by a random person I briefly meet, because they're armed and trained to kill people they think are trying to kill them. So it's reasonable to be cautious during a traffic stop. But if I start telling all my friends we should \\"defund the police\\" because police are all murderers, one might argue I've lost the plot.But why specifically men? You see a woman approaching you on a dark night and you have no concerns? She could just as easily randomly attack you.?Men commit 80% of violent crimes and almost all violent sexual assaults by strangers, so it's reasonable to be more cautious around men. Though from my arguments above, that extra caution should be commensurate with the risk. A place where I strongly agree with your overall position is the way some men get treated around children. E.g., a man watching his daughter at a park gets accused of being a child molester, because why is this man taking photos of a little girl? Or, a male kindergarten teacher gets accused of improper behavior because he hugged a student.In that case, it *is* reasonable to be slightly more cautious about men (90% of convicted childhood sexual abuse offenders are men). But there are so few child sexual abuse offenders that treating a male kindergarten teacher like a monster just for hugging a student is ludicrously unwarranted. It'd be like a cop shooting a black kid for putting his hands in his pockets, just because black people are statistically more likely to commit gun crimes. You can't treat people horribly just on the off-chance they're a bad guy.","title":"CMV: political left could win votes of men back without major sacrifices"},{"text":"Oh well. 50% of the people wanted it.

No of course presidents don't have immunity from crimes. did SCOTUS agree to take it up.They then waited until the end of the term, and even extended the term into July as an extra insult, before issuing their long sought ruling.

When the Supreme Court ruled segregation in public schools unconstitutional, Arkansas governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas Army National Guard to block the entry of nine black students to Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by federalizing the Arkansas National Guard and deploying troops from the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division stationed at Fort Campbell to ensure the black students could safely register for and attend classes. So if the Colorado governor called on the National Guard to protect illegal aliens, Trump could assert his control over the guard with nothing more than a phone call, and there's nothing Colorado could do about it.","title":"Trump border czar Tom Homan says he's willing to jail Denver mayor over mass deportation protest | Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said he would go to jail to stop mass deportations"},{"text":"u/jollygood156","title":"Trump Should Finish What He Started (Guest post by Jason Harrison on the corporate tax and consumption taxation)"},{"text":"Caitlyn Jenner was the only one ive ever heard of, she gets partial respect from me but gotta remember shes also a murderer who got away with it","title":"Trans Enough"},{"text":"Can you link to your comment?

BTW the whole thread that it spawned with comments by Lotsagloom touching on how people pick up and then abandon candidates based on vibes, and how candidates we are sure dont have the right vibe (Katie Hobbs was an example) still win, is worth a read. Comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/comment/lyywogl/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/1gzgawd/comment/lyywogl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)So I thought more about this coding and vibes and stuff, and it seems that this is more a presidential thing than other positions. For instance: our Democratic freshman senators include three women, two of whom are black, and an Asian-American man (Asian American men are often coded as less masculine than other races). Jacky Rosen squeaked to her re-election in Nevada. OTOH Bob Casey who I never thought would be at risk, turned out to lose - he and Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester are all impeccably white and masculine men. Elissa Slotkin beat a man (in the race, not physically!), Jacky Rosen won her race against a combat veteran, and both Slotkin and Rosen are utterly normie moderates. They dont vibe. I remember when people were saying Jacky Rosen could never win (back in 2018) because she was boring. Well, congratulations, Senator Boring, youve won a second term! Harry Reid knew what he was doing when he picked Rosen to run for that seat. Charisma really truly isnt always a necessary thing. I also remember Katie Hobbs and how she was boring (and worse, very misogynistic stuff which I wont repeat here) compared to the sleek and glamorous Kari Lake. Who now lost her SECOND race. Competence can win out over charisma, at least in non-POTUS positions.Delaware just sent our first out trans Representative to Congress. And Sarah McBride is getting far more shit from her fellow Congresspeople (the Republicans, at least) than she is from her constituents, who gladly elected her. McBride was, by all accounts, a great state Senator, and Delaware voters knew that, and respected her ability to do her job over her gender.Soare vibes mainly a Presidential thing? Aside from losing three states that seem to have swung hard right, we had Nevada, Arizona, and Michigan go red on the EC level but elect their Democratic Senators. Is it people using the Presidency as a catch all for good vibes or bad vibes andjust not filling out the rest of the ballot? Is POTUS the one elected office where charisma does beat competence? Charisma, weirdly, seems to be regarded as a male thing in mainstream discourse - women get to have charm. It almost makes me wish that we could do what some other countries like Ireland do, and have a President whose role is ceremonial and a Prime Minister who does all the hard work. I know we cant have that.I also do not think we have to run a white man in 2028 (and yes, I think there will be elections then, stfu arrpol). I think we can and we will have a woman POTUS, maybe not in my lifetime, but its not impossible. Look at the glass ceilings being broken in the Senate and Governorships.To wrap up this teal deer, POTUS seems to me to be the ultimate vibes catcher for good or ill. Maybe the coding for POTUS is something that is exceptional to that position and not any Senator or Governor.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 26, 2024"},{"text":"In what absurd world is this a good thing?

And that's what galls me: he could have actually executed on the thing he promised, but he didn't. I'm going to be voting against the Conservatives in the upcoming federal no matter what but if it winds up being that I vote for the Liberals to do so most effectively I'm going to do so with a good quantity of disgust. The federal government has had a lot of own goals and I attribute a good quantity of that to Trudeau being in an echo chamber of yes-men.","title":"Poilievre Mocks \\"Team Canada\\" Unity on Trump Tariffs and Doubles Down on Rhetoric"},{"text":"Itll be different for everyone, just like its always been.

With Trump you could get a jury to convict him of anything as long as you do it in New York.You are misunderstanding that.Even disregarding the fact that the report was basically a republican hit piece (jfc, why do they always appoint Republicans as special counsels), the actual point of that was \\"We are unlikely to be able to prove reasonable doubt when one of the arguments that could be made is that he's simply forgetful.\\"Even if I granted you that biden was closer, you have to acknowledge that the line here is nowhere near the same.Imagine we agreed that I could cut off your head, but you were very specific that I wasn't allowed to cut off even an inch of your neck. If it were biden, you and I would be arguing over a couple of inches just beneath the jaw. I *could be convinced* that what biden did was criminal, because what he did was negligent as shit, but it can easily go either way. We're arguing about the fringe.If you extrapolate that to Trump the line we'd be talking about would be near his orbital bone. Whereever the line for \\"Should this person have been prosecuted\\" is, I think Trump passed it by miles.So this case was dismissed without prejudice so they can try him again when he gets out of office. Obviously charging a sitting president isnt something we do. I suspect that all these cases will continue until Trumps dying days unless he pardons himself before he leaves office. I think he will probably do that. I would do it if I was in his case. He said he wouldnt pardon himself in 2020 and didnt. That was probably a mistake.Why is this obvious? Maybe I'm just crazy, but I believe that no person should be above the law. If you do crime, you do time. If a sitting US senator like Bob Menendez gets convicted, we kick his ass to the curb, why is it different for the President.Let the trial go, let him be convicted. Truth told, I think President JD Vance would be **worse** for my political side, but I'd rather Trump be convicted and removed than just decide \\"Hey guys, I guess the president is king.\\" Fuck that noise.So my question for you is would getting him to face justice for this documents case be worth losing future elections by getting branded as anti democratic people that use lawfare? Because that is how you are branded now and why Trump won the popular vote.Why do you keep calling it **lawfare**? You agree he did a fucking crime!

I didnt actually stop to think if that was clear or not or if it mattered since I was just trying to get thoughts on paper and shared.I actually think its less about a difference in bias and more of a different conscious belief of whats important. I actually dont think its right to sift through what was twenty some odd minutes of personal attacks for the thirty seconds that say something outside of their rhetoric, and even then trying to be as charitable as possible with the implications. I dont think this is a good idea and its definitely not a luxury Trudeau gets lol. Part of the problem probably is that the media is acclimated to it by now.For example, I think the ratio of attacks to substantive content matters. Maybe its worth using an actual measurement like sentiment analysis to visualize why this is so different and wrong. Ive never seen anything like this in Canada. Its okay to say youre not bothered by it and that it represents some kind of bias.. but I would argue that its a principle and not a bias. I believe its important to have decorum and to signal kindness and collaboration as a leader, and I think it makes you a tangibly weaker leader with lower moral character when you dont. And that means your prioritization frameworks and decision making is worse and less empathetic when youre in power. I believe this actually matters more than a lot of specific policy, but not all of it obviously. It also contributes to our spiraling political discourse- honestly it actually DRIVES it. Its unethical and it creates real division and pain.

Not with Pense, Biden, Hillary, or Trump. I do think you left some stuff out and gave Biden and Hillary extreme benifit of the doubt. I do seem to remember the reasoning for not charging Biden is because hes a well meaning senile old man and they didnt believe they could get a jury to convict him. With Trump you could get a jury to convict him of anything as long as you do it in New York. But Im willing to admit that most of your break down is probably framed correctly and exactly what Trump did. Definitely a crime according to the laws of our country. No doubt about that. I do think it leads back to my original point though. While I can see where you are coming from I think this case has been diluted by all the other shit your side has been throwing at the wall surrounding Trump. They have used lawfare before even if this specific case is not the best example of that. Although Im sure he would have got more leniency if he was a democrat. So this case was dismissed without prejudice so they can try him again when he gets out of office. Obviously charging a sitting president isnt something we do. I suspect that all these cases will continue until Trumps dying days unless he pardons himself before he leaves office. I think he will probably do that. I would do it if I was in his position. He said he wouldnt pardon himself in 2020 and didnt. That was probably a mistake.So my question for you is would getting him to face justice for this documents case be worth losing future elections by getting branded as anti democratic people that use lawfare?

First of all, we already do some of what you mention. But in the US, the American Medical Association (AMA) fights tooth and nail to keep as much power in the hands of physicians, even though your pharmacist (who also has a Doctor's Degree) in many cases has more education than your physician. Many of us got a 4-year BS, then spent another 4 years earning our Pharm.D., and then some even spend 1-3 more years in post-graduate studies.  \\nBut removing pharmacy regulations won't make much of an impact on lowering the overall cost of healthcare in the US. The reason is that (by design) our healthcare system lacks transparency. Who has been writing all of the legislation over the past 20 years? It is probably the main 2 players getting filthy rich right now: Big Insurance and Big Pharma.  \\nObamacare mandated that everyone in the US had to have insurance, and provided low-income subsidies which I won't elaborate on. We all know how that turned out. But what was accomplished in doing that is no one really **knows** the price of anything anymore. You only see a copay and expect that price to be a discount of the full retail price.  \\nBut in reality, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and Obamacare are subsidized by taxes. So the drug companies have no incentive to lower prices, because there is tax-payer funds to offset high prices. Insurance companies have also come up with a way to offset these high prices. They work out deals on **rebates** that would otherwise be called a kickback, except that they wrote the laws to make that legal for them.  \\nBut the lack of transparency doesn't stop there. You also have these guys called PBMs, or Pharmacy Benefit Managers. These guys are the middlemen between your pharmacy and your insurance company. They manage contracts and the way the operate is by taking a \\"slice of the pie\\". So it is to their advantage when you have more expensive items on contract.  \\nAnd last, but not least, we have massive vertical integration. For instance, the largest insurance company in the US is Aetna. Aetna is owned by CVS. CVS has several PBMs, with Caremark being the largest. They get to decide which doctor you see and which pharmacy you have to use, not on who has the best prices, but who bid the highest! Health legislation created a system where $4.3 TRILLION dollars was spent in 2023 alone on healthcare. That is almost FIVE TIMES AS MUCH as what the government spends on our military. Best of all, by the way it was legally structured, there is NO government oversight on spending!  \\nHere is a funny little skit that demonstrates another example of what I'm talking about:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\\\_khH6pZnHCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_khH6pZnHCM)","title":"Libertarian on our sub,you think pharmacy needs more liberated from government regulation or not?"},{"text":"My parents are from Iran.
