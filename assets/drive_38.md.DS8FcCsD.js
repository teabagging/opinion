Now, the two are not even close in terms of interest. The vast majority of credit cards available to the working class are charging more than 20% in interest.

I said \\"some culpability.\\" And I stand by that. Obviously different individuals are going to have different levels of involvement. That's a given. But at the same time it is an inescapable part of this conflict that Hamas deliberately uses civilians as cover to force the Israelis into making difficult choices about inflicting civilian casualties.    When civilian casualties inevitably occur the civilian deaths are publicized as part of a deliberate strategy. They are Martyrs in the conflict by design whether or not they consented to it.      Hamas launches Rockets from the grounds of a school knowing that if Israel strikes back children might be killed and they can lay the dead children at the feet of israel. There are many situations where Israel is unequivocally in the wrong as well but pretending that there aren't l two sides here is not based in reality. And yes there are equivalent situations in ukraine. There are large areas in Ukraine where the Ukrainian government issued mandatory evacuation orders for its own citizens.  Some of this is due to fear of Russian actions. That the government can't guarantee the safety of civilians in Russian occupied areas.  But a significant part is due to the recognition of the necessity of combat.   Go and look at videos of bakhmut in the winter of 2023 or more recently in pokrovsk.  The destruction Rivals any Battlefield from World War II.     Basically the entire town is reduced to Rubble.If combat is occurring and Russian soldiers have occupied a house, the ukrainians are going to destroy the house.    They know that that house represents the home of some Ukrainian family.  And although more than 90% of the civilians have evacuated they know there could still be civilians in the combat zone. They might not intentionally Target civilians but they have to accept that the needs of combat are going to Trump protecting property and that they have told all civilians that an evacuation is mandatory.","title":"Bidens arms transfers to Israel under internal investigation"},{"text":"Were you around in the 50s &amp; 60s?

Timeliness and accuracy are chief among them. In 2016, there was a Russian smear on a candidate (Clinton) in the last week before the election. It was spread and given credence by a director of the FBI. Within a week, a reasonably comfortable cratered to give the other candidate an electoral lead.That one smear, in the final week of an election, was unmeasured. Polling timeliness was one problem, and a certain amount of false information was in blame, too, as I see it.Polling, sifting the data, and publishing takes a few days for a smaller poll, and a week or more for larger polls. We only get a glimpse of opinion of what happened a week prior.A 'betting' poll collects and shows opinion in near real time. In proper hands, that can be a useful way to survey a rate of change, if not an entire survey.Whether this is a grail, the most accurate poll, is likely not going to happen.That said, there are thin majorities in a number of states, including potentially, Florida, and Texas.

I'd say \\"child\\" marriage falls on the \\"good argument\\" side of the threshold, as  it's somewhat apparent that there is some degree of arbitrariness at where we set the age of maturity or even as to whether love ought to be the primary decider on marriage (incidentally, a somewhat overstated phenomenon historically)\\"Slavery\\" is to me a notorious *misuse* of the argument. For one we have endless evidence that it was in fact seen as immoral *at the time*, amongst the slaves themselves, abolionists but also just in casual language, enslavement was used as a metaphor for other forms of oppression. One of the Bible's most famous stories is literally a parable against wholesale enslavement of an entire people. In the 16th century, when Spain had started its colonial empire but England had not, Spain's treatment of Natives in the colonies was a mainstay of English propaganda against them. Of course, it was opportunistic but it was seen as an obvious shot against them, because slavery was seen as immoral.You can make a limited case for some forms of slavery indeed having a different moral character based on time.In ancient Rome, you had very brutal forms of slavery like the silver mines of Hispania, but also someone like the emperor's scribe would be a slave, which was a privileged enough of a position that they had their own slaves.But for the most part, we know quite certainly that not only is slavery bad, but it was seen as much by vast majorities since very early in human history, as we'd expect from something easily derived from The Golden Rule. At times, powerful elites in powerful polities engaged in this practice to enrich themselves and occasionally cooked up elaborate justifications while marshalling great force in its defense. But it was never a widely accepted practice, not by a longshot.In conclusion, while it can be a good argument, a lot of the time people misconstrue things \\"powerful people got away with\\" as things that \\"were accepted at the time\\", thus misusing the \\"different times\\" argument.","title":"CMV: \\"Morals were different back then.\\" Is actually a pretty good argument much of the time."},{"text":"Only suggestion made is that it was purposely left vulnerable to encourage an attack.?","title":"A new whistleblower has come forward, revealing shocking details about the second assassination attempt on Trumps life, confirming it was an inside job."},{"text":"Seems like a trend.","title":"Republican Arizona county chair endorses Democrat to replace him"},{"text":"Hilary pushed Trump to the front.

It's just Republicans using a \\"vulnerable\\" group (that they secretly want to exploit and control) as illusory victims, so that they can be used an excuse to abuse another group.The real issue here is that \\"sex offenses\\" is such a vague and ambiguous wording, that we've already seen Republicans use it to lump all sorts of non-offensive acts and behaviors into it. We've seen them try to make crossdressing, drag-shows, identifying as transgender, publicly identifying as gay lesbian bisexual or pansexual... all considered to be sex-offenses.To make it worse, \\"Conspiracy to commit a sex offense\\" is even more vague and could be used to convict someone who is simply discussing and discovering their sexual identities with others.Finally, \\"moral turpitude\\" once meant acts such as: Theft, Perjury, Fraud, Larceny, Murder, Rape, Spousal abuse, Child abuse, Incest, and Kidnapping. But with how the Republican party has been skewing more and more into fascistic mindsets, this phrasing will likely be twisted to include pretty much any behavior that Republicans dislike, especially behavior such as identifying as non-Christian.","title":"158 Dems vote against bill to deport illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes"},{"text":"Youre the man I want to be when Im your age.

And i think that most people, due to the lack of nuance, tend to identify one of those traits and slap on the corresponding label instantly as some sort of defense/coping mechanism. This i think has to do with social media as well, we tend to see a bit of everything these days and chances are that many people have probably seen a video or two vaguely outlining the traits of virtually every mental disorder out there. Humans are quite smart in recognising patterns so when they spot any of those traits while they engage with people, they tend to apply what they've seen/remember.What i hope to change your mind on is maybe to acknowledge that it's a bit unfeasible to expect the general population to be educated enough to apply the necessary nuance needed.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"Kingmaker of the con-artists.","title":"Doug Emhoffs ex-wife leaps to Kamala Harriss defense after Sarah Huckabee Sanders attack on childless women"},{"text":"Hell, yes!

Your  vote is equal to that of another person in your state in deciding who your state chooses as its votes for president. If you live in Texas, the system was never ever designed for your vote to be equal to someone who lives in Wisconsin, it just wasn't. And, like it or not, the way they got states to come together and agree to join was to agree that population would never be the sole decider in who was elected president.Now, since the 20s it has been a little skewed, but it's still vastly more acceptable to many states than just simply letting the states who pack in the most people have more of a say...As someone from rural America, you can absolutely have a system where the leader is chosen by the popular vote the day we start letting states vote to secede. Until then, absolutely not something I would support.

Madison pointed this out about Southern states at the convention: There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.. And consider this fact: under a popular vote, a candidate could win 49 of 50 states and lose the election because California voted 60/40 for a candidate. You might think that's fair. But again, why would any state without that size want to be in such a union.Under any system, the person who's popular in your state might lose.  This isn't a unique feature of a popular vote.  Plus, in order for that math to work out, the other 49 states would have to be like 51/49, and your exact scenario with similar numbers is possible with any other state in place of California.  Someone could win 49 states by a narrow margin, lose by a bigger margin in Kansas, and lose the popular vote too, it's got nothing to do with California.  And it's hardly some massive imposition of tyranny for a state to go 51/49 for a candidate but have the other guy win because of how other states vote ... and of course, that can happen today as well.","title":"CMV: - The Electoral College is outdated and a threat to Democracy."},{"text":"How is this good?

I probably shouldn't be too surprised. Scapegoating immigrants and attempting to weaponize the crime of domestic violence is appearing to be a time-honored tradition for Republicans. The Trump Administration reversed protections for asylum seekers who were fleeing unspeakable domestic violence in their home countries, and that's exactly what will happen again under another Trump presidency, as described in Trump's Project 2025.  Aminta Cifuentes is emblematic of the many survivors of gender-based violence who would be harmed by this legislation. For over 10 years, Aminta Cifuentess husband beat, raped, and tormented her. He tried to set her on fire. It resulted in her permanent hearing loss. He once hit her so hard that she gave birth prematurely, and she still has difficulty breathing and speaking. Miss Cifuentes tried to get protection from Guatemalan law enforcement multiple times, but the police dismissed her complaints as marital problems, and when she tried to leave her husband, he hunted her down. She finally fled to the United States, where even here her husband's threats still followed her. This is exactly the kind of person that apparently my Republican colleagues do not think deserves protection.  Back in 2013 when the Senate passed its bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation with 68 votes, it was then blocked by the Republican Speaker of the House, because he knew that it would pass if it were to come to a vote. That legislation would have legalized 10 million people, updated the legal immigration system, and added significant amounts of new enforcement. One of the provisions that was forced in by Senate Republicans actually included a section making the crime of domestic violence a new inadmissibility ground. We supported that provision, because it also contained important exceptions to protect survivors of domestic violence. There are absolutely no such protections in this legislation.  This misguided bill would take the Violence Against Women Act definition of domestic violence and weaponize it into a grounds for deportation. Let me be clear: VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, is landmark legislation, and it's actually a testament to a time when Democrats and Republicans could come together and legislate on issues of fundamental importance to this nation, despite our differences. The initial iteration of VAWA passed the house by voice vote! It was a significant law. It reshaped how we as a country talk about gender-based violence and how we treat survivors. Now, we have to fight tooth and nail to reauthorize it, and Republicans regularly let it languish, expired now for three years. But while VAWA is a great law, its definition was never meant to capture criminal conduct. In fact, it explicitly says in the definition itself that it intends to capture conduct that may or may not be criminal. There is a reason that advocacy organizations for domestic violence survivors are coming out in droves to oppose this legislation. They know how this expanded definition will harm survivors, and create a chilling effect for reporting future crimes.  There are so many reasons why individuals in domestic violent situations are forced into the criminal legal system. Too often, survivors are arrested alongside their abuser, and theyre charged and even convicted of crimes involving violence. Using this definition makes it more likely that we harm the very people that we want to protect. And in that same vein, this bill also has no waivers or exceptions. Under current law, any crime involving moral turpitude, which would cover much of the conduct in this bill, is eligible for a waiver if the individual can meet very strict criteria. Current law also has specific and important options for waivers for survivors when dealing with a conviction for domestic violence or stalking. These allow the government to waive a conviction if certain criteria are met, including showing that the individual was not the primary perpetrator, and that the crime was committed in self-defense. Unfortunately, the Republican majority is attempting to add a new inadmissibility ground, and they don't even require a conviction or include any waivers. This makes absolutely no sense.  As it is, domestic violence survivors say that these waivers are not as strong as they could be, but to not include them at all shows a shocking lack of empathy and understanding of what survivors of domestic violence experience. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering that this is the same party supporting a man who was found liable for sexual assault, and bragged about grabbing and forcibly kissing women without their consent. Last week, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of VAWA's enactment and now, as Trump's Project 2025 threatens to decimate key protections enshrined in VAWA, Congressional Republicans are attempting to contort the law to hurt the very people that it was designed to protect. What a disgrace. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misleading bill, and I yield back. - Rep.

The conservative Supreme Court ruled that cops can do pretty much anything they want whenever they speak the magic words, Officer Safety. ?The victims might not end up in prison, but theyll get their rights trampled at the time; theyll have their weapons seized without a warrant or probable cause; theyll be taken to jail and charged with multiple crimes, they may get roughed up in the process because the cops know that they can use the magic words Resisting Arrest to excuse aggravated battery (especially if one of them screams, **GUN!**) theyll end up with a permanent arrest record; theyll show up in the local paper as having been arrested; and theyll have to endure the inconvenience and expense of getting a lawyer.It happens *all the time* because civilian cops are trained to be terrified of armed citizens. ?*Mimms V Pennsylvania* is the USSC case that gives cops free rein to consider the mere possibility that you might be armed sufficient to put you in shackles, search your property, and confiscate your firearm. ?Even if the case is eventually thrown out, the worst thing that will happen to the coward cop is a few days of paid vacation while his buddies investigate the matter, and *maaaaaaybe* a sternly worded letter in his internal personnel file that will be removed if he doesnt get caught within 30 days.If you want to see the dark mindset of the people who are going to be the ones who kick down your door, take a peek at r/protectandserve to see how much disdain civilian cops have for the constitutional rights of citizens versus the absolute paranoia they have about their personal safety and their policies about obtaining instant obedience any time they interact with members of the public.A lot of them get off on their ability to walk up to any random person, tell them that whatever theyre doing is illegal (even when their actions are literally enumerated in the Bill of Rights), and order them to sit on the ground like a cocker spaniel for Officer Safety reasons. ?Meanwhile, the ten other cop standing around watching dont intervene. ?Its sickening to me as a conservative who took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and our side seems to be okay with it.Oh and you may never get your gun back. ?Its fairly common for police agencies to simply refuse to return weapons to their rightful owners, even after a judge orders them to.","title":"VIDEO: Kamala Harris Said Legal Gun Possession Doesnt Keep Police from Searching Owners Homes to Check"},{"text":"Id actually pay good money to see this lol","title":"Doug Emhoffs ex-wife leaps to Kamala Harriss defense after Sarah Huckabee Sanders attack on childless women"},{"text":"Republicans are desperate and being run by a dementia-ridden madman.That's the only story here.","title":"158 Dems vote against bill to deport illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes"},{"text":"He speaks the truth.

All serious sexual offenses are already covered under current law.

I believe his model is not as forward looking and it uses less soft data. That said, his forecast is still influenced by polls that are suffering from his convention bounce adjustment. He expected her to gain in the polls post-convention, so when she didnt it was counted as a double negative against her. He essentially subtracted a couple percent off her sinking polls.?? ?Of the two, I actually prefer Silvers model. Its less optimistic but that drives action. Nate actually had the opposite happen, where he predicted she would win the electoral college by pollls, but did not predict an overall win. He explains it here:?A week or two ago, a seeming contradiction in the model confused some of our readers. For instance, on Aug. 30, Harris was projected to win (slightly) more?electoral votes?(270 to 268)  but Trump was very slightly favored (52 percent to 47 percent) to?win the Electoral College.

It's a bit like if you said that Catholicism is bad for society because some Catholic priests have been known to sexually molest children, even though this phenomenon is presumably the exception to the rule.With #1, you talk about there being a prevalance of porn that portrays violence or degrading content towards women.  As a regular watcher of porn, I have never actually seen such porn, and would not be drawn to it even if I had.  My preference is just normal, mutually-pleasurable sex in the porn I watch.  I don't know where you're getting your information, but most of the porn I've seen online is not the type that you are describing.With #2, you are again just cherry-picking certain kinds of porn, while ignoring other kinds of porn.  In addition to mainstream porn which often involves sex between people who aren't actually in a committed relationship, there is plenty of independent porn available online that involves sex between dating couples or married couples.  Many such porn videos very much involve loving, happy relationships.Number #3 is very subjective.  I personally have never felt insecure while watching porn, because I acknowledge that the porn actors involved are professionals, and hence they are typically individuals with outstanding physical appearance and sexual ability.  I don't feel insecure about my body from watching porn, any more than I feel insecure about my body from watching athletes in professional sports, or attractive movie stars in movies.  Also, I believe that the outstanding sexual skills of porn actors is actually a good thing, because it can be inspiration for committed or married couples to spice up their sex lives with more adventurous positions or activities.With #4, as I said before, this is all very subjective and anecdotal.  There are plenty of porn actors who love doing porn and haven't had the bad experiences you talk about.  Also, I would like to share some data with you.  [Here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/vlgtrg/pornography_laws_by_region/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)is a thread that provides a map of pornography laws across the world (green means legal, yellow means partially legal, red means completely illegal).  And [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1bbg2ti/countries_that_are_safeunsafe_for_women/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)is a thread that includes a map illustrating overall danger for women (the darker the color, the more violence and inequality towards women).  If you'll notice, there is a very interesting correlation: the countries that allow more access to porn tend to be safer for women; and the countries that are more restrictive towards porn tend to be more dangerous to women.  One particularly interesting fact is that Israel appears to be the only country in the Middle East that allows porn, and also appears to be one of the safest countries for women in the Middle East.  Also, Japan is one of the only countries in Asia that allows porn, and is also among the safest countries for women.  Take that as you will.And #5, this does not apply to me at all.  I have watched porn for many years and have never been addicted to it.  And porn does not in any way diminish my desire for women, but in fact only whets my appetite for them.  And even if porn is somehow addictive, I fail to see how this addiction is any more destructive than, say, an alcohol addiction, smoking addiction, drug addiction, gambling addiction, etc.  Even a sex addiction is more destructive because of the chances of contracting STDs.  In fact, I would dare say that, inasmuch as porn is an addiction, it is probably among the most benign of all addictions in existence.","title":"CMV: Hardcore porn is overall bad for society (especially with how it affects straight men's treatment of/attitude towards women)"},{"text":"Fuckabee.

It is *different* to gay porn. And *quality* is a highly subjective metric.^(1) You're aiming to activate parts of your brain that are very primitive, so you do that and it is mission accomplished.The reason I raised it is that porn doesn't make me hate *anyone* in the same way TV doesn't make me hate anyone. It's not *real* and it's so blatantly so that I find it difficult to believe anyone would be swayed. In addition, as other commentors ITT state, actually violent or abusive porn is incredibly difficult to see. If you are going to model behaviour or resonate with something you see *then you actually have to be seeing it*.What makes me hate (also a highly subjective metric) people IRL is what they've done IRL. There is no denying the reality of reality. When someone does something really shitty to you (or my personal favourite, to people you care about) then there's no ignoring that. The more it happens from the same cohort the bigger the mark that gets burnt into your brain that says \\"This type is worthy of your hatred\\".

State: while murkowski is a very good candidate for Alaska, the leanings of Alaska are a lot different than Vermont.2. Political views: jeffords, throughout his career was to the left of many democrats, similar to Lowell Weicker or the chaffees. Jeffords was to the left of Bob Graham, who was a potential candidate in 2004 for the democrats. Murkowski isnt even to the left of the most conservative Democrat. In what world would she switch to the Democratic Party?3. Reasoning: murkowski is similar to Romney, but more liberal. She still holds fundamentally conservative views, and if someone like Marco Rubio was leading the party, she probably wouldnt be saying this. Murkowski is a republican who doesnt like trump, but still very much a republican. Theres a reason why she never stood up to be the 50th vote and manchin did. Her reasoning for leaving was I dont like trump jeffords reasoning was the republicans didnt support the disability act.

Everyone recognizes an American casualty would take things to a much higher level, even if they weren't targeted but happened to be in the region -- so that means keeping troops away from the front lines and that other entities may talk a big talk but will generally avoid targeting our people.That's all very different from sending American soldiers into raid cities and villages while propping up the inklings of a foreign government.Risks are still present anyway -- that's the blessing and the curse of NATO and of being a superpower -- that everyone has skin in the game.

I addressed the Eurocentrism there and the chronology, Taiping, Arab Spring, and January 6 all happened relatively recently, in very different architectures and cultural backgrounds.. the disinformation and political propaganda during Maoism, Leninism, the Arab Spring, and Jan 6 are all modern tools, with media roles we are yet to fully encompass.\\nAs for Harari, he's a self admitted compiler, and not really an originalist, Guns Germs and Steel or even the Prolegomena were more original works. I don't agree with his hyper materialistic view and he's not exactly a scientist but has amalgamated some basic sciences in his canvas, which again he himself admits not fully knowing their basics (biology/anthropology etc).\\nThe subconscious argument and paragraph you essentially agree with me.. though I contest our desires are shaped on birth within certain orders, that may be true in the beginning? but it doesn't remain innate.\\nNot all revolutionaries need full knowledge of their priors, Nobunaga didn't know of Muhammad or Jesus, Genghis never knew of Boudica, yes the modern world allows for more interchangeability, but the different demographics and cultural backgrounds are the major point.. You can't call Lumumba inspired by Cromwell.. never mind Thich Quang Duc.. I'm using areas outside of Europe for ease of comparison, because you can always say maybe it was part of the subconscious.. but most Arabs and Americans and Chinese people haven't read Mazzini or studied Cromwell.. it's simply not part of their narrative.. the leaders may have read them but they had to contend with the cultural makeup, political institutions, geography and demographics of their own people. Marx thought Britain would be the springboard of communism, Lenin thought it would be Germany.. they were both wrong.\\nCMV is like a debate club essentially.. unless you can show what exactly your point proves and can be changed upon.. then it's just a hypothesis.\\nThanks for the reply and points.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"Did you read the post by u/leotiablood?","title":"For the first time this election cycle, 538s forecast projects Kamala Harris winning 270 electoral votes"},{"text":"The only sitting president ever to do so.Nice show of loyalty, Teamsters","title":"Teamsters will not endorse for president, in blow to Democrats"},{"text":"The vote was nearly on party lines.

While some civilians may have been standing near the terrorists in some instances, this was a much more targeted attack than Israel has done in taking out a massive terrorist organization. Although the headlines all just say hospitals are full with thousands injured, the people it injured are almost exclusively terrorists who were given the pagers. Most civilians dont carry pagers anymore and wouldnt have had the number sent to them, wouldnt have bombs in their pagers, and Israel wouldnt be able to detonate anything.

Last election cycle, (Puff) Diddy endorsed Biden, but then announced that he was starting his own political party that he named, Our Black Party. \\nHe even went as far as to register the group officially. (YouTube: Our Black Party, and you watch an interview where Diddy explains that while he has endorsed the Democratic Party, he is unsatisfied with the way they have handled issues in the black community. I dont think Diddy knew exactly what he was doing when he did this. \\nAs we all know, starting a black party, would split the Democratic vote, which would cripple the left in every election there after. \\nIn the year that followed we watched as suddenly there was a call to bring Tupacs murderer to justice(after 25 years) apparently brought on by a civil lawsuit by Christopher Wallaces Mother, labeling the Las Angeles police department. As seen in the documentary, they already knew who did the murder. Was just a matter of getting the evidence. Why now? Why after 25 years? They were attempting to get the case to lead back to Diddy, and lock him up. \\nHowever, as seen in the documentary, they fell short of connecting him. \\nSeveral months go by and we see that new charges for Diddy were brought up in a previously settled, 15 year old assault case. But they did not stop there. Headlines began to appear slandering his character. Accusations of being a closet homosexual, to having sexual parties, to cheating artist out of pay. The character assassination was especially brutal because, nothing mentioned was illegal. And lets be honest, who thought this guy was a Saint? His origins are from the 90s gangster rap era of Keeping it real.\\nAn era we saw the likes of Tupac, and Biggie meet their fate. His West Coast rival, Marian Suge knight, incarcerated for life, a know gangster. \\nSo why is everyone acting surprised at any of these allegations? It was as if we were hearing these things about Will Smith or Kevin Heart. No, this is a producer of gangster rap. \\nSo why now? Who did Diddy piss off? Character assassination and the digging up of old cases sounds familiar to everyone as we just saw Donald Trump go through the same thing. All me really know is that he upset the Democratic Party. He threatened to split votes and took steps toward creating this party just before all these troubles ensued. And how does the Democratic Party deal with political threats? Step one: character assassinate. Step two: dig up old dirt and make it stickier.","title":"P Diddy and Obama"},{"text":"American definition: Socialism is anything paid for with taxes, that I don't like","title":"Republicans block Senate Democrats IVF bill"},{"text":"Johnson's own party keeps cutting off his johnson.","title":"House GOP torpedoes Speaker Johnsons funding bill"},{"text":"There is nothing conservative about neocons.

Propoganda is strong to ensure it is never questioned. People still willingly go to fight in the name of capitlism.  Give up their freedom and resources in the name of capitlism.  People are SLAVES to capitlism. Everything you rely on, everything  you consume , your health care,  your aged care,  your food supply is OWNED by hedgefunds and asset managers. This means its no longer about the quality of service, but how best to create strong returns for investors.  They control the flow of money and they have become so powerful they pull all the strings. When stimulus payments are paid to the working class that ends up in the hands of these hedge funds. The concentration of wealth and inequality is a direct consequence of capitlism.  I mean just today a major hedgefund is threatening to pull their money out off the US economy if Harris is elected over trump. That's an explicit example, but there is lots of this going on behind the scenes. The sad thing is,  most Americans have been so brainwashed the very thought of questioning capitlism creates rage. That all by design so you remain in the system and never question it. Heck, the propoganda is so strong that you even dismiss concepts of equality and actively contribute to the privatisation and financialisation of everything you depend on.

Political analysts seem to hold a consensus that the split screen between Harris and Trump was extremely advantageous to Harris. Trump's height advantage was negated, the fact that he couldn't even look at her has been widely commented on, and Harris's expressions did some respectable lifting to sell the narrative as well.Compare that to Hillary's debate in which they were both allowed to walk around the stage. Trump was able to use his height to at times comically loom over her while she was speaking. He stalked her throughout and dominated the space.And with Hillary suffering from a 30 year long smear campaign by Republicans, *anything* that made her look bad was automatically exaggerated to devastating effect.Optics do seem to matter in debates in terms of the perception as to who won. I think what will really matter is if we can keep Trump's debate loss and weakness in the minds of voters for the next month and a half as debates and their impact ordinarily fade over time.

There's no hard limit on what the trade defecit could be. In 2018 it was ~620B, for example. We survived that just fine. It has grown historically, as has GDP. You can think of trade defecit like added debt a country owes. From the perspective of a creditor, as long as that debt is below a certain percentage of total liquid net worth and income, then the debtor is likely good for that debt. In this scenario, the US is the debtor, and the creditors are mainly the US citizens (~80% of total government debt is domesitically originated) and other nations. So from this view, you can see that the national debt level, 5000 times greater than the trade deficit, is more of the real issue--but even that is debatable how much of an issue it really is. The trade defecit is nothing more than a talking point used to attempt to pass certain tariffs and restrictions. It really doesn't have a lot of economic significance This article does a good job of explaining both sides in a pretty unbiased manner if you'd like to know more about precisely what is going on with the trade defecit.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-trade-deficit-how-much-does-it-matter","title":"CMV: It is fair to characterize Trump's tariffs proposal as a sales tax on American consumers."},{"text":"Quite true!

Assuming NIMBYism doesn't go away, people want to move to high demand areas would still be unable to move in, but it would be from shortages and not explicit prices. Seems like a very roundabout way of rent control.About a million other things I hate about these ideas, but this is a great illustration of where I hope the Democratic party breaks with the progressives.

Firstly, I would distinguish between rebellion and revolution: the former can be an innate behaviour, the latter cannot, because it also implies a change in existing political institutions. Secondly, in this article I am referring only to modern revolutions, not only in terms of the chronology of events, but also in terms of the way in which they took place: for example, it would be difficult to imagine any of these revolutions if we eliminated the contribution of the press and propaganda (which gradually became more and more important), just as it would be unthinkable for us today to try to make the revolution in a way that is too different from this. You are right about the collective subconscious: it reminds me of Yuval Noah Harari's notion of an 'imagined constituted order'. In this view, we humans believe in an imagined constituted order (be it the Code of Hammurabi or Human Rights) not because it is objectively true, but because the belief that it is objectively true enables us to cooperate effectively. As much as the stability of such an order requires the preservation of the instruments of coercion, we need widespread belief in it (especially on the part of the elite and the security forces) to maintain it. In the first place, an imagined constituted order is constantly intertwined with material reality: in this sense, it is interesting to note how the modern myth of individualism and privacy has shaped contemporary architecture, especially if we compare the latter with medieval architecture, a period in which a person's value was determined not so much by his inwardness as by his reputation.? Second, the desires of each of us are shaped from birth by the myths that characterise this order. Third, the imagined constituted order is intersubjective, that is, it is rooted in the shared imagination of thousands or even millions of people: it exists within a network of communication that links the consciousness of many individuals. But this intersubjective phenomenon can change or disappear if the majority of individuals in the network change their beliefs: if I want to change the imagined constituted order, I have to convince millions of strangers (or more) to cooperate with me. This is where the leaders of revolutions come in, who are also present in the most democratic revolutions, who take on the mission of leading the people in this change, and who have - they certainly do - a good knowledge of previous revolutions. As for the rest, I actually invested much more emotion and time in the Italian Risorgimento than in the English Revolution.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"That projection is purely based on PA.

An alliance between global corporate interests, the military-industrial complex and a political establishment devoted to US hegemony and imperialism in its foreign policy aims, has become more adept at selling \\"humanitarian\\" narratives to justify these wars.. While the dubiousness of the stated reasons for war might be obvious to you, it's  apparently far from obvious to the majority of westerners who time and again are persuaded by the latest humanitarian-sounding messaging of why we need to go to war or fund and provide weapons for somebody else's war. There are opponents of  wars of course,, and years after the fact, it typically becomes received wisdom that this war or that war was illegally carried out under a false pretext, and was always kind of a bad idea. But at the time,, a whole lot of people either support the wars or are not interested enough to oppose them.Today there are plenty Harris believers who imagine that she represents vague emotional concepts and virtues such as \\"kindness\\" and \\"joy\\". The fact that Dick Cheney of all people has endorsed her campaign doesn't seem to  be at all jarring for most of them, The propaganda continues to be successful enough that they are able to keep on using it.This mis-selling of war and the reasons for war meets the definition of conspiracy because aims which are harmful to others (whether that be other nations or sections of the US population)  are pursued covertly under the guise of humanitarian intervention and social justice.","title":"Kamala Harris is a neocon in disguise"},{"text":"Well said ??","title":"More evidence of Violent Woke Liberals"},{"text":"Cant wait to see how Fox tries to spin this","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 18, 2024 - 48 days until election day!"},{"text":"His home state is Florida now, but he cannot escape the New Yawker accent","title":"Kamala Harris Gets Big Debate Bump Over Trump in Swing States"},{"text":"I think Trump directly asking Republicans to shut down the government today alleviated all those fears","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 18, 2024 - 48 days until election day!"},{"text":"Fuck this clown.","title":"Ohio Sheriff Defends Wanting Kamala Harris Supporter Addresses"},{"text":"Billionaires everywhere.

In the case of India, it is well known that Gandhi was also (not only obviously) inspired by the American Revolution, and the fathers of the American Revolution looked up to Cromwell: in this way Cromwell and the Roundheads could also have a 'moral descent' in India. This does not mean, of course, that the American Revolution was Gandhi's only inspiration, but it is enough that it was one of his inspirations to be able to trace the family tree.

Were not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt, Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said in a statement. We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.The alert also said Iran has continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trumps campaign to U.S. media organizations. The statement does not indicate whether any of that information has surfaced publicly, but called the episode the latest example of Irans multi-pronged approach  to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process.A spokesperson for Irans government did not immediately respond to request for comment, but the country has denied being involved in hacking the campaign.The Trump campaign was hacked earlier this summer, but the issue did not become public until August, when the Trump team was contacted by reporters who had been approached by a man claiming to be named Robert who said he had internal campaign documents.Trump ally Roger Stone was among the Iranian hacking targets, as was Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles, according to reporting from The Washington Post.The FBI has indicated Iran similarly had attempted to hack the Democratic campaign  which, at the time, was supporting a ticket of President Biden and Vice President Harris  but was unsuccessful in doing so.In a recent call with reporters, the ODNI said intelligence indicates Iran has accelerated its efforts to influence the U.S. election, both funneling disinformation into social media and seeking to further divide Americans.Those efforts come alongside campaigns of increasing intensity from both Russia and China.The U.S. in recent weeks has taken action against various Russian influence tactics, seizing 32 web domains it was using to spread disinformation and indicting two employees of RT, formerly Russia Today, who worked with Tenet Media to contact various right-wing social media influencers to push narratives supported by Russia.Both the Post and NBC have reported that the U.S. in coming days plans to file charges in relation to Iranian hacking.","title":"Iran sent information stolen during its hack on the Trump campaign to the Biden campaign"},{"text":"And the mainstream media will tell you that it's a good thing, in the interest of equity, or some crap.","title":"Biden's DOJ Threatens Election Offices Over Cleaning Voter Rolls"},{"text":"[Some links](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/15vqlrk/comment/jwysg8c/)","title":"MK Ultra"},{"text":"So in the past 3 days or so, it's gone from \\"Where is the bump?\\" to \\"Slight Bump\\" to \\"Big Bump\\".

News has been wild.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 18, 2024 - 48 days until election day!"},{"text":"You're making my point for me. Regardless of how it came to be that way the plain truth is that if you combine israel, gaza, and the West bank, there are roughly 7 million Jewish people and 7 million Palestinian people living in those areas.    The Gaza Strip has a population of roughly 2 million Arab palestinians. The West Bank has a population of roughly 2.6 million Arab palestinians. Israel has a population of a little over 9.5 million, but roughly 2.5 million of those are either Arabs or other non-jewish individuals.    There is no ignoring that these two groups of people live in Close proximity, and have for much of the last 70 years if not closer to 100.   Making the claim that the Jewish residents of the area have no claim to live there due to the displacement of Arab residents in 1945 or 1967 isn't going to make anyone move.Except for the far right in Israel most of the government has previously acknowledged that this means that a two-state solution is the only realistic alternative. In 2005 and 2006 the government of Israel managed to effectuate a withdrawal of occupying forces and Israeli settlers from the Gaza strip.   The government paid a substantial price evicting some 15,000 Israeli settlers from gaza.   This is all Complicated by the notion that in 2024 Hamas is functionally an unelected government that is not particularly responsive to the concerns of its citizens.    Despite this there had been a tenuous ceasefire agreement since 2014.  And that brings us to the October 7th attacks. When they occurred there was a pretty broad consensus that some type of armed response was both necessary and valid.    What I think many people assumed but has not played out was that even netanyahu's government in Israel understood that a reoccupation of Gaza was neither appropriate nor in Israel's interest. However when faced with consistent terrorist attacks Israel is not realistically going to have any choice but to have a military reaction.  Hamas knows this.   Notwithstanding that Hamas is partly a foil for international politics in the region with support from iran.   An aggressive Israel complicates us relations with Saudi Arabia and US support for the Saudi and UAE conflict against the houthis who are also backed by Iran. \\n  It's not at all clear what Israel's end game for this particular conflict is at this point Beyond punishing Hamas.  However the conservative religious right within netanyahu's government openly calls for deportations and resettlement which is only likely to end badly for israel.","title":"Bidens arms transfers to Israel under internal investigation"},{"text":"Iran hates trumps for killing their general.","title":"Iranian hackers sent stolen Trump campaign information to Biden campaign"},{"text":"The enemy of your enemy is your friend","title":"Iranian hackers sent stolen Trump campaign information to Biden campaign"},{"text":"To be clear, this has precisely zero chance of passage.

Wales has been a part of the English kingdom for forever. To an outsider the Welsh and English are exactly the same. It's like the difference between a Texan and an American. Texan and Welsh are more specific and each place has various historical rebellions with complete histories of oppression and violence an independent identity. That is it's true that Texans are American but the remains of the old war's are recorded in the language. This is one of the differences between the names of England and the United Kingdom. Ireland and Scotland are famous for their independent attitudes, but even the Irish and the Scot's looked at Wales as more English then them. This is how the English Colonial Empire got started. A family dynasty emerged in England, and absorbed place after place until it spanned the globe. So in the context of that phase of history the Welsh are sort of the first victim's they were an Independent group conquered by the English crown so long ago the entire rest of the world just views them as part of an empire. However many rural Welsh have their own language and customs and still to this day might not feel like they are full citizens of England because some of the English aristocracy still in the modern day think of the welsh as uncivilized rural redneck dumb dumb farmer hill people who never learned to speak English the right way..  So it's still kind of a problem. However both England and Wales were conquered by the Roman empire way back in the day and were treated as one by the Romans when they were a set of diffuse tribal groups. So the split between England and wales happened post the collapse of roman authority in the region. Pre Roman there were ton's of primitive tribal groups each with their own norms and languages living mostly independently but collaborating through trade networks. Post roman many of those old group's were destroyed completely and without the Romans forcing the islanders into one territory for the purposes of empirical domination the natives of the Island of Britain or whatever it was called by whomever was calling it a place diverged back into sub regions. Britain is most accurately used to refer to the land mass. So Welsh emerged then as a banner for the western tribal Brits while English emerged as a flag in the east with the center of the island changing hands over and over again for hundreds of years. Ireland is a separate island from Britain and has always had the Sea itself drawing the border. There's also a whole historical clusterfuck of Irish subdivisions including violent acts of rebellion in the modern era. Scotland was far less under roman control and has a long history of fighting for independence. SO like in the year 200 BC or whatever the Welsh and the English were not things yet, The Irish were independent by the nature of being a different island and the scots were independent through negotiations and warfare. So the welsh have only ever really been an identity the welsh self identified with, while the Irish and the scot's were like whatever that's just being English with extra steps. So the word Hiraeth might not be in the English language. However maintaining the English language as exclusive was historically done specifically to destroy the welsh identity. It was called the Queens/Kings English to enforce the crowns dominance over wales and to destroy a unique tribal identity.  So The word Hiraeth is precisely welsh but it's very close to MAGA in the sense that is is the longing for the return to a simple time before colonialist oppression mixed with the fact that such a place never existed on land but only in the minds of hopeful and innocent children longing for a better world then the one we exist in. Wales never existed before roman colonialism, America never existed before English colonialism. But the desire for a world without the effects of colonialism is older then either. The city state of rome created an empire to protect itself from the colonialism of its neighbors. England was being colonized by the Vikings and tried to conquer the ocean to make themselves safe. The then peaceful independent farming Scotts were being raided by the brutal pillaging rapist vikings and desperately called on the Welsh and English for help. This cry for help was the birth of the UK itself. But also Hiraeth is kind of fake in the sense that it's a longing for an unreal land. But simultaneously their is very little more consistently human then the desire for more peaceful world. It's pretty easy to want a world without colonialism and to strive in that vague direction but trying to coherently describe a world without it in concrete terms becomes pure fantasy pretty quickly.  Like world peace is a pretty quick description and get's the point across concisely but how the fuck do we even do that becomes the question.","title":"CMV: the right in the U.S. longs for a time that didnt exist"},{"text":"My understanding is that the majority of the 1.3 million teamster are going to vote for Trump.

This exponential increase in de minimis shipments makes it more challenging to enforce U.S. trade laws, health and safety requirements, intellectual property rights, consumer protection rules, and to block illicit synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and synthetic drug raw materials and machinery from entering the country.\\n \\nThe majority of shipments entering the United States claiming the de minimis exemption originate from several China-founded e-commerce platforms, putting American consumers at risk, undercutting American workers and businesses, and resulting in the importation of huge volumes of low-value products such as textiles and apparel into the U.S. market duty-free. A shipment is eligible for the de minimis exemption if the aggregate fair retail value of the articles imported is $800 or less. De minimis shipments enter the United States with less information than other imports and are not subject to duties and taxes.   \\n \\nThe growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments. Foreign corporate giants who exploit the de minimis exemption do so for a variety of reasons.  Some companies exploit the de minimis to conceal shipments of illegal and dangerous products and avoid compliance with U.S. health and safety and consumer protection laws. Other foreign entities use it to circumvent U.S. trade enforcement actions intended to level the playing field for American workers, retailers, and manufacturers.\\n \\nWith todays announcement, the Administration is using executive authority to stop the abuse of the de minimis exemption. The Administration also calls on Congress to pass legislation this year to reform the de minimis exemption comprehensively to further protect American consumers, workers, and businesses.  -Each section is followed by additional detailed bullet points in the press release:*Administration Action Intended to Reduce De Minimis Import Volumes*\\nNew Rulemaking to Reduce De Minimis Volume and Strengthen Trade Enforcement: The Administration intends to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would exclude from the de minimis exemption all shipments containing products covered by tariffs imposed under Sections 201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.  \\n...-*Administration Action to Protect U.S. Consumers, Workers, and Businesses*\\nNew Rulemaking to Improve Accountability and Enforcement in De Minimis Shipments: The Administration intends to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the entry of low-value shipments that will propose to strengthen information collection requirements to promote greater visibility into de minimis shipments.  \\n...-Final Rule to Prevent De Minimis Shipments from Circumventing Safety Standards: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff intend to propose a final rule requiring importers of consumer products to file Certificates of Compliance (CoC) electronically with CBP and CPSC at the time of entry, including for de minimis shipments.  \\n...-*Comprehensive Legislative Reforms on De Minimis Needed to Protect American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses*\\nThe Administration is pursuing significant regulatory action to address the surge in de minimis imports that put American consumers, workers, retailers, and manufacturers at risk.  But further comprehensive de minimis reforms are needed, and these reforms require congressional action.  The Administration stands ready to work with Congress to pass comprehensive de minimis reform legislation by the end of the year.  \\n...-*Administration Action to Protect American Textile and Apparel Manufacturers*\\nAmerican textile and apparel producers play a critical role in the U.S. defense industrial base and support hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the United States.  U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers are facing unfair competition from several China-founded e-commerce giants, as these companies take advantage of the de minimis exemption to ship huge volumes of textile and apparel products to American consumers. In addition to the de minimis reforms highlighted above, the Administration is exploring other decisive actions to support U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers and their workers.  \\n...-Related press releases:* [DHS Workforce on the Frontlines of Biden-Harris Administrations New Executive Actions to Address Surge in De Minimis Shipments and Protect American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/09/13/dhs-workforce-frontlines-biden-harris-administrations-new-executive-actions-address)","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect American Consumers, Workers, and Businesses by Cracking Down on De Minimis Shipments with Unsafe, Unfairly Traded Products"},{"text":"I absolutely fucked my lower back last night goofing around with my girlfriend by trying way too quickly to pick up my older bulky dog.

In fairness I could have done this myself but I wanted it to be faithful to your argument.I actually see a lot of parallels between the English Revolution and Meiji Restoration, now that you mention it.In general, I think this is overstating and overemphasizing continuity between revolutions that had very different historical contexts. It makes sense that later revolutions would use previous ones as a reference (ex. drawing inspiration from specific leaders like Cromwell), but is this really true that the English revolution \\"influenced\\" the Indian independence movement in any meaningful way?It's like saying that Thomas Jefferson caused the Vietnam War because Ho Chi Minh was influenced by the ideas of the American Revolution. That's at best a marginal cause and overemphasizes the ideas of leaders and \\"great individuals\\" instead of the more objective analysis that the Vietnam War and Indochina Wars happened because of French colonial rule being widely unpopular and its grip slipping after its empire collapsed during and after WW2.I think of this like how you attribute causation in the context of a statistical analysis. If you were to throw a bunch of variables at explaining why the Indian independence movement started, the English revolution is going to only account for a small amount of variance in how that specific movement actually took place. It's much better explained by other causes, and using the English Revolution as an \\"anchor\\" is going to be pretty biased, and it's extremely eurocentric.So I would challenge your view, mostly in that you're overstating the influence of a particular revolution because the ideas of its leaders happened to be referenced in other times in history. But was Cromwell the main inspiration in any of these revolutions? Was he the main inspiration behind the collapse of the British Raj? Was he even in the list of the top 100 reasons?If you want to say that there was influence, like at all, then sure. I can accept that. But otherwise it's a very elaborate opinion that vastly overestimates the impact of one historical event as the \\"cause\\" for dozens of other ones, even when it is only a marginal cause at best.I tend to see revolutions more from the material circumstances of the people revolting, and perhaps as an example of elite politics and power brokering. That's why those theories are more popular and accepted in political science, because they have actual explanatory power outside of the specifics of a particular revolution (even if they themselves aren't fully explanatory).","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"I'm fond of the nice dad man myself","title":"Please, not again!"},{"text":"tens of thousands?

Please try to space things out for English readers.\\nFirst, the concept of revolution is not essentially influenced by prior experience, living things revolt in varieties of ways.. even animals in labs or zoos revolt. It's an innate behavior.. so the question here is about how much influence can we credit the English with.?\\nSecond, the ideas here have a certain investment bias, the English didn't start or end the timeline, there have been revolutions in China, Ancient Egypt, Greece, Sumeria etc, with variant degrees of philosophical and political complexity, touching on divine and earthly authority, since the dawn of time. So it seems you've centered that period as a lynchpin due to personal investment in its study. ??\\nNevermind that the Protestant character developed only as a revolt against Catholicism which was a revolt on the more exclusive tenets of Judaism and Christian Orthodoxy. Moses, Jesus, Muhammad are all revolutionaries who have way more influence today and back then than Cromwell or Mazzinni.?\\nWhich gets me to the 3rd point.. Revolutions are huge, filtering through massive collective subconscious of people, and the expression of ideas of resentment and need for change from bottom to top or vice versa, while it may be influenced by some intellectual precedent for some at the top, usually is expressed in the language of certain people, and their cultures and beliefs, if you look at Taiping, the Arab Spring, or even Jan 6 as examples, do you think the average Chinese Peasant, Tunisian fruitseller, or Trump supporting WASP has read Mazzinni??\\nSimple, large but expressive language is what allows large enough groups to mobilize and incite change, sure the orators may be influenced by prior authors, everyone is, including the English, but the revolutionary instinct needs to speak to its people, understanding their hopes and fears, and addressing them.?\\nSimply because there are more followers than leaders.. and you need to speak to all of them.. the average Russian in the USSR never read Marx, just as a good number of Afghans never even knew about 9 11 or who OBL was.

People dont prescribe drugs to treat its symptoms (or not regularly).

To the physician they get positive feedback that the pill works and not so much that the therapy does as people give up or say it isnt working. Its a feedback loop that inspires the physician to prescribe pharmaceuticals over the other therapy options.Edit. Not to mention that they do work especially in tandem with therapy.

I am afraid that something has been lost in the summary, but maybe it can work\\n1. The English Revolution as an antecedent: The English Revolution (1642-1651) lacked the precedents and revolutionary ideologies of later revolutions. It was primarily influenced by Protestantism and conservative values, unlike later revolutions which drew on thinkers such as Rousseau or Marx.\\n2. Religious and conservative roots: Early English revolutionaries saw themselves as defending existing institutions such as religion, liberty and property against the absolutism of Charles I, rather than pushing for radical change. However, some conservative ideologies became revolutionary when creatively interpreted.\\n3. Regicide and royal authority: The execution of Charles I was not just about killing a mortal king, but destroying his political authority. The notion of the king's 'two bodies' (natural and political) was influenced by theological concepts, and public regicide represented a deeper break with the monarchy.\\n4. Influence on later revolutions: The English Revolution set a precedent for future revolutions, such as the French Revolution. Figures such as Cromwell influenced thinkers such as Robespierre and revolutionaries around the world, including American independence leaders and later European nationalists.\\n5. Puritan and Jacobin ideologies: Despite their differences, the Puritans and Jacobins shared some ideals, particularly around morality and virtue. Rousseau, deeply influenced by Calvinism and English republicanism, bridged these movements with his ideas of popular sovereignty and the general will.\\n6. Mazzini and Cromwell: The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini, influenced by Jacobinism and English ideas, saw Cromwell as a model for his own political activism. Mazzini's ideals also influenced global movements, from European independence struggles to Gandhi's non-violent resistance.\\n7. The global impact of the English Revolution: The legacy of the English Revolution extended beyond Europe, influencing the American Revolution and movements such as Indian independence. Figures such as Lenin, Gandhi and even the founding of the League of Nations were indirectly influenced by the English experience.\\n8. Cromwell's legacy: Cromwell's influence spanned centuries and regions. The American revolutionary John Brown admired Cromwell, and even African American descendants of slaves have adopted his name as a symbol of liberation.\\n9. The European Union and revolutionary ideals The European Union draws in part on the revolutionary ideals of the English Revolution, particularly through the influence of thinkers such as Mazzini and Jacobinism, which emphasised democracy and European unity.\\n10. The ongoing revolutionary process: The essay concludes that the English Revolution set in motion a revolutionary process that has continued throughout history, influencing political and social change throughout the world.","title":"CMV: Modern revolutions are Cromwell's daughters"},{"text":"Aww thanks bud.

You think every single civilian casualty in Gaza is the result of being a human shield to Hamas.

I found this by googling \\"how can Israel minimize civilians deaths\\". But I don't know why I bother. No doubt you'll try to say Israel's conduct is justified anyway, ~~but maybe you'll prove me wrong.~~ (Edit: Nvm, blud literally didn't read it. Amazing.)The fact of the matter is that **Israel has been criminally negligent** ([literally](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/report-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuxtvBrs2IAxUQ5ckDHXAcJ0cQFnoECAEQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw27yCoKt5EzN4hZPh9_F-ZJ)) in their war against Hamas as a matter of international law. They aren't taking appropriate precautions mandated by international law. They're flaunting warnings given by the UN and the ICC.People with a surface level understanding of this conflict (you, evidently) love to assert that any and every civilian casualty is a result of them being used as human shields because that would partially absolve Israel of the criminal act of targeting civilians. [But that's not how most civilians are dying in Gaza](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/coi-war-crimes-hamas-israel-october-7-gaza-hostages/).Israel is also doing the war crime of *intentionally limiting access to water and food* to the area. That is indefensible. It is literally the kind of collective punishment explicitly outlawed in the Geneva Convention. You say \\"no one\\" has ideas or plans about how to minimize civilian deaths? Here's one: **don't shut off water and food to the region**. Jesus Christ.Additionally, any time civilian infrastructure is deliberately targeted by Israel, they have claimed that it was harboring Hamas militants. No doubt this is sometimes true; however, it's pretty suspect that Israel has [categorically refused](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56687437.amp) to cooperate with investigations into war crimes. If Israel had the sincere belief that every act of theirs was justifiable according to international law, they would not refuse the ICC's investigation nor would they badmouth the non-profits seeking to provide humanitarian aid.The fact of the matter is that Israel is unambiguously committing war crimes of various kinds in Gaza. No doubt some of their bombings of militant-occupied civilian infrastructure is theoretically justifiable, if independent observers could investigate and confirm that was actually true. But since they can't, and Israel always claims the hospitals and homes and elementary schools are always and without exception occupied by Hamas, there's quite a lot of reason to believe the IDF is lying about war crimes they're committing.","title":"Bernie Sanders preparing resolutions to block $20B in US arms sales to Israel"},{"text":"#Kamala Harris sticking to talking points does not drive page clicks.\\nWhen someone complains think for a second why.","title":"Politico Is Bent Out Of Shape That Kamala Harris Stuck To Her Talking Points"},{"text":"it sometimes takes less than you might think, sadly.

If prices went down, that would be called **deflation** which is worse than high inflation (see Japan's economy for the past 3 decades).

Notice the sharp jump between 2020-2021? This happened during covid in the last year of the Trump presidency. The combination of printing large sums of money combined with the supply chain disruptions lead to the high inflation that coincidentally peaked 1 year later in 2022, and it's been downtrending ever since. If you believe Biden caused the high inflation, you must believe he somehow caused it all to happen within 6 months of taking office and simultaneously has been bringing it down since then which makes no sense. The actual cause of the high inflation was the insane rate of money printing from the end of Trump's presidency combined with the supply chain disruptions.

Here are some details from inside:Is Harris ahead of Trump? This model says yesFor gauging Biden-Trump rematch, Miller developed a generalized, linear model based on results from the most recent sixteen presidential elections starting in 1960. Starting with that years Kennedy-Nixon race, every presidential race has been decided by 538 electoral votes. The models based on a lot of historical data, says Miller. It shows that the daily pricing on Predicitit translates closely into the share of the popular vote favoring each candidate. Say on a certain day, bettors give candidate A a quote of 52 cents, amounting to 52% chance of winning. By Millers reckoning, those 52% odds should also mean that at that moment, the best forecast holds that 52% of likely voters plan to cast their ballots for candidate A.Each day, Miller recorded the prices posted at midnight on a graph where he overlayed the crucial events shaping the election. Titled, Effects of Current and Campaign Events on Forecasted Electoral College Votes, its posted on his website, The Virtual Tout (virtual tout.com). Overall, the chart tracks the number of electoral votes the Predictit odds are showing. Its shaped like a giant U, resembling a steep ski slope that bottoms then rises into a giant mountain.**Miller notes that at least in recent history, Americas never witnessed a reversal of fortune remotely as dramatic as this one. Its gone from a drastic landslide in Trumps direction to a drastic landslide for Harris, he marvels.** The distance is now so great that only another epic swing would bring Trump back into contention, and Miller predicts that right now, it looks like Harris will win big on November 5. As a coda, he recalls a slogan the Johnson campaign used to bash Goldwater: In your gut you know hes nuts. Millers markets-based analysis posits that the people betting their own money are right in predicting that by the time the candidates left the stage on September 10, millions of voters likely to back Donald Trump abandoned the ex-President, starting the shock waves that could cause an avalanche for Harris that as of now, few see building.","title":"Could there be a Kamala Harris landslide in November?

The doctrine of the two bodies of the king, according to Kantorowicz, stated that the sovereign had a natural and a political body. This concept was derived from the idea of the mystical body of the Church, which referred to the community of the faithful, and was further developed by Thomas Aquinas, leading to the separation of the 'corpus Ecclesiae mysticum' (the Church) and the 'corpus reipublicae' (the State). In the 13th century, the mystical body of the state guaranteed continuity even after the death of the king, since the king was only part of the political body. The sacredness of kingship was linked to the anointing of the king with holy oil, which transformed him by grace into a Christ-like person. This rite gave the kings miraculous power, but it ceased with the religious and political changes. Michael Walzer, in his essay \\"Regicide and Revolution\\", suggests that the English and French revolutions aimed not only to kill the king's mortal body, but also to destroy his political body. A public regicide is therefore radically different from a conspiratorial regicide (but also from an anarchist attack or the mortal body of a king killed in war).
