They arent listening"},{"text":"Okay I want to address each of your concerns since you keep accusing people of ignoring your points:\\n1. Downplaying whats at stake. \\n \\nThe view of most leftists, including myself, if thats you are overestimating the stakes. Both democrats and republicans use fear mongering to energize their voter base, but when you compare the two parties to each other, they are remarkably similar. I will concede that republicans tend to SAY more crazy stuff, but if you look at the actual policies and behavior of democrats, when democrats are in power they almost always continue and expand unpopular republican policies. For example, Trumps border wall/family separation. It was a massively unpopular policy that resulted in lots of protests (even from democratic representatives such as AOC). When Biden came into office, he continued and expanded those policies, putting more kids in cages and building more of the wall than Trump even did.\\nSo when you say that people who choose to vote, their party are downplaying with a stake, it looks like you are not paying attention to what is going on regardless of who is in charge.2. Trump did a lot of damage appointing three Supreme Court justices and might get a chance to appoint more.I think you have to look at this issue a little broader again. First, the only reason there were three justice spots when Trump was president was because of poor planning in the Obama term, particularly to do with the retirement of RBG. But we can go ahead and ignore that for the sake of this argument. While there are three justices who are aging, those justices are conservative and are easily able to continue serving for four years to wait for a president they prefer to appoint their replacement. I do agree that if Trump is elected, they will retire and be replaced by another set of conservative judges. However, if Kamala is elected, they will simply continue to serve and wait until the next election. Essentially this is fear tactic because we will always have the possibility of a president appointing Supreme Court justices. The issue is that our current Supreme Court is incredibly corrupt. This is an issue for those who are already in office to tackle the corruption head on (restrict cooperate bribery) and to also expand the courts to meet the current nation judicial district number. The democrats in office have taken little interest (I do think the bribery issue may have been brought up in congress once, but there has been no follow through). Either way, fixing the Supreme Court is not on the presidential ballot.3. If Jill Stein cared about Palestine, she wouldnt be taking away votes from Kamala.Two parter here. You are claiming that Jill Stein is taking voters away from Kamala and also that Kamala is better for Palestine than TrumpMost people voting for Jill Stein would not vote for Kamala, that is simply not the case. 3rd party voters would often just not vote if they did not have a candidate to align with. Kamala and Trump are bad for Palestine. Its difficult to believe that Trump will be worse on Palestine when the administration that Kamala is part of and loudly in support of is already funding a full genocide. Joe Biden and Kamala have said that their support for Israel is unconditional and the actions of their administration have shown that. While Trump may be worse in rhetoric, as far as we have seen in actual behavior, Kamala is just as bad.4. There is no law that says a third-party needs to get 5% to be a legitimate party. This has to do with with federal funding. It is set up by the federal election committee. Political parties must meet certain criteria in order to apply for federal funding. One of those criteria is between 5% and 25% of the population vote in the last election.5. If Trump wins, you might not get a chance to do anything for Palestine. Unlimited powercult following.. burning ballots Netenyau.This isnt a super coherent argument so Im not going to address it completely. Instead, I want to point out to you that Problems in the United States are not going to be fixed via voting. no matter who wins the election, the United States is still going to be an imperialist police state where the richest 1% of people control the 99%, where citizens die of poverty in the richest country in the world and where cooperate profits come first. If you were actually interested in changing those things, you wouldnt be voting for Kamala.I understand where your thought processes are because Republicans say some crazy shit but if you really take the time to look at what is happening, you would understand that the Democrats do the crazy shit quietly and I think thats even more insidious.","title":"cmv: If youre voting for Jill Stein youre a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you dont care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground"},{"text":"Worst part is users are eating it up.","title":"The Democrats want Tim Walz to speak to rural Americans.

Instead of evacuating all of our equipment, troops, civilians, and Afghan Allies during the rainy season when no one fights, Biden did nothing for 6 months (except yank the contractors maintaining the Afghan Army's aircraft, so they had no air cover).  Then he pulled out of bases in the middle of the night without notifying anyone - the first the Brits knew we were gone was when locals started stealing the vehicles we left behind.  Instead of evacuating from Bagram Air Base which was well defended, had two runways, and ample fuel supplies, Biden pulled everyone back to Kabul and tried to evacuate from Hamid Karzai Airport, which had one runway and almost immediately ran out of fuel.  He told everyone that the Taliban weren't going to conquer the country... while they were conquering the country (in a matter of weeks).  He was shipping literal pallets of cash to the Afghan government *on the day they bugged out* because the Taliban were taking the capitol.  He told American diplomatic staff and their families to shelter in place while he evacuated a hundred thousand random Afghans (most of whom disappeared once they got to the US), and then told them (and our Afghan allies) that we couldn't get them out.  He told the British and French to stop evacuating our people because it was making us look bad.  When the Taliban took Kabul, they offered to allow us to handle airport security, and Biden said no.  So we left behind 9000 Americans, almost all of the Afghan allies we had promised to get out with their families, and $80 billion in equipment and weapons, and got 13 Americans and over a hundred Afghan civilians killed because the Biden admin wouldn't authorize the sniper overwatch to take out the suicide bombers.  Just for fun, we gave the Taliban a biometric database on our way out with the names, addresses, and identifying data for all of our Afghan allies - so for the next couple of weeks they went door to door shooting people.  Civilian rescue efforts got most of the Americans and some of our Afghan allies out - efforts that the Biden administration did everything it could to obstruct.  ...and as the coup de grace, Biden killed someone with a drone strike and told everyone it was the mastermind of the airport bombing.  ...only it turned out to be an aid worker and 11 members of his family instead, including 9 children. Shut down the economy for covidNope.  Trump left that decision to the states.  Blue states shut it down and kept it shut down, red states mostly did not. Open the economy and cease COVID restrictionsThe economy was well on the way to recovery by the time Biden took office.  ...then Biden's policies hit. Injecting household cleaners and using a bright light to cure COVIDNo, that's bullshit and you should know better. Taking your wife and daughters rights away with SCOTUS appointmentsNope - but a decision that allowed people to kill millions of people who *would have been* wives and daughters was finally reversed. Border security non existentAll Biden.  Trump built hundreds of miles of wall despite Democrats (including Senator Kamala Harris) doing everything possible to obstruct him, and had the lowest border crossings in decades.  Biden reversed **everything** Trump had done to secure the border, made Harris \\"border czar\\" in March 2021, and illegal border crossings **quintupled**. Number of associates in jail or financially ruinedYeah, funny how that works.  Hillary and the DNC illegally hired a foreign national to bribe Russian government officials for dirt on Trump... which all turned out to be false.  Nonetheless, the dirt was compiled into the Steele Dossier, which Hillary shopped around everywhere.That dossier was used to open the Russia collusion investigation on Trump.Because they needed an excuse to spy on the Trump campaign, Carter Page was accused of colluding with the Russians to help the Trump campaign.  A FISA warrant was fraudulently obtained on Carter Page (the DOJ lawyer who falsified the information on the FISA warrant was eventually charged and convicted).  Page refused to take a plea deal and charges were eventually dropped.Then there's Paul Manafort - who was prosecuted for a crime that the DOJ had known about and previously decided to not prosecute.  A crime which, immediately before Manafort was prosecuted, the Podesta Brothers (Democrats in good standing) were allowed to file retroactive paperwork to avoid prosecution on, despite doing the exact same thing at the exact same time with the exact same company that Manafort did - but Manafort was subjected to a pre-dawn raid and jailed instead.  In order to justify the re-activation of the charges, the FBI used a \\"black dossier\\" which they had been told by multiple sources was fraudulent.  They didn't use the dossier in the trial because they knew it was fraudulent - they just used it to reactivate the charges.  Manafort was offered a lighter sentence if he rolled over on Trump.Then there was General Mike Flynn.  Flynn's job in the Trump administration was going to be investigating Obama's use of thousands of contractors to illegally mine NSA databases for dirt on his political enemies.  Former Director of National Intelligence Admiral Rogers had warned the incoming Trump admin about this.  Flynn was framed for \\"lying to the FBI\\" to prevent him from investigating it.  After his lawyers ran him out of money to the point where he had to sell his house to pay them, and he was coerced by threatening his family into pleading guilty and giving evidence against Trump, the DOJ decided to throw the book at him because he had no evidence against Trump.  Then he was tipped off that his lawyers were working with the prosecution, so he fired them and got a new lawyer.  ...at which point, someone in the FBI leaked documents proving he'd been framed, and by who.  The DOJ tried to drop the case, but the judge decided to take on the role of prosecutor as well, refusing to let them drop it.  So the leaker leaked documents proving that Joe Biden was the one who came up with the idea of framing Flynn, and Trump was eventually forced to pardon him.Then there was Michael Cohen.  Cohen is a crooked lawyer who was charged with a laundry list of crimes.  He was offered a plea deal and a lighter sentence if he gave evidence against Trump.  He told his lawyer at the time that he HAD no evidence Trump had committed crimes.  So he plead guilty to the laundry list (some of which weren't even crimes) as part of a plea deal and told a bunch of lies about Trump committing crimes.  ...which were quickly exposed as lies, so he went to prison based on his guilty plea.  Then he was called up before Congress and told more lies about Trump (which were again exposed) and he was charged with and convicted of perjury.  Then he was called up before Congress again, and did it again.  Later, the NY AG used him as a witness in the Business Records case, where he accidentally admitted to stealing $60,000 from Trump.Are you seeing a theme here?","title":"Seriously Sick of the Democrats Living In Denial"},{"text":"I try to drop nuggets here and there, I don't mind the downvotes.","title":"BUSTED: How The Kamala Harris Campaign Manipulates Reddit"},{"text":"Is this the gal that went to MSNBC and started lining up with them politically?","title":"Just Shut Up!: Megyn Kelly Slams Michelle Obama For Ripping America"},{"text":"This comment reminds me of [that family guy scene with Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejn4YBOOntM) lol","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"In a world of Hogans and Undertakers, be a Batista or a Mick Foley","title":"WWE Legend Mick Foley Pounds Douche Bag Trump, Endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Ignore polls.

There is obviously more to it than consensus, most science is not based on wider social consensus for example, otherwise we would say that a theory and hypothesis are interchangeable but we use those words differently in science. Does that make us wrong because we are in the 0.1%? Should we instead swap to whatever the wider consensus is? What if there isnt one?

Voting third party doesn't actually do anything to address the two party system.The two party system is baked in place by several things: FPTP voting, the Electoral College \\\\[for POTUS\\\\], and gerrymandering. Two of those can only be addressed on the state level. Even if you get a POTUS who wants to push for ranked choice \\\\[or better\\\\], they aren't going to be able to do a damn thing because elections are governed by the States. The most the POTUS can do is work to push for the elimination of the Electoral College, which is something Walz states should be done. A POTUS you agree with will also help with federal judges, who fight against gerrymandering.If you want to get rid of the two party system, vote for local politicians who agree with you that it should be abolished and have a plan to do so. Stein doesn't want to abolish the two party system, she's pretty much said the purpose of her run is to spoil the election for Harris at one of her rallies.Lastly, even if a third party wins the general election in our current political environment, that would mean that the voters have shifted away from one of the two major parties. That would just move the second party to the party which has won. You'd still have two parties, but instead of DNC and RNC, you'd have GNC and RNC.

This isnt about Islam being just another tool, like nationalism or propaganda. Islam unlike political ideologies or isolationist policies roots itself in the daily, personal lives of people in a way that few other systems do. Islam carries a powerful weight in shaping societies, behaviors, and even legal systems in a way thats unique. Yes, all religions have baggage, but Islams influence on law and governance in certain regions is undeniable and intense.And lets not pretend its just radicalization happening in a vacuum, with religion as a harmless tool at the side. Look at certain Muslim majority countries oppressive practices against women, LGBTQ+ people, and religious minorities arent accidents of geography. Theyre directly tied to how Islamic doctrine is interpreted and enforced in those regions. Theres a reason why, say, apostasy laws, blasphemy laws, and brutal punishments exist almost exclusively in Islamic countries.Yes, Muslim Americans arent throwing anyone off rooftops, and thats because theyre in a country with secular laws that override religious mandates. In places without that secular safety net Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan the outcomes are radically different. So its disingenuous to act like Islams influence is just one factor among many, like nationalism in North Korea. Radicalization and extremism in Islamic contexts have their roots in interpretations of scripture, laws, and cultural norms that arent just tools theyre deeply embedded values in some Islamic societies.And sure, you mention Japan and other countries struggling with social issues. But in places like Japan, sexism exists without religious endorsement in contrast, Islamic doctrine has been historically and scripturally used to legitimize specific treatments of women and minorities. To gloss over this as if progressive values alone can wash it away is naive. Reform is needed, but in some places, it requires directly confronting interpretations of Islam that drive oppressive practices. Pretending Islam is just a non issue here dismisses the very real impact it has on shaping these societies in ways that go beyond mere political ideologies.The reality is, if were serious about progressivism and human rights, we cant sidestep Islams role in these issues. Addressing it head-on is uncomfortable, but necessary, if we genuinely want change in these regions.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"There used to be a time when real reporters were not to disclose their political affiliation to the public.Opinion writers, sure, by all means, but reporters, that just wasn't considered professional.","title":"More Washington Post staffers resign over failure to endorse Kamala Harris as president"},{"text":"And I just read that hes up in the swing states a few minutes ago.

You can isolate random bits of scripture or the surahs all you want, but at the end of the day it is actual practice that matters, and that often has little to do with the exact verbiage of scripture and more to do with people's personal interpretations or decisions to abide (or not) by religious principles.muslims I met in my life have increadibly aggressive views on especially the lbtq-community and jewish peopleI would hazard a guess that non-Muslims overwhelmingly contribute to these positions in your countrychristians tend to have a much less aggressive approach to these topics because of principles like charity and taking a hit to the other cheek.This is one of the points where you isolate some very general ideas that are certainly present in Christian thinking, though I would not call them particularly representative of what Christians do or think. Charity and pacifism are decent ideas, but I do not think the average Christian is more charitable or peaceful than anyone else. Charity, for what its worth, is a virtue in both Christianity and Islam.presumably because of their principles of an eye for an eye and the high importance of the jihad.Ditto; 'eye for an eye' (qisas) is a legal principle with variable interpretation, not a maxim for how to go about your life; Jihad refers to a variety of things, lesser jihad is, very generally, the sort that most people think of (amongst other things), while greater jihad is an internal process.Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people. I've seen lots of domestic violence in muslim families too and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.I mean this is mostly just confirmation bias is it not? You're assuming that Turkish or Arabic people are violent and pay a lot of attention to instances of violence or abuse involving them as opposed to others. I don't really see how this is different from people who think the same about black people, or those who curate videos of minorities committing crimes and think that this says something about society.I don't doubt that some Muslims, especially more recent immigrants or refugees, have very conservative beliefs, but there's a tendency to hyperfixate on the problems of conservatism when a group of immigrants or minorities are doing it, ignoring the overwhelming contribution to these problems by a majority population. If you have issues with conservatism, antisemitism, homophobia, and anti-democratic sentiments in Germany, I would be far more concerned with AfD than with immigrants. The decision to constantly bring up a relatively small minority whenever they're conservative anti-democrats, but treat a good chunk of the majority population doing this as just a fact of life that nothing can be done about has always struck me as lazy justification for xenophobia.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"I came here to say just that.

This conflict of conservatism vs. liberalism is *always* framed in classist terms.In truth this argument is not only unhelpful, but is actively damaging.Donald Trump isn't *merely* a continuation of conservatism, nor is he the logical outcome. So too is fascism not the logical outcome of conservatism, nor is communism and socialism the logical outcome of liberalism. This is a false dichotomy that too many people have fallen into.Trump, and the people like JD Vance and Christian nationalists that follow him, are *uniquely* bad, and un-American. Arguments of \\"Republicans were always bad\\" equivocate the extreme undemocratic and fascist bent that these people have with the pro-American conservatism of yesteryear.

The idea of finding and removing 11 million people will take a financial and human investment that congress wont approve and then dealing with the protests and the hiding of people. It is simply unrealistic. What will happen is exactly what has happened under Biden which is locking up people as they await processing, refusing to process asylum claims in the US and turning the Mexican border into a giant refugee camp. This is already happening and so I dont think voting Harris will solve any of it. \\nThe Supreme Court is already screwed and Im not sure how much more screwed it could get. \\nEven though I dont support Stein, she also ran against Biden and Obama do your point that she only turns up against women is patently false. \\nI have heard my whole life about how its really important to vote for a neoliberal democracy with horrible policies because the Republicans are so evil.

I view Trumpism as a movement fundamentally centered around stopping the browning of America. The Jan 6 coup attempt was justified in their minds as the last stand of their in-group (white Americans) after the election was stolen from them (white Americans) by Democrats bringing in illegals (brown US citizens) to vote. Old Republicans lived in a time where the demographic dominance of the in-group wasnt threatened (America was over 80% white in 1990). Their support of democracy was present but never really tested. Almost all Republican voters who were alive to support Reagan and the Bushes are hardcore Trump supporters today. The Cheney/Romney/Bush types who refuse to vote for Trump are a small minority. I view the shift from neoconservatism to Trumpism as much more as a change of circumstance than a change of moral virtue. As in, democracy was good for the in-group yesterday, but detrimental today. I imagine that if Nazi-killing US soldiers from the 1940s traveled to present-day America and saw what was going on racially, they would have joined in on Jan 6 and with their guns too. Just like in their own time, all sense of democracy or law or order went out the window once they felt threatened racially.

If there is a racial disparity in outcome, they claim the law related to it is racist. What they do not do is just look at the law and analyze it to see if it is racist. For non-CRT, you would probably be able to identify a racist law by looking at its wording and seeing if it treats races equally. CRT doesn't do this. A law that openly discriminates against Black people may well be anti-racist according to CRT, as it might produce an equitable economic outcome for the races. This is why many CRT works explicitly condemn liberalism and colorblindness and reject the normal definition of \\"racism\\" where it is defined to be \\"treating people differently due to their race.\\" That's not the racism CRT analyzes, as they think that kind of racism is often morally good and necessary. The entire CRT program is literally pushback against the liberal claim that \\"racism is treating people differently do to their race and this is bad.\\" CRT says \\"Actually, laws that treat people differently due to their race can be good, but what is racist is when different races end up doing different things in society.\\"the systemic legal discrimination built into American institutionsThey have never identified anything of the sort. CRT simply presumes this exists without ever trying to prove it, and then claims that any racial disparity correlated with a law is caused by that law being racist. The Mayor of San Francisco legalized lollipops and this resulted in more White people buying lollipops? The legalization of lollipops is therefore a racist White supremacist law. They also usually call anyone who disagrees with them \\"racist\\" because they know this shuts a lot of people up.It's not about individuals, as the whole point is to examine the inequity of our systems beyond the influence of individual racism and bias.The point is to do this examination in a very, very specific, highly political, far-left way. If I examine the inequity of our systems beyond the influence of individual racism and bias by say, solely looking at the wording of the law and seeing if it is logically racist, that is wrong and I am not doing CRT. I am a dirty racist liberal. If I reference past civilizations as they relate to our laws to find out which areas we could improve to be philosophically more fair let alone the outcome, I am not doing CRT. If I happen to be a philosophical deontologist while analyzing the law, which most people in the West are, I am not doing CRT.CRT is consequentialist (outcome determines morality, not intent), anti-liberal (they believe treating people differently due to race can be good and equal rights for all is bad), and Marxist (rejects fundamental logical mode of analysis most of academia uses in favor of references to history and \\"power structures\\")","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

I only make $50K/yr (before tax), so the price of goods &amp; services directly affects me. 3) I am a teacher, and I had no idea Trumps plans to seemingly do away with the Department of Education. Ill be honest, I live in FL and Governor DeSantis raised the wage for teachers. So that made me think Trump was also sympathetic to teachers.

A recent article in the National Journal quoted Democratic consultant Simon Rosenberg who predicted that conservative polling groups would flood the media with polling showing a close race.  He was right. In 2022, we saw a similar pattern with the Republican Red Wave, where skewed polls inflated the averages. Now, Democratic polling groups may be playing the same game, keeping their internal polls with bullish numbers under wraps to keep the race appearing as close as possible and their voters engaged.   Averages like those from 538 and RCP try to counter these biases by minimizing outliers and accounting for partisan effects. However, the problem is that every publicly released poll is biased. No one is releasing a $25,000C$80,000 poll out of the goodness of their heart. When a campaign releases a poll, its not to inform the public; its to shape public perception in favor of their candidate or agenda. No campaign is going to openly tell a reporter, Were in big trouble. They know media outlets love polls because they lend credibility, allowing the media to say, Weve got the real story. This creates an interdependent relationship between campaigns, pollsters, and the mediaFundamentally, no amount of adjustments for the presidential polling averages can explain the vast discrepancy between what we are seeing in the senate race and what we are seeing in the presidential race.  Republicans are set to get blown out of the water in North Carolina in the Senate races by double digit points, but Trump is dead even with Harris? That would represent a truly unprecedented amount of split ticket voting, which, if you believe that is whats happening, is historically illiterate. As well as illiterate of recent trends that have only further entrenched straight down the ticket party voting. It also doesnt account for the surge in popularity for Harris among non-white men, such as the gender gap. All in all, this is the only poll Ive seen thats tried to address the discrepancies between the races, as well as showing their data in step by step detail. Their own data for every race lines up pretty closely with 538, as well as historical trends, except for the presidential race, where they deviate heavily from 538. That doesnt make sense. Whether you believe it or not, is up to you, but with that much data, its not cope to consider their argument","title":"Kamala Harris hitting every battleground state in final days, hoping to drive turnout"},{"text":"No, fuck that.

(See my post about the abortion issue)   We watched the same thing happen in 2016 and many of the people I know who voted for Stein were Evangelical Christians out of Pennsylvania which was a swing state.Their main issue in voting for the president had very little to do with voting for either candidate but instead voting for Abortion policy.   Clinton and Harris are very much PRO CHOICE and view abortion as a reproductive medical issue.  They are not about shaming or lecturing women.    Obviously the GOP is pro life.  Trump is an opportunist who tows the party line.   They all knew that Trump was a vile candidate who they could not in good conscience vote for as Christians.     But they absolutely could not vote for Clinton because of her abortion stance.Stein's position which is still Pro Life but with the idea that we should work towards making abortion as rare as possible.   is somewhat closer to their beliefs.So,  instead of voting against Trump by voting for Clinton (which is the only reason they would vote for her)  they chose Stein.   It was a deliberate sneaky way of getting their abortion issue through  without actually voting for the candidate.   Because you are correct.   If they really were being honest they would have sat out the election.Instead they made sure the anti abortion candidate won without actually voting for him.","title":"cmv: If youre voting for Jill Stein youre a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you dont care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground"},{"text":"I was friends with her boyfriend at Yale, and she was never that conservative.

So  now you see attacks  about how weve only built a dozen charging stations with billions of dollars because the states got to slowly add an extra layer of beurocracy as a treat.Like most of the policies have the right idea but the extra hurdles add real costs to the implementation, and politically means we've only really seen CHIPS money have any impact 3 years later.","title":"Bidenomics Is Starting to Transform America.

It really comes down to deontology vs utilitarianism. Or, to put it more simply, does one believe in principles or just minimizing damage?

But some people believe in principles that they don't want to violate and I don't see the point arguing your ethical framework with them when they have a different framework.?\\n?Maybe I can explain by talking about Sophie Scholl, who was a student in Germany who protested against the Nazi regime. She was executed for her protests and is now seen as a hero by many for standing up even though it didn't really have a negative impact on the Nazi regime. She stood by her principles no matter what and there's something admirable about that, even though a utilitarian might say that she should have helped people in small quiet ways instead of taking a big principled stand that did nothing to achieve her goals.?\\n?If that doesn't garner some sort of perspective on these abstainers, then you should ask yourself your own question about utility: do you think shaming them is going to achieve your goal of getting them to vote for Kamala? I personally haven't seen shame be a particularly good get out the vote strategy and studies show that it makes people shut down. Better to find common ground and ask questions with the hope that they come to the conclusion on their own. That would be the utilitarian move, causing the greater good. It might take some swallowing of one's pride and anger, but who cares?

There has to be some accountability for the support of these atrocities and if there is no other option than to walk away from the Democratic Party then there is no other option. I think a lot about the Ursula Le Guin story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas. If there is nothing we can do to save the tortured boy in the basement do we just vote for the utopia that makes the child suffer. I think the real moral decision is to refuse to take part and voting for Harris is taking part in the genocide; it gives tacit approval to it. There is very little to be done to end the suffering; our leaders are deaf to the suffering of Palestinians as they have been for the last 100 years. We can chose to vote and support a genocide and a party that seems unwilling to help working class people or take real action on climate change or we can walk away and refuse to participate.

Since 2012 the statewide vote has gone 60+% for R. There has been no meaningful shift in politics or beliefs in the state over the past 4 years. There has not been sufficient mobilization of the youth or previous non-voters in urban areas for anyone to have any reason to believe that there is any chance of a 10+% swing this year.The fact is, as long as the electoral college is in place there is no reason to believe that any individual vote in this state counts towards the eventual winner. An individual vote can help make the difference in legitimizing 3rd parties, though. There is no law that says that you need 5% to be a legitimate party, its a made up number to sabotage the election.I'll close with this. The 5% number isn't about being a \\"legitimate party\\" it's about gaining access to public funding for the next election cycle.

Another sure bet with Trump is to assume he's doing it for his ego. California and New York are reliably blue states (as are the states people drove in from to attend his Madison Square Garden Rally), but those states also have more Trump supporters than just about anywhere, they're just greatly outnumbered. The Electoral College may have made their votes irrelevant, but over 6 million people still voted for Trump in California in 2020, and a ton of those Trump supporters live in Southern California. For a guy obsessed with crowd size, holding a giant rally in a place packed with his supporters, even if they're greatly outnumbered in the actual vote, is a gold mine of an ego boost. Likewise, while he may have partially abandoned it for tax and political reasons, Trump remains a New Yorker at heart, and the holy grail of NYC venues for Trump's flavor of New Yorker is Madison Square Garden. It doesn't matter that nearly everyone who attended votes in New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut--all states he's guaranteed to lose--because now he gets to say that he \\"sold out\\" Madison Square Garden,^1 and that ego boost is all he really cares about.^1 It doesn't matter to him that tickets were free, that thousands left early, or that there were, in actuality, empty seats.

Now true, you could say decisions made in 18th century Beijing didn't affect life in sub-saharan Africa,  whereas decisions made in 19th century London could - but does this make them any less consequential for many millions of people? I feel this is a strange view of history which suggests \\"nothing much of consequence happened until the white man arrived\\" - which could be seen as, I suppose, patronising at best? And even when the white man does arrive, the native people are still entirely capable of making their own consequential decisions in response to him; they don't suddenly stop becoming actors in their own right.Moreover (and this alludes to \\"The Manchu Paradox\\" I mentioned elsewhere) - did white men make those decisions *because* they were white men? Would all white men have made the same decisions? Would non whites have made different choices?From the evidence I've seen in my study of both European and East Asian history, I'm far from convinced..I hope this makes sense !","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

However I've changed my views on the idea that this was a problem specifically associated with islam. Any strong ideology can cause similar things, if believers never take the freedom to actually re-evaluate their beliefs every now and then. And by my experience, most of them definitely do that in Germany. It's easy fo forget how different views, religion and culture works in arab countries and for that reason it's quite understandable that it might take decades or generations of people to actually change their views. In statistical comparison to turkey, where most German muslims come from, muslims have much less conservative and un-open views towards democracy and even homosexuality.If you're interested in that statistic or how I changed my viewpoint, you might be interested in seeing the edits and deltas on the post.You're comment is very interesting, thank you for writing it out.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"They know they will lose.

I like to explain what I think is a bias rather than caring about the label, but I made it seem like an actual cognitive bias by mentioning the word bias more than once. I'm not an expert on biases and fallacies and don't like when people mention fallacies too much, better just explain your idea if you understand it, the classification was meant to organize and define them not to be a language barrier or a way to not explain the argument in context.I found a cognitive bias on the same idea which is \\"Base Rate Neglect\\", you can correct me if I'm wrong.\\nIf you have a fake die, with a 5/6 chance of producing 1 and 1/6 of producing 2, and you roll it blindly, saying \\"oh expecting this could be a 2 and not the generally observed 1 is a bias\\" is wrong.I completely agree and am aware of that. Less probable stuff happens all the time and 1/6 isn't even a small probability.\\nIndividualism, the belief that people should be treated as individuals and not judged based on the actions of their respective groups, is the single biggest social idea in the past 300 years. It's the reason why we live in democratic, liberal worlds in the West. You can't throw it away when it becomes inconvenient.I totally believe in individualism and that it's the basis of liberal societies.\\nMy warning was that most people in Muslim societies don't believe in individualism, and when you have many of them in certain countries, it becomes harder and harder to have a liberal society, that's exactly why their societies aren't liberal.\\nImagine if Harvard stopped admitting people from the Southern States because they tend to be more religious than the rest, or have lower IQs, or whatever other crass generalisation about a large group of people. You'd be furious. Rightly so. But if Harvard decides to vet general groups of people in different ways, which they already do, that's something people accept.I never meant to generalize that way, literally for every individual, I was countering the people who seem to be in denial and try to make any prevalent patterns meaningless by saying you can't generalize or people are different when people's differences don't change the relevance of the pattern. I meant generalizing when you're judging whether certain attitudes are very common among certain groups of people and what the implications of that are. I'm surrounded by Muslims, do you think I just label them as Muslims and am not aware of their differences as individuals? we have to treat people as individuals, but my desire to get out of the country because it can be unsafe is still rational, just like Western countries being \\"more careful about receiving big Muslim immigration\\" is rational, which is the only thing I said.\\nYou should interview them and make sure they fit in Western societiesI actually wrote something just yesterday that's almost the same as what you said here seemingly objecting to me, on a discussion on an Arabic-speaking atheist YouTube channel where the atheist talks to religious people mostly Muslims, the Muslim guy (I'm not labeling, that's the only way to identify him here) said that Europe needed the Muslim refugees because Germany needed workers. I wrote a comment exactly saying that Germany needed skilled workers in certain fields and they have to do interviews in their home countries' embassies where they're checked if they can accept other cultures (I think Germany officially has that criterion now for accepting immigrants).I hate generalizations, and see people who I disagree with, about many topics not just religion, generalize all the time. But here in the face of the denialism I see frequently on topics related to Islam, and by choosing a point by OP I can expand on because I mostly agree with the post, I may have appeared in favor of generalizations by mentioning they can be important and useful in statistics. But literaly my second sentence in the comment was \\"We have to be careful about generalizations\\", and just by the essense of the whole comment it's clear I'm not advocating or justifying any discrimination against individual Muslims.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"See!","title":"Who Is the Best Candidate to Support Our Democracy and Constitutional Right to Protest?"},{"text":"Coming from the guy who didnt know how to run a python script.","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"Ignoring the exaggeration.

If we wanted democracy in the region, why did we fund so many warlords/dictators/ military governments? Because democracy means people can self determine and cut profiteers out, but you can always throw a warlord at another warlord to keep your money spigot turned on.

Unfortunately it's been a playground for imperial ambitions for so long, we've forgotten how we got here.It's no doubt delighting hard right christofascists that their manipulations in the region keep sewing more division and Animus against everyone but themselves.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"First they came for red rum and I was like that's kind of cool.

One of my favourite memories re: Islam is of when I was younger and working evenings to make ends meet at a Dairy Queen. For context I am living in Canada. The Dairy Queen I was working at was owned by an immigrant Syrian family, the store was owned by their father (mostly uninvolved) and managed by his three sons. The eldest son was the boss, the middle child was the evening manager and the youngest son had a more flexible/part time role. I have been openly bisexual since high school, and I was never hiding this at work. Since I was working evenings I was most frequently reporting to the middle brother, but got along with all three of them. They treated me very well during my time working there. They gave me hours when I wanted them and included me in overtime doing repairs and maintenance at the store because they knew I wanted the hours. I had several conversations with the middle brother on our evening shifts about my sexual orientation, and yes, he didn't hide it from me that he disagreed with my preferences and considered them unethical. Nevertheless he continued to give me hours and responsibilities, pleasant conversations, and even brought me home cooked food his family had made to share, because he knew I loved middle eastern cuisine. He also shared with me aspects of his culture and prayers and helped me become more knowledgeable about Islam in general. He made it clear that he personally disagreed while also being as respectful and considerate towards me as he possibly could have been as a human being. Anyway I digress, I'm not about to make you read all of this just for it to be all about my own confirmation bias that one family was nice to me. My point is the following:I would definitely strongly encourage you to read the Qu'ran for yourself like you mentioned you intend to. It's not the religion to blame for the incidents you described, it's the individuals who behave that way who are to blame. All around the world there are malicious individuals giving whichever ideology they subscribe to a bad reputation, and I would argue that what you're observing is simply a product of the growing popularity of Islam and that it's a numbers game. The more people there are in any school of thought, the more bad actors you'll be exposed to.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"How to tell the world you have no idea what the word evidence means.","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"no, he is saying basically \\"republicans in 2024 are 435K votes higher than Dems in 202\\" completely ignoring the Dem votes THIS YEAR.

The idea that theyre undercounting the Trump vote because people are afraid to say they like Trump because the majority hate Trump? If thats the case, then the takeaway would still be the majority people hate Trump and a poll that showed that would be accurate.  (For example of how polls *can* screw up- pollsters  apply likely voter screens, trying to square the answers theyre getting with how many of those people they actually expect to vote. So one reason the 2016 polls were off is that a demographics who pollsters were assuming wouldnt- white men without a college degree- actually did turn up that time.

They are more of a margin that emigrated in search of better conditions. Many of them are also ordinary frauds who only want to take advantage of EU social benefits. When the US destabilized the situation in the Middle East and Africa it caused great chaos in those countries. The lack of an organized state structure meant that among the emigrants were many criminals who had been released from prison or were escaping the consequences of their crimes. \\nThere are certainly less radical Muslims who are less attached to the principles of religion, just as it is the case among Christians, just as in the case of Christians there are probably also many educated Muslims who question their faith. they are simply a minority among the current migration. Yet, if we focus on the ideology of Islam itself, it is indeed very distant from EU culture. \\nI am your neighbor from Poland and I was very surprised by Germany's open door policy that they pushed in the EU. \\nI see that the moods are changing, but i think it is a bit too late because the number of Muslims in Europe is overwhelming. We are not able to implement everyone to a sufficient degree into societies in such a short time, so they organize themselves into closed and radicalizing groups. \\nThe EU will have a very big problem in the future to reconcile both cultures. Maybe you can give me an insider's view of why Germany, which I consider a progressive and libertarian society, was so insistent on accepting those so called refugees? \\nI know that in the past in the 60s, Muslim immigrants from Turkey integrated very well into German society and there was not as much aggression as there is now. It was even a bit the other way around and Germans were sometimes hostile towards newcomers, especially at the beginning. \\nDo you think that smoething has changed or radicalized in the attitude of Muslims since then? \\nMaybe Turks are just more European than other countries muslim or maybe the first wave were people from different social classes than today, like better educated and culturally closer to EU values? \\nMaybe in the past the assimilation process was better carried out and we are currentlydoing something wrong?\\nMaybe in the past society was not as lenient as it is now and all cases of aggression were met with a harsh reaction from the justice system?You propably better oriented at least when it comes to history.

He blamed his poor debate performance on being sick at the time, and brushed off concerns about his age and mental acuity.\\n \\n The US president pledged to campaign for Kamala Harris saying he was going to do whatever his vice-president \\"thinks I can do to help most\\".\\n \\n We must, we must, we must defeat Trump, he told US broadcaster CBS News.\\n \\n Mr Biden said if he had continued his campaign, the presidential contest would have gone down to the wire.\\n \\n \\"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,\\" he said.\\n \\n \\"And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic.

Harris team is aware that some liberals are frustrated by her approach, especially on her support for Israels war against Hamas. But the campaign sees a major opportunity to expand her coalition by winning over disaffected Republicans, especially college-educated voters in the nations suburbs, who are uneasy about Trump.\\n \\n From the Harris campaigns perspective, the focus on moderate Republicans at this moment is simply a matter of math.\\n \\n The Democrats campaign assesses that 10% of swing-state voters are still undecided or persuadable, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Of that 10%, some 7% are considered Cheney Republicans who are receptive to messages attacking Trump, the aide said. \\n \\n At the same time, the Harris campaign believes her chief political liability is the perception that shes too far left. Trumps allies are pounding the airwaves accusing the former California senator of being a radical-left liberal. Therefore, she has been reluctant to appear with progressive icons like Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.\\n \\n Sanders noted that hes been doing whatever hes asked to help Harris win. He has participated in two dozen Harris campaign related-events this month alone, although theyre largely in rural areas. None have been with Harris.\\n \\n But, Green said, theres been an odd disconnect between the campaigns economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and dont provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues.\\n \\n Other are frustrated that the Harris campaign hasnt featured progressive leaders like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez in higher-profile spots.","title":"Harris stiff-arms Biden in final stretch"},{"text":"there was a brief moment when TFG got on his helicopter on 1/20/21","title":"Kamala Harris hitting every battleground state in final days, hoping to drive turnout"},{"text":"Im struggling with this data.

(I'm not gonna comment on that beside I'm neither :))\\nI said Christian apologists like Jordan Peterson.\\nI realise there are valid counter arguments and lots of context not being addressed within these points. But *rejection* is a hard sell imo.\\nYour reply is as you say overly verbose and easily counter pointed. I'll just do one as an example.\\nChristian values of equality before God inspired democratic ideas where all people should have a voice, influencing movements for civil rights and democracy. The Protestant Reformation, especially, pushed for individual interpretation and responsibility, laying the foundation for democratic ideals and personal freedoms\\nNo they didn't. That is said in hindsight to overlay Christian morals on what actually happened. If democratic ideas of all people being equal before god . If that was the case, where was democracy in western countries for 1000s of years. Do you actually expect us all to believe that it was a pure coincidence that democracy happened to arrive? with scientific thoughts, enlightment, the subsequent rise of distribution of wealth through the merchant classes??\\nNo you have been sold the idea that the church concocted to keep itself relevant. If it was an idea that was truly inherent to Christianity and not some other? force it would have happened before. And that refutes most of your other points.\\nFurther the protestant reformation was exactly part of the process I am talking about. It broke the power of the church. Protestantism is essentially the first flourishings of humanism, where human life started to be prioritised. That humans could be trusted to take the word of god without corrupting middlemen. That humans would be judged on their own merit rather than by how much they were subservient to the catholic church and how much they paid them.\\nThe main issue our society faces is it has forgotten the cancer that is religion. Our ancestors died in their droves due to church and the power structures enmeshed with it.? And it took the collective work of thousands of forward thinkers to overcome that. That is why these foreign religions are a threat. Because we have forgotten that individual liberty and freedom of expression need to be WON against the pull of religion. These people need to be indoctrinated with our idea.\\nReligion is oppression, it's values only a mask to enable power structures behind the scenes.\\nI would like a source on that statement. Do you realise how much cultures differ from each other? We don't have an instinct telling us 'not to steal'. Do you think tribes and clans in Pagan Europe didnt go to war with each other, didnt pillage and rape? Come on.\\nAnd do you think the Christians didn't?!?? Do you think it all went away due to the spread of Christianity? On the larger point no I don't, but discussion on the moral zeitgeist being independent of religion is well known.\\nLike I said the values don't matter, they are just words to keep power structures in place. The church wanted the existing power structure but lost the war of ideas. So they and their apologists and enablers try to take credit for their own overthrow.?","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"i remember that","title":"Reminder: At this time in 2016, Hillary was favored to win"},{"text":"Trump just claimed/admitted on the Joe Rogan interview that he lost by 22,000.

Chloropromazine?  High dosages of Quetiapine?  I know for a fact that there was a system in place in British Columbia to scout for specific kinds of kids, mostly through the Cub Scout camps.  Kids would be subject to intense mkultra style programming, and the ones that showed promise for what they were trying to achieve would be funneled into a program that was run out of the American embassy.  The parents of these kids were usually aware of what was happening.In my opinion the program was trying to find perfect Manchurian candidate children, who could be programmed to carry out tasks when triggered.  A common effect of this was something that mimicked serious schizophrenic tendencies, mostly delusions that were biblical in nature.  This would often result in parents forcing these kids through highly controlled medical trials, which were always done through 'specialists' that were located much farther away than made sense.  The prescriptions wouldn't be sourced locally either, so I am sure the medication wasn't what it said on the labels.From what I could tell, most of these kids were little more than subjects of extreme experimentation, abandoned after they were studied through the process.  Fragmented memories would often bubble up through their 'delusions', and it is in these beliefs they held where common threads and ties to historical 'conspiracy theories' that they certainly had never looked into or accessed themselves.These cub scout camps were always near 'former' armed forces bases, the kind of places that were meant to be completely mothballed but always had active security measures and working airfields capable of landing small jets.  The locals around these areas are quite often aware that strange things have taken place at these camps, and an outsider asking any questions about the history of the camps/bases is always going to be met with cold hostility and a silence that comes from obvious fear.  If this system is still operating in some fashion, I believe it is now using special schools for severely autistic children as a medium for much more sophisticated, subtle testing.  I think they have the data they were looking for, and the more demented thrills from children are harvested through the programs run politically through things like the Clinton Foundation and the usual child trafficking negotiated with Mexican cartels or the age old system feeding the predators in Hollywood.","title":"Canada is a dystopia"},{"text":"Those laws that you describe that are unenforced are unenforced because the Supreme Court struck them down.\\nYes &amp; no.?

Because there is no public support to arrest and jail the adult children of the affluent for drinking.\\nYes you are right that laws are enacted and not everyone agrees with those laws, large minorities sometimes disagree, and in some instances majorities may disagree with a law.\\nBut in a democratic system respect for a law in particular, or the law in general, ultimately is derived from our mutual respect and desire to cohere.\\nconservatives are generally only willing to accept or give out compassion and respect from those that they consider to be part of their in-group.\\nIt is a human flaw that we are susceptible to tribal thinking.?

Now, thats unfortunate, because its not interesting to everybody and even if you do find it interesting, it requires time a lot of people dont have. And its not helpful, because a lot of people who pay attention to politics are really either just participating in performative in-group behavior, only interested in a single issue (guns, abortion, immigration, etc), or just love one or two political personalities (think Tucker or Rachel Maddow) and get all of their information from only those sources.For me, figuring out whats true involves spending an inordinate amount of time paying attention to all sides so you can figure out what politicians, donors, special interest groups and media personalities want and how they spin what they do. It involves developing theories about the world and the people in it and watching those theories tested in real time with an open mind. It means thinking critically about the agenda of any person on television, the radio, or the internet: what do they want, who do they work for, and how are those things likely to influence what theyre saying? Why do they want you to believe them when they open their mouths?Finding trustworthy sources of information means following those sources for a long time. Even then, those people will have their own biases that see important to consider when they offer you actionable information.The better your understanding of history, civics, and the sciences, the better youll be able to discern good information from bad. It sucks to say it, but a college education is definitely one of the better ways to develop a broad enough knowledge base to figure out whats bullshit and what isnt, and thats not something everybody can just go get. Even then, a college education isnt enough by itself. A lot of people breeze through college without ever learning how to learn, or learning how to think. Still more people let those skills fall by the wayside once they graduate and focus on whatever they decide to do next, and end up doing the same thing that millions of Americans who are interested in politics do: outsource their thinking to the person on their computer screen.I thought you asked a really great question there. And dude, it is not easy. A useful shortcut is asking yourself who benefits financially from X or Y. For politicians and the people who donate lots of money to them, thats usually the most important question. Millionaires and corporations arent  donating to politicians for their health, as the saying goes. But thats not always the whole picture. Ideology and concerns about public perception drive that behavior too, among much else. Learning to reliably discern good information from bad means appreciating the interplay between dozens, if not hundreds, of interconnected systems and the thousands of individuals and institutions that interact with and within them. It takes time, and an open mind.Also if you made it this far, I personally like Joe Rogan, but I dont think hes particularly good at holding politicians feet to the fire. Go back and listen to the part where he asks Trump about his election claims. Trump ultimately gets away without having to answer for lying about it. Joe is entertaining, but he just wants to have a good conversation. Thats a problem when youre interviewing the guy asking us to make him the most powerful person in the world. Any missed opportunity to interrogate someone who wants that much power is a tragedy.Apologies for the essay, but I hope it helps.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"Thats a movie a comedy at that.

I'm now a christian Jordan Peterson apologist. (I'm not gonna comment on that beside I'm neither :))To your comment about Europe's' rejection is what caused it to develop past the middle ages (I assume) is a very strong opposing position and I think that position is very hard to defend due to multiple reasons.Here are some examples that either contradict or refute your point:1. Christian teaching on the intrinsic worth of each person laid the groundwork for human rights, inspiring values like equality and individual dignity. Even secular human rights frameworks are built on the Christian-influenced idea that every person has inherent value, which was foundational for abolishing injustices like slavery. Slavery was rampant in all parts of the world prior to the abolishment in Europe nationstates 200+ years ago. The Ottomans still captured and castrated Africans all the way up till the 1910, and there are YT videos of Arabs inspecting chained Africans and their teeth up till the 1960s.\\n2. Western morals such as compassion for others and justice for the marginalized also reflect Christian ethics. Forgiveness, rooted in Christian teaching, fostered practices of charity and welfare, which became integral to modern Western ethics.\\n3. The Christian notion that everyone is accountable to a higher moral authority helped shape the rule of law, with fairness and accountability central to Western governance. This helped develop principles where laws apply equally to all, supporting structures like constitutional government, even as authority moved from religious to civic leaders.\\n4. Christian values of equality before God inspired democratic ideas where all people should have a voice, influencing movements for civil rights and democracy. The Protestant Reformation, especially, pushed for individual interpretation and responsibility, laying the foundation for democratic ideals and personal freedoms.\\n5. The Christian Church established Europes first universities and promoted scientific inquiry as a way to understand Gods creation. Early scientists were often motivated by faith, contributing to the scientific foundations that propelled Europe forward in later centuries.\\n6. Christian charity led to Europes first hospitals, orphanages, and organized care for the poor. These early forms of social services evolved into modern welfare systems, reinforcing Western ideals of collective responsibility and compassion.\\n7. The Reformation emphasized the right to personal belief, inspiring religious and intellectual freedom. This laid groundwork for modern concepts of pluralism and tolerance, making Europe open to diverse beliefs and ideas that spurred its progress.I realise there are valid counter arguments and lots of context not being addressed within these points. But rejection is a hard sell imo.Pointing to you shall not murder or steal are pretty much universal values in human society.I would like a source on that statement. Do you realise how much cultures differ from each other? We don't have an instinct biological instinct telling us not to steal.

But Ive seen few try to identify and fix the underlying causes.Lack of male role models is an especially common one. The article you cited has a brief aside on how teaching in the US is treated as stereotypically female, but it doesnt dive deep into why. Its a short, surface-level claim that nurturing men are seen as deviant with ulterior motives. Instead, the article is more interested in positing the teacher shortage as the problem, more male teachers as a solution, and the lack thereof as an obstacle to that. I contend its a symptom of, a cause of and a solution to mens issues all at once.Because when people discuss the lack of male teachers, they rarely tend to discuss its effects on the men themselves. They want to be caring. They want to be nurturing. They enjoy working with children. Gender roles affect not just school workforces and student outcomes, but the teachers themselves too.Hence its part of a far wider issue, affecting teachers, nurses, single fathers, older brothers, teenage boys who just want to relax at a park, etc. They are forced to conform, even as they dont want to.Maybe uniquely wasnt the best word, but I still believe the Andrew Tate types are the ones who acknowledge and validate these underlying issues the most.

Renewable energy specialist Apatura said it had secured planning permission to build and operate a 100-megawatt battery energy storage system (BESS) at Tealing, north of Dundee. It is the fifth project of its kind that the firm has received consent for in the last 12 months as it pursues its goal to deliver grid-scale battery storage that supports renewable energy generation in Scotland. Scottish Ministers approved the scheme and the local authority lodged no objections to the proposed development, Apatura noted. Andrew Philpott, the companys chief development officer, said: At 100MW capacity, our new development at Tealing will be one of the largest battery energy storage schemes operating in the UK. When operational, the new facility will make a significant contribution to enhancing UK energy grid security and grid stability. It will play a key role in supporting the UKs transition to renewable energy and a low carbon economy as part of its net zero commitments.  The 2.5-hectare site is located in open countryside just over a mile south-west of the village of Tealing, Angus. The proposed new facility will consist of 52 lithium-ion batteries securely housed in steel containers and will be directly connected by an underground grid cable to the nearby Tealing substation. To minimise its impact on the local environment, the development will include new native species trees and wildflower planting. Philpott added: The proximity of the existing Tealing substation makes the site an ideal location for energy storage. Importantly, the proposed development will provide a significant boost to the local economy by creating jobs during the construction, operational and eventual decommissioning phases of the facility, as well as indirect job creation in the supply chain, maintenance and other related services. Battery storage schemes like the project planned for Tealing are an essential part of the infrastructure needed for the UK to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, which will help to deliver stable energy prices and reduce bills for households.!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Hell yeah brother, Trump 2024 ","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"He's a sore loser who's so wildly out of touch with reality that it's honestly just sad at this point.","title":"Donald Trump wants to prosecute everybody who votes for Kamala Harris, why?"},{"text":"Make it real: vote.","title":"Kamala Harris holds lead over Donald Trump in new national poll"},{"text":"Do you realize how much more money her campaign spends than trumps..?","title":"Kamala Harris hitting every battleground state in final days, hoping to drive turnout"},{"text":"Most of you people are temporarily embarrassed neocons lol.?

You should interview them and make sure they fit in Western societies, and if they are true refugees you want to help, help them overcome these beliefs, educate the children in good Western schools, etc.Imagine if Harvard stopped admitting people from the Southern States because they tend to be more religious than the rest, or have lower IQs, or whatever other crass generalisation about a large group of people.

I think you are right to some extent that too many workers reduce wages, but since all developed countries have problems with the birth rate, why aren't wages rising? Isnt that perhaps a proof that allowing uncontrolled migration is the reason for this negative hold on wages? It also seems that in order for your assumption( that with a decrease in the number of workers, businesses will be forced to raise wages, which will ultimately allow them to finance retirees), the number of workers must actually fall. \\nThis can only be achieved by blocking migration completely, so that the influx of new people does not compensate for the shortage in births.If only this were possible the wages could propably rise. \\nBut there is still an issue with that, it's seems logical that decreasing number of workers will negatively affect production capacity, and with a decreasing population demand for manufactured goods will simultaneously fall because there will be fewer consumers who will need them.  \\nThis would propably result in a combination of rising employment costs, falling production capacity and falling trade revenues. \\nBusiness will never agree to this and will always support an increase in the influx of immigrants which will prevent wages from rising. Perhaps, as you say, the only solution is to invest in innovation so that technology can compensate for the shortage of workers, but this again means that the value of the worker does not increase because technology replaces him, so it will not increase wages. \\nThis lead to a situation in which production is efficient, population (consumers) is low, and workers aren't that important anymore so are underpaied which limit thier possibility of buying the goods. \\nTo balance this, business would have to lower the price of products which at some point will cause a decrease in quality. \\nSo we end up in situation in which the automated economy works efficiently, producing increasingly lower quality but cheaper products which, however, break down more often and need to be replaced with new ones, which in turn has a negative impact on the environment.\\nThis is still not result you propably wish for.You have indicated in a way that sounds very superficial, how the decline in births is positive for humanity and the planet in your opinion, giving a few very general examples without any more detailed explanation. \\nHowever, I assume that you have thought your opinion through very carefully, so it has a solid basis and is not based on wishful thinking. \\nCould you then explain to me what method you propose to counteract the negative effects I have given above?For your convenience I will summarize them briefly.\\n- how to reduce the number of available workers so that rates could increase\\n- how to counteract the decline in productivity caused by a decreasing number of employees in a way that does not make them unnecessary and allows for maintaining high wages\\n- how to counteract the decreasing consumption associated with a decreasing society.\\n- how to reduce product prices without losing quality in a situation where maintaining high wages and efficient production proves impossible\\n- who will finance the costs of pensioners in a situation where automation reduces demand for employees, wages are frozen, and revenues from consumption fall along with the population.\\n- how to reverse the growing process of decreasing birth rates when its scale begins to threaten the survival of the human speciesI am very excited and eagerly awaiting your ideas on how to solve these problems which will prove that the decline in birth rates is indeed great.","title":"CMV: Lowering birthrates are good for humanity as a whole"},{"text":"I'd go further than that, OP.

Exactly 70 years ago, Alan Turing, a British war-hero and genius, was chemically castrated for being gay. He later killed himself.This was a blatantly homophobic law, almost as bad as throwing gay people off roofs, that was motivated by Christian and cultural extremism. And that was 70 years ago! Christianity didn't have a revolution since then. The religion is the same. What changed were the literalist and extremist interpretations of Christians, and the general loss of religion in the West.2) In 1979, not that long ago, one of the best Egyptian films was \\"Alexandria... Why?\\" one about a boy who fell in love with a Jewish girl in Alexandria, as well as the gay love story between an aristocratic Egyptian man and a British male soldier.That was a purely Egyptian film! Egyptian films back then had sex, drinking, and what have you. These things, needless to say, are impossible now in Egyptian films (despite the country not being THAT religious). But again, nothing major changed in Egypt or Islam over this time period. It's still ruled by a military dictatorship. The people are still the same.These examples show you two things. 1) Islam is (mostly) like any other religion, all of which have extremely outdated and horrific ideas. 2) Muslims aren't inherently extremist or religious, it's simply a consequence of the social and economic situation they are in at the moment.A more sympathetic view of modern Muslims could help you help them overcome religion and move on from their religious tendencies.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"They are going to have zero music to listen to by the end of this","title":"Grateful Dead's Bob Weir Endorses Kamala Harris, Tim Walz"},{"text":"Republicans have been running attack ads with black guys criticizing her lately (usually stupid trans fear mongering).

And when that started happening, Europe developed. The power of the church has been steadily eroded in the worst for centuries.

This will be for straight men as thats the main demographic for this pipeline and gay men face related but separate issues.1. **Body positivity for men.** Commenting about womens weight or breasts, directly to the woman or as a metaphor, is now unacceptable *in normal circles.* But mens height and genitals remain fair game (big dick energy, must be compensating, has balls, etc).\\n2. **Unenforce gender roles for men.** *In normal circles* weve made great strides to break female gender roleswomen can be strong, aspire for any job, choose not to have kids, etc. But expecting men to be the breadwinner, the protector, the stoic and strong type, etc is considered normal and acceptable.Both men and women enforce these cultural norms on men. These two are interconnected and together are directly upstream of many issues commonly cited:- Lack of positive role models for boys. Gender gap in K-12 teaching is huge and only growing. Half is the low pay making mens expected role as breadwinner untenable. Other half is discrimination faced by male teachers from parents and administrators for working a caregiving role. And to willingly choose such a role raises suspicionmale teachers, male babysitters, male guardians, etc are often viewed as predators.\\n- Loneliness. Culture has recently been shifting to praise more vulnerable male partners, but not how to get there and with limits. Boys are still expected to be strong and stoic. Many trans men will comment how lonelier and less personal male friendships feel. Boys are taught they should express emotion and open upjust not too much, and only to female partners.\\n- Overemphasis on sex. Comparing men and womens sex drives is mostly a wash. Both want relationships and get horny. The difference: Women are encouraged to be virginsa big issue but a widely recognized one. Whats not recognized is men are encouraged not to be virginsso much so that the word is used as an insult toward men. Men are taught by peers and media from a young age that they should have female partners, have sex with them, and be good at it.\\n- Oversexualization of women. This is a continuation of above. Expectations of relationships and sex paint a distorted view of women in many boys minds as sexual goals and a different species. Resulting lack of normal interactions with women is a self-perpetuating cycle. The more men view women as impossibly different, the more strained normal interactions become, and the more they feel different from them.These are real issues that boys and men face. Yes, women have faced worse. And while womens issues still persist today, culture has worked and is working to rectify them. The same has not been afforded for men. Many will diminish them, ignore them, or criticize them for stealing focus away from womens issues, as if sexism is zero-sum.The Andrew Tate types uniquely acknowledge these issues. But instead of confronting them, they double down on them with promises of teaching men how to conform to them. They become incelsor, if they succeed in conforming, abusive partners with the same mindset.The culture shift against female gender roles showed men that change is possible, but that change for male gender roles has been kept unattainable. And the rise of social media and online personalities has enabled their complaints to fester and mold into like-minded hatred.Korea gives us an extreme example. Accelerated by unique factors like mandatory military service for men and the deep-rooted neo-Confucian sexism against women, incel ideology and misogyny have become a powerful political force. Meanwhile, the partisan gender gap among young Americans is growing. Left unchecked, it will infect Western politics too.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"AV does little to \\"actually have a government that's chosen by a majority of people\\".

In the UK this is still evident as the head of the church is still the monarch, not the archbishop of the anglican church.When these barriers started breaking down in Europe (following the french revolution), Christianity's function as a way of keeping legitimacy for monarchs slowly faded while democratic elected governments (from mid 19th century and onwards) largely supported a secular system. Countries with monarchs today largely have a purely symbolic function in society, and their role is not directly associated with the church.In essence, Christianity shouldn't necessarily be seen as have had a direct impact on governance and political systems, rather it was used as a tool.

The two members were Pimp C and Bun B. Background \\nPimp C passed away on 12/04/07, due to a poisoning in a hotel by a \\"friend\\" Larry Adams. The immediate reaction by the press was that Pimp C had died to an overdose from a cough suppressant - Phenergan with Codeine. Though Codeine can cause an overdose it is rare due to Codeine being unable to metabolise into enough morphine to keep getting a person high. Codeine typically reaches a ceiling around 400 to 600 mg. This is not very strong to opioid addicts. The cough suppressant does not contain acetaminophen. Due to Pimp C having valid prescriptions for his drug, we know it was not cut or fake. The press had also released that he overdosed before an autopsy was conducted.This had caused a conspiracy theory a years ago that ended with his autopsy claiming he died from choking on his vomit in his sleep. As well as not having enough Codeine in his system to cause an overdose. Though it's not uncommon for opioid deaths to cause one to choke on vomit, the rest of the toxology lines more closely with cypnide poising. His mother, friends, and people around him claim it was Larry Adams who poisoned him.

Only governments do? Man the naivety! I could see your point if you were saying media needs to cover both sides objectively. That is already happening- in fact the Washington Post has criticized Biden plenty of times. But publications endorsing a candidate is merely saying we the voting employees of the Washington Post or times or whatever endorse this person. Because the newspapers is the employees and therefore the post endorsing a candidate is essentially these humans who will be voting anyway who are endorsing a candidate. The lack of bias is reflected in the stories. An endorsement does not equal to a bias. Stories are what can reflect a bias. If Bezos wants to make people trust legacy media more, he should focus more on getting and showing more diverse views and criticisms which btw is already happening and in fact, he has also recently asked for the post to hire more conservative reporters and journalists. But ultimately, a majority of employees pro a certain presidential candidate and then that being turned into an endorsement is no different from say, a majority of members of a union pro a certain candidate then turning it into a consensus and endorsement.  An endorsement is an opinion of a group of people- and a group of people if they all share an opinion (or majority) should have a right to voice them. That's how democratic institutions work. Or are you against free speech and expression of it? Corporations are simply the people who make them. And a majority should be able to then make that majority opinion known. It is simply saying to people who already read the post/trust its reporting and thereby its writers and journalists that we the writers trust this candidate more. They are not forcing their opinions or people or mis- influencing them. It's not going to make people who dislike or distrust the Post already to change their views. It only makes a difference amongst existing readers. If YOU don't find a legacy outlet credible, discard the outlet and believe ONLY the comments, endorsements, coverage of FOX news, you can continue to do so and the post's endorsement should mean nothing to you. Nobody is stopping you or CAN stop you. People always have options to trust certain endorsements over others. There ARE people have endorsed Trump and plenty of people on this sub will not be changing their view of Trump because of these endorsements. The POST endorsing a candidate will not make a notable diffence either- (something Bezos himself accepts- and yet will not allow it to make an endorsement.Why is Musk who is a corporation by himself, a walking talking human brand endorsing a candidate? How are people supposed to feel safe that he won't be biased against them (and their opinions) since he runs Twitter- the online public space and has a decidedly pro Trump stance. Especially since Twitter is so obviously right wing slanted and filled with them and their opinions some of which are amplified and encouraged on the algorithm by Musk himself by liking, replying etc. A like by Musk or a share by Musk with his many followers is a direct encouragement to the algorithm to bring that opinion (even if it's not shared by everyone) to the top of the feed. So yeah, you are getting an agenda fed to you on Twitter as well. But m guessing that to you is not communist China. And private parties with profit motives are a worse alternative to governments having SOME control and regulation over social media cuz they don't have a for- profit objective. It's patently stupid to think billionaires are better pressed to be free speech warriors when their whole agenda is money based. It's idiotic to think governments imposing regulations could pose more of a conflict than for profit companies who stand to gain more by promoting a certain pov or agenda that benefits their for-profit interests.","title":"USA Today Becomes Latest Publication to Snub Kamala Harris with Non-Endorsement"},{"text":"breitbart Disregarded","title":"USA Today Becomes Latest Publication to Snub Kamala Harris with Non-Endorsement"},{"text":"I dont think you understand what I am saying.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"LMAO!","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"You gave some exceptions to the rule.

Any social security systems and government policies such as minimum wages and labour rights alleviate this in proportion to how extensive they are.A large population of humans also consume a lot of resources which heavily damages the environment which is contributing to global warming.This is true, but it's also far more complicated than just more humans= more destruction. Some humans contribute far more environmental destruction than others, with these usually being people from wealthier countries or the wealthiest people in general.More humans mean that factories have to produce more products, contributing to more pollution. Soon, the planet will become uninhabitable.Not if consumption of unnecessary goods is reduced and we transition to more renewable power sources.However, I believe with a decline in the number of talents, businesses will have to give higher wages to workers, giving them enough funds to support the old population. Businesses will be forced to innovate more in technology which will make themselves more efficient and produce more money.But this would also lead to more job vacancies which would lead to employees having to worker harder for longer hours to do an amount of work that was previously done by more people. Either that or there would be mass closures of businesses which would mean no relative increase in the value of each worker.\\nThe Black Death killed half of Europe's population and thus broke feudalismNo it didn't.

I'm not going to spend an excessive amount of time looking up info for a reddit discussion, but if you're up for a deep dive just use terms including - nsw electorate results same sex Muslim western sydney poll etc etc etc  you'll find tonnes of polling with support well over the 60% Yes result, and more localised ones with well over the 20-40% results, as well as discussion around it. It was a big talking point, especially as people were pretty shocked at the support they believed they had. I did find surveys that demonstrate the difference between survey responses and actual voting. [This one](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/8/419) is from around the same time.\\"The survey asked a number of questions pertaining to social and interpersonal relations, human rights, and theology. Adding the number of respondents who answered strongly agree or agree to the statements provided, the survey found that respondents overwhelmingly expressed ethical, liberal, progressive views consistent with the above-mentioned typologies. As shown in Table 4, in relation to spousal relations, 95.2 percent said marriage should be based on mutual respect rather than the subservience of one spouse to the other. Concerning human equality, 92.6 percent said people of all religion and no religion should be treated equally, 84.1 percent said women should be given the same rights and opportunities as men, and 93.9 percent said indigenous people should be recognized in Australias constitution.19 These findings refute claims that Muslims are opposed to equality between spouses and people in general as a standard within Islam.\\"Note the findings on the \\"overwhelmingly\\" liberal and progressive views. 92.6% should indicate greater support for same sex marriage. The most telling figure is 93.9% in favour of Constitutional Indigenous recognition. We had a referendum on this issue, too, and I'll give you one guess as to how these same electorates voted.... [Source](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/8/419)\\"The survey also inquired about respondents views on specific principles of democracy. By adding the number of respondents who answered strongly agree or agree, the survey found strong support for the principles of democracy, including: freedom of religion (93.4%), equality of all people under the law (91.1%), human rights, civil liberties and political freedoms (86.9%), rule of law (82.5%), freedom of expression (80.7%), elected political representatives (77.6%), free and independent media (77.6%), independent judiciary (76.7%), and separation of political and religious authorities (54.0%).\\"\\"A slight majority (51.7%) would like classical shariah laws relating to family matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance recognized in Australian law91.1% for equality of all people under the law\\n86.9% for human rights, civil liberties, and political freedoms\\n80.7% freedom of expression All the above suggest a very liberal mindset and support for progressive issues, including same sex marriage.54% separation of political and religious authorities \\n51.7% for shariah law related to family matters such as marriageInterestingly, those results don't really fit with the previous responses.Check it out for yourself. As a start, the survey I linked at the has a lot of interesting data, especially regarding attitudes towards traditional shariah laws, polygamy (males in favour outweighed females 4 to 1, fancy that lol) and other political beliefs.I thought more about potential reasons as to why anyone would lie in an anonymous survey. You say it's unlikely they'd be scared of societal backlash, which would be true as individuals. But it's worth considering the possibility they do so in order to avoid backlash as a group/community. These surveys influence public opinion, so it actually does make sense to lie in order to paint a more favourable picture of Islam, and thus protect Muslims from the societal backlash they'd face if they told the truth. I get the motivation. They don't want to be targeted for their faith by the usual suspects. But the sinister side of that is it also wins a lot of favour from liberals and  progressives who will use this data to celebrate Muslims and prove their values align with western society - only to be betrayed at the ballot box every single time.They're already voting for traditonal conservative parties around the world, They're also voting for Independent candidates who don't really face any scrutiny as they're accepted as legitimate representatives of their community - which they are. But they are also conservative and much more so than the mainstream right.That voting power will continue to grow in Western countries with the full support of well-intentioned liberals and progressives. Unfortunately, the result of this will ultimately be catastrophic for their biggest supporters","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/w1ho4aw0enxd1.jpeg?width=601&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea76f4f490e7ab08670c0ca716f2ee0f6e5c8ebd","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"this will kill the pension system and plunge into crisis","title":"CMV: Lowering birthrates are good for humanity as a whole"},{"text":"Even with this data, fake as it is- clearly shows the democrats winning by a large margin.","title":"When Kamala Harris wins the election, they are definitely citing things like these to engineer a steal"},{"text":"Fully agree A bit of short term hardship makes room for long term prosperity","title":"CMV: Lowering birthrates are good for humanity as a whole"},{"text":"There is no fucking way that advertisement company didn't know what they were doing.","title":"'Vulgar' anti-Kamala Harris billboard in Newark removed after backlash"},{"text":"No true scotsman","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Theres an irony in the fact that many of Trumps supporters, who often come from lower-income and less-educated backgrounds, are among those most affected by his policies, as these groups tend to bear the brunt of the negative impacts.","title":"USA Today Becomes Latest Publication to Snub Kamala Harris with Non-Endorsement"},{"text":"Its really amazing that his campaign is banking on Trumpanomics as their winning message.

Biden didn't even campaign in 2020...*Substance* is actually completely irrelevant. Substance and participation are orthogonal. If a political \\"thing\\" is incredibly vapid and superficial, but 90% of the population participates, then it would be a direct contradiction to your view that participation and/or engagement have dropped.If everyone is talking politics - then even if you think what they're actually saying about politics is meaningless, it still directly contradicts your view that \\"people in democratic societies seem to be more and more adverse to talking politics\\".Biden certainly put out a whole lot of ads in 2020.

Bhutto started it before him. And before him Ayub created the Islamic Ideology Council. What Zia did was empower them too much. Which islamic policy ? How about marital rape not being a crime ? How about the blasphemy laws and death sentences for it ? How about the mobs of religious fanatics that kill non muslims and muslims alike for alleged slights? How about the religious leaders who are used as puppets by the establishment to cause chaos in the country?Pakistan main problem is and always has been the western backed government's, which make policies in favour of themselves rather then the people and country. Secular leader Bhooto of PPP was one of the main culprits in Bangladesh creation. Bai Nazeer, the first lady prime ministers state of Sindh has been run by feudal Lords. You have no knowledge of the countries demise you speak of because your a simpleton.Ad hominem doesn't make you right. Again, do you live in Pakistan ? Pakistan's main problem is the establishment. The religious leaders are backed and used by them. I know a lot more than you seemingly do.Just look at it this way if all of as magically became atheist, what would change.If they had become atheists back in the 60s, pakistan would have been completely different. Atleast we wouldn't have an the ideology council or the federal shariat court.If they become atheists today, they would get the patience they need to fix this country for the future.So is that the only thing you want to argue ? That Pakistan's problem isn't islam ? Pakistan's main problems are islam and the establishment. The \\"western backed\\" governments are a sham to begin with.

Pretty much every seemingly scholarly piece/person I've talked to about the ideas boil the concept down to  we literally define whiteness in racist terms. Irish people were not \\"white\\" when we were prejudice against them, they were Irish, as soon as they became accepted, they became white.  We literally use the term white to include people we accept, and exclude those we like. As other people have said this is about our societies and laws not about individuals, so when I say \\"we\\" I don't mean like, you can me, I mean \\"white\\" societies over all.Additionally our laws were written pretty exclusively by racist people for a large majority of our history, and were written to advantage white people. So even if there was not a single racist person left in the country, a bunch of non racist cops and government systems running by the letter of the law would still be disadvantaging non white people.I have never really read an article/paper on critical race theory, or talked to anyone who seemed knowledgeable about it that implied \\"white people are bad\\". It's all been roughly the above description, including lots of articles linked by right wing people being like \\"look this is what the left believes they hate all white people\\", and then I read the article and really don't think they understood it(or they didn't read it at all).

I was an Economist subscriber for many, many years.  I grew up Republican and am pretty much a centrist as well with one exception - civil rights.  I've lived enough places and have seen enough of racism's effects that I don't want to see us go backwards. I've also got 2 daughters for whom I want to have every opportunity I did as a man.  Several of the things that articles lists - foreign policy, national security, &amp; military - I don't see much of an ideology difference.  Back in the 60s or 70s sure - but today they're just often different views of questions.  i.e., do you side with Ukraine's resistance or do you force them to settle?  On sex crimes, I don't have any idea what they mean by the left vs. right position.  Rape is rape - maybe I'm missing something.On school shootings, you're correct - there is a left vs. right position - do we as a country try to focus on figuring out why these shootings happen or do we lock down the schools more. Environment - you're also correct here - left - protect the environment, right - relax protections. So I'll change some of what I said - there are differences of opinion.There's another way to view the graph's in the article.  Notice how both Fox News and Breitbart both are ideological islands.  I'd submit that both are attempting to pull the country far to the right.  Abortion - we were in pretty much the same place since the 70's.Civil Rights - there has indeed been a steady progression forward for over 100 years.  The right wants to pull us backwards.What scares the hell out of me as a parent is that the Republicans want my daughters to not have access to abortion.   I don't want to see my daughters pregnant until they are in committed relationships and ready.  The Republicans also want to slow down the movement to give my daughters the same rights I've had.  That saddens me.It sounds like the economy is your key issue - none of which ever gets talked about since the Republicans always drag us into these culture issues.  If the difference between Democrats and Republicans was indeed economic, I'd have no problem with a more conservative press.  But since that's never what the Republicans push it's a moot point.Anyways - thanks again.","title":"Why Major Newspapers Wont Endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Ohhh I remember a reporter asking Kamala about this Tweet.

In fact, if we look at history, arts and sciences used to flourish in Islamic regions when they were languishing in Europe, and the Ottoman Empire or Arabic Spain weren't necessarily worse places to live than many European nations (in the latter case especially, Jews could live a decent life - as soon as the Christians reconquered Spain, they threw out all the Jews and then installed the Spanish Inquisition).But in my view, *mainstream* Islam has been radicalised in the last century or so. You can see that even in places where Islam used to be pretty tolerant things have started to go downhill, e.g. Sharia law being instituted in Aceh (Indonesia) in 2003, or the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Islamic terrorist groups have also been able to recruit numerous people that lived in Western Europe, so the bad economical and social conditions in the Middle East seem like an insufficient explanation.Also, trying to compare sexism in Japan with what's going on in Islamic theocracies is just disingenuous. A better comparison would be crazy Christian evangelicals, such as the ones that made homosexuality a capital offense in Uganda. Those are just as awful, but at least they don't do terrorism in Europe, I guess.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"The next James Bond will be Vietnamese","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Certainly fascinating that both sides right now are convinced they are going to win.

Hence SJWs, BLM, Transgenders in Bathrooms being the focus of discussion as opposed to bank bailouts, millions of americans driven into foreclosure, etc.Silicon Valley on the other hand liked lax immigration policy to get the best programmers/I.T. people from across the world. They donated to the Democratic party heavily and eventually eclipsed the influence of the labor unions, which were generally much more hostile to immigration due to how illegal immigrants lower the price of labor.Then of course the U.S. toppled Libya and took what was a fairly prosperous African country, basically leveled it and many of those people fled into mainland europe.

This was far from a consensus on the part of the southern states, and it was certainly not achieved through compassion and respect alone. If compassion and respect were sufficient, Norman Rockwell wouldn't have had to paint *The Problem We All Live With*. So, why is it that compassion and respect are insufficient to make these changes? Well, compassion and respect don't make you a member of the in-group. You can be as compassionate and respectful as you'd like to be, but you'll never change some peoples' opinion about race or sexuality. It's tragic. I don't know how people go through life like that.

No matter how much the modern muslim revisionist tries to change it. Quran encourages gender discrimination, slavery, sex slavery, pedophilia, beating wives.

Second, while the field is stabilizing, the entire economy can slow down. For example, I work in aerospace, and if there are very few mechanical/aerospace engineers, we dont design new planes (or do so at much slower or at lower quality), which means the 95% of employees who arent mechanical engineers have less to do, and are either laid off or face lower salaries.

These examples of democratic Muslim nations is a question of institutions that survive both colonialism, interventionism, and puppet dictators. The successful ones are the ones fighting Western influence so must need unity and a central dogma so that everyone know who is the enemy despite crumbling institutions.Key example look up how the Iran became this boogie man. We (the U.S.) kept a puppet dictator in power and housed him when he was deposed. So of course why would the Muslim trust Western democracy when Western democracy?

They would have done it a long time ago but people would have thought it was evil. After Hillary lost to Trump, the Democrats executed their secret plan to conquer the Internet, claiming they need to censor everything to protect us from dangerous \\"Russian\\" messages that may influence how we vote. This tricked the public into thinking the Democrats massively censoring the Internet is acceptable.The Republicans aren't innocent of this, as they've already claimed that China and Iran are bringing dangerous messages to the Internet that we need to be protected from.When they can't outright ban us, they bring haters into the discussion to discredit the people who said something that's not approved by the leaders.This time, Joe Rogan points out that Democrats are pro-censorship. Very few people put it like this, as most people say it like, \\"Democrats are protecting us from Russians who try to sow chaos in our elections by saying stuff on the Internet\\". When Rogan, or anyone for that matter, says \\"Democrats are pro-censorship\\", people's minds start to awaken, and very very bad things can happen then.

Is it really the culture, or did I just meet the wrong people?\\nGeneralizations can be useful when a pattern is so prominent. We have to be careful with them, but not in denial about existing data, which leads to another bias when someone dismisses patterns, trends, or probabilistic statements, insisting that every scenario must be evaluated individually, even when generalizations are useful or based on solid evidence.Can Muslim countries/cultures/people change to better tolerate others and improve human rights? Yes.\\nWhen? No one knows.Should Western countries be careful about receiving big Muslim populations in the meantime? Absolutely.More detailed thoughts you may find valuable:It's definitely the culture. It's very, very rare for a Muslim not to have aggressive views against homosexuality. I've met/known none. I live in a Muslim country and am open online to Muslims from other countries, mainly Arabic-speaking. And it's not controversial to say that, as it's easy to understand why they believe so, given the way we grew up and were taught certain stories about how God destroyed the people of a certain prophet because they were all homosexual, lol. That story is well known to almost every Muslim. So we're brought up to think homosexuality is unimaginable, disgusting, and hated by God (literally makes God commit genocides) and done by crazy, very fringe people. So we don't even know what it's like. It's not like they hate it because they know it, but because they don't. When they see it in the West, they think it's just a symptom of the West's moral degradation and craziness, not that it's an actual phenomenon.An example is an old post I've seen recently by a news agency on Facebook reporting that the Islamic state threw gay people off rooftops. The comments were shocking to me (despite being an ex-Muslim, I discover every now and then that I've lost touch a little bit with how crazy and dark the culture is), the comments were generally praising that behavior or at least not criticizing it, saying things like \\"ISIS doesn't represent us, but they did something right.\\" That page was Moroccan, so I'd imagine most people in the comments were Moroccan. Morocco is one of the least extreme Islamic countries.I'm not saying Muslims living in the West don't see positive things about the West. I would imagine the civilizational gap forces most people to be impressed by or at least like certain things, but they can adapt to that by saying cringe stuff like that quote by an Egyptian Islamic scholar in the last century: \\"In the West, there's Islam without Muslims, and in our countries, there are Muslims without Islam\\". In other words, Islam guarantees us the success of the West, but we're just not good Muslims.I'd also imagine many Muslims in the West become more open-minded, but not enough to actually be secular, as the base was too conservative, and they moved so little. Many others also become more conservative and protective about their identity as they become more self-conscious about the differences between them and others and take a tribal, defensive position, which explains why many become Islamists in the West when in their home countries they were just more chill, not being too religious or interested in politics or spreading the message of Islam.The story in the US seems different to me at this point, but I'm not sure. I heard that a significant percentage of Muslim Americans leave Islam each year, maybe because the US had gradual, less significant Muslim immigration and also because it's far away from the Muslim world, separated by an ocean, so it generally filtered richer, more open-minded people. And the diversity and freedoms of America seem to also be more effective in changing people.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"Guessing Fox is trying to avoid another Dominion lawsuit and he's not happy they're playing it safer this time?","title":"Trump Dementia: Trump Rages Against Fox News, Praises CNN And MSDNC In Rant Accusing Conservative Network of Sabotaging His Campaign"},{"text":"Like: Is the sky Blue?","title":"Who Is the Best Candidate to Support Our Democracy and Constitutional Right to Protest?"},{"text":"To be fair he said that after he ran for senate.

You cannot universalise such one man one vote principle.Yes you can. To universalize means to take something and ascribe moral value to it. Let us say that it is either virtuous or immoral to vote by testing it through universalizing the act. The idea in deontology is that if an act cannot be universalized in such a way to continue the act continue to exist, then it is not virtuous. For example, someone can argue that it is virtuous to murder. Universalize this (everyone must murder so does) and everyone dies as a result, now there is nobody to murder, the virtue cannot be fulfilled, therefore it fails the universality.Apply this to voting. If not voting is a virtue (as opposed to vice), then there should be no problem if nobody votes. But if nobody votes, then voting itself no longer exists as an option, as some manner of authoritarian rule will take its place. Now you cannot choose not to vote, the choice is removed, ergo the virtue fails. This means that not voting is not the virtue, voting is.Voting can be universalized. If we all vote, then we can continue to vote. The virtue here can be sustained if everyone participates. Therefore it passes universalization. We therefore conclude that voting is the virtue by the principles of deontology.And by using a deontological framework, we also implicitly suggest that we have a rules-based obligation to vote if it is virtuous. Therefore even a single missed vote is wrong.","title":"CMV: voting is totally useless"},{"text":"Muslims opposing democracy and a secular state is a weird point to make considering the country with the largest number of muslims is a secular democracy.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"No, it was just a general pointer to live a better life.

My political views boil down to leave me alone leave my family alone leave my kids alone. Ok so Trump where to start. I do not believe he was a bad president. I grew up on the actions speak louder than words. Yes the man says some outlandish stuff. his actions were Ok. One thing for sure is the media does overblow quite alot of what he says or takes sound bites to make it worse than it is. As far as the economy is concerned. When trump was in office I was making money hand over fist. Gas prices (i know not controlled by president) groceries, intrest rates, and taxes were very low compared to our current times. The economy under trump was the best I've seen in my adult life. Worldwide views. There was not one single war between countries during trump. Take that how you want. I take it in the view that other world leaders looked at trump as you said a wild card. Very fuck around and find out. Let's be honest we have the world's strongest military. If it wasn't for rules or our desire to rebuild a country after a war we could roll through any country in months. Domestic immigration. Look everybody should have a right to the American dream sure. There is a reason why we only allow so many in a year. Coming illegally is not the right anwser. We do need tight border security. We are the safest and strongest country in the world simply due to our location. If we weaken that our ability as a global superpower diminishes with it. As for your two comments about trump leading to the less educated masses. I'm not quite sure where you get that information from. Both sides dem and rep have some absolute dumb asses. Both have very intelligent people. I think that's just more of personal bias than anything set in stone. For kamala being black. We had a black president one of the best we had not sure why now it's regressing? I'm not seeing evidence of that at all. I've traveled to every single state for months every terrortory and this racism that people talk about is not prevalent at all. Yes every single person has bias that's human nature but people tend to lean to who is the most competent over skin color for anything. For the election itself. For every rep volunteer there is a dem. Your specially singaling out one group of people because their ideals are different from yours. I'm not going to go into the implications of that.Supreme Court. Just cause the justices lean conservative they still follow the law. Yes there are a few rulings that can be attributed to upbringing but that is every single human. I don't think you have to worry about them if the vote is for Harris she will be president. As for the damning points in your debates. Sometimes there just isn't a counter argument. Sometimes the candidate just said or did something stupid. Trump has kamala has. Google it and if you can't find a good counter point maybe there isn't one and it's Just a bad policy. 99% of politics is opinion. The last 4 years have been very rough when you look at the last 12 to compare it to. Yes kamala wasn't president and didn't have power to make policy one big issue is she still has yet to come out in support of anything different. It seems she reads from a teleprompter and if the news is wrong or recieved wrong she back tracks. It's happend quite a bit at this point. One major thing I can point to she was tasked by biden to bring internet to rural America and not one single home got connected. For trumps side. Not going to touch on the bs like 2025 or immigrants eating pets. \\nNot sure why people frame trump as a racist? That was never even a thought until he ran for president. It just feels so disingenuous. The LBGT is what it is. People can do what make them happy. Promise you nobody cares until you bring kids into it. The problem your seeing is you have educators teaching this in class to kids. That's not something kids need to learn. I've seen videos about a teacher wanting to be called zee and Zim? Tf is that. Does not belong in schools. Neither does parading naked or half naked down the street in a parade. That's for anybody man woman gay straight. It's just viewed as a LBGT thing cause it's pushed so hard in media. And row v wade. Let's be real here. In regards to the constitution. The Supreme Court made the right decision. I don't have a dog in that race but from a legal standpoint they were correct. It wasn't a issue of abortions. It was the issue of the federal government imposing it's view on individual states which is expressly forbidden in the constitution. Please stop comparing trump and Republicans to nazis. You do a great disservice to those who lost their lives and the people we sent to stop thay regime. It is not even a close comparison.","title":"CMV:  Harris/Walz don't have a chance in hell of winning.  And if Trump wins, it will completely destroy the country.  PLEASE change my view.

Although podcasts like JRE feel very off-the-cuff, they are still edited and allow for the guest to prepare for the interview. Think of it as that person at their most collected, the most on-the-ball. And in just about every other appearance he has had, Trump has been a mess. Whenever he doesn't have a clear topic and a teleprompter, Trump tends to be rant-y, tangential and seemingly a little confused. This has become more obvious in his more recent appearances, but even his older interviews have him going off on tangents that have nothing to do with the topic or question. Even putting aside policy, which I should emphasize he is a mess on as well, Trump has never struck me as someone who is good at getting across ideas. Take any rally, and think about what he is actually saying. How much are actual ideas about his policy and stances and how much are just vague statements that generally make him sound good? Very little or what I've seen strike me as the former.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is currently the best choice for President."},{"text":"Of course she is.

However, if the letter of the law is viewed as illegitimate--say it says that marijuana is as bad as heroin--if it is widely known there is no longer political consensus behind the law, the law will be viewed as an illegitimate dead letter.?

F them. Sergey Brin is a trainwreck with multiple wives and affairs. Andy Rubin, Father of Android, used to run a sex ring as if hes Diddy. Google suppresses our information and our voices. Censor or suppress if it doesnt align with them.Im glad Trump pointed out that we have the most corrupt government in the world with media biases, censorship, people getting fired for voicing their support for Trump, and rigged elections. And thats why theyre mad at him and are willing to kill him like Epstein. They do not want to be exposed as the frauds they truly are.Trump needs to arrest them all after they tried putting him in prison after all these years and still zero convictions. Zero prison time. Karma, bitches. Because they will continue to lie and cheat the American people if Trump doesnt put these hypocrites behind bars. Make sure to plant GOP spies in those Democratic cities in case another cheat happens.Must learn from 2020 and make sure Trump has watchdogs all over the country.

What I believe is happening is more Americans are becoming Libertarian, and more former Republicans and Democrats are also shifting towards being a Libertarian. And Libertarians tend to organize and form a loosely based coalition on the side that allows them to speak. For example, I think Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, Bill Burr, Dr Phil and someone like Jordan Peterson are actually Libertarians at heart. Greg Gutfeld is Libertarian. He does criticize Republicans all the time. He doesn't go after the Military Industrial Complex and Big Pharma though, because he's on Fox. But his viewpoints would not be tolerated on CNN or MSNBC. I enjoy RFK and Gabbard on some level, but to me, they are just more political grifters. I even consider Trump to be just another political grifter. People who have found \\"success\\" at something else have the freedom to be Libertarians. Someone like Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool, Candace Owens, Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, if they weren't political pundits, they'd be working in a Chipotle right now. All grifters.

Or maybe that even the article doesnt intentionally use a tweet from a few days ago as proof against something that happened today. But here is my firsthand account of what happened. Im extremely interested in politics and I follow all the events on both sides. This is my SuperBowl essentially. Podcast is released on October 25th and it proceeds to get close to 1million views per hour. The next day it drops off to maybe 500k per hour. On the 25th, 26th, and 27th I could go into YouTube and type in Joe Rogan or Joe Rogan Trump and find the podcast within the search results. Today when I woke up I went to check in and see how many views it had at about 8:00am Central Time. I typed in a multitude of search terms and it was impossible to find the podcast. Not even typing in the exact name could find it. Yet typing in the name of any other podcast episode would reveal it within the search results.\\nAround 3pm central time, things really started to blow up on X, Reddit, and YouTube videos, calling this fact out. Nobody who searched for the podcast could find it. The topic hit #1 trending on X and within 20 minutes, you could once again find the podcast by searching Joe Rogan.How could this be a fluke? How could only this specific episode not be searchable? How did it become searchable again right at the peak of backlash? Why are other media releasing articles to mislead us by saying Joe Rogan himself said its not censored. When he didnt say that in regards to todays issue. We know very well that videos can be shadow banned from search. YouTube has the ability to do this and has demonstrated it before. Perhaps a rogue actor at YouTube did this. Perhaps it came from higher up. I dont know. But it didnt happen by accident. It was clearly intentional.","title":"Youtube Censoring Joe Rogan Trump video with 33 million views."},{"text":"That is the wrong message.

Mainly being that these aggressive muslims you talk about experiencing in your own life are not practicing islam. -Islamic laws and teaching cannot be applied to non-muslims. Is an atheist or christian or whatever other faith chooses to be gay, a muslim has no place to apply islamic teaching on them. -Any muslim you see in a club or bar is obviously not practicing islam. This is more likely a case of them being irresponsible with newfound freedoms since those things are looked down upon in most muslim countries. -Being aggressive in general goes against the teachings of islam as there are multiple hadiths (quotes) talking about the importance of remaining calm, with one example being do not become angry and you will enter paradise. This in regard to interacting with all people. Muslim and otherwise. A personal note from me would be that ive noticed (also from my personal experience) that countries that display more islamophobia in general (germany, UK, france, etc) tend to get more aggressive Muslim youths. Which in turn spurs the islamophobes.

Nevada EV is a complete disaster for Democrats. Jon Ralston (the Nevada Oracle) just posted a blog saying Harris needs to win independents by 10 to barely win the state?\\n2. The Dem margin in PA mail in vote is below 60%. Biden won this by 65% in 2020 and in 2022 Dems won it by 69%. If it stays below 60% (looks likely because in the last few days Rs out requested Ds) there is absolutely no way they can win Pennsylvania (remember Biden only won by 2% with 65% of the mail in vote)?\\n3. Black turnout in Georgia is the lowest it's been since 2004. There is no way the Dems can win Georgia or NC if blacks aren't voting. The last souls to the polls (black churches busing people to the polls) was this Sunday and it only increased the black turnout by 0.1%. Also Duval county in Florida (Jacksonville) is currently red in the early vote and it's voted the same way Georgia has voted since 2000.?\\n4. The Gallup party identification survey average is R+1 this metric has been extremely accurate at predicting the national popular vote going back dozens of election cycles. If Trump wins the popular vote there is no way Harris can win the electoral college (538 puts it at a less than 1 in 100 chance, it's more likely to be a 269 tie than for that to happen)?\\n5. According to Michael Pruser the GOP is turning out more of their low propensity voters than the Dems are turning out. Generally the party that turns out more low propensity voters wins?\\n6. The turnout in Milwaukee and Madison is lower than 2020 right now while the WOW counties (Republican suburban/rural counties around Milwaukee) are having record turnout.?\\n7. Rs lead the early vote in NC which is something they have never done before?\\nThe only somewhat good state for the Dems right now is Michigan.

This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support. It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.  \\nWe have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to two years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across state lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world. All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.  \\n\\\\-Bill Clinton SOTU address 1995","title":"Liberals from 25 years ago would be considered far right today."},{"text":"He knows the prices will go up.

I think somewhere I already knew that but I needed someone to remind me.Ideology is strong and it doesn't even need to come from religion. Maybe muslim preachers and states are just better at spreading and planting their beliefs deep in people's minds than others, but comparing ideologies really doesn't help anyone. At least it's clear to me now, after reading good points for a whole while, that some ideology must have got to me too to even think this way.I'll just return to being a cynic, thanks for taking your time and writing all that out. This might be my favorite response.Edit: Since delta didn't recognize this comment, I'll elaborate some more. The negative experiences I've made with muslims, did support me in believing that the problem was the islamic belief system in contrast to other religions. But many comments, and especially this one, have convinced or rather reminded me, that this is absolutely not a problem local to muslim beliefs. Any strong ideology that is blindly  followed by its believers can cause similar amounts of harm. And history as well as an actual comparison to other religions, especially regarding the behavior of their followers, absolutely show that this is true. You can look at nazis, the crusades, authoritarian states, anti-humanitarian rulings based on religion, bush invading afghanistan on the basis of the bible as pointed out in another comment, and numerous other examples. It's undeniable. No matter how good your ideology is, there's only the need of one bad belief to screw the entire rest over. And if you blindly follow everything, it's unavoidable to encounter that problem eventually.Everyone has their beliefs, whether they are religious or not, but there's always the need for re-evaluations of these beliefs in regular intervals.Pretending like that all was a problem local to islam is absurd. I see that now.","title":"CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries"},{"text":"A Trump apology?
