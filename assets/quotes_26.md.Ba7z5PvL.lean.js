We just have a hard time understanding how voting for someone that very obviously does not have their best interests, and in fact in some cases have policies that directly go against their best interests,, makes any sense. If they want things to get better for them, it makes 0% sense to vote for someone who is at best, not going to care about them, and at worst, going to make things worse, right?For instance, MAGA folks want a full stop on immigration, including H1B Visas. The billionaires that surround Trump rely on those Visas to find valuable skilled workers and want to keep H1B Visa flowing, instead of increasing education spending and outreach programs to help lower class people get the skills they need to fill the roles that H1B Visa holders are filling. So instead of helping themselves by voting for a candidate that wanted to increase education spending, they voted for one that wants to shut down the Department of Education and keep those poor people poor and uneducated. Do you see why this is confusing to us? Trump is siding with the billionaires and has said he will not stop the granting of H1B Visas like the MAGA voters want.

And Mr. Reichs anxious class  neither the impoverished nor the highfliers riding the rising global stock market  felt unheard until the rise of an unlikely new kind of Republican: Donald J. Trump.To me, this framing makes a lot more sense than stating working class as the movers behind this alone, if only because working class is nebulous enough to mean anyone outside of the wealthiest and poorest among us if you shift the margins.Its not only the working class whose anxieties are being used to gain political power.  Its often those in higher income stratum who are acting the same.  See the recent blow-up over H1B Visas.

Lets unpack this.Youre absolutely right that humanity has accumulated a significant moral debt, and its fair to assign responsibility to the current generation for both perpetuating and addressing it. However, framing it entirely as our fault oversimplifies the issue. The idea of debt implies clear lines of accountability, but moral failings are more like a tangled web of systemic issues, individual actions, and historical inertia. While its valid to feel disheartened by the scale of our challenges, viewing one generations actions in isolation ignores how centuries of compounding choices have built our current reality. Even so, youre correct that systemic problems rely on individual complicity. The challenge lies in balancing these perspectivesacknowledging personal responsibility without overlooking structural forces that constrain and shape our actions.Your frustration with empathy as half-evolved and often ineffective is compelling, though perhaps a bit harsh. Human empathy wasnt designed for the abstract, large-scale moral challenges we face today; it evolved to prioritize survival in small, close-knit groups. The fact that weve managed to stretch this limited capacity to care about global issues at all is remarkable, even if its inconsistent. While you argue that progress only happens when it aligns with convenience, that overlooks the sustained advocacy and innovation often required to make these shifts possible. Industrialization and lab-grown meat may reduce harm, but they didnt arise purely out of laziness or convenience. Empathy, even in its imperfect state, doesnt need to be flawless to drive meaningful change.Your critique that systemic problems are really individual failures in disguise is a valid but harsh assessment. Many people could care more, act more, or push harder for change, and cultural norms often provide convenient excuses for apathy. However, its important to recognize that these norms are deeply entrenched and difficult to overcome. People arent simply choosing not to care; theyre shaped by a lifetime of cultural conditioning, misinformation, and conflicting priorities. Your own reflection on your innate human bias speaks volumes. If someone as self-aware and reflective as you struggles to align philosophy with action, it highlights just how challenging it is to break free from these ingrained patterns. While its tempting to condemn others outright, its often more productive to focus criticism on the systems that perpetuate this apathy rather than the individuals caught within them.Your acknowledgment of progress is key, even if it comes with a degree of cynicism. You seem torn between frustration at humanitys flaws and hope for its capacity for change, and that tension is what fuels meaningful action. Recognizing our moral shortcomings and the systemic challenges we face doesnt negate the importance of optimism; it makes it more grounded. Progress is undeniably slow and often tied to convenience, but it is still progress. The moral arc of humanity doesnt bend as quickly or dramatically as we might wish, but it does bend. Believing in eventual redemption while confronting the messy reality of the present is a powerful stance. We dont need perfect empathy or morality to keep moving forward; we just need enough people, acting enough of the time, to keep pushing.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"I will never forget how smug democrats were when he was announced and all the back patting for how clever they were being and what a slap in the face to republicans it was to nominate him.

These rural areas rely on the infrastructure provided by the cities to survive and sale their goods outside of their rural area. Without the infrastructure funds provided for by the city, there would be no international selling, no long distance transportation/selling.

They issued a directive to some powerful lawmakers and allies seeking one-on-one time: The exchanges should be short and focused, according to people who received the message directly from White House aides.\\n \\nIdeally, the meetings would start later in the day, since Biden has never been at his best first thing in the morning, some of the people said.

On one such occasion, in the spring of 2021, a national security official explained to another aide why a meeting needed to be rescheduled.

Obama's band-aid fixes after the 2008 recession got rolled back almost immediately, and with them other New Deal reforms of the financial industry. It sounds like both Republicans and Democrats are against the workers best interest. The only difference is how quickly it destroys the working class standard of living. The only parties discussing any of these issues are third parties and you said you won't vote for them. So I guess all that's left is to be stupid and vote against worker's best interest?","title":"How the Democrats Lost the Working Class"},{"text":"And this led to a legitimate overreaction which just so happened to end up flooding places like this?","title":"A new virus has been rising in china for the past week.."},{"text":"this entire sub the last biden election while the remainder of us pointed out the rich doesnt get punished and were called doomers and negative for being realistic?","title":"Fatal Mistake: Democrats Blame DOJ As Trump Escapes Accountability For Jan. 6 - Merrick Garland wasted a year, Rep.

Whatever you do, dont retort Didnt you choose the bear?","title":"What do your liberal friends and family blame Kamalas loss on?"},{"text":"I'm starting to feel better thanks to this comment section, and I appreciate your encouragement, but there are some issues.These examples indicate that humans are capable of recognizing moral shortcomings and taking collective steps to address them.Fair, but I never really doubted our ability to turn it around. I'm a misanthrope, not a pessimist, thank you very much :p. I'm more concerned about the current state of our actions. If morality or \\"karma\\" were like a company, we'd be *balls deep* in debt right now, and by and large we're the generation of leadership that has caused the most of that debt, and maybe our individual decisions are wiser than before, but the sheer scale of the debt we're taking on is alarming.Second, human morality is deeply influenced by evolutionary and cultural factors, which shape how we prioritize issues. Its not that people inherently dont care; its that our moral instincts evolved in small, close-knit groups, where immediate survival concerns took precedence. This doesnt absolve anyone of responsibility, but it does help explain why widespread issues like factory farming or climate change feel abstract and distant to many. However, the same evolutionary psychology that limits us also enables us to form empathy and coalitions for change. Movements advocating for justicewhether for humans, animals, or the planetdemonstrate this capacity.Another part of the issue??. We're not just the middle children of history, but of *empathy* as well, evolved too late to lack guilt and empathy, but evolved too early to actually have empathy that *works* as opposed to... whatever the the hell this is supposed to be... We're just empathetic enough to realize and care, but not to actually reliably do anything about it other than this *painstaking* grind that only seems to move forward whenever it doesn't inconvenience us (a la lab grown meat seeming to be the only thing that could end animal slaughter, and the end of slavery *just so happening* to perfectly coincide with the industrial revolution and beginning of automation).Third, your argument risks conflating individual culpability with systemic challenges. While individuals play a role in perpetuating harmful systems, those systems are often deeply entrenched and resistant to change. Blaming individuals for systemic failures oversimplifies the complexity of societal structures. For instance, many people consume animal products because they live in cultures where alternatives are less accessible or affordable, not because they consciously choose to perpetuate suffering. Addressing these issues requires structural changepolicy reforms, economic shifts, and technological innovationrather than individual guilt alone.I strongly disagree on this one. Each individual *chooses* to not care about these things, at least not enough to actually *do* anything! It's like seeing someone getting robbed and going \\"Jeez, that sucks. Thoughts and prayers??\\" before walking away and forgetting about the interaction entirely. And from experience, most people consume animal products because they don't give a fuck, they're more worried about their preferences or freedom or health or perceived masculinity or that the \\"deep state\\" is trying to control them or whatever new BS they've come up with, whining about the world economic forum and eating bugs or whatever the fuck. And many of these issues are core value problems, where nobody would ever find it acceptable for someone to view a puppy and a baby with the same significance and not give the baby special preference, because then they act like *you're* the monster for not having as strong an in-group bias??. Most people just say \\"don't care, I like bacon\\" and that's it, not a drop of empathy, not a single. fucking. drop. And I've been guilty of this exact thing for ages and still my philosophy doesn't align with my innate human bias. I don't have the same empathetic response to animal suffering as human suffering (I think I'd lose my mind if I did), but I can realize it's wrong, like a sociopath who understands *why* other people matter but can't bring themselves to feel anything (okay, not *quite* that bad, but it really feels like it sometimes, my own unintentional lack of empathy disturbs me sometimes, even more than the lack of empathy I see in others). We're pretty decent at being good within a small moral circle, but terrible outside that small circle of beings and issues we care about, because the vast majority can't even identify it as a moral issue in the first place.In sum, while the human condition is far from perfect, it is neither static nor irredeemable. Recognizing our flaws is important, but so is acknowledging our capacity for progress and improvement. Instead of despairing over what we havent yet achieved, we should focus on the ongoing efforts and incremental changes that reflect the better side of humanity. Progress may be slow and uneven, but it is undeniably real and its worth fighting for.I do agree overall though, that the future looks bright and we'll eventually not just pay off our karmic debt but turn a profit!","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"Moar paleeze.","title":"Biden awards Medal of Freedom to Hillary Clinton, Soros, Messi and 16 others"},{"text":"China China China China China China China China","title":"Trump Blasts 'Biden/Harris Injustice Department,' Claims He Was 'Evilly and Illegally Treated' in Hush Money Case: 'The Judge Should Be Disbarred!'"},{"text":"Working class Americans have BS detectors when people use faculty room language.But apparently not any BS detectors for snake oil salesmen who actually hold them in contempt.","title":"How the Democrats Lost the Working Class (Gift Article)"},{"text":"Because the 'right,' evidently, DGAF about democracy.","title":"The crisis of democracy is really a crisis for the left"},{"text":"Well, Democrats could have fixed it, but they chose not to vote.

The idea that were all way, way worse than we realize hinges on a moral absolutism that doesnt fully account for the nuances of human behavior, psychology, and progress. Heres why I disagree with this view:First, moral progress is real and measurable. Societies today are far more conscious of issues like human rights, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare than they were in the past. While the changes may not be happening as quickly or comprehensively as youd like, they represent a clear trend of improvement. For example, global movements for animal welfare have led to legislative changes, increased awareness, and growing populations of vegetarians and vegans. Similarly, climate change activism has sparked significant policy shifts and technological innovations. These examples indicate that humans are capable of recognizing moral shortcomings and taking collective steps to address them.Second, human morality is deeply influenced by evolutionary and cultural factors, which shape how we prioritize issues. Its not that people inherently dont care; its that our moral instincts evolved in small, close-knit groups, where immediate survival concerns took precedence. This doesnt absolve anyone of responsibility, but it does help explain why widespread issues like factory farming or climate change feel abstract and distant to many. However, the same evolutionary psychology that limits us also enables us to form empathy and coalitions for change. Movements advocating for justicewhether for humans, animals, or the planetdemonstrate this capacity.Third, your argument risks conflating individual culpability with systemic challenges. While individuals play a role in perpetuating harmful systems, those systems are often deeply entrenched and resistant to change. Blaming individuals for systemic failures oversimplifies the complexity of societal structures. For instance, many people consume animal products because they live in cultures where alternatives are less accessible or affordable, not because they consciously choose to perpetuate suffering. Addressing these issues requires structural changepolicy reforms, economic shifts, and technological innovationrather than individual guilt alone.Fourth, your view overlooks the immense diversity of human actions and motivations. People exhibit both selfishness and altruism, indifference and compassion, cruelty and kindness. While its true that many fail to meet their own moral ideals, the fact that those ideals exist at all suggests a striving for betterment. From the small acts of kindness that occur daily to the global efforts to combat poverty, disease, and injustice, there is evidence of human goodness that cant be dismissed as superficial or insignificant.Finally, while self-awareness of our moral failings is valuable, framing this awareness as penance risks becoming paralyzing rather than productive. Guilt, in excess, can lead to despair and inaction. A more constructive approach is to channel this awareness into meaningful action, however small. While no single individual can solve systemic problems, collective effortsfueled by many individuals doing their parthave historically driven change.In sum, while the human condition is far from perfect, it is neither static nor irredeemable. Recognizing our flaws is important, but so is acknowledging our capacity for progress and improvement. Instead of despairing over what we havent yet achieved, we should focus on the ongoing efforts and incremental changes that reflect the better side of humanity. Progress may be slow and uneven, but it is undeniably real and its worth fighting for.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"No kidding like broken record","title":"Democrat strategist James Carville thinks recent terror attacks can be attributed to frustrated \\"incels\\" ??"},{"text":"Political discussions being brought offline.

(See part B(4) of the ruling). \\"We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process.\\"And we've seen this play out.  The Russian government in 2016 [spent oodles of money](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1035562/dl?inline=) to help elect Donald Trump via various cutout corporations in the US.*  **The government doesn't need to give tax breaks for political speech.**While corporations have some properties of groups of people, they have other properties that make them much more favorable, and that the government can reasonably put restrictions on.  Most notably, nonprofit corporations like Citizens United (the group) don't pay taxes on the money they receive, and donors to them may get tax deductions for their giving.  The government can pretty reasonably say that they don't want to be giving tax breaks for this sort of thing.  If I, a human being, want to spend money on an ad campaign, I have to use money I've paid income tax on.  If Citizens United does, they don't need to pay income tax because they're organized as a not-for-profit.It's totally reasonable to say that availing yourself of a tax break limits how you can use the money that was subject to the tax break.  And remember it isn't the speech, but the spending money on the speech, that is in question. * **Letting people hide behind corporations provides shields they shouldn't have.**Likewise, putting money into a corporation limits liability in ways that it doesn't for individuals.  Let's say I want to run an ad against a candidate that's clearly defamatory and false.  If the ad is run by a corporation, the corporation can't be sued for damages past the funds of the company, which if the company is purpose-built for a political campaign, will likely be $0 by the time a lawsuit is completed.  In contrast, if I speak or act on my own behalf as a human being, I am subject to liability as against all I own.Likewise, hiding behind a corporation can let someone lie and deceive voters.  For example, during the 2024 campaign, Elon Musk used a front corporation to make a series of ads [deceiving voters into thinking they were offensive Kamala Harris ads.](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/30/g-s1-31042/elon-musk-kamala-harris-facebook)  If Elon Musk had been forced to disclose that it was in fact Elon Musk funding them, instead of a front called \\"Building Americas Future,\\" that would have greatly changed the impact of the ads.  People can't change their identity as humans nearly so easily as a company can change names, or as a new company can be created.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

I'll focus on corporations since that's the main issue here.Your claim that corporations are \\"just groups of people\\" is overly simplistic. Corporations are artificial legal entities specifically created to shield individuals from liability and pool capital. They have special privileges that regular groups of people don't get - like limited liability and perpetual existence. These aren't natural rights, they're privileges granted by the state.When corporations spend money on political speech, they're not expressing the collective voice of their employees or shareholders. The CEO and board make these decisions, often using money earned through the labor of thousands of workers who might completely disagree with the message. Your local cashier at Walmart has zero say in how the company spends its political money. What *is* a corporation if it's not a group of people?A corporation is a legal fiction created to facilitate business. It's not a natural association like a union (where members actually vote on political spending) or a genuine grassroots nonprofit.The First Amendment was meant to protect individual citizens from government censorship, not to give artificial entities with concentrated wealth unlimited influence over our democracy. The founders would be horrified to see multinational corporations wielding more political power than actual citizens.There's a reason we don't let foreign governments buy political ads in US elections. Concentrated power distorts democratic discourse, whether it comes from governments or corporations.

I guess thats easy to do when you lie about things being bad in the first place.The #1 thing I heard over and over again for 2-3 weeks after the election was, \\"look at how well the stock market responded after Trump won. Looks like businesses are happy!\\" Like I had a sub who I only share polite pleasantries with feel like it was safe to dick ride Trump in front of me while shitting on another older liberal teacher who expressed their worry about the effect deportation and tariffs will have on the economy. I had to stop the dude and argue against him and it was instantly clear he hadn't really thought anything through.1. Ya the stock market boomed for a few days, which likely had more to do with the election not being close, the election not being contested, and there being no protesting or violence. Every person I talked to was freaking out saying they thought Republicans AND DEMOCRATS were going to contest the election of they lost despite there only being clear evidence of one party attempting an actual fucking coup. 2. Dude was bragging that \\"I made $20000 last week\\". I reminded him he's only actually made that money if he's sold his stock. Did he? No of course not that his retirement plan, he can't sell that stock! Well then you didn't earn shit. Your bank isn't gonna give you a spiffy 1% interest loan on that money either, that reserved for the oligarchs, not for use average Joe's. 3. I also reminded him that many of the stocks that did so well, like Tesla, are basically performing as meme like crypto currency at this point. People are buying stock based on vibes and political loyalty, and not only how some of these companies are actually performing. The Tesla rollout of the cyber truck compounded with almost a half decade of declining quality with all their other models. I talked to him about Dogo Coin and how the price basically is entirely dependent on jokes and influencer support and I asked him if he would be comfortable investing $20k into something like that. \\"Absolutely not, that sounds like a terrible idea.\\" Well that's what you're doing when you buy and hold stock in Tesla at this point. 4. And to bring it all home, I asked him what he thought the impact of tariffs and mass deportations would have on inflation, our economy, and the stock market. He immediately led off with, \\"well I don't think Trump's gonna actually do any of that.\\" I reminded him that Trump at the very least attempted to do everything he promised he would during his first term (except work on infrastructure). Now Trump's only bring in yes men, has an money purse in Musk promising to spend millions to unseat at Republican in Congress that doesn't do as Trump says, and he has at least 5 seats on the supreme Court that either fully support his ideology, or are personally reliant on him for the seats they hold. He's gonna do what he wants. And that ignoring the fact that your voting for someone who you think won't uphold his two major election promises. Says alot about a person. Fact is if either deportations or tariffs come into play, our economy is gonna be toast and inflation will once again be the word of the day. Some fun days on the stock market back in November won't change that.","title":"GOP Cheers Hakeem Jeffries For Saying Trump Won  Until He Notes Which Party Is Home To Election Deniers"},{"text":"Torching every shred of goodwill on the way out.

It is bad that people are losing faith in their governmental institutions, causing society to become more unstable. And people lose faith in institutions that they believe are corrupt.For an example of this, see the amount of hate youve gotten for even posting this pro-*Citizens United* CMV. People hate the government because they think it is corrupt, and most redditors would see your view as fostering such corruption. Allowing unlimited independent expenditures by wealthy corporations, who push out messages that help elect or defeat specific candidates for office, only increases disillusionment in government. It leads people to believe that those officials are working not for the public interest writ large, or even for the interests of their constituents, but for the interests of the wealthy corporations who helped them get elected through favorable messaging.If people dont trust the government, they will attempt to take matters into their own handsthrough violence, if they believe violence is necessary. Consider the street violence and attempted insurrection that occurred throughout 2020 and January of 2021. Much of that was fostered by the disillusionment people had, on both right and left, in different types of governmental institutions. (Obviously the pandemic was the precipitating factor, but it was not the root cause of the protests and violence.) If *Citizens United* has an effect of increasing such loss of faith in institutionsthe direction in which the available evidence seems to pointits a dangerous decision, indeed. Fostering the appearance of corruption is like spilling a tub of gasoline; any idiot with a match can then come along and start a fire. We would be better off if the dissenters had prevailed.NOTE: Im not trying to morally equate the George Floyd protests, the street violence of summer and fall 2020, and the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Those are, morally speaking, very different matters, and I will let you draw your own ethical conclusions. I am merely trying to say that the loss of faith in governmental institutions fosters instability.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

Number 2 we have got to get a handle on NOW. We are NOT united as a group regarding our messaging and it's killing us. Pelosi, while a great whip, is whipping votes in the WRONG DIRECTION. While Leader Jeffries is new at his current position, he is not new in Congress.

Then again, Jeffries was Pelosi's protege, so maybe I'm asking too much of him. That's not ok anymore.

And the first step towards doing that is to STOP doing things by seniority (\\"it's their turn\\"), let your party vote for whomever for leadership without people putting their thumbs on the scale, and get everyone on the same message. Don't vote for a damn thing unless the Republicans are going to be bipartisan AND it's effective change. Make them whip their own party together if they want to forward their agenda.

I'm not saying the left does things perfectly, and I am positive to keeping a dialogue on how to improve things open.The double standard comes from holding one side accountable for their mistakes while the other side seemingly gets away with murder (or as in this case, rape, fraud and pedophilia).In conclusion; I don't think one should exclude the other, both should be held accountable for their actions, and I agree with you that it can be seen as a hopeful sign, but I also understand the feeling of hopelessness for people who see the right-wing the same way I do, and believe Trump and Musk, along with many of their cabinetpicks, are horrible persons. It just seems like we are analyzing how to prevent the 8 year old boy who frequently shits himself from doing so at a funeral, and thinking of ways to mitigate such a situation by bringing diapers and having them on a strict diet. Meanwhile we don't really care about the other kid, the one who sets animals on fire, loves exposing himself and slaps strangers for no good reason.\\nThe key differences of course being the boy with IBS *cares* about what happens, and the other kid doesn't.\\nSorry for the wall of text, hopefully I've answered how analyzing this loss can feel like upholding a double standard, even though that's not what it really is.","title":"How the Democrats Lost the Working Class"},{"text":"No, they're hired to do what they're told.

Elon and Trump are wrong, claims an X post by Nick Fuentes, a MAGA figure with a long history of racist and antisemitic commentary.But Sanders is wrong. Whats more, hes wrong in the same way hes been wrong for decades.Indentured servitude is a contract to work for a single employer for a predetermined period without pay, David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, wrote in April 2024. H?1B workers are not only paidthey receive wages in the top 10 percent of wage earners in the United States. As importantly, although they face more obstacles to changing jobs, H?1B workers are not tied to a single employer and they change jobs regularly. Indeed, employers have to pay considerable fees just to hire an H-1B visa holder.Not only that, but job shifters were even more common than new hires, among H-1B recipients. In 2023, about 61 percent of all H?1B workers starting with a new employer were existing H?1B workers hired away from other employers in the United States, Bier added. This means that US employers are more likely to hire an H?1B worker already in the United States in H?1B status [than] they are to hire a new H?1B worker not already with H?1B status.Employers are also required by law to pay H-1B visa holders a prevailing wage, which the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) defines as the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment. As Bier wrote in 2020, 100 percent of H-1B employers audited by the DOL were doing so, while 78 percent actually paid their visa holders even moreon average, 20 percent above the prevailing wage.Sanders support for immigration has long been more tepid than one may assume, given he caucuses with the Democratic Party. In a 2015 interview with Ezra Klein, Sanders perplexingly referred to open borders as a Koch brothers proposal.It would make everybody in America poorer, Sanders added. Youre doing away with the concept of a nation state. Trump has made nearly identical remarks, telling a crowd in 2018, If you dont have borders, then you dont have a country.Sanders has long believed that increased immigration depresses wages for American workers. In 2007, he helped kill a bipartisan immigration reform bill that would have created a path to citizenship for those here illegally. While Sanders supports both a path to citizenship and welcoming more refugees and asylum seekers, he opposed the 2007 law over its guest worker program that would allow foreign workers to receive two-year work visas.I dont know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now, Sanders told Lou Dobbs at the time.The most recent economic evidence suggests that, on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans, according to a 2012 report from the Brookings Institution. Based on a survey of the academic literature, economists do not tend to find that immigrants cause any sizeable decrease in wages and employment of U.S.-born citizens, and instead may raise wages and lower prices in the aggregate.Similarly, an April 2024 working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that between 2000 and 2019, immigration had a positive and significant effect of between 1.7 percent and 2.6 percent on wages of less educated native workersand no significant wage effect on college educated natives. The paper also found a positive employment rate effect for most native workers.In his statement this week, Sanders also implied that programs like H-1B are merely a ploy to bring foreign workers into the country on promises of high-skilled work, only to then employ them in low-skilled positions. If this program is supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers?Sanders use of importing to describe the voluntary movement of individual people is dehumanizingand Trumpian. But his larger point is also incorrect: Bernies statement implies that you can get an H-1B to be a masseuse and cook. That is wrong, Bier tells Reason. Those jobs do not require a college degree and are ineligible.https://www.yahoo.com/news/bernie-sanders-still-wrong-immigration-201514942.html","title":"Bernie Sanders Wades Into MAGA Civil War to Trash Elon Musk"},{"text":" It doesn't matter what your economic policies are if the white working class has a preference for voting for white supremacy over economics.Spot on","title":"How the Democrats Lost the Working Class"},{"text":"Trump by no means won 2024 \\"fair and square\\".

FEC* to find that corproations, as opposed to individuals, do not have the right under the first amendment to advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate for office.  This was the big thing that the Supreme Court reversed, holding that corporations do have that right under the first amendment.So let's get into that:**Are corporations groups of people?**  Sometimes.  But those people have different rights under the first amendment.  A corporation can be owned by one or more human beings, by other corporations, or by governments, or by any combination of those.  For example, the whole case currently before the Supreme Court related to TikTok's first amendment rights has to do with the fact that TikTok is owned (in part directly, and in part indirectly) by the government of the People's Republic of China.A corporation *could* be wholly owned by US citizens in the US, who are subject to maximum first amendment protection.  Or it could be owned by a foreign government, which would be subject to no first amendment protection.  Or it could be owned by foreign persons outside the US with much more limited first amendment protection.  Without disclosure of the true ownership of the corporation, you do not know whether or to what extent its owners are protected by the first amendment.In the case of a nonprofit like Citizens United, it becomes even more complicated because it doesn't have owners, and its primary purpose is to funnel donations to some end.  So you would have to consider the rights of the donors.  If a nonprofit has a board made of US citizens in the US, but is principally or exclusively funded by a foreign government, does that nonprofit have first amendment rights to use those funds to try to influence a US election?","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the bill that *Citizens United vs. FEC* actually struck down, limited spending on political media by unions, think tanks, and corporations in the 30 days before a party nomination and the 60 days before a general election. It did not restrict the actual production of that media or even its airing provided it wasn't funded in ways that violated BCRA. Therefore, it did not abridge free speech because people could still freely express their policy or candidate preferences.\\nAdditionally, restricting how money is spent before elections actually expands free speech. If it's a free-for-all, then the most money will be spent by corporations promoting the candidate who will best serve their interests. Thus, the voices of more working-class groups will be drowned out, less likely to actually influence dialogue or even be heard in the first place. And this isn't mental gymnastics - the Supreme Court's whole job is to determine how the Constitution can be regulated so that society is stable enough that we can actually enjoy our rights.\\nMaybe this isn't the best example, but look at *Engel vs. Vitale*, the case that banned mandatory school prayer. The actual New York law that repealed by the case was a prayer that school districts could *choose* to use and that students could opt out of with a parent's permission. It also didn't endorse any specific faith - though its monotheistic language alienated polytheistic faiths like Shinto.

Corporations are groups of people, people who all each have the rights of free speech afforded to people. Why does giving the group of people rights they already have make sense? Furthermore, corporations are not democratic entities in the least. When a corporation speaks, it is not the collective voice of each member of the organization expressed equally, but the voice of the very few at the very top who control the corporate finances and can choose to spend it in this way. So, in essence, weve given people who already have rights to political speech as individuals a supercharged outlet to flex their financial muscle and influence elections disproportionate to average citizens without such resources. Its nonsensical and nakedly corrupt.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

FEC"},{"text":"For the people who have really thought deeply about this issue (not the average internet commenter), they accept that the rule of the *Citizens United* dissent is less speech-permissive than the rule of the majority. But on balance, they believe that the good of limiting the distortive and corruptive effects of independent expenditures outweighs the limited evil of prohibiting a small amount of political speech by corporations.Many have argued that the libertarian approach to the speech and press clauses (embraced by the *Citizens United* majority) ignores the original purpose of the First Amendment. The speech and press clauses were enacted in large part to allow eligible voters in a democratic society to inform themselves of issues of public importance, via non-governmental informational sources, before exercising the franchise. After all, an ill-informed populace cannot effectively control their elected representativesthats the core of the First Amendment.The rule of the *Citizens United* dissent (i.e., upholding most of the independent-expenditure limits that the majority struck down) recognizes that the corporate form allows the mass accumulation of money beyond what nearly any individual can amass. Because money can be used to fund political speech, to avoid what some people call the distortion of the marketplace of ideas in favor of those with the most cash to throw around, and what others call corruption and the appearance of corruption from the influence political speech may have over government officials, we the people may need to impose reasonable limitations on such independent expenditures. Doing so protects the original informative purpose of the First Amendment.TLDR: Its a balancing test. Some take a more speech-maximizing approach, caring not for the consequences of speech by wealthy corporations. But others argue that the positives of allowing the type of speech at issue in *Citizens United* are outweighed by the negatives, namely distortion of public debate toward views represented by moneyed interests as well as corruption and the appearance of corruption.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Courts disposition of this case.","title":"CMV: The Supreme Court made the correct decision in Citizens United v.

When I was gloating after Trumps win, we had a conversation during dinner and she said, she just didnt get kamala harris. She kinda knew Harris would lose. She had no charisma, no personality, and no sense of humour. My mom said that it felt that kamala harris was just going through the notions during her campaign and had no convictions of her own. She said youre not getting a good read of her when youre listening to her, does she herself believes in what shes saying or is she trying to sell me something? My mom also admits that Trump has a great sense of humour, charisma, and a commanding presence. She said theres something respectable about a man who just doesnt give up even after being shot at, convicted, impeached and persecuted. He is a very determined and stubborn person. You kinda have an understanding of him. My mom thinks a lot of people picked up subconsciously on the contrast between Harris and Trump public display of personality. She said theres just something about Harris that doesnt add up while with Trump, what you see is what you get its genuine even if you dont like it. So between the two, Trump had the energy and the momentum during the campaign. Harris couldnt match it or counter it and Trump does have something of a cult-like following. And of course, if peoples subconscious are putting up mental blocks with you, the rest of your message or agenda will have very little impact. My moms words, not mine. And of course, I agreed with her. Its funny, my mom grew up in a very strict conservative disciplinarian household, and she became more liberal.

This isn't called out enough and I have no clue why. Party candidates this century have been: Gore, Kerry, Hillary, Hillary, Biden, Harris.That's...an *awful* lineup.

I want to say FDR, Nixon, and Biden are the only coastal lawyers to win in a hundred years and many have tried. 4/5 coastal lawyers, 4/5 heirs to the last administration, 5/5 stuffy bureaucrats, 4/5 over-60s, average time in Washington is something like 3 decades.This has never been the sort of candidate that reliably performs--especially for the Dem party where so much of that goes directly against our brand. Like...these are the Dems to win the presidency the last 100 years without inheriting incumbency from a dead president: FDR, JFK, Carter, Clinton, Obama, Biden. Biden's a bit of a fluke, but compare our winning candidate type to what we've been running.Imo the greatest indictment of Pelosi and her generation of leadership is that their criteria for a strong candidate are fundamentally misaligned with the electorate. And it's not like this is a recent shift from social media--people have *always* hated the sort of candidate we're putting up. It's just this group of out-of-touch bureaucrats who assume everyone operates like they do and wouldn't recognize charisma if it bit them on the rear.Double points because we're in a decades-long anti-establishment wave where everyone increasingly hates the status quo...and we're running these stuffy pro-establishment bureaucrats, a failed candidate model at the best of times, when people have been screaming for outsider reformers.","title":"Scoop: Biden notifies Congress of $8 billion arms sale to Israel"},{"text":"Just when you think this piece of shit can't go any lower...","title":"Biden to present George Soros, Hillary Clinton and 17 others the Presidential Medal of Freedom"},{"text":"Dear Israel, we are so happy youve finally gotten around to enacting your own genocide.

The Republicans have continued to move to the right and formed a coalition of voters behind christian nationalists, while Democrats have moved to the right as they abandon the left for \\"the center\\". As the article points out, the Hart Hat riots are a interesting turning point for the Democratic Party's support of labor. After Reagan the only success for Democrats until Obama was Clinton, who was conservative in his ideology and elitist. And Clinton again takes swings at workers with policies like NAFTA which tanked wages. Obama didn't accomplish much in terms of meaningful legislation, and watered down proposals to get Republican support, which never actually worked as a tactic and just compromised the legislation's effectiveness.Thus here we have two parties with one option being the now neo-nazi and christian fundamentalists on the Republicans side who if they follow through on their legislative goals will tear everything down in a rush for filling their own pockets, and on the Democratic side the neo-liberal centrist bastion of supporting the status quo and slow corporate profits, as they chip away on regulation and the quality of life for working Americans for their corporate donors. I agree with you that most voters get limited information, but that's by design. Workers aren't supposed to have a stake in the economy or democracy in the workplace.

He drew a circle on the side of the road and gruffly commanded to Kevin, \\"Stand in that circle and DON'T MOVE!\\" He then went to Kevin's car and cut up its leather seats. When he turned around, Kevin had a slight grin on his face, so the driver said, \\"Oh you think that's funny? Watch this!\\" He gets a bat out of his truck and breaks every window in Kevin's car. When he turns and looks at Kevin, he has a smile on his face. Driver is getting really mad. He gets his knife back out and slices all its tires. Now Kevin is laughing. The truck driver is really starting to lose it. He goes back to his truck and gets a can of petrol, pours it on Kevin's car and sets it on fire.

And the sheeple listened. So, the leftists act like puppets of the globalist elite. The billionaires that take part in this are the ones in the WEF: Soros, for one.

The replies I've been receiving here have helped me a bit, and another user gave me the inspiration to start trying to personally improve in those areas I feel I'm doing wrong, even with just small incremental steps like biking instead of driving, eating less meat, and avoiding factory farmed goods. It's not much, but I want to try and make things even a bit better.\\nI'm not so sure I'm a fan of the argument from nature perspective though, as honestly I think even animals killing and being killed by other animals is a tragedy, albeit one that isn't our fault and we don't really have control over... but maybe one day though... *sci-fi speculation about genetically engineered sapient animals intensifies*. I understand that for all our flaws, we humans are without a doubt the strongest example of empathy on earth, but that just means a greater responsibility. We should be better, as an omnivorous species with the *capacity* to reason, I think we should be above such things. But it is still an improvement, to at least not support the *abysmal* business of factory farms, to at least provide a decent life for the animal. I still think it's leagues beyond where we should be, and not *objectively* kinda, but you absolutely nailed it on how it's *comparatively* quite merciful next to what we're currently doing, which makes it a great stepping stone. And I think by the time we've finished moving away from factory farms, lab grown meat will likely be economically viable. Now, it's a bit sad that that's what it'll probably take to end animal slaughter (an alternative that removes almost all need for us to compromise or sacrifice), but it'll do. I hope future generations share my view, but in the past tense, that their *distant ancestors* were savages, because it means our small self awareness now finally paid off, and the cruel reality is so ingrained into people's heads that it's like how we view slavery now. We may need a convenient alternative, but generations down the line the values will likely be so locked in that our practices are unfathomable, and that they'd never be willing to eat meat if that were how it was made. If our descendants view us as savages, then we did something right in trying to push progress along.Only good people wonder if they truly are good.I definitely have a lot of moral anxiety about a lot of things, it's almost an OCD for me, so I hope I'm not as bad as I sometimes think I am.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"If I recall, Trump had makeshift pieces of his self appearing as Time Magzine's 'Person of the Year' displayed in his own house.For a pleb, that's proudly comical.

Troll Blacque outright lied.","title":"Trump Pardoning Jan. 6 Insurrectionists Would Endorse Attacks on Democracy"},{"text":"OP, I'm so sorry you view the world in such a negative light.You're right. People are more flawed than they like to admit. I know how much I've struggled with my own doubts about being a good person. I'd be lying if I said I don't anymore. But kindness is really just a matter of perspective. One action can be interpreted in so many different ways, depending on where you stand. Like veganism for example.There is a story I once heard that truly changed how I viewed the fact I ate meat. Before, I've never really considered the fact I ate meat as something bad since I wasn't the one doing the killing. In my teenage mind, the deed was already done so might as well not let it go to waste. It was winter when my uncles killed the pig in our backyard for Christmas and I felt like tearing up. I suddenly couldn't stomach eating pig anymore. The simple fact I witnessed his death was enough to finally make me realize I was just as bad as the ones holding the axe.I was reading a book at the time, one where the main character was vegan. It was never supposed to be a big deal, just a characteristic that enforced his love for all living things. He was a character I really looked up to because of his truly good nature. His friend once asked him if he ever felt bothered by the fact that most people around him ate meat. His answer kinda shocked me. He explained how as a young boy he was taught to value the life of the tiniest creature. That we could learn strength from the hard-workings of an ant just like we could from the pride of a lion. It was nature that had gifted us with so many unique and special animals so they can become our first teachers. They taught us how to swim, how to fly, how to run. But he never saw other people eating meat as disrespectful or malevolent. It was just a different way we valued their lives.It wasn't senseless killing. It was just another lesson we've learned. We watched the bird catch a fish mid-flight, so we created hooks and nets. We watched the fox snatch an egg from a hen, so we started raising them. He said nature was glad to see how we've evolved and respected the sacrifice these animals made. It wasn't cruelty. We only had to remember to pay this sacrifice forward.It stuck with me for a long time. How all of a sudden, my family weren't monsters for killing that pig, but actually made sure it had freedom and good food and even love while it still lived. They didn't endorse the horrible conditions that pigs raised up for slaughter have to go through. Life comes with the cost of death and all of us have a ticking clock following us around. Was it kind? I don't know. By the vegan teachers standards, probably not. By slaughterhouse standards, definitely. I really hope you don't beat yourself up with the question of just how kind humanity really is and if it's enough. Because despite all the evil in the world, people prove compassion and goodness come from the simplest of acts. You might not think the small things we do are significant, but usually those make the biggest difference.Only good people wonder if they truly are good.Just this post alone made me hopeful you're going to be okay, especially if you're wondering if humans are able to change this world for the better. We were never perfect, but the fact some of us keep on trying is enough to hope.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"Well, its clear she hasnt done it in a while.

Now its increasingly a main attraction, reshaping both the power grid and the automotive industry, and 2024 was easily the sectors biggest year yet. The oft-cited constraints on batteries  manufacturing bottlenecks, mineral scarcity, fire risk  simply didnt hinder battery deployments this year. Instead, excess manufacturing capacity and plunging prices for key metals pushed battery prices to record lows. States with ample battery storage put it to good use, enriching developers while lowering costs for consumers. California, still leading in total installed capacity, passed the symbolic milestone of 10 gigawatts, but Texas stole the show by becoming the fastest-growing, most dynamic market for grid storage. In both places, when extreme weather events hit, batteries were able to shore up the grid and lower energy costs for customers. But it wasnt all sunshine and roses for battery storage in 2024. Efforts by Western governments to localize the supply chain hit turbulence. Major American and European battery contenders ran out of cash, and others dialed back their ambitions. Similarly, the battery recycling sector, which promised big breakthroughs for a circular battery economy, struggled to get past the first step of dismantling and shredding old battery packs. Here are Canary Medias top five takeaways from a topsy-turvy year in energy storage. **Batteries got unprecedentedly cheap** Up until now, cost has prevented batteries from taking over the grid and the automotive sector. But this year, the battery industry managed to push prices to unprecedented lows. **Texas grid storage market takes off** The Lone Star State came out of nowhere a couple of years back to become the liveliest state for grid battery construction, and firmly cemented that reputation in 2024. In the waning days of this year, Texas was on track to have installed 4 gigawatts of grid-scale storage in 2024, outpacing Californias new battery construction by 12 percent, according to the latest count by Wood Mackenzie. **California surpassed 10 gigawatts, and batteries started pitching in at night,* Texas covered more ground this year, but California still installed a whole lot of battery capacity, and it became the first state to pass 10 gigawatts, back in April. Battery power now adds up to about one-fifth of peak demand on the grid managed by CAISO (which covers most of the state, with some exceptions like Los Angeles and Sacramento). During a heat wave in the summer of 2020, California ran short on power and had to initiate rolling blackouts to avoid greater damage. Now, when record heat hits and millions of Californians crank their air-conditioning, the state can call upon a new army of batteries to shift its ample solar production into the hours when the sun goes down and supplies run low. **Western battery manufacturing setbacks** The Biden administration and European governments have thrown a bunch of policy tools at the challenge of building up domestic battery supply chains, in the hopes of onshoring jobs and reducing dependence on China for the key building blocks of the clean energy transition. This effort suffered some setbacks this year. **LDES steps a little closer to its deployment era** So far, lithium-ion batteries have completely dominated the energy storage market. But the scientists and entrepreneurs of the nascent long-duration energy storage (LDES) sector are seeking out new technologies that can succeed where lithium-ion hasnt: cost-effectively delivering power over many hours if not days. Convincing customers to try novel, even exotic technologies is tough going, and LDES has operated in a perennial state of becoming. The LDES sector didnt break out of that dynamic this year. But customer conversations around LDES projects are moving toward broader deployment, says the Long Duration Energy Storage Council trade group.

When their donors started freaking out, they switched to the wildly unpopular incumbents VP without a shred of progressive policy vision. They had her say absurd things like \\"I can't think of anything I'd do differently\\" and trotted her around with people like the Cheney's. They do shit like this because ultimately, they would rather see Trump in power than to provide us with a truly progressive alternative. Trump maintains a system that exists to generate capital, which has always been their main priority.While they are not as bad as republicans, democrats consistently sell out the american people to private interest. They do not offer meaningful solutions to the crises of our times. So life gets worse and worse for working class people, we are involved in endless wars all over the world, and the mega rich continue to burn our world to the ground. This creates a playing field that is primed for right wing populism to take advantage of the dissolutionment with the system. At some point we have to ask ourselves what electing democrats does for us if all it does is create a see-saw from D to R with unpopular incumbents. Is the argument that the watered down legislation democrats manage to pass makes incremental progress even true? How can it be when people like Trump set us back every 4-8 years?I know one thing: I'm not going to be guilted out of voting my conscience/values anymore.

You can see the average amount of harm someone causes to the environment over the course of a lifetime, and you can see that the \\"anthroposphere\\" outweighs the biosphere and is mostly waste for a single species that makes up less than a percent of the biosphere's mass, and you can see how many people deny the very existence of climate change, how wealth is so unevenly distributed, and how *hundreds of millions* of animals are killed for meat *every day* with a population of almost a hundred billion at any given time. Even if we go *full* human chauvanist and assume animals are only worth 1% of a human life, this is still a tragedy so great it cancels out all human happiness, and we're gonna have to work *really* hard to turn that around into us being a net positive (though I'm optimistic that it's doable, I'm misanthropic yet *viscously* optimistic, after all I kinda have to be considering how broken the human condition is, we're not great but we can be). Now, we obviously don't really have some brain scanner device that can measure all the varying forms of pain and pleasure, but regardless the sheer numbers are damning, it's just inexcusable no matter how generous we are with ourselves and how little we value other life, this is just so utterly disgusting. And the wealth inequalities are also apparent, and not just from the ultra rich but the middle to upper-middle class. For example, if everyone lived the way the modern American does the earth would only be able to support a fraction of our current population given current technologies. And the thing about everyone being able to fix countless problems if we all just lived with the bare minimum for middle class life, that's true as well and there's a whole movement about that one called Effective Altruism. You could be out helping to make the world a better place, and so could I, but here we are in the comfort of our own homes filled with luxuries we don't need. Maybe it's an unrealistic expectation to expect any different, but if so that's just depressing. I'm not necessarily sad or worried about the normal standards for being a good person, I think I'm at least okay by those standards, but I think those standards are inherently greatly flawed and as it stands the difference between our behavior right now and an ideal state is *at least* as great (or greater) as the difference between us and the people we call monsters. The very fact that this sounds nitpicky and rude is just further evidence. People don't like to I feel like the only way the world isn't this bad is if we bury our heads in our own egos. I want to feel better, but that's kind of hard when I realize that even the sweetest people I know are still complicit in all these things, to the point where their mask of kindness barely makes a difference, and maybe the crack in my mask means I'm not even at that bare minimum, but it does mean I can see a mask for what it is, and realize just how fucked up we all are, before promptly having a steak and cranking up the air conditioning as I order some expensive new thing I want??. Maybe I will feel better if I look into the kind smile plastered on someone else's mask, but that doesn't really change anything. I can either at least pay back some degree of the damage I've done in feeling this way, or I can pretend everything is fine and that I'm not part of the problem. I'm not worried that people can't have meaningful and wholesome relationships with each other, or that most people don't do right by their neighbors and fellow people (because for the most part we *do* live to those standards), I'm just upset because it seems like none of that matters, like a serial killer giving to the homeless.","title":"CMV: We're all way, way worse than we realize... and when we do we simply don't care..."},{"text":"I'm not sure that's the best analytical perspective for 21st century Israel. I'd characterize the modern state as a late-surviving expression of Central European ethnic nationalist ideology.

But whereas hard-line nationalist states were shut down in Europe after World War II (and again during/after the Yugoslav Wars), and the west generally started moving toward post-nationalism in the later 20th century, an exception was made for Israel as a result of historical circumstances.

There's nothing there that could lead to anything constructive, so all they can do is destroy.

I think you should find things you can do to be a better person, and then do those things. If climate change is a significant issue, once you can finacially support yourself (so, graduating and getting a job), donate a bit of your income every month to charities which combat climate change.

On one such occasion, in the spring of 2021, a national security official explained to another aide why a meeting needed to be rescheduled. He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so were going to address this tomorrow, the former aide recalled the official saying.Yes, Musk and Zuckerberg were proponents of the Tiktok ban. Facebook has been attempting to [stitch Tiktok up for years with lobbying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory/) rather than wider regulations across all social media platforms. The Biden administration specifically went after it claiming election interference despite the [FBI saying they had no evidence of such](https://theintercept.com/2024/03/16/tiktok-china-security-threat/). The reality is that videos of a compromised Biden were widely circulated on the platform and his administration was constantly attacking them for \\"being out of context\\" while they were coverning up his cognitive decline.The bill, which must still pass the Senate, would force TikToks China-based parent company ByteDance to sell the app within 165 days, or face a ban in the U.S. Several Democratic lawmakers, one Biden campaign official, and one intelligence expert tell *Rolling Stone* the election meddling and misinformation arguments presented to justify the legislation were not strong enough.?Speaking with *Rolling Stone* after voting no on the bill Wednesday, Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) says, The threats that we were told about were things that could be done on any platform  it was not actually about the ownership model of the platform. I think the existing national security threats regarding TikTok will not be solved by and do not warrant this very broad cudgel of a bill.Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) also voted no on the bill. He says that concerns about the app potentially being used to influence elections are not unique to TikTok, explaining: We saw similar issues with other social media in the last presidential campaign. This is something we need to address for all social media. I think targeting TikTok specifically with this ban is not good policy.More than a third of the population of the US uses Tiktok, with an *average* use time of almost an hour a day. You don't think that attempting to ban that might have been another factor that swung some  voters?  \\nIt's particularly foolish when Dems can't carry a message in a bucket and constantly complain about legacy media being against them, Tiktok and Facebook dominated by right wing content *why would you cut off your nose by banning the one platform that is extremely popular with younger voters and still leans left.*","title":"Donald Trump Cant Torch All of Joe Bidens Legacy"},{"text":"Stay tuned after this poast for a sneak peek at the next discussion thread","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"If you think Jerry Jeff Walker would have supported Dick Cheney's daughter, think again.","title":"Start polling Liz Cheney as a potential Dem presidential nominee for 2028.

Israel has been in the state of war since day 1 of its establishment.\\nThey displaced thousands of Palestinians upon establishment. That land was viewed as stolen, and a war was declared. Do you want Israel to bend over and spread its cheeks?\\nNo, they can defend themselves. They have every right to utilize it's Iron Dome and keep their civilians safe. Do you really think that the UN/US would allow Israel to be dictators?\\nThe UN has been fairly critical of Israel's treatment of Gaza, but they won't do anything about it.\\nU.S, yes.? The US is fucking evil when it comes to foreign policy. Of course they want their darling Proxy Allies. None of you even knew about hunt on jewish people until Hamas attacked a COCERT and killed over a 1,000 of civilians.\\nAgain, Hamas is a product of Israel's annex of the West Bank.

The plan allocated 56% of the territory for the Jewish state and 43% for the Arab state, though Jewish people made up about one-third of the population at the time and owned roughly 7% of the land. Israel has never imitated conflict. It has only been responding to attacks\\nTaking land is an act of war lol. That is what EVERY WAR EVER has been about. They took land from the Palestinians, they annexed the West Bank, they got war declared on them. and and the best part you probably didn't even know, about 1/3 of Palestinians are israeli citizens.\\nI am talking about Gaza... Yeah there are some Israeli-Palestinian citizens, (and they probably face systematic racism). But that is not who I am talking about. I am talking about the annexed Palestinians in the West Bank.

And like... I got to watch as they took all my previous credits and tried to sort them into a completely new course organization scheme, and like; they clearly had zero clue what to do with all the German credits, because they didn't even try to assign those to specific classes, they were just like \\"Based on your previous transcript, we calculate that you have like... A stupid amount of German credits.\\"\\"Cool. Can I like... Get those counted as specific classes?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"... Um... Great. Well I still have enough language credit to graduate, right?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"... So let me get this straight, you will attest that I've successfully completed like a hundred credit hours of German instruction, but you will *not* attest that I've completed the equivalent of your first two basic German classes, which would be 8 total credit hours?\\"\\"That is correct.\\"\\"... Ok, so if I want to take German, I can just take *one* sufficiently advanced course, pass it, and that'll count, right?\\"\\"No. And since your German credits no longer count towards specific classes, you'd actually have to start at German 1 again.\\"\\"...

About half of the population pre-WW2 were jews.   \\nSecondly, Truman alongside of United Nations approved the state of Israel and have decided on the territorial resolution.

Which would mean that needing legislation to enforce Section 3 would essentially be a ridiculous loophole that a simple majority Congress could simply choose not to enforce a provision that would otherwise require a two-thirds vote to remove. So in effect the simple majority can remove the disability by simply not enforcing Section 3?That makes no fucking sense.But wait... there's more. \\"Congress shall have the power\\" suggests that they *can* enforce **the provisions** by way of legislation but legislation by its very nature cannot override the Constitution so logic would suggest that Congress can enforce the 14th only within the bounds of what is already explicitly states as that is and always has been how the Constitution works. There is to my knowledge no example within the Constitution where it says something to the effect of \\"Here's the law but Congress can completely ignore or override it if they want to\\" no bitch that's literally the opposite of why the Constitution exists. If the rights and law laid out within it can be undone by a simple majority of Congress then what the hell is the point of it even being in there?Basically if you want to override the Constitution there is a process for doing that and the threshold is a lot fucking higher than a simple majority vote in Congress. Yet that's what SCOTUS is saying. That nope even though 14AS3 explicitly states that an insurrectionist is disqualified but that the disability may be removed with a two-thirds vote in Congress they can completely side-step that by just not enforcing it. Like what the literal fuck. Also, it isn't even the Congress that is supposed to execute and enforce laws, it's the executive. So putting it on Congress to legislate a provision within the Constitution when it already states the enforcement is just ridiculous.I get why they came to the conclusion they did but it doesn't actually make sense and I can guarantee if the shoe was on the other foot they'd have ruled in the complete opposite way.","title":"14th Now: Thousands expected to convene in nations capital to demand Congress bar Trump from office"},{"text":"The pendulum swings every election.

It happens. This doesn't mean it has any meaningful significance.My ex was schizophrenic, had delusions, thought people in public were reading his mind.

It's not fun.Maybe try a different antipsychotic until you land on one that does work? Not all of them are going to be effective for every case. Some people with schizo/psychosis have too much dopamine in their brains. Too much dopamine can lead to hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia (which then exacerbates the hallucinations), etc..

They absolutely are and should stay in the country using H1 visas. Hell, Id say they should be given a green card. A lot of it just boils down to der terking er jerbs, which is pretty apparent to any outsider. And also if you actually look at the official data from the DHS and not some biased article from an anti immigrant think tank, its clear that these immigrants earn far more. Also, if you wanna question the economic positive of these immigrants, then Id say you should look up the number of F500 companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants.

Black Americans may only represent 10% of the US population, but had a massive influence on American culture. Pretty much all forms of American music derived from black culture. They've also been a part of American society since the founding of the nation, and had a much more storied history in America than any other minority group (outside perhaps the native Americans), so they're obviously going to have more stories and representation in American media.There's also massive bias in films like \\"crazy rich asians\\" which dont show any of the south asian origin citizens of places like singapore, instead focusing only on east asians. And before you say \\"there arent a lot of them there\\" they make up around 10% of the population and plenty hold high posts in the government (including the current president of singapore).So? The writer is of east asian decent. Most writers write of their own experience. He probably socialized more with east asians and understands that aspect of Singapore a lot more than the south asian side. Why should he shoe-horn us into his movie to make it aligned with the exact demographic breakdown? And if we're talking about ethnic representation, why do I never see dark-skinned people in Indian cinema or TV? Or the Indians with east asian features?Theres terrible slums in the phillipines (an entire underclass of people that are forced to live among graveyards for example) yet i dont see that being the main portrayals of the country.Here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV7R0c4TIMI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV7R0c4TIMI)Furthermore, while there are a lot of reasons which people will pick on India over say Iraq or Brazil is because many poorer countries are also either pure authoritarian and don't allow any access without military/police escort to ensure you don't show anything the dictator doesn't want, or their favelas are run by deadly gangs. The price of democracy and free expression is that you are much more open to criticism. Would you rather live in a dictatorship?The real root cause of all this bs today is the fact that brown people constantly question and put each other down for the smallest things, without even trying to see the point that the other person is making (and you're guilty of that yourself).Here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t511c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t511c/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t3x87/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/1hqcri4/comment/m4t3x87/)That's me defending Indians against racist comments. I always have and I always will. But I won't have some BS blind solidarity with all 1.7 billion of them, because why would I? Racial solidarity is frankly stupid in my books. I'm about standing up against any discrimination. I'm also about being honest about problems. Indians will often brag about how India is a superpower and how high earning Indians are. Well guess what? Gaining wealth and status comes with far greater scrutiny and criticism, And also a lot of animosity too (ask the jews).

Its attitude about degrees.You can certainly use it for more than merely assessing if someone has the base level of intelligence and discipline to not flunk out of a degree program.And while having lots of projects outside of work and school does demonstrate one particular kind of ambition, if you make it your main hiring criteria, you are sending the message that you do not value work/life balance. You literally want people to love work so much that theyre working outside of work.And that only is justifiable if youre doing a high-growth startup where you reward your employees with a lot of equity in return for not having a life.I do think its arrogance for other employers to act like they need to hire a Bill Gates for every job role. And even if you really do need a Bill Gates, you need to realize Bill Gates is measured by what he actually accomplished, not by how many projects he worked on in his spare time.While most people with extremely impressive accomplishments demonstrated inner motivation that went far beyond school and their job, the converse is NOT automatically true. In ordinary jobs, plenty of people are smart and efficient at their job while on the clock, but prefer to do things completely unrelated when they go home. Outside of tech, thats the norm for most white collar careers. But I dont think theres evidence that for ordinary tech jobs, hiring someone who only obsesses over their work and has 0.001% chance of becoming the next Bill Gates or Linus Torvalds, automatically means youre getting someone better than a talented candidate who insists on work/life balance.

Not to say there isn't, as, abstractly, it seems too hard to make such claim, however, under a market system, where, usually, your income is based on the subjective value you create (actually or potentially) to the one who pays you, there will always be a disparity in outcomes. Even if women were to be paid as if they were working while pregnant (something many countries do), they would still lose experience, making they're labor subjectively and relatively less valuable. It's a factor to consider not rooted in society and objectively unquantifiable.Therefore,  even if we were to assume nature doesn't contribute to the social dynamics in play, that society is sexist and disregarded the need for a causal nexus betewen the difference of outcomes and sexism, we would still be unable to say the difference in outcomes between the sexes means there is widespread sexism.So, I find it hard - even broadening the definition of sexism to cover any action directly or indirectly caused by the socially perceived difference between the sexes and that, even if unintentionally, creates a difference of outcomes - to agree that a difference of outcomes, on itself, proves sexism.To prove sexism, I think you would need to point to something more.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"In Suriname a sitting president was convicted for crimes.

It's why I'm a Classical Liberal/Centrist, because social media, and a deep understanding of American jurisprudence, has helped form my political positions. I'd rather be somewhere in the middle with an open mind to go one way or the other, than a hard liner that dogmatically believes it's us or them.","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"Are you saying Democrats were?

While these are not typical voting representatives they do exist to represent those territories in Congress. The RC serves a four year term (double that of Representatives) - while participating in debates and voting in committees - but cannot vote on the house floor.  The NVDs serve two years, participate in debates and vote in committees, but also cannot vote on the house floor. While I agree that this level of representation is not on parity with full representation of the States it is more than a complete lack of representation.Some in territories see benefits in remaining a territory.  These include lower federal taxes (no federal income tax), greater legal autonomy (less Federal oversight compared to its oversight of states - less mandates such as minimum wage enforcement, less pressure to standardize things where the other states have standardized). Why should increased representation be given while these benefits of being a territory instead of a state remain?EDIT to add this:  Why should American Samoa have such representation when at birth they are classified as US Nationals not US Citizens. As such they can live or work in the US without a visa but cannot vote in federal elections unless they naturalize. As a US Citizen, a person cannot just go buy a house in America Samoa either - land ownership requires 50% or more Samoan ancestor.  US Citizens going there to visit, live, or work, need permits.

Furthermore it provides a broad foundation to tackle problems you havent seen before.Note that I said good college because not all degrees are equivalent. There are admittedly some where grade inflation and softening of curriculum has made the degree worth a lot less. But those that still have a good reputation are ones where students still struggle, and where having a high GPA means something.In comparison, my experience with people who are self-trained without college is that they settle into a niche they are most comfortable with. They may be very good within that niche, but they dont like to go outside their comfort zone, or even know where to start if they were to do so.A good degree, on the other hand, will force people outside of their comfort zone, and make them stronger for it. I have yet to see a self-trained person who couldnt benefit from college education to shore up their weaknesses. That doesnt mean they will benefit from every class in college, or even benefit from every college.And ultimately, for certain jobs you may only care if they have the niche skills for the role. But if you value having a broader set of skills, looking at college degrees and GPAs is a good way to assess that.","title":"Sen.
