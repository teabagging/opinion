Yes, religion is greater on the red side, but that doesnt mean all religious people are red or that all reds are religious. Personal interpretation of religion is a major aspect of the modernization of theism; people are practicing their faith how they feel best connects them with their theology, and that does include Christians engaging in pre-marital sex.Intermingling exists. Reds date blues and vice versa. Assuming that only liberal leaning women will participate and that it will only hurt liberal leaning men completely ignores any individual differences in political opinion. For instance, mens reproductive rights isnt really something either side advocates for, so how exactly will the politics affect the relationship in that regard? What if I support certain aspects of the opposing party and can provide reasonable arguments for that? It might be difficult for sensitive topics, but I doubt my dates are going to be complaining that I think we should be revising the board of education, even though thats associated with republican dogma. The nuance of individuals interacting is not something you can make a sweeping generalization about because politics have a different perspective for each individual. Very rarely could you find two people who have the same stance on every political issue.Your 3rd stance is just talking about eugenics, which is not something you can argue against conservatives with when a significant number of liberals are upset at the sex of their baby, or how other parents label themselves as boy moms because they take the dominant role in teaching traditionally male attributes to their sons. Thats not something the right is upset with, thats something the left is upset with. Ultimately, a nothing burger because both sides commit this problem.The final stance is assuming political ideology trumps all other identities. Already talked about this in the first point, but at the same time, this still hurts all men. Random hookups  (which all men do, not just liberal men) wont involve deep conversations about politics. Youll be flirty, meet up, have your fun, then be done with your day. You can do that with anyone. Less women means less options. Less options means everyone feels the squeeze.Your support behind it is weak, but the 4B movement is ineffective. Significantly better supports would be that men in general are more adverse to dating, marriage, and children. As more of them realize the areas in which women have power over them, theyre going to be pushed away from those areas. Family courts are dominated by womens power. Reproductive rights are squarely with women. Parenting is still seen as a womans job, as any father would know after taking out their kids by themselves enough times. The 4B movement assumes that men want everything theyre denying, or that they were even providing these things to begin with. Men were having less sex, less children, and less marriages. Dating was a wash as most dating is performed online and everyone knows how bad online dating for men is. Dating norms still place the effort solely on the man, without any of the benefits of traditional dating culture. Theres nothing that was being given to begin with, so theres nothing to take away. All the 4B movement does is make more men opposed to supporting women because women sure as hell dont want to support men or stop infantilizing them.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

NO ONE CARES! They're staring at $7 eggs! Agree with them! Get mad WITH them! Point at the greedy corporations jacking up prices while making record profits. That's what people actually see and feel.Second (and yeah, I know I'm gonna catch hell for this) - we've GOT to cool it with the identity politics stuff. Look, I want equal rights for everyone too. But you can't force people to change overnight. We FINALLY got most folks comfortable with gay marriage, and before they could even catch their breath, we're hitting them with all these new gender terms and bathroom debates.

It just makes them dig in harder.Remember that spotted owl mess 40 years ago? I may be giving away my age on this. Perfect example. Yeah, maybe it was important, but you know what? When people are worried about feeding their families, or feeling oppressed they don't give a damn about an owl. And all these buzzwords and slogans - just stop! Of course black lives matter, but turning it into a slogan that gets repeated over and over just makes people tune out.Here's the thing - most Americans haven't spent years in college learning to pick apart complex issues. They're working their butts off just to get by. When we throw fancy explanations at them, they check out. And please, PLEASE stop with this \\"can't we all just get along\\" garbage.

Which is factually correct. This does not equate to saying the average person are doing fine. And so far away from saying nothing is wrong.So then who is this talk about the economy doing better for? If the average person is not doing fine, why should they care?Where did Harris say nothing is wrong? Can you cite it?Clearly I was being facetious and hyperbolizing what she said. However, her policies were never going to be meaningful toward the working class.The Harris platform was almost entirely about helping the middle class. This means they are saying average person is not doing good. It means they were not deaf to the concerns of average Americans.I would say her platform catered exclusively to the upper-middle class. Americans in the lower-middle and lower classes dont have a down payment or credit to even be able to afford or qualify for a home in the first place. A tax credit, which is effectively a reimbursement and not some check they give you at the time of purchase, does not address the housing crisis the working class is facing. Also, this does nothing for you if youre already a homeowner, nor does this address struggles homeowners face.I do not expect someone in the lower classes to benefit from a child tax credit. A $6k reimbursement does not cover you for childbirth if you have no insurance, which averages at around $50k for your trouble, and if you do have coverage, then birthing might be $3k down the hole for you, but then youre left with an extra $3k out of that reimbursement that isnt going to afford you food, diapers, medicine, or the lost wages incurred for any meaningful amount of time (which is irrelevant if youre going to be struggling for an entire year anyway before you see that money during tax season). The working class would benefit more from free daycare, more social safety nets for lower income families to feed their kids, M4A, guaranteed paid maternity and paternity leave, etc. I did not see her mention any of this during her run.The working class doesnt give a shit about a small business tax credit either. If I have no plans on opening a business any time soon, why should I care that some schmuck is going to open a 5 man shop somewhere where Im probably never going to benefit from this? Where are my stronger labor protections instead? For as little as Kamala pulled away from Biden, for some reason, she felt the need to pull away from one of the only redeeming factor of his presidency, which is that he actually gave half a crap about unions and showed up to a picket line.And this is just about the Opportunity Economy^TM . I can keep going with more examples about all the different faults of her campaign in this regard. I will admit however, doing price manipulation for groceries and at home Medicare coverage were amazing things that the working class COULD benefit from. They might be half a step in the right direction, but theyre good nonetheless. Too bad she barely talked about any of this on the trail.Redditors demonstrating the inability to comprehend the distinction between economy and individual is reflective of how the electorate voted. Redditors are evidently no better informed.So if the working class is struggling and they dont give a shit about the inner workings of an economy they dont understand in the first place, then it is not my problem, nor is it anyone elses, that the person that we put in charge (sort of) that were paying tax dollars and donations toward does not comprehend this and adjust their pitch to better reflect the mentality of the voter base.You dont play the fucking game you want to be playing. You play the game already being played. Earn the working classs votes.But nah, Im just a dum dum Redditor who hasnt thought about this for longer than 5 minutes before going Kamala bad ??But by all means, I guess feel free to keep supporting this farce of a political party while they learn absolutely nothing and continue to lose voters to the fucking couch until the end of time.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

It's silly to argue otherwise. OP is simply arguing it's ineffective because those most affected by liberal women enacting a moratorium on sex would be liberal men.

Americans dont want to do the jobs the migrants take. Spoiler alert, if business owners were arrested for hiring migrants, there wouldnt be a migrant crisis. But you dont want $10 eggs and $20 hamburgers and no one else does either. Illegal immigrants make up a huge part of our economy.\\nThen there is the logistics issue. Saying youre going to deport all illegals is as dumb as saying youre going to take away everyones gun. Good luck. These are humans who have already traveled across 1000s of miles and entered into a country without getting caught and have assimilated into society. Despite what the media tells you, most migrants are incredibly resourceful and not in fact murderers and rapists. But regardless, law enforcement agencies work independently and are already incredibly understaffed and underfunded. How on earth are they going to undertake a mass deportation effort bigger than anything the world has ever seen before? Whos paying for this?

Biden/Harris were afraid to acknowledge inflation as anything but transitory or not as bad as it couldve been, thinking that just mentioning at all would mean that theyre accepting blame. Same with illegal immigration. Same with many other things. Voters SEE things. So when issues are not acknowledged at all, it can feel like, well, fuck, if they dont even see it as a problem, will they fix it?

Im surprised but disappointed that the white collar job market and all the layoffs wasnt mentioned at all. To me, its worse in a way, perception-wise, because people see those who are educated, touted as highly-skilled, went into debt for college, climbed the corporate ladder, and got the ideal job, only to get laid off and have to spend a year before getting another job that likely pays less and isnt as good as their first one.

If America had oligarchs, it would be the likes of Musk and Thiel. It should have been one of the few talking points that they hammered into the ground. The election was lost by a thousand cuts so Im not here thinking, If only they did this ONE thing they wouldnt won. But its clear that voters want simple slogans and talking points and simple solutions. They clearly dont care as much about results - half the shit Trump promised, he didnt do the first time, and voters brought him back. So one clear repetitive line of attack could have been Trump and Vance want to help Musk and Thiel, not you. Theyd have plenty of examples to pull out. I wouldnt be surprised if most voters dont know who Thiel is. Framing Vance as a puppet for the rich is a great way to introduce him. Too many people still think Elon is the mad scientist who invented all these things - well, theres another way to paint him, and its not positive for him. I was so frustrated during the vice presidential debate when Vance sanewashed himself with no pushback. Vance sounded like damn Bernie Sanders up there half the time, talking about lowering childcare costs and all these progressive-sounding policies that arent part of the GOP platform. And what happened? Walz didnt rebut any of it and was even saying how much he agreed with Vance half the time!

The left wing of the party was boxed out of the 2016 primaries by the DNC machine when they anointed Hillary. And because the machine hid Biden's cognitive decline, the left wing was again boxed out of the conversation and left with Kamala who was Biden light.Pelosi getting upset that Bernie said the Democrats abandoned the working class was tone deaf on her part. This party has been ripped apart by neoliberalism and a Democratic elite that is out of touch with the economic despair of the working class.I agree. We are not radicals. When a billionaire cashes in his stocks for millions of dollars from the company they own that goes into his personal bank account, they are taxed at 20%. A person making $47,000 is taxed at 22%. That's absurd.My concern is that the DNC will run more moderate/neoliberals in the mid-terms thinking that is the path forward. Private equity has hollowed the country. Loneliness is at epidemic proportions. And as James Carville said, \\"Identitarians\\" have too much sway. Being skeptical of trans women competing in sports makes you a bigot. It gets you canceled.As Clinton said to Bush in 92, it's the economy stupid. It's meat and potato issues. Not avocado and toast. To many of the working class, they have felt that the Democratic elites are condescending. I agree with this.","title":"Democrats are trying to work out where it all went wrong.

The 4B movement is everything they want out of women by preventing more abortions and not having sex outside of marriage.First, this is a caricature of \\"conservative men.\\" There are plenty of Trump voters who this does not accurately describe. Heck, look at Donald himself--do you think he's \\"against hookup culture\\"?Second, even if it was nominally true, what people say they want is often not what they actually want. It is safe to assume that most men want sex more than they want \\\\[whatever political dogma\\\\]. This is as true of conservatives as of communists.Conservative men are not going to go out with more left leaning women who do not share their values, most of these men despise feminists and they have no problem with women they have no interest in not dating them.Again, you're making very sweeping, confident statements about a very large group of men. Around 40 million men voted for Trump. Not all of these men have some bright line rule about not going out with left-leaning women.That being said, I think this is a better point than your first one: the kind of women who would be tempted to 4B are probably not the kind of women who were sleeping with Trump voters in the first place.That being said, you don't mention what I consider to be the most compelling reason 4B-style sex strikes don't work: They don't happen in the first place at any significant scale.

It implies youre using sex as a bargaining chip for better women rights, so it makes no sense to insist that men shouldnt be bothered or affected by this.I do not view the 4B movement this way. I dont view it as a strike or a protest.Trying to use sex as a bargaining chip to get men to vote in the way we want is a self-defeating goal, since all it does is frame sex as a reward for men who act the right way. It doesnt actually make men view us as people, only makes them do the right dance to get sex.True, but Im getting even more confused. Is it even a strike or a movement at this point? You say men shouldnt feel threatened by a small group of women, as if you dont care about this movement gaining traction or not. Why would I care about this movement gaining traction? I dont want to force anyone to participate in it. Im not even participating in it.But if women do want to participate in it to protect themselves from the increasing maternal death rates, I absolutely understand and do not think those women owe their bodies or time to anyone else.The angle Im taking here is that this is a movement that could potentially gain a decent amount of popularity, so men should feel threatened since thats obviously not healthy for both individuals and society. If a group of women choosing to no longer have sex is unhealthy for society, then we should not have built a society where women are forced to be in romantic relationships even when they do not want to be. Im perfectly fine with a society which is built on the idea that women *must* choose to date and have sex with men being unhealthy.But it seems more like a trend at this point, like going vegan.Yes its definitely just a trend. Ive barely even heard actual women talking about it. Mostly just men angry about it.\\nI thought the point of this was to get men to take womens voices and rights more seriously, If men only take us seriously if we have sex with them, then they arent really taking us seriously at all.but it seems like you dont really care if it changes anything, its just a lifestyle choice for you.Im not a member of the 4B movement and have never claimed to be.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

But I can attempt to slightly alter your view on 2 points:1) Saying that the 4B movement is ineffective is technically incorrect. It may be ineffective in the sense that it wont achieve the desired goals of those who partake in it, but it is quite effective in the sense that it solves the abortion issue. Not only that, but it solves this issue the right way and not through draconian legal mandates. Such mandates of course would not be necessary to begin with had the women participating in this movement valued modesty in the first place. To be fair you somewhat address this in your first point.2) Regarding your 3rd point, Id argue that liberals procreating doesnt necessarily create more liberals. Children tend to rebel against their parents if they dont respect them and grow up to value the opposite of what their parents do. This is why so many conservatives who treat their children poorly raise rebellious liberals, while conservatives who raise their children well and foster a relationship of love and respect raise more conservatives. The same can be said about liberals. Especially so since a big part of modern day liberalism fosters certain characteristics that are difficult to respect or look up to. In fact, you can already see the repercussions in gen alpha. In many cases gen alpha kids appear to be more racist and homophobic than even older generations. This can partly be attributed to immaturity, but even more so to the zeitgeist. Older generations were racist and homophobic due to an aversion to the abnormal. Now that it has been normalized, gen alpha is becoming racist and homophobic as a function of their own generational rebellion to the norm.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

Participating in a sex strike alleviates most of the risk of being stripped of our maternal healthcare.I understand that, but if you say it's a \\"strike\\" then you're basically protesting something. It implies you're using sex as a bargaining chip for better women rights, so it makes no sense to insist that men shouldn't be bothered or affected by this.Sure, but you arent entitled to have a relationship or sex with anyone you please. They have to also want to have a relationship or sex with you. If you feel threatened by a small group of women choosing to participate in this movement, you may have an unhealthy relationship with sex.True, but I'm getting even more confused. Is it even a strike or a movement at this point? You say men shouldn't feel threatened by a small group of women, as if you don't care about this movement gaining traction or not. The angle I'm taking here is that this is a movement that could potentially gain a decent amount of popularity, so men should feel threatened since that's obviously not healthy for both individuals and society. But it seems more like a trend at this point, like going vegan.If men will only vote for equal rights or for womens issue because they think theyll get sex out of it, they dont actually support womens rights in the first place.I thought the point of this was to get men to take women's voices and rights more seriously, but it seems like you don't really care if it changes anything, it's just a lifestyle choice for you.

I fully support birth control and doing what need to do to not get pregnant.However, if the point is for men to show up for women, this seems utterly counterproductive as instead of becoming more progressive, it may encourage more men to become conservative, as genZ is already leaning, and to treat women worse/increase overall misogyny.Like, there's the idea that men need to earn their place. And like, self improvement is important and emotional relationships are two way streets where people should grow within them and have empathy for each other, but the right wing manosphere is loud, strong, and ready to snap these boys up and has women too. Vs our side is telling men their trash and that they're not going to have romantic or physical relationships until we change our political system...?Engaging in good physical and romantic relationships can increase overall well being -- not engaging it in case harm well being (as I can attest to). I've volunteered and run sex and kink postive spaces for quite a few years (tho taking a break), I've seen how while it can sometimes not go well, it overall increases well being and is really important. Humans thrive on connection.I'm a gay AFAB guy, women withdrawing sex does not directly effect my sexual or romantic partners, but I really would prefer there nope be /more/ right leaning, transphobic people for my own safety.IMO, while we need to not excuse misogyny and we need encourage everyone to improve as a human and improve how we treat each other and, we need to make the left more welcoming to men. There's men within left spaces of all birth sexes (this sub has some rather annoying rules...) that a feel that hate and makes it harder to engage in community -- it's not just right wing propaganda.  We do need more men to stand up -- we need better male role models to help young men navigate the world and understand systematic issues and discussions around consent/etc.. We also we need to take everyone's issues seriously and not just dismiss one demographic, and not make people feel hated and feared based off a demographic of their birth.This is a culture war, and we're losing. Alienating and pushing people to the other side does not feel like a good strategic move.But.... I'm guessing this movement will get enough traction nationally to matter either way.

Conservative men are typically very Religious, they not only preach against hookup culture but support celibacy for women and are extremely anti abortion. The 4B movement is everything they want out of women by preventing more abortions and not having sex outside of marriage.Conservative men aren't typically very religious. Many may be people of faith, but definitely don't fall into the fully devout category. You're completely right that those who do love this movement and it's everything they preach, but most just aren't in this category. Most don't have such strict \\"moral standards\\" when it comes to dating. Your average \\"conservative\\" in the dating pool is just that guy at the bar who likely has little qualms about who he goes home with. 2. Conservative men are not going to go out with more left leaning women who do not share their values, most of these men despise feminists and they have no problem with women they have no interest in not dating them.Political values are far less of a factor in dating preferences with conservatives than they are with progressives. They may dislike feminists, but these women were unlikely to he interested in pursuing a relationship with conservative men either way. They don't need a movement to reinforce this. [Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/24/most-democrats-who-are-looking-for-a-relationship-would-not-consider-dating-a-trump-voter/) 3. No Conservative man wants left leaning women to procreate. Why would they want more people in future generations to challenge their values instead of populating the future with children who subscribe to their views.This wouldn't be a huge factor either, with these men believing they'd not only be able to impart their values on their children, but perhaps their spouse as well. And with reason, it's something seen throughout society - often, many people's more progressive views fade with age, and they begin to lean more conservative. This applies even more so for those who are married. 4. This hurts liberal men. Men who are feminists or are sympathetic to these women are far more likely to date and marry the women in these movements, and thus, they are hurt by this movement, while nothing changes for conservative men.This would be true and an even bigger blow for many liberal men. Rightly or wrongly, there is a perception these men often already display less of the stereotypical traits deemed desirable. It's a common talking point over the year. There has always been debate as to why progressive women go for conservative men, and it's often due to having more traditional, stereotypical traits that women look for in a partner.Lastly, one of the biggest reasons the movement is probably  controversial, but it's true. From what I've seen so far, most of the women showing the most vocal and public support for the movement just aren't desirable to conservative men anyway. This is evident on Twitter, Youtube, and everywhere else this is being discussed. Men are simply mocking the women involved, with many of the comments relating directly to the women's physical appearance.Also, I'll try to find the source when I have more time, but it's reported that a large number of those publicly espousing the movement had already  been single, or not engaging with men  for some time already. Therefore, these individuals really just aren't part of what would be dating pool for the typical conservative man.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

All the indicators are in the right direction. Materially inflation is low now and people are better off than they were before it started.That said, people absolutely hate inflation. My personal guess is that it makes them feel uncertain. Maybe they are okay now, but they do not know that they will be okay in the future. It takes time for people to acclimate and feel confident that the new situation is stable.Does that mean it was smart to vote Trump instead of Harris? I don't think so. But I don't think it's smart to point to right now numbers to insist bad feelings are unfounded. Harris and Biden absolutely could be harping on inflation and prices and wages as though it's a lion in the room with them now they're going to fight bare handed.

While saying I was affected by someone not wanting to have sex with me is a more reasonable statement.?\\nAs far as the purpose behind it, I think the idea is more to take back ownership of your own body. Not so liberal men will be affected by it and vote differently. Liberal men are already voting liberal so that doesn't even really make any sense.?\\nIt's about that if the government is going to make abortions illegal, why should you put yourself in a position where you are going to need one and have casual sex if you aren't interested in having kids?

If a doctor can't give you the proper care you need because they are risking going to jail or having a literal death sentence on their head if they help you, it's going to put women in a position where they are afraid to get pregnant.

It IS something that causes harm. If everyone can live without being able to have sex, whats the point of a sex strike?The point is as pregnancy becomes more risky and maternal and infant death rates continue to rise due to the current political climate. Participating in a sex strike alleviates most of the risk of being stripped of our maternal healthcare.Wanting sex and seeing women as objects are not the same. Sex is an important part of relationships for most people. Sure, but you arent entitled to have a relationship or sex with anyone you please. They have to also want to have a relationship or sex with you.Its not entitlement to feel threatened by the idea of a sex strike. If you feel threatened by a small group of women choosing to participate in this movement, you may have an unhealthy relationship with sex. Just have sex with people who want to have sex with you, instead of trying to convince this group of women to have sex when they do not want to.Expecting liberal men to be okay or act like theyre not affected by it is just missing the point.

And blue-collar workers have been the biggest beneficiaries.An analysis published in July by economists at the Treasury Department found that the median worker can afford the same representative basket of goods and services as they did in 2019  plus have an additional $1,400 a year.The Consumer Price Index climbed about 21.7% between the four quarters of 2019 and the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2024. But over that same period, median weekly earnings, which include before-tax wages plus any commissions or tips, climbed 24%, for a gain of 2.3% beyond the inflation rate, the Treasury analysis found.At any rate, even as prices have climbed, the typical American household has weathered the storm: Foreclosures and bankruptcies, though theyve begun creeping upward, are beneath pre-pandemic levels.And once again, let us not forget how we got here: Trump's tax breaks for the rich that added trillions to the debt and had zero positive effect on the average worker, and his criminally negligent COVID response that started from his dismantling of our pandemic prevention unit several months before the virus hit China.","title":"How Kamala Harris Plowed Through $1 Billion and Still Lost to Donald Trump"},{"text":"If this is true, this is phenomenal news.

Use those situations as a learning experience, for yourself and the person you disagree with.  Look at the general sentiment they have, is it a friendly one to left causes?  If so, then forgive them semantics and if they arent 100% on board with every little detail.The left is perceived as expecting perfect virtue and if youre not perfectly virtuous, then youll be mocked, shamed, cancelled.

What else they would they do except seek to stay away from or combat the threat they perceive.I lean very far left and Ive even experienced this on numerous occasions, because I didnt 100% agree with or support some term or some details of policy or plan, or felt a given idea/plan/policy was too myopic or problematic in nature.We gotta build bridges, we gotta accept imperfect allies.

I think the main point is abstaining from sex so as to not risk pregnancy. I have long held the opinion that making men responsible for the consequences of their choice to have sex via child support without any further say in the matter and regardless of any previous attempts to hinder conception while women get to pick and choose freely whether they want to carry the result of the same decision is unequal and not becoming of the principles of equality and the idea of every adult, regardless of gender, being a rational individual capable of thinking about their actions and its consequences. This is exactly what I would want: Everyone thinking about the possible consequences, rationally weighing risks and benefits and then acting accordingly - coincidentally leading to women choosing to not have sex and risk pregnancy. Its like stock investments - if people dont want to face the risk of losing their investment, they should not invest. And I fully agree - its a rational and logical choice following through with the desired end goal of the participating individuals.The fact that now less women will want to have sex isnt even a problem in the first place, and if it was, its so much less of a priority than people living along the principles of their free choice.So, I dont think its failing due to the reasons you cited, I think people participate in it for entirely different reasons.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

First of all, women are more progressive than men these days, so if conservative men wish to couple with someone, there aren't enough conservative women to go around. It's also more common for conservative men to not place as much weight on their political orientation in romantic relationships as women these days. So if women made it clear that they are only interested in dating men who share their values or at the very least respect their rights, that could be effective in changing the culture, and improving safety for women.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

The German economy is currently in a deep crisis. Recently, the European Parliament voted in favor of a law that would allow refugees to be relocated evenly to all European countries because Germany couldn't handle it.

This has been their plan from the very beginning, which is clearly visible from the fact that after crossing the border, everyone heads straight to Germany, where social welfare is the highest in Europe. The current waves of immigrants are not beneficial to Europe in any way. It only burdens the budget and increases the number of crimes. If you saw what content is presented on Islamic TV channels in Europe... No one there even hides their hatred of European culture and Europeans.

I think she would do great as a president, even if she personally hesitates or disagrees. I think she'd excel in a primary. But there's no getting away from the fact that the glass ceiling exists and the electorate at large, where their votes matter most for deciding who seats at the White House, are going to be less enthused purely on sexism alone.Idealistically we'd like to imagine it won't be a big deal, but this is the insidious thing about many, many ~isms: these implicit biases are often silent, pervasive, and natural. Someone who opens doors for women but not men may be seen as chivalrous, but it can equally be borne from a perspective of inequity. Countering these biases require active, persistent, intervention. There are a lot of people who proclaim they are above these implicit biases, but in reality they aren't. Self-proclamations of position are easy; actual behavior and speech require everyday, consistent effort.On the other hand, all this attention on the presidential seat misses out on all of the good people from all walks of life do across all arms of government, federal and state. If the Democrats had a Congressional majority for example, the looming despair of a Trump presidency may be weakened. Even having the House would be a remarkable aid (something that seems highly unlikely to happen given how the votes are tallying up). Our ideal caricature of a presidential candidate may have qualities that would disadvantage them electorally on the national stage, but this same caricature would be great for Congress, for state governorship, for city councils, for education boards.

In fact the most infuriating thing about the most recent SCOTUS decision is that it did nothing _except_ allow him to break the law. He is considerably more able to go out and shoot someone in the street, if he justifies it right, but has zero additional policy-making authority.Notably, while it protects him from prosecution, ever, for official acts, it does not make those acts lawful and doesn't change the fact that other members of the executive branch can and should refuse unlawful orders. Yes, the R-majority is razorthin but that's all they need to do whatever they wantThat \\"they' is hiding the issue here. Yes, if the entire Republican party unanimously wants to do something then they can do it, but that was also true in 2016. In fact it was more true in 2016. Right now they would have to be basically unanimous to do things because the most moderate 3-4 Republicans can block anything.Again, to repeat myself: there were 10 out of about 200 Republicans that voted to impeach Trump last time. Out of those, 2 are still in Congress. They _need_ those two guys to pass stuff now. Just like Anthony Kennedy we'll see them all inexplicabley retire or change opinionThe article you linked is very negative on your allegations, and in fact calls them a conspiracy theory. The actual situation here is that Kennedy was always a Republican even if that was easy to forget while he was the moderate Republican swing vote on the court. Of course he wanted a Republican to replace him. Mark my words, there will be numerous suspicious defenestrations, poisonings, convenient suicides and disappearances of Trumps enemies!I would no joke bet you $10,000 that this doesn't happen. Trump isn't Putin and can't be Putin for a variety of reasons, including that mysterious disappearances would be investigated by state governments who are often not friendly to Trump, that the American government unlike the Russian government relies a lot more on clear positions of true authority like governors and senators that would look mega-suspicious to eliminate, and that often eliminating people in those positions allows their party to decide how to replace them so it doesn't even do the thing you'd want it to do. Plus the fact that US government officials, again, can refuse illegal orders, so he'd have to do this himself.TL;DR the President is not a king no matter how much Trump would like to be, and the many other sources of power in the US system would not like him trying to kill them.The reason I'm very frustrated by this sort of conspiracizing and catastrophizing is that there's all sorts of bad things in the policy arena that Trump can definitely, legally, do, and talking about dictatorial shit he can't actually do distracts from our ability to do anything about that stuff. This is the sort of stuff that he actually did last time and is the actual concrete reason why he was a bad president.If he wants to impose a 100% tariff on anything from China the day he enters office, he is absolutely allowed to do that, and it would definitely crash the economy if he did. It's unlikely he jumps to there immediately but it is very likely he imposes a significantly higher tariff than is already the case. And he already raised tariffs last time.If he wants to make it the FBI's number one priority to deport undocumented immigrants, again, he is definitely legally allowed to do that.If he wants to pardon all his cronies for all the various crimes they did during his past administration, black-and-white in the Constitution he can do that. It's also possible that he could pardon himself for his own past crimes, and it's with this sort of thing that the Republican SCOTUS actually does matter.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"That's what we're asking for, someone with proper authority just checking the election results.

I believed our democratic institutions would make it difficult for fascism or socialism to take root.

Hillarys campaign accused us of being sexist and racist for disagreeing with Hillarys pro-corporate and pro-war positions, and the media labeled us Bernie Bros. We were silenced. But we had a coalition of working-class peopleBlack, Latino, and whitewho were energized. Yet pompous Democratic consultants believed the only way to win was to capture elusive suburban Republican men and women repulsed by Trumps rhetoric, assuming working class Black and Latino men would vote Democratic regardless of Hillarys platform. We believed the DNC suppressed our votes (and voice), handing the nomination to Wall Street Hillary, who then ran on an identity politics platform and unsurprisingly lost. Im still bitter about it to this day. And after Trump captured the coalition we had in our grasp in 2016, Im even more bitter. The Democrats ran another identity-politics-driven campaign, led by out of touch consultants beholden to giant corporations and Wall Street, now chasing the elusive Liz Cheney vote. Routed.

And as much as we'd hope voters at large are above making decisions on something as basal as race and ethnicity and gender, the objective reality is this is not true.And therefore, Newsom is never going to successfully shed his California background. He'll have to win in spite of it if he ultimately becomes the presidential candidate, and that already puts him at a disadvantage.It _sucks_, don't get me wrong, that we have to filter out competent people because their background and history paints a large target on their back, but this is unfortunately reality: when the electorate cannot be trusted to think past their basal human instincts, success does not involve banking on them to think past their basal human instincts. It must be appealed to, because unfortunately we've now gotten to a point where one political party has to win because the other has completely abandoned all responsibility and diligence to the ethos of the country at large.And this is why the Democrats as a political group is ever so threadbare and on the precipice of everything. There is a consistent struggle between doing what is right: meritocracy, opportunity, representation, equity, and what is needed. Sadly doing what is needed will turn some subset of voters away, who will abdicate their participation in these critical civic moments, and the Democrats will continue to chase after what is needed, taking gambles and risks along the way because at this point every decision is a calculated gamble.","title":"Trump can keep campaign promises or be popular.

And in fact we need to turn to non-electronic, non-computer methods to do that.**  At the same time, that is about possibility, about vulnerability that may exist in future elections...\\"So, the first point is exactly what I'm saying, for the long term security of all future elections - make sure that they're verifiable by the public and move to non-electronic, non-computer methods.

As someone on the left, you'd have to connect mass immigration to national identity in a way that supports their current view of national identity.It's why left wing parties are already trying to do this by reframing the country's values as a tolerant, accepting country. They actually are already employing the best strategy that would counter the pro-remigration parties.But it's unlikely to work anyway because the whole right-wing wave isn't manufactured. It's a direct consequence of mass migration and its failure to work. It won't suddenly continue to work so as it accelerates and more tensions build up, more people come to this view as a natural consequence of the migration in the first place.You solve the \\"far right\\" problem by solving the migration problem. It's only a reaction to the current situation. It's why I don't think the left can ever win on this issue as migration continues to accelerate.","title":"CMV: Left-wing parties should challenge right-wing parties on mass deportation (because right-wing parties can't actually do it)"},{"text":"if they're voters they are here legally. maybe lumping all latinos together in some monolithic \\"must like immigration amnesty\\" bucket is part of why the DNC lost them.","title":"Progressives arent the problem in the Democratic coalition"},{"text":"Both sides are Zionist, but the party in charge during the genocide has been the Democrats.

Democracy is dead."},{"text":"There are two basic attacks on your position here, depending on how the position itself is being applied in the moment.First of all, yes, the validity of an opinion is based on its content.  However, *no human knows for sure which content is valid*, and that's why we disagree about it!  If we had supernatural access to external 'validity' and could make perfect judgements about which content is valid, we wouldn't be arguing in the first place!Given dozens or hundreds of conflicting opinions on a topic, we use a number of hueristics to try to figure out which opinions are most valid.   The scientific method is one such hueristic, a very good one, but we often don't have the data needed to apply it, or the opinion weighs on non-empirical factors which the scientific method cannot directly confirm.  Expertise and time spent studying the problem is another hueristic.  Closeness to the issue and personal experience with it is another hueristic.  Having 'skin in the game' and having the outcome of the discussion actually affect you in direct consequential ways is another hueristic.And identity-based credibility trades on on those last 3 hueristics.  If someone encounters an issue every day while living their life, we can expect them to know a lot about it.  We can expect them to have unique perspective on it that you can't get from books and second-hand accounts.  We can expect them to actually *care* about expressing the correct opinion, because the outcome of the discussion will impact their life directly.Of course no hueristic is perfect.  It's all probabilistic, and there will be some identity-based opinions that are far wrong and some remote-curiosity opinions that are pretty accurate.  Certainly academic experts and long-time policy experts have hueristics favoring them that may overwhelm identity.  BUT if you're just talking about two random anonymous chuckleheads arguing on social media, then yeah, the person who directly interacts with the issue every day and is deeply affected by it is *far* more likely to have a valid opinion than the person to whom it's an idle curiosity.The second point is when we are talking about policy proposals, rather than neutral description.If two people have different opinions about *what is true*, then the person closer to the question probably has an advantage. But if the person farther from the question happens to be well educated and insightful then they can be more correct.But if we are talking about opinions on *what should happen*, then we need to worry about the cases of two wolves and a sheep arguing about what to have for dinner.The people *directly affected* by a policy should have more say in what that policy should be.  On grounds of morality and liberty, perhaps, but also on practical grounds; strangers with no skin in the game may not care what happens and settle on whatever is most convenient to themselves or just sounds good, without caring what the real impact is on the people affected.I'm a pretty hardcore atheist, and I'd be totally fine passing laws saying that teaching your children your religion is a form of indoctrination and child abuse, and you shouldn't be allowed to do it until they turn 18.You absolutely *should not put me in charge* of making laws about religion!  My opinions are not just radical and poorly-informed, they're also casually edgelord opinions that I have more to make myself feel cool than because they would have good outcomes!Same idea in the general case.  The people who are affected by a policy can be best trusted to have valid opinions about it, because they are who will suffer if they don't.","title":"CMV: Validity of opinion is based on content not demographic"},{"text":"Ive always used the illustration that I think any hardcore MAGA guy would watch Trump grope his wife and still vote Trump.

The entire purpose of the show is to put a lens on his guests in a way that they can come across authentically. There are absolutely no episodes of his show without a guest. Joe Rogan's very presence on the show is sometimes entirely incidental, where he will basically let his guests talk for extended periods of time with minimal interruption. If you think the guest sucks, the episode will suck guaranteed and won't be worth watching. His approach works, as the 1% of his episodes I watch are engaging.People on his subreddit complain constantly about how he flip-flops on issues where he can have someone advocate for a certain topic and have someone else on the very next day advocating the exact opposite position and come away agreeing with both them. This is a feature of his show, not a bug. The point isn't to create a debate thunderdome where he subjects guests to \\"gotcha\\" interviews. He'll ask questions to push back on certain points, but the guest's response to that question will pretty much always be the last word. Getting Joe Rogan to give up ground during an interview is almost trivially easy. The only time he ever really dug in was in an interview with Twitter moderators - which was couched as a debate beforehand.People who are familiar with his show take Kamala not wanting to go on as a bad sign. Her not going on isn't why she lost, but it's a decision that is symptomatic of the greater issue with her campaign's media strategy. Her interviews had a polished feel of being scripted and inauthentic, and numerous stories are now out concerning her team's demand for editorial control of content. In the past, DNC campaigns have mostly relied on media networks to do the heavy lifting for them, but that's about to change.","title":"What Democrats Dont Understand About Joe Rogan"},{"text":"Is that how we say ignoring the Leahy Amendment now?","title":"ProCIsrael Dem.

Inflation started under Trump as a direct result of his objectively devastating COVID fiasco, and yet he managed to win using it as a weapon against the guy who spent his entire presidency trying to bring it down to reasonable levels. So now that it's finally below 2.4%, the lowest in years, Trump can swoop in and call it an achievement of his own.In short, take it from this guy.
