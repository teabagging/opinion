For the most part, it is wrong to think of elections as contests between good and bad candidates. With few exceptions, it is more accurate to divide most politicians into two broad categories: Enemies, and Cowards. The enemies are those politicians who are legitimately opposed to your policy goals. The cowards are those politicians who may agree with your policy goals, but will sell you out if they must in order to protect their own interests. Embrace the idea that we are simply pushing to elect the cowards, rather than the enemies. Why? Because the true work of political action is not to identify idealized superheroes to run for office. It is, instead, to?*create the conditions in the world*?that make it safe for the cowards to vote the right way.\\"I've often voted for candidates I was not in great agreement with - and I never vote for the smaller evil.","title":"Kamala Harris started 'like a rocket' in Michigan.

The letter also included a fact sheet with examples of these forms of discrimination in the workforce development system.\\n* DOJ issued a fact sheet titled Confronting Discrimination Based on Religion in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families, which discusses scenarios involving students rights to pray and wear religious attire in schools.\\n* EDs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a Fact Sheet on Harassment based on Race, Color, or National Origin on School Campuses, reminding schools of their federal civil rights obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to take prompt and effective action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. ED OCR continues to investigate and resolve claims of shared ancestry discrimination under Title VI at schools. For example, ED OCR recently entered into a resolution agreement with the Ann Arbor Public Schools in Michigan to address concerns about a hostile environment for students based on shared Muslim/Arab Palestinian ancestry.\\n* ED released Free to Learn: Leading Inclusive Learning Environments in Higher Education, a new resource guide for fostering safe and inclusive campuses.\\n* The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a letter to the over 200 federally-funded Fair Housing Initiatives Programs and Fair Housing Assistance Programs on how to identify and counter Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and related forms of bias and discrimination in housing. Also, HUD created a webpage on protections against housing discrimination on the basis of religion, shared ancestry, or ethnic characteristics, which include the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\n* The Department of Transportation (DOT) provided a number of resources related to travelers rights and opportunities to file a complaint when there may be an instance of discrimination by airlines or recipients of federal funding, including discrimination on the basis of religion or national origin. The Passengers Right to Fly Free from Discrimination is a guide designed to explain DOTs role in protecting aviation passengers from unlawful discrimination. Similarly, the Guidance for Airline Personnel on Non-discrimination in Air Travel assists airline personnel in understanding their legal obligations not to discriminate against passengers. For example, this guidance notes that it is impermissible to remove a passenger from a flight simply because he is holding a book that appears to be a Quran.\\n* DOJ sent a letter to state, county, and municipal officials reminding them of the obligation of public officials to comply with the land use provisions of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) and to inform them about documents issued by DOJ that may be of assistance to them in applying this federal civil rights law. RLUIPA is a federal law that protects people and religious institutions from discriminatory and overly burdensome land use regulations. For example, DOJ recently filed a complaint and consent decree in United States v. Hendricks County, settling allegations that Hendricks County violated RLUIPA and the Fair Housing Act by twice unlawfully denying zoning approval to an Islamic educational organization that sought to develop a religious seminary, school, and housing on land in Hendricks County.\\n* Some Americans, including many Muslims and Arabs, have documented how financial institutions use de-risking, a practice to terminate or restrict business relationships indiscriminately with broad categories of clients rather than analyzing and managing the risks of clients in a targeted manner. To help address de-risking, the U.S. Treasury Department has published its National De-Risking Strategy. The Treasury Department also has issued a proposed rule to improve the effectiveness of how banks manage potential risks associated with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism in a risk-based manner, while avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches that can lead to financial institutions declining to provide financial services to entire categories of customers.*Addressing Issues Related to Travel** The FBI published an Overview of the U.S. Governments Terrorist Watchlisting Process and Procedures.

Members of these communities, including Palestinian Americans, have been murdered or wounded in hate-fueled attacks; shot and subjected to other assaults as they simply walked down streets; bullied at schools, including by having their religious head coverings ripped off; and denied jobs, harassed, or demoted at work merely because of their faith or ethnicity.President Biden and Vice President Harris are leading efforts to bring about much-needed change and have repeatedly condemned such violence, discrimination, and bias. These efforts are part of a larger Administration initiative to counter hate in all its forms, to keep every community safe, to promote equal justice, and to afford all Americans a fair shot at success. For generations, Muslim and Arab Americans have contributed to the enrichment and prosperity of our nation through their public, military, and community service, in addition to many other invaluable contributions. And like all Americans, they are entitled to the promise and opportunities of our great nation.Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting some actions taken as part of its forthcoming National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Hatred Against Arabs in the United States, including important steps to address daily concerns regarding safety and discrimination, as well as issues related to travel. The Administration will continue to lead a whole-of-government and a whole-of society effort to counter hate.Completed executive branch actions that are part of the forthcoming Strategy include:*Improving Safety and Security** The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) have completed an unclassified assessment on violent threats facing Muslim and Arab communities in the United States. The assessment will be published this week, and is the first of what will be an annual assessment by these agencies regarding threats facing these communities.\\n* Since 2021, DOJ has awarded over $100 million in grants to law enforcement and prosecution agencies, community-based organizations, and civil rights groups to address hate crimes through outreach, investigations, prosecutions, community awareness and preparedness, reporting, hotlines, and victim services. This figure includes nearly $30 million in grants announced last month.\\n* DOJ continues to support law enforcement agencies transition to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Beginning in January 2021, NIBRS became the national standard for law enforcement crime data reporting in the United States and the transition to NIBRS represented a significant improvement in how reported crime is measured and estimated by the federal government. Since 2015, DOJs Bureau of Justice Assistance and the FBI have provided more than $150 million to law enforcement agencies and state Uniform Crime Programs to support their transitions to NIBRS.\\n* The DOJ Civil Rights Division continues to prosecute Islamophobic and other hate crimes, including hate crimes directed at students on campus. Last week, a New Jersey man pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime for breaking into the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, during the Eid-al-Fitr holiday and damaging and destroying religious artifacts because of the Islamic faith of those associated with the facility.\\n* DOJs United Against Hate initiative, led by all 94 United States Attorneys Offices (USAOs), combats unlawful acts of hate by teaching community members how to identify, report, and help prevent hate crimes and by building trust between law enforcement and communities. To date, at least 45 USAOs have engaged directly with Muslim communities.\\n* Attorney General Garland directed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and all 94 USAOs across the country to work with local law enforcement and community leaders to protect communities from hate-fueled violence in the last year and recently reaffirmed DOJs commitment to combat the disturbing rise in the volume and frequency of threats against Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian as well as Jewish communities here in the United States. DOJ created a webpage aimed at raising awareness of resources for addressing these threats, and it will continue to publicize its efforts.\\n* During the September 2024 Protecting Places of Worship Week of Action, the DHS Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships hosted workshops to encourage partnerships to take collective action against hate-based violence, including Islamophobic violence and hate crimes against Arabs. This emphasis included promotion of a guide to applying for Nonprofit Security Grant Program funding.\\n* DHS has announced that it will distribute $210 million in Nonprofit Security Grant Program funds as the second tranche of additional funding the Biden-Harris Administration secured to protect faith-based institutions and nonprofit organizations against targeted attacks. This funding opportunity will be made available in late October.\\n* DHS published two resource guides to help faith communities and others address swatting, hoax threats and doxing. The DHS Resources for Swatting and Hoax Threats provides information on how to handle swatting calls and hoax threats, while the DHS Resources for Individuals on the Threat of Doxing infographic defines what doxing is and outlines proactive steps individuals can take to prevent doxing.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Takes New Actions to Counter Islamophobia and Anti-Arab Hate"},{"text":"Not an answer.","title":"The Democrats Are the Only True Defenders of the Constitution"},{"text":"It's more than we have to share the same planet that you guys are destroying...","title":"Kamala Harris Surprises Rallygoers With Damning Video Of Donald Trump The vice president literally rolled the tape on her Republican rival, drawing gasps from the audience in Erie, Pennsylvania."},{"text":"It is a weak ass statement that would suggest a lack of composure and confidence.?And her work is about lifting up people and not throwing dirt in their ears.?","title":"Kamala Harris Just Comes Out and Says It: Donald Trump Is F--king Nuts"},{"text":"Translation: Dearborn, Michigan, please vote for Harris.","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Takes New Actions to Counter Islamophobia and Anti-Arab Hate"},{"text":"Yeah, and regarded people always vote republican.","title":"Dead people always vote Democrat."},{"text":"But it was hyper restricted.

Have you attempted to develop cognitive empathy? Im on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum. I experience empathy as such a high level (as demonstrated by several standardized assessments of empathy) that I literally experience others pain more deeply than my own. Pain synaesthesia. Shockingly accurate. Rather uncomfortable. I sometimes work with individuals who lack affective empathy to develop cognitive empathy. Sometimes. But thats conditioned on a person making the active, conscious, and conscientious choice to not inflict pain on others and self. It seems to me that you want to pretend that isnt a choice you have to justify further antisociality. As far as the utility of empathy: our species is prosocial. Were interdependent on each other for survival. Experiencing affective empathy for others discomforts and pains has use for building connections and communities. Understanding, at least to a first approximation, the pain others feel provides shared experiences and dissuades most from engaging in actions that inflict pain upon others and self. I understand the effects abuse can have on a person. ACE score of 7, victim of child sexual abuse. Yet I still seek to connect and bond with others. Now, to be clear, Im no more able to read anyone elses mind than you are. I have difficulty understanding others motivations beyond a simple framework that has shocking efficacy. Having said that, you have awareness that your behaviours are antisocial, yet you engage in them. That implies that your actions are a choice and not something you cant do. Probably more of a choice than most folks experience, since you allege you are unburdened by concern for the other save for how they affect you. Ironically, you and I likely have more in common that you would think, particularly in that we are capable of performing certain emotionally extreme roles that the overwhelming majority of individuals cannot. I worked for law enforcement, and individuals who lacked affective empathy were great at working extreme crimes because that psychic poison had no effect. Individuals overflowing with empathy also rock hard at these investigations from a position of needing to find justice for those so deeply wronged.","title":"CMV: I don't comprehend the importance of empathy or or why I can be responsible for not being empathetic when my disability prevents me from doing so."},{"text":"predictit comments are one of my fave places on the internet","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Fell asleep at the NE Dem campaign office when I was 13 waiting w/my family to hear if Jimmy Carter won.

You may have difficulty truly \\"feeling\\" it, or recognizing it when you are. It may be delayed.Additionally, other common features of autism may make it extremely difficult to recognize how NT people want to be treated and why, and may also make it difficult for them to understand why you wouldn't also think that way. Furthermore, your manerisms and conflict resolution/prevention instincts likely conflict with neurotypicals. That's also not truly lacking empathy though, it's just a barrier for the understanding necessary for particular instances. This is unfortunately often referred to as \\"the double empathy problem\\", which can be misleading.If you are truly incapable of empathy (your comments here don't imply that to me personally) that suggests to me something other than heavily alexithymic autism.If you haven't, my suggestion would be to look into those differences. Right now is a really interesting time to be autistic, as the community has really started coming together to learn about the misunderstood condition from the perspective of an autistic, where previously it was all based on how autistics affected neurotypicals. In particular for this discussion, I'd look into:* those conflict management differences\\n* preferences for emotion first vs information exchange first communication\\n* bottom up vs top down processing, \\n* literal/direct/black and white thinking","title":"CMV: I don't comprehend the importance of empathy or or why I can be responsible for not being empathetic when my disability prevents me from doing so."},{"text":"We know too much?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Give yourself a green light to move on.?*Academics*?is mental, so the proper mentality plays a big part in reaching?*academic*?goals.","title":"What are the flaws of Academic system, and how will you fix it?"},{"text":"Ike might honesty.

You can see that percentage tracked on the left sife of the graph from 0% to 100%.

So the red line goes up, then the other lines go down. And when there is anperiod with fewer R aligned polls, Harris' lead increases again - we see this as the lines representing Harris' leads in the various states go up.This indicates that aggrefates are likely biased towards Republicans as they are including polls which have faulty methodologu and whosebpurpose is to provide a rosey picture for Republicans. Republicans are flooding the zone with polls which are the main reason why the aggregate polling sites show that Harris' leads in swing states are decreasing.

My understanding of evidence is anything which makes a proposition more likely to be true. Religious experience is just that , people having encounters with God through their prayer, through their worship through their practices. No you cant put it under a microscope but it can count as evidence when determining the existence of God or what religion to follow. So I ask you again , lest I conclude you are indeed at least tacitly falling into some sort of scientist, is there any evidence or questions worth discussing that are not scientific? Scientist is self reciting, you cant prove by the scientific method that the only way to prove anything is by the scientific method.Edit to add:One of the most compelling pieces of evidence I encountered when first exploring religion was the argument from desire. That humans have bodily desires that are innate and fundamental that correspond to an actual fulfillment and that we also have an innate spiritual desire for perfect love perfect truth and perfect goodness. The existence of this desire is evidence that God exists other wise it would be a natural desire that is frustrated or a natural desire without a corresponding end. Now the atheist counter evidence would be Feuerbachs idea that we project our desires into God and imagine him because we want the perfection to exist so badly and yet we cant exemplify it. That is evidence for the contrary conclusion that God doesnt exist. I would count both as evidence and say we should put *all* evidence on the table when deciding what to believe not just limit to what we can study empirically or under a microscope as you say.","title":"CMV: The problem with Fundamentalists/Extremists isn't their behavior, it's their lack of evidence."},{"text":"Its all of the above.

Contrary to predictions that an increase in female earnings raises the opportunity cost of childbearing and that this will lower fertility, the findings show that an increase in the profits of female business-owners in Ethiopia and Togo results in them having more children. The findings also show a positive fertility response to increases in the value of household assets induced by land formalization programs in Benin and Ghana. These results are driven by women who are in most need of sons for support in old age or in the event of widowhood. The findings suggest that womens lack of long-term economic security is an important driver of fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa [source](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099518407102437684/pdf/IDU1699f7acb16ca614fe4199601d8d3c9a94a76.pdf)So we can preserve women's rights, increase fertility, and stick it to the olds at the same time?

Its a Gallup survey so its not exactly an esteemed source but its a useful data point.Not sure what the triple digits nationwide means - can you elaborate? In terms of letting them define the issue, I do agree the democrats have been too passive on it. Im not sure what the right solution would have been, though - the one massive disadvantage that democrats have relative to republicans is that we dont have a propaganda tool like Fox News being pumped directly into peoples homes every night. Im not even sure how they would have helped define this issue better other than going on Fox News every night and trying to present an alternative argument.Anyway, TLDR I think the current Democratic Party is as supportive or lgbtq rights as ever (its on the party platform), theyre just not being visible about it for political reasons.

He was pissed that Joe came out of the gate endorsing her. Somehow, Kamala managed to weasel her way in there and they realized they had to run with it. I doubt the Democrats ever run a legitimate primary again. They have no reason to. They have Blue MAGA, which in a lot of ways is even more devout and brainwashed than Red MAGA.

If Vance and Trumps cabinet then send a second letter to say hes unfit, then both houses of congress convene to vote and only by a 2/3rds majority does Trump get removed.

Luckily slavery ended, but it ended because of capitalism.  Capitalism is the greatest enemy of bondage and poverty.  \\nAmerica ? developed into the greatest county ever to exist because our founders gave us, US Citizens, a Constitution that promotes life, liberty, and private property.  All based in sound money which naturally led to a capitalist society that enabled this county to end slavery, grow in population,  and becomes a wealthy nation. Yeah, you guys can thank capitalism for this excellent county. Unfortunately in 1913 they created a central bank and it began peddling fiat money. Slowly but surely with the exception of a few we have had socialists like Harris ruin our country. Central banking is a pillar of socialism for a reason. It destroys everything.

Could it be that DA's are letting people who steal out the same day? Could it be because security guards are not allowed to touch thieves? Could it be because of the groups such as Antifa and BLM who have pilfered and destroyed numerous businesses? Could it be because the economy is horrible and petrol and diesel prices have doubled? The economy is being choked out the last few years. Just the diesel prices have cost shippers exorbitant amounts to move products across the country. Worst economy I have seen in my lifetime.

Insulting Gold Star families; the shoving of Arlington Cemetery staff; the thumbs-up beside grave-members of servicemembers who committed suicide, saying he likes war heroes who weren't captured. I mean have very long lists like this and a campaign apparatus should EASILY be able to compile this and just run it for a segment of every rally, post it on every one of their social media platforms, and incorporate into their ads.

When Trump said he wished charged child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's partner well?\\"Poll after poll is showing that people are waxing poetic about Trump's administration more so than when they lived under it. It seems the Harris campaign could do better to remind them of the laundry-list of chaos that this was and that we don't need to live through this again.I feel her closing positions need to be:- The economy is improving by every indicator, faster than any other country post-pandemic; let's continue the trend. Let's stay the course.\\n- Since last year a Republican-made and Border Patrol-endorsed security bill was blocked because of Trump. \\"He couldn't even defend the Capitol from insurrectionists.

On top of it, it's made worse when a lot of those good vibes to start with was because Harris seemed like a breath of fresh air and a change. However, since she's made it clear she can't elaborate where she'll be different from Biden, and since she's more interested in campaigning with conservatives these days because \\"muh bipartisanship\\", she's completely lost her appeal as the \\"hope and change\\" candidate, which I think will depress Democratic turnout.So, to your point - if there is one thing I have learned as a Democratic voter, it is to never be surprised at Democrats throwing away a completely winnable election.

It's up to the father to decide if he wants to provide them with an inheritance or give legal power of attorney to his kid(s) to take care of him as he ages. However, if he marries a hot young wife who is primarily interested in him for his money, then gives her that authority, that can complicate things across an entire family and give her the power over decisions related to his health.For a real-life example, take Casey Kasem (from Top 40 radio and Scooby-Doo fame): While it might be overly harsh to call his second wife a \\"gold digger\\" in the sense you're describing, she was about 20 years younger than him when they married. Casey was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia (similar to Parkinson's) and his wife prevented his children from having contact with him, put their multi-million dollar house on the market, then moved him to a secret location so his kids couldn't find him. There, he experienced severe medical neglect, which resulted in infected bedsores and a case of sepsis that was listed as his primary cause of death. Afterwards, his kids and the wife were in a years-long series of legal battles.Were the kids the good guys in this situation? Maybe not. They obviously had a stake in his estate that made them biased. However, there are plenty of cases like these where a new wife and a man's grown children end up entangled in messy legal and family drama. Even if both the man and wife consent to a sugar daddy/ gold digger relationship, the family impacts can have wide-reaching effects.","title":"CMV: Im Ok with gold digging (if mutual)"},{"text":"Or non-rich old men.

It's not always easy or straightforward to have a meaningful relationship with another person (especially if you grew up in a era/culture that didn't allow you to be vulnerable and to express your feelings to others- this might be the stereotypical older man who wants a pretty, young woman around).My personal sense is that it is better to strive for authentic relationships and encourage our partners into relationships that are more than transactional, in general. I think there are people who really struggle to understand relationships beyond a transactional nature, maybe due to a mental disabilty or trauma. This is kinda a separate situation where it's maybe not helpful/supportive to push someone into something different.But generally, I think people are searching for a sense of companionship and belonging in their partners. While transactional relationships can be a starting point, there seems to be some importance in moving beyond that for a more fulfilling relationship. If someone finds comfort in connecting with another in a superficial, transactional way, who am I to judge! But ideally, together they can move past transactional and into companionship.","title":"CMV: Im Ok with gold digging (if mutual)"},{"text":"Sickening ain't it... ??Edit:??

That these things cause harm to another person. Why offensive things like being rude or mean to other people is also considered wrong comes from the same idea of causing harm. If you say something rude or mean it makes people feel bad, causing harm to that person. For you, it might sound less wrong because you have a harder time grasping what makes people feel bad. So in this case, you can ask questions that might help you cognitively process why it might make them feel bad.For the importance of empathy, empathy develops because it makes relationships easier. If you say mean or hurtful things without consideration it makes people feel bad and causes strained relationships. Because people wont want to be around someone who makes them feel bad. If you make an effort to avoid making people feel bad, they will probably want to be around you more. The way empathy works in neurotypical people is often reciprocal. Extending empathy to someone comes from a place of wanting to understand that person and avoid causing them harm or hurt. But they wont want to try to understand someone who is hurting them in the first place. So, in your case, if you want people to be more open to trying to understand your lack of empathy and how it affects you- you have to be willing to try to understand/listen/avoid what might be hurting them.","title":"CMV: I don't comprehend the importance of empathy or or why I can be responsible for not being empathetic when my disability prevents me from doing so."},{"text":"I've watched plenty of Cruz's debates and I just can't figure out why Republicans think he's good at it.

After losing cognitive ability- can't think straight enough to make reasonable decisions, (like bringing home sensitive top secret documents and storing them by the toilet paper) and short term memory loss, the person's memory gets worse and worse.  Most recent memories go first, first in, first out, Trumps confusion over who he is actually running against is an example.  Then more memory loss- can't remember people from 10 to 15 years ago, he says he 'hardly knows' Cassidy Hutchinson who was Mark Meadows, Trump chief of staff principal aide.  He seems completely sincere, he just can't remember although he must has seen her daily and worked with her for four years.As the patients brain shrinks, and actually develops blank spaces, everything slowly goes, memory, executive functions, language, ability to swallow, ability to be continent, ability to walk, ability to communicate.  I am watching this happen with a family member, it's called the long good bye, sometimes the person seems all there, sometimes they just don't even recognize you.  And this is Trumps fate, if the psychiatrists who have pointed out Trumps issues are correct in their diagnosis, which it certainly seems to be the case.EDIT: They start sundowning meaning they won't go to bed, they get agitated and upset at night, all those ill thought out X and truth social posts.  They start hating to take showers because water feels funny (people have complained that Trump smells bad), they lose bladder and bowel control, can't figure out how to swallow food or drink liquid, their body get to the point where it just doesnt work because the patients brain is so damaged that they can't breath, have a heart that beats, or digest food.  It's awful, Trump's dad Fred Trump had Alzheimers, which does have a genetic component.  If Trump wants people to want to not worry about whether he has the gene for Alzheimers, he can have his DNA checked and release the results.  Since he won't release his medical information or his tax returns that's probably not likely to happen.  But if he doesn't like all the bad press about his cognitive decline, that's an option which would put some of people's concerns to rest.Stress and exhaustion makes it go faster.

And I think many people on teh right don't even get it.Trump did an interview with the View in 2011. If you look at him while he talks to Whoopi he mentions that he doesn't like either George Bush or Obama, then he talks as the \\"Birther\\" thing comes up, he in his mind genuinely doesn't believe he is saying something that should be taken as a racist attack on Black peoplehttps://youtu.be/KMvYxMgD0pw?si=S5Hvi-GMKEs009uD&amp;t=1286Interview: Donald Trump Interview on The View (Walters, Goldberg et al) - March 23, 2011\\nI am once again reminded of the famous quote \\"You don't hate journalists enough.

Stalin lied (or exaggerated) to convince everyone that Lenin's health was failing, and Lenin should be kept in his private quarters, away from official duties. \\n \\n30 years later, in 1951, Stalin's doctor told Stalin his health was fading and he needed to cut back on work hours. This made the already paranoid Stalin irrate, assuming someone was trying to \\"pull a Stalin\\" on him and keep him locked in his quarters. So he had the doctor arrested for being a spy. \\n \\nHe would die of a massive stroke 2 years later. \\n \\nAnd yes, to OPs comment, Stalin's stroke was kept a secret until they could figure out an official plan. \\n \\nWhile the consensus among those present was to call a doctor, the officers on guard wanted to wait on instructions from the party leadership. Eventually, they got Beria on the phone, who demanded they tell no one of Stalins illness. \\n \\nIt took them 8 hours to call a doctor \\n  \\n. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-death-stalin-180965119/","title":"Why is President Vance trending on social media?

Democrats also had an amazing ground game Then comes 2020. Many like to point to 2020 as a clear sign that Trump always over performs because of how well the democrats did in 2018 but performed relatively bad in 2020.Analysis showed several things hurt the democrats:-Defund the police and the BLM protest upset many suburban voters \\n-Pandemic and the lockdown worked in Trumps favor. So may ask, why was this not reflected as much in the polls? Well thats because more and more people were getting fed up with the lockdowns as the week went by. In my opinion, thats why it wasnt captured as much in the polls With that said, democrats did relatively well in 2022 despite high inflation and immigration being an issue So what does that lead us with 2024? There hasnt been any change really between 2022-2024 like there was in 2018-2020.Also the democrats have a way better ground game this time around even more so than Trump!It is for these reasons along with pollster over correcting their methodology from 2020 without thoroughly understanding why they were off that leads me to believe Trump will not over perform and if anything Harris will over perform","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 15, 2024 - 21 days until election day!"},{"text":"You are correct, but he was very clear about being pro gun control during the 2018 run and still flipped several generally red (but still urban) counties.","title":"Colin Allred making Ted Cruz's face all red at the Senate Debate"},{"text":"How in the hell is trump a fascist?

Tragedy evokes pathos. To my understanding both modes rely on empathy to evoke laughter, tears, satisfaction, and catharsis. So I'm curious; if you are incapable of empathy, are you still able to appreciate tragedy and comedy?If you are incapable of empathy, that's the way it is. But you might want to fake it. I point you to game theory with the prisoner's dilemma, extended version. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s\\\\_dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) The basic setup is 2 prisoners being offered the choice to cooperate or not. If  both stay silent, they each serve one year. If one narks on the other, the nark goes free and the other serves 3 years. If. they both nark, they each serve 3 years. In this situation, the best strategy is to nark.The game changes when it's played in multiple rounds. The best stratagy is to lead off by cooperating and then follow suit. It the partner/opponent narks, you nark on the next round. If they cooperate, you cooperate on the next round. When in doubt cooperate. I believe that most of us instinctively follow this strategy, and we call this instinct empathy.In your lack of this instinct, you have a disability. You might have to compensate by intentionally cooperating, something nearly everyone else does instinctively. The benefit to you is because it's the best transactional strategy.  You cooperate by default with strangers because there's a chance you will interact with them again. You never know. The transaction(s) might not be complete.","title":"CMV: I don't comprehend the importance of empathy or or why I can be responsible for not being empathetic when my disability prevents me from doing so."},{"text":"January 6thCancun Cruz is about to get SLAMMED","title":"Discussion Thread: 2024 Debate for Texas' US Senate Seat Between Rep.

It makes posts blend into the noise, failing to contribute a fresh perspective.    Generic Responses: AI-generated content often lacks the nuance and specificity that human experiences bring to political discourse. This can lead to overly simplistic or generic arguments that don't engage deeply with the topic.    Context Ignorance: AI responses may not account for the specific context of the discussion, leading to irrelevant or off-topic contributions that frustrate other users and dilute meaningful debate.    Emotional Disconnect: AI lacks genuine emotional engagement, making its output feel flat and impersonal. In political discussions, where passion and conviction are vital, this detachment can lead to a lack of resonance with other participants.    Potential for Misinformation: AI can inadvertently generate inaccurate or misleading information. If users rely on verbatim outputs without critical evaluation, it risks spreading falsehoods or misunderstandings.    Diminished Credibility: Regularly posting AI-generated content can damage a users credibility. Others may view such posts as lazy or lacking in genuine thought, leading to decreased trust in the individuals contributions.    Engagement Deficit: Posts that aren't authentically crafted often receive less engagement, as other users may see them as unworthy of response. This can stifle discussion rather than promote it.    Echo Chamber Effect: Using AI outputs may contribute to reinforcing existing biases or viewpoints rather than challenging them, as the content may fail to provoke critical thinking or diverse opinions.In summary, relying on verbatim AI outputs can hinder meaningful engagement, dilute the quality of discourse, and ultimately undermine the richness that diverse, human perspectives bring to political discussions.But on the other hand using ChatGPT to generate a haiku about gerrymandering can be helpful for several reasons:    Creative Engagement: A haiku presents a fresh, artistic take on a complex issue, encouraging users to engage with the topic in a more creative and accessible way.    Simplicity: The brevity of a haiku distills the essence of gerrymandering into a few powerful lines, making it easier for people to grasp the concept without getting bogged down in technical details.    Memorable Format: The poetic structure makes the message more memorable. A well-crafted haiku can stick in people's minds, prompting them to think more deeply about the issue.    Emotional Resonance: Poetry can evoke emotions and provoke thought in ways that straightforward political commentary may not. A haiku can humanize the consequences of gerrymandering, appealing to the audience's feelings.    Conversation Starter: A thought-provoking haiku can serve as a catalyst for discussion. It may inspire users to share their interpretations, leading to richer conversations about political ethics and representation.    Encourages Critical Thinking: The concise nature of a haiku invites readers to reflect on its meaning and implications, fostering critical thinking about the implications of gerrymandering in a compact form.In essence, a haiku about gerrymandering can transform a complex and often polarizing topic into an engaging, thought-provoking, and memorable piece, enriching the discussion in a way that verbatim AI output typically cannot.","title":"Kamala Harris Says Reparations for Black Americans Deserve Review"},{"text":"ironic since most of those Tobacco/Vape shops are owned by Indians.","title":"So just Black Men?

If you go on 538 and look at the sponsors for a lot of recent polls in battleground states, they're sponsored by Trump or Republicans at large. While this election is still tight, its not *that* tight. Realistically, Harris is holding PA, WI, and MI wins her the election.What complicates things for them, and serves as a bellwether for the state of the race, is North Carolina. Robinson (you know, the Black Nazi who fantasizes about trans porn and sleeping with his wifes sister, while posting vile things on porn websites and screaming about killing trans people and owning slaves), Trumps handpicked candidate for governor, is down 20 points in the last poll. If that spills over up ballot into the presidential race, Trump could lose NC. Georgia also just ruled that the election cant essentially be stolen. Leaked GOP internal polls show Trump and multiple safe Republicans down ballot either losing or barely hanging on. They might even lose the two-term incumbent senator from Nebraska. *Nebraska!* Plus, Dems are steamrolling every special election this year, which historically spells big wins for them.This race is close, but when you filter out the fake Republican noise, Harris wins in most scenarios. The House is almost certain to flip to the Dems, and the Senate will probably be another 50/50 split with Walz as the tie-breaker, or a 49/51 Republican hold, which wont accomplish much. Seriously, get out and vote.

(I think it's a mistake to classify all of these people as motivated by racism, homophobia, and misogyny. Like, while many undoubtedly are, the failure of the left-wing to appeal to these voters is also because left-wing candidates are often interested in things that they don't see as impacting them.

All you have to do is thread more fiber optic cable through the tubes. Thats it. Maintenance costs are low, upgrade costs are low, the plans to use it are low because of the low costs to maintain, etc etc. Its also a lot more reliable than starlink, considering satellite has trouble when any terrain obstructs it.

His age was an issue for me back in 2020.Since Biden dropped out and seeing the Dems fall in line behind Kamala, and seeing them run a competent campaign, I've been at peace. I think the Dems have done a fantastic job of navigating this whole situation thus far. I personally have donated more money in this election season than all other elections combined.So from the time that Biden dropped out until now, I feel like the Dems (and Kamala) have played their cards well enough that if we do end up losing, it wasn't because of some stupid obvious mistake that cost them the election. Are there things I would have done differently? Maybe, but not so much that it would have some obvious significant benefit.At this point we just wait to see if our fellow citizens make the right choice. If Trump wins, well... I guess this country deserves everything that comes with that.

It is less than four weeks until the presidential election on November 5, with the path to victory seemingly available to either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris in an incredibly tight race. Gallup, a polling firm that tracks party affiliation monthly, found that 49 percent of independents leaned towards the Democrats while 45 percent leaned towards the Republicans in its most recent survey, carried out between September 16 and 28. In the poll before this one, where independents were questioned between September 3 and 15, Republicans were in the lead with 50 percent while 45 percent leaned toward Democrats. The GOP's 5 percent loss and the Democrats' 4 percent gain means the latter saw a nine-point swing in their favor at the end of last month. Some 941 registered voters, across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, were questioned for this poll, which has a margin of error of +/- 4 percent. The latest data is a stark shift from June when a Gallup poll saw the number of people who describe themselves as Democrats shrink to its lowest recorded level. This was before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Harris took over as the Democratic Party's nominee, closing the gap between herself and the former president in multiple polls. With three weeks to go until the election, Harris and Trump remain essentially tied with neither candidate beating the other by more than two points in any aggregator's average in the seven battleground states that could determine who wins the race. Harris's current national lead over Trump is 2.4 points (48.5 percent to 46.1), according to polling aggregator and forecaster FiveThirtyEight. This is a 0.2-point decrease from the 2.6 lead Harris had over Trump on October 8. Pollster Nate Silver, who founded FiveThirtyEight and now publishes using a similar model on his Silver Bulletin blog, gives Harris a larger national average poll lead over Trump of 2.8 points (49.4 percent to 46.5 percent) in his most recent update. Silver's model shows that Trump's numbers have improved by 0.2 points compared to last week. The national average from RealClearPolitics has Harris leading by 1.7 points (48.9 percent to 47.2 percent). On October 8, RealClearPolitics' average poll results had Harris with a 2-point lead over Trump. The forecast model from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill currently gives Harris a 51 percent chance of winning the election overall, describing the race as exceptionally close.","title":"Independents Switch Towards Democrats in 9-Point Swing Away From GOP: Poll"},{"text":"Fuck Ted Cruz","title":"Discussion Thread: 2024 Debate for Texas' US Senate Seat Between Rep.

Here are some of the main pros and cons:Pros:\\t1.\\tAddressing Historical Injustice: Reparations are seen as a way to acknowledge and address the profound injustices and harms caused by slavery and subsequent systemic racism, including segregation, discriminatory housing policies, and mass incarceration.\\n\\t2.\\tClosing the Wealth Gap: African American households tend to have significantly less wealth than white households, largely due to historical disadvantages. Reparations could help reduce this gap and provide more equitable economic opportunities.\\n\\t3.\\tMoral Responsibility: Many argue that the U.S. government and society have a moral obligation to compensate descendants of enslaved people for the exploitation and generational trauma their ancestors endured.\\n\\t4.\\tReinvestment in Black Communities: Reparations could take the form of investments in education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure in predominantly Black communities, leading to long-term social and economic improvements.\\n\\t5.\\tHealing and Reconciliation: Supporters believe reparations could serve as a step toward healing racial divisions in the U.S. by acknowledging the lasting legacy of slavery and affirming the dignity of Black Americans.Cons:\\t1.\\tDifficulty of Implementation: Defining who qualifies for reparations and determining how much compensation is appropriate are major challenges. There is no consensus on how reparations should be structured or who should fund them.\\n\\t2.\\tOpposition to Direct Payments: Some critics argue that cash payments to individuals are not the most effective way to address systemic racism. They suggest that the focus should be on broader policy reforms that benefit all marginalized communities.\\n\\t3.\\tDivisiveness: Opponents fear that reparations could exacerbate racial tensions, as some non-Black Americans may feel unfairly excluded or responsible for actions they did not directly commit.\\n\\t4.\\tEconomic Cost: The financial cost of a reparations program could be enormous, potentially requiring hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Critics argue that this money could be better spent on other social programs that benefit all Americans.\\n\\t5.\\tQuestions of Responsibility: Some argue that todays generation should not be held accountable for the sins of the past. They claim that reparations would punish people who were not directly involved in slavery or its aftermath.Alternatives to Reparations:\\t?\\tInstitutional Reform: Some propose focusing on criminal justice reform, affirmative action, and education to address systemic racial inequality without cash payments.\\n\\t?\\tTargeted Programs: Others suggest targeted social programs to help underprivileged African American communities without framing them as reparations.In summary, the debate is complex, with both sides offering strong arguments related to justice, practicality, economics, and social cohesion.","title":"Kamala Harris Says Reparations for Black Americans Deserve Review"},{"text":"You don't want Cruz to lose his seat?","title":"How to watch the debate between U.S. Sen.

Harris used the question to pivot to her own economic agenda, touting it as one which would help build up intergenerational wealth in the community.The issue of reparations for Black Americans has gained momentum in recent years, with California in 2023 becoming the first state to put a potential dollar value on multi-generational inequality as a direct result of slavery.

The religion a person chooses has barely anything to do with reason or evidence - if that was the case, then a person's choice of religion wouldn't correlate with the religion of their family or their society. If they were acting rationally, they would make a choice independent of these factors that are obviously not related to the truth. In reality, the way 90%+ of religious people \\"choose\\" their religion is by having it pushed onto them since the beginning on their lives, varying in intensity from simply presenting a certain religion as unquestionable fact to beating it into them. Shockingly enough, most people end up adopting that religion and perpetuating the cycle into the next generations. A lot seem to never be able to reexamine their beliefs - they were ingrained so deep that \\"my god is real and good\\" became as true of a statement as \\"the sky is blue\\" to them - it underpins many people's whole lives. None of that is either rational or evidence-based.Sure, you need to make an assumption for what you call \\"logic\\" to make sense. But \\"things that we observe are real\\" is a smaller leap than \\"this very specific god and this specific system, and these historical events, and this world order is fully real\\", no? The difference is that \\"logic\\" is seemingly able to unravel the world before us - we learn new things, explore natural systems, and all of them fit into a logical order that we *study*, not prescribe - and religion had been claiming random things for millennia, with no system or justification.

For most of his term the lie was obvious.  Even earlier this year Biden responded to the incessant  conspiracies with a SoTU that gained widespread praise and even trump mouthpieces were reduced to claiming he was on a drug that temporarily cured dementia.  It was right to mock their nonsense.The debate changed all that.  For the first time the public at large saw a man that was cognitively slowed and frazzled.  That didn't make the years of lies suddenly true.  But it did make clear that Joe was losing another step.  And that's not something we could assume would stay level for four more years.  So what did Dems do with that info?  They changed course.  We took new information and acted accordingly.  I'm really not sure what else you could ask for.Now Republicans have lied about Biden and trump's cognitive abilities for years now.  They've *claimed* to hold genuine concerns, but only when the person they wanted to denigrate was the subject.

As Beinart reported, Biden and his team wanted to handle the dispute privately. Obamas camp took a different route by drawing up a list of demands to be made of Netanyahu. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton then gave the prime minister 24 hours to respond, warning him, If you will not be able to comply, it might have unprecedented consequences on the bilateral relations of the kind never seen before.\\n \\n Biden was soon in touch with a stunned Netanayhu. A former administration official who saw the transcript of their call told Beinart that Biden completely undercut the secretary of state and gave [Netanyahu] a strong indication that whatever was being planned in Washington was hotheadedness and he could defuse it when he got back. When Clinton saw the transcript, she realized shed been thrown under the bus by Biden, the official added.\\n \\n When the prime minister and his staff visited the White House soon after, one of Netanyahus top advisers told the New York Times Magazine that Biden reminded him, Just remember that I am your best fucking friend here. My guess is she'll go with the Obama and Hillary people. Another one of Hillary's people, Sara Jacobs, the youngest Jewish member of congress, came out for a weapons embargo. The Biden administration had been horrible to Kamala since day one. Bad mouthing her to the press, giving her impossible and unpopular tasks like the border, and making her invisible. Biden is a sinking ship now, the world is aware him and his people tried to gas light the world about his mental status, and the world saw him risk the nation to Trump for his own ego. Thank god Pelosi dragged him out kicking and screaming. My money is Harris going with the Obama and Hillary people, and putting the squeeze on Netanyahu, like Obama and Hillary were not afraid to do. Can I just say that we probably wouldn't be having this discussion if Hillary was on her 2nd term, she would have dealt with Netanyahu by now. Heck, Oct 7th wouldn't have happened, it was a direct result of Trump letting the other Arab nations get away with their own genocidal campaigns in exchange for them turning their backs on Palestine.","title":"Biden (Finally) Threatens to Halt Arms to Israel Over Gaza Carnage"},{"text":"Yes","title":"Culinary Workers Union Local 226 has assembled the largest canvassing team in Nevada to knock on doors for Kamala Harris for president.\\nBecause they know who stands with labor."},{"text":"K thanks, will check it out.","title":"Biden-Harris Admin Paves Way For Bureaucrats To Take Gender-Confused Kids From Non-Affirming Parents"},{"text":"It wasn't uncommon to see upvoted comments saying abortion was a losing electoral battle and that the democrats should cede it a few years ago lolAlso this sub has a weird fetish about women getting pregnant too.

Your view only makes sense if you already presume Christianity is incorrect, or at least not provably correct. It is fine to have that presumption (I share it), but it is a presumption none the less.

Trump didn't start birtherism, the Clinton 2008 primary campaign did, and they tricked a bunch of people into signing on and genuinely believing it. When Trump brought it up he did so as a pro-Clinton person who fell for her propaganda. Republicans sometimes fall for stupid shit that they think the media isn't covering; usually because the media doesn't cover shit all the time. An important reference to bring up is that in 2008, the same trick was pulled with John McCain. There was a very real uproar over his birth and citizenship, there's plenty of easy to find evidence of it and \\"fact checks\\" online. Media just didn't feel the need to make an uproar because I guess it's ok to question White people for the same questions, or because he was a Republican, or because he lost the election: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-natural/Is John McCain a natural-born citizen of the U.S.?Does John McCain not qualify as a natural-born citizen of the U.S. because he was born in Panama?David Mikkelson\\nPublished July 23, 2008Look closely, Snopes didn't even denounce it as false, they put \\"undetermined\\":Claim:   John McCain does not qualify as a natural-born citizen of the U.S. because he was born in Panama.Status:   Undetermined. This idea I see online, that Obama's birth was only questioned because he's a black guy, is more of the same retarded race baiting, borderline violence inciting stuff MSM loves. If John McCain were the same exact dude, but born Black or some other minority and a democrat, then Snopes wouldn't even dare write \\"undetermined\\" in response to claims questioning his citizenship. Anyways Trump pulled it full circle with a nice media bait stunt with [his \\"big announcement\\" about Obamas birthplace in September 2016](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/donald-trump-bait-switch-rickroll-media-birther-929679/)\\"It's hard to imagine this is anything other than a political rick-roll,\\" said CNN's Jake Tapper.September 16, 2016Reporters Voice Outrage at Donald Trumps Bait-and-Switch Press ConferenceDonald Trump began Friday morning by declaring that he had a major announcement to make about his birtherism claims regarding President Obama.

But reddit having gone \\"woke\\" has been a known thing for a while..... most of em upvote alot of similar issues, like any negative criticism about trump, or about trans stuff. Even the DEI/critical race theory stuff is only somewhat debated while alot of people just seem to agree with it and downvote anyone who speaks out against it. I myself got my old original account for reddit which I had for like 10 years banned for talking about trans stuff like how they shouldn't allow hormones or surgery to minors under 18yrs, that its wrong and dangerous and all that got flagged and banned saying it was \\"hate speech and I was promoting violence or self harm\\" or something ridiuclous like that. Had plenty of arguments and debates in my years..... but never been flagged, and never got such a knee jerk reaction to being bannned with all my past posts scrubbed and deleted so fast over something that quick as I did after critcizing some of these new trends and additions for \\"trans therapy\\", despite making it clear that as an adult we got the freedom to do whatever, just not safe for kids/teens. A reasonable stance to take, with 18yrs old being the standard for many things. But the way some people talk to you after voicing your opinion is certainly more aggressive then whatever I said..... get downvoted and flagged (prob en masse) and then even banned over something so ridiuclous by overzealous biased mods. But yea, reddit is highly  biased and many subreddits are full of people who think similar, and you will get downvotes for not following the narrative or beliefs that most of tese people have. Even the ads u see will promote Harris or democrat but criticize Trump or republicans. And I am not a fan of either, and consider myself central and mixed, not quite liberal or conservative and for the record, my fav candidate was Vivek Ramaswamy. I don't quite hate Trump, but I also don't think he is the next messiah and will somehow fix america in 4 years.... plus I hate hearing him talk, just how he talks and repeats phrases  all the time. I am pro-2nd amendment, but also pro-choice, so all this abortion stuff that became an issue over the last 10 years I don't get and don't understand why its such a big talking point for republicans, def makes them seem unreasonable in my mind. But democrats have lost any support I had for them once they started to support puberty blockers and other trans stuff for minors including allowing it in schools, plus the DEI/CRT stuff that is promoting racism and not getting rid of it like they claim it does. The economy is most important of course, or maybe save and spend money internally in the US instead of get involved with foreign wars and giving money/guns to these other countries..... but not sure if either side will fix those problems or how effectively. People think republicans are pro-war and democrats anti-war..... which might be a general assumption or what u learned in school..... but America is pro-war, we are the war machine, so even democrats will still keep getting involved in wars and foreign conflicts just like republicans.","title":"Reddit is currently social engineering the election."},{"text":"This is how it's bad for Kamala.","title":"Kamala Harris is apparently outperforming with white women (for a Democrat)"},{"text":"[I assume they mean this](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/obama-administration-claims-unchecked-authority-kill-americans-outside-combat-zones)","title":"Tim Walz Warns Against Normalizing Trump's Threat Of Using Military Against U.S. Citizens | \\"If anyone wants to pretend that this is a normal conversation that Donald Trump is having, just dispel that,\\" the Democratic vice presidential nominee said."},{"text":"Agreed.

And it is always dangerous to be fully convinced that our own biases are objective perspectives. Today, the Democrat party is a very, very big tent. It encompasses everything from centrist-right Republicans who have been growing more disillusioned with the current GOP through ultra-progressives. It includes single-issue voters. It includes social liberals who are fiscally conservative. It includes fiscal liberals who are socially conservative. It includes elderly, otherwise conservative voters, pissed off at GOP attempts to attack Social Security, Medicare, and the VA. It includes. It includes young voters who are oblivious to how slow political change happens. It includes aging activists who have stuck with the party since the '60s and are finally seeing their push for political changes being realized -- though still needing to fight for more. It includes minorities who are voting Democrat simply because the GOP is anti-minority. A great number of who, btw are otherwise very aligned with the GOP on any number of issues (including things like abortion and anti-globalist perspectives). It includes religious people who feel like the GOP is a threat to their religion. It includes atheists who want to see the freedom of religion banned. By contrast, the GOP is a very, very small tent, and it is mostly growing smaller. While some inroads have been made with younger males, even in minority communities, the GOP's demands for orthodoxy are significantly greater than the Democrat party's. The only reason the Democratic Party is competitive is that it gives everyone in the tent a reason to be there. But to do that, the Democrats can't favor one perspective over any other, so they end up looking pretty centrist. Frankly, this is what a good government should be: the interests of all citizens should be represented to some degree. There are progressive candidates. And they are represented in the party in rough proportion to the actual engagement progressives have with furthering the DNC's platform. That last point may sound controversial, but it isn't. I live in a \\"progressive\\" state. I am active with the state party. The number of true progressives who are engaged in things like fundraising is negligible. Being a vigorous protestor doesn't move the platform.","title":"CMV: The Democrats should be nominating candidates who are further left, not more centrist."},{"text":"Silver has turned into such a troll.And no I dont think Harris should do Joe Rogan the legitimizing favor of treating him like a real journalist.
