Over worked under paid, watching millionaires and billionaires getting richer by the day and their PTO, pensions, benefits etc slowly slipping away. Then Covid hit and everything changed, it was no longer the same old cycle of corruption and inflation and then election cycle. Corporate greed kicked price gauging into next gear. And even when restrictions were lifted and we all went back to work they not only DIDNT take their foot off the gas they crept prices up more. Corporations were snatching up residential properties, housing and rent was unsustainable, interest rates were insane. Yet the economy is booming, Wall Street looks great, unemployment is at an all time low but you dont see it, not if you make less then 100k hell maybe even a million. I own a business in Tallahassee my sales are down 11.2% for the entire year. Artists in my shop (some of which have been tattooing for 20 plus years) all say theyve never seen it so slow in their lives. Indicators of needs over wants indicators of where the general mindset of common Americans are at right now. Nervous and angry.Then the 24 elections gear up and Biden makes a surprise move and steps down and Kamala comes in. I myself am surprised but also excited. I think she can turn it around I think shes going to side step much of Bidens short comings (like age). She does well at rallies she does well campaigning shes reaching many celebrities and her VP choice is a slam dunk (in my opinion). But then comes the debate with Trump, its her time to shine. She does fairly well but its missing something. I dont hear anything about the price of food, of housing, of college, of gas. Trumps bumbling and dancing on stage for 40 mins but guess what else, hes bringing up the price of eggs and bacon and gas prices. So much of what he says is brain dead and racist and borderline criminal but hes saying this like the price of food and promising to fix it day one. So hes essentially hitting two areas people are maddest about. The time it takes to change things and the outrageous price of living. If you were to equate inflation to wage ratio on a state to state level it would average about $16.50 a hour. Some states still have $7.80 hour. All while everything you can think of has risen in price. Trump tapped into that anger, fear and frustration of voters he would have never have, that were willing to look past who he was and what hes done or would do in hearing the promise of immediate change financially. Do I believe it? Not a chance, hes a liar and a grifting con artist but I also dont live paycheck to paycheck check and Im not blinded by desperation of that magnitude. Trump always had his cult of personality but he raked in new voters that are desperate and angry. The DNC had a chance in 08 with the Occupy Wall Street crowd they were ultimately disregarded, and again in 16 with Bernie and we all know how shameful his disparagement of character was by the DNC and people close to him like Elizabeth Warren. Not giving him a fair shake caused a mass exodus of new and excited voters to the depression and hopelessness of them not trying to achieve big goals. Biden was a stop gap in 2020 but everything that has followed that has been so vanilla from Garland as AG to light touches with Ukraine. The DNC is far to use to playing it safe trying not to veer to far left or shakeup their corporate overlords. Its high time they embrace working, middle and lower class Americans and adopt some real dynamic agendas to galvanize its base with younger, independent and undecided voters. I dont see us losing democrats to this pitch. I only see us gaining more and drawing a hard line the GOP is forced to work with.","title":"Democrats are trying to work out where it all went wrong.

I read that people are often asked to live as the opposite sex for *a year* before being offered medical transition services.  I agree there is a possibility for abuse, but Women get raped in bathrooms and changing rooms *right now* by men because there isn't a magic force field protecting these spaces.  Additionally, both men and women deal with the possibility that a person of the same sex could act massively inappropriately in those spaces. Any hard and fast rule on this sort of issue will likely create as many problems as it solves.  It is worth discussing for sure.  One of the reasons I think this creates so much division is because for  Trans individuals it is an a direct attack on there ability to participate in society.  If a person who presents as feminine goes into mens restrooms because *that's the law*,  they face the same kinds of risks that people think having Trans women in womens restrooms will cause.  If people were better about noting that *people who would abuse the system are not actually Trans* it would be beneficial for all involved.  A man who lies about Trans identity to get into womens spaces to creep on women in a pervert and not a trans person.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"If they truly want an objective answer to this question.

Republicans play hardball and often employ violent rhetoric targeting their opposition as traitors simply for disagreement. Democrats have a reasonable platform but they do not know how to play the game to win by any means possible.

Breaking up monopolies is pro-corporation, actually. Half of those are currently pending in the courts and will eventually get approvedNvidia/ARM was blocked and abandoned. Same with JetBlue/Spirit, Illumina/Grail, and Penguin/Simon&amp;Schuster. On Microsoft/Activision, the FTC fought them in court and lost, and are now appealing, but they havent given up. As for the conduct cases, Google was just found liable for monopolization and faces a remedies trial next year. The DoJ also just had a second trial against Google, with the decision due in a few months. Pretty much every expert expects the DoJ to win. Was there any real pushback on the dozen or so pharmaceutical industry mergers? 2020 and 2022 set a records in the number of approved corporate merges, so honestly the administration doesnt sound anti-corporation to me. The Microsoft/Activision merger was approved in October of 23.2022 was a [record year for merger challenges](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges), which means that merger enforcement was a lot more active than before. Also, it set a record for mergers reported, not approved. And, especially lately, the Biden admin has [been a lot more successful](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mergers-lose-their-shine-as-biden-racks-up-antitrust-wins-090057974.html) at blocking big mergers. More reported mergers are getting second requests from the enforcers, so industries are generally more reluctant to consolidate. Microsoft/Activision, as I said, was never approved by the FTC. The FTC fought it in court and lost. Executive orders are cute, but they hold little legal weight, they are not laws and the president isnt the king, the next guy will literally write their own orders reversing their predecessors executive orders on day 1. Signing a temporary executive order does nothing to convince me your actually solving the problem.Theyre more than just cute - EOs dictate how the entire Executive Branch works. Sure, this one will be reversed by Trump, but as long as Biden is president, his _entire government_ is working to promote competition and push back against consolidation. Think of how much rulemaking authority the executive agencies had (at least until _Chevron_ was overturned this year) and that power being brought to bear against monopolists. The example of Buttigiegs DoT is just a small part of this. Sure, EOs are not law, but as long as the president that signed them is in office, they are powerful. I could go on and on about more local corporations being gobbled up and completely dismantled by hedge funds, but is there a point? Democrats are not corporations bestest buds, but that honestly just depends on the corporation and who they are donating PAC money to.This is a stupid, cynical take. Sure Democrats are not perfect, but they are still _much, much more progressive_ than they were under Clinton or Obama. Just because you can point to some things they havent done, that doesnt mean they havent achieved a hell of a lot under Biden. And Bernie jumping up and down on the Democrats and denying their _very_ real achievements - after _literally playing on their team_ the last four years - is just selfish and petty.  Special interests rule the democratic party, always have and always will. Republicans are at least honest about it. There I said one good thing about republicans, they are more honest about which corporate elite overlords they are working with. At this point the I believe the only reason democrats fight any merger is so they can buy time and get capital ready for their inevitable insider trading they love to do.Sure, if this is the fiction you need to believe to make your BeRnIe WaS rIgHt take work, go ahead.

There is literally nothing more important than talking to 10%+ of the entire U.S population for 3 hours at the end of a campaign.

It's estimated that less than 100 transgender athletes compete in school sports nationwide, but Republicans would have you believe that it is some widespread, inescapable epidemic. This is what they do. Moral panics, fearmongering campaigns, complete distortions of reality, all for the sake of inciting hatred and vindicating a small faction of conservative's prejudices, phobias and paranoid delusions.Despite all the histrionics from conservatives on social media this election cycle about the radical left's plot to indoctrinate the masses with transgender pedagogy, to perform sex change operations on students and immigrants against their will, to \\"groom\\" children and expose them to pornography in schools, to flood women's sports with men, to force children to attend drag shows, to expose young kids to graphic material in class, to use the education system to recruit children into the LGBTQ movement, to use companies to promote the transgender and gay agenda, so on and so forthdespite all this culture war driven nonsense, voters did not turn out en masse to protect their children from all of these LGBTQ boogeymen.Because it's just a bunch of scare tactics, the same old story told again and again about some liberal agenda to transform American culture into something depraved, abnormal, irreligious, and evil.*I also want to address the hysteria around \\"wokeness.\\" Conservatives claim that it's \\"the left\\" who is obsessed with race, gender identity, but what I see is often the opposite. Where figures on \\"the right\\" constantly condemn \\"woke culture\\" and criticize a liberal, race, gender or DEI related agenda whenever the opportunity presents itself. I see conservatives instigating this culture war conflict disproportionately more than I see liberals living up to these criticisms.*Think about the panic around critical race theory, and how we are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting for parents, albeit accurate. Think about how some conservatives now claim that racism is over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat. Think about the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives haven't even read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think the outrage and panic centered around Bud Light after the company sent a single custom can to a transgender personality. Think about the moral outrage directed at target for selling rainbow sandals and t shirts. These are just a couple of examples where conservatives act like a coalition of liberals got together and forced these things to happenThink about all of the hysteria around \\"DEI.\\"Think about all the race related criticisms that Letitia James received, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.Think about how when gay or black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Think about how when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives rally around them and claim *their* appeal to black people.Thinking about the AI images that circulated over social media of Donald Trump posing with black people.Think about Trump's disingenuous showings at black events, where he sometimes rambles on incoherently about how he's done more for black people than Abraham Lincoln, or remarks that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black.Think about the outrage over litter boxes in schools. Think about how race, and gender identity and sexual orientation in particular are the target of myriad Republican-led legislative efforts.Think about Republicans wanting to roll back civil rights based on sex or gender discrimination.And all the fearmongering propaganda centered around the LGBTQ movement.The fixation on pedophilia and conspiracy theories, their tendency to accuse their opponents of being pedophiles.Think about... Well, the list goes on. The point being, who's really obsessed with race and gender identity?At any rate, this is the Republican M.O., and it's become much more effective lately at riling up a loud minority of seething culture warriors, because misinformation, propaganda, unsubstantiated rumors, clickbait, outrage and hate spreads farther, travels faster, circulates for longer and reaches wider audiences compared to anything resembling the truth.

Disinformation is sadly not illegal.  Media of all forms is now so heavily right wing that it's hard to pop the MAGA bubble.There was no fraud, but this certainly wasn't an aboveboard election.  Trump figured out in his first term that if something wasn't explicitly illegal, it was technically legal.  It's why he has so many dog whistles in his speeches, or why he has the people around him say and do the corrupt stuff on his behalf - it creates plausible deniability.  It's why he broke with so many longstanding government precedents, because there were no laws requiring that he follow those precedents.  It's why all the January 6th crimes were so hard to bring to trial, because they don't fall cleanly within the lines of existing criminal law, and ex-post-facto law enforcement is unconstitutional.  It's why he wasn't removed from office after either impeachment, again because his high crimes and misdemeanors weren't clearly and plainly high crimes and misdemeanors.  He's clearly had decades of training on how to skirt the law without breaking it, seeing as he can afford dozens of lawyers at any given time.  In this election, that strategy expanded to everyone around Trump.  Musk's PACs, the disinformation campaigns, the fake text messages with voting misinformation and false claims about Harris' policies, and more - all of it technically not illegal.And of course, his plan is to ensure it stays that way.  He already has a plan to stop the government from calling out disinformation, or from asking social media platforms to highlight disinformation, under claims that it violates the first amendment.  Technically, he's right - the first amendment largely prevents the government from deciding what information can and cannot be shared.  But that means the only check remaining on disinformation is the listener/viewer/user themselves, and we all know that social media algorithms are designed to keep us addicted to the same content over and over and never prompt us to challenge our beliefs.","title":"2024 election inconsistencies"},{"text":"[You need to prepare for the collapse of the US emergency medical system.](https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1go9w8a/you_need_to_prepare_for_the_collapse_of_the_us/)","title":"Democrats did better than Harris downballot, providing glimmer of hope"},{"text":"Yep.

Podcasts dont have to rely on them to function, though. Its not like Joe Rogan had a politician on every single week.Furthermore, the establishment Dems are so manicured and hyper focused on presentation that you could never throw Kamala on any podcast that isnt something like Call Me Daddy. Kamala is an awkward woman who seems like she has no interests and hobbies in anything outside of work. She is the kind of person who would be so concerned about oh my god, how many voters am I losing to republicans if I say that I tried out some weed when I was young and in college? that she doesnt realize that podcast audiences dont give a shit about any of that and just want someone who is genuine.Trump can do this. He can talk about doing a line of coke on a podcast. He can talk about golf. He can talk about cars. He can talk about whatever the fuck the other person is interested in. In sales, if you want to be someones friend and get the sale, whatever they want to talk about hobby wise, you are going to sit there for the next 20 minutes and fucking wax poetic about how cool cars are or some shit. Trump gets this.Meanwhile, what do we actually know about Kamala? In fact, do you know how well equipped she was to be casual? This bitch worked in McDonalds as a young adult. Go fucking bitch about how awful that job was like every other person who walks away from it. She never could because god forbid McDonalds stops donating to them and the young audience she should be relating to doesnt relate to how grueling and awful being in a minimum wage dead end job is. Instead, she doesnt capitalize on that life experience and she lets Trump overtake her on the McDonalds thing because bro actually shows up for a fucking shift on camera at McDonalds and then looks super personable toward the people going through the drive thru window.

The oil and the war seems to go hand in hand. I'd argue it's more about limiting their oil production and making the world more reliant on our oil production. I don't think the right is all about buying foreign oil, more about making ours cheaper by drilling more. Drill, baby, drill is the common Republican saying. Not big more from the middle east. If I remember correctly our number one importer of oil is in south America. Not the middle east. Yeah economics is a complicated issue, I don't really think  anyone can change your mind on that.

Liberals on guns...I don't think any liberals are trying to take guns, but they are trying to regulate them. From my perspective, the only thing citizens would have in America were the government to come for them or  civil war to start would be guerilla tactics.

Assault weapon ban, yes, that's a thing, but in Iraq and Afghanistan they had full auto AK47s everywhere, they may have \\"won\\" in the end, but had we stayed and forced the issue with no rules of engagement, we'd have killed them all.

Honestly, it mostly seems like the concern is for how much effort MtF trans individuals put into \\"passing\\"Before the Republicans made a huge issue of this, MtF trans individuals used the bathroom of *there appearance* and *nobody cared*.  In fact, most people would have been more upset if a passing MtF trans woman used the men's restroom.The backlash seems to be the idea that men who simply declare themselves Trans, but are not doing anything to pass or live as women would enter women's spaces, because again, *passing* trans MtF women have been in women's spaces *since the 1950s*.Sports also seems to be an area where the impacts have not been thought about.  If MtF trans individuals, who are  doing hormone treatments to have a body that expresses  as female are supposed to play in  men's sports, that would mean *FtM trans men would be playing in women's sports.*  This seems to be the exact opposite of what the concerns about men in women's sports wants to have happen.  A FtM trans individual will have the chemical biological advantage that people claim a MtF trans individual would have meanwhile estrogen therapy results in muscle loss and reduced bone density.  I am not saying your opinion is wrong, but sex reassignment has been a thing since the 1950s.  It was *not an issue* that trans women used women's spacesz played in women's sports and participated in society as women.What *changed* is Republicans made a big deal about it and made it seem like individuals who were either *not passing* or *not ready to fully live as their preferred gender* were the most typical versions of Trans individuals.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"A little toooooo ironic.","title":"Kamala Harris campaigns election-eve concerts said to cost up to $20M  as staff, vendors fear they wont be paid"},{"text":"They expect a minimum wage cashier to account for their register to the last cent but not the most powerful office in our country??If theres no fraud, if we do audits and find nothing, I believe people will accept it unlike those in 2020.

I think we're in a moment that shows the stark division between liberals and leftists of the Democratic Party. By and large, white liberals are more prone to virtue signalling, in an insulated community and a privileged life and they are happy to be environmentalist, rights advocates, etc.. but as soon as their mannerisms and behaviors come into focus? They aren't really able to handle it for the most part. It feels great to have an amplified voice in the online age, but that also comes with the ability to adapt and grow with change. What we're seeing is the inability to change with the times because it requires a level of reflection and introspection that they are not used to, and usually attach a level of sensitivity and defensiveness to their reactions for not understanding something. Leftists understand that we are all stronger and live better, more enriched lives, when we are able to change systemic issues in oir lives. There are so many moments in our history in the US that highlight how difficult it is to fight systemic issues, but they persist nonetheless. A lot of the things I personally believe in wouldn't benefit me directly, and that's more than justified. I had my own facing the music and reality check on my ignorance about race, gender, etc. It is very difficult to change your habits and way of thinking that you are so used to, and has kind of steered you through life up to that point. But I understood that I will never understand my neighbors if I can't even face an uncomfortable challenge like that. I have the privilege of living in a very leftist city and the things mentioned in this article happen plenty, there are always going to be some people who take these behaviors and become toxic with them -- there are toxic people in literally every demographic imaginable. But by and large, the feeling that comes from having a sense of community that neighbors do truly care about each other, not just some faceless platitude, it has a very deep, invigorating effect. There is a lot of humility, a lot of honesty, a lot of transparency. I think articles like this do a disservice to people because it is just more finger pointing.  When faced with an uncomfortable confrontation with how you are perceived outside of yourself, and you choose to repel against it and stick your head in the sand? You will choose to make arguments like this article does, which are at its core, dehumanizing groups of US citizens.","title":"Trans Moralism Is Killing the Democrats"},{"text":"Theres nothing wrong with having a big tent but there needs to be a unifying factor vs having a coalition of conflicting interests.

I staunchly support access to gender affirming care for youth based on my own experience of *not* having it, and for the exact same reason that the sports and athletics conversation is so complicated, because puberty *does* in fact cause physiological changes, based on the dominant sex hormone, that are irreversible and permanent.It isn't true that there isn't an understanding in the trans community that there is a fundamental difference between cis and trans women. What is true is that difference is often a source of incredible pain, self-alienation, and suffering for trans women. We understand. Trust us, we do.I think sports issues should be left to their individual leagues, and I would actually really appreciate some *extensive* research into athletic performance for various sports through aspects and stages of medical transition. Partially because I want to find what *is* fair, for everyone, and partially because I think a giant mountain of data on physiological performance through various time frames of HRT would be *really nice* for the trans community to have from a purely medical perspective.That sounds really useful!I do believe these conversations are valuable and important. At the same time trans people have been the very specific target of a coordinated attack campaign, and we have to deal with bad faith arguments and questioning, gaslighting, sealioning, and if we have an overly emotional or charged response to people who ultimately have power over us and we are dependent on for compassion and understanding having a \\"civil debate\\" about just how involved in common, shared, public life we can be, we're branded as extremist, dogmatic, intolerant of other viewpoints, etc.","title":"Democrats celebrate LGBTQ+ gains &amp; promise to stand up for trans rights after rough election"},{"text":"I just dont understand what they were thinking with that","title":"Bernie Sanders blasts Democrats for their attitude towards Joe Rogan"},{"text":"When did the Muslim terrorists quit being our enemies?","title":"When Did Liberals Become So Comfortable With War?"},{"text":"Rubbish. \\nWAR is a RepubliKKKan thing.\\nALWAYS HAS BEEN!","title":"When Did Liberals Become So Comfortable With War?"},{"text":"yes it is?","title":"Nearly 4 minutes of Trump condemning white supremacy while the media says he won't"},{"text":"On screen they see that but in real life they will see things stay the same, get worse, or get better.

They don't vote on policy, they vote on narrative. Trump has a narrative; liberal elites and illegal migrants are killing your country. The solution? Deportations. On both ballot initiatives and polling on the issues, progressive policies are consistently popular. Raising the minimum wage, protecting abortion, paid sick leave, expansions to social security/medicare, etc. etc. etc. These policy positions *are* popular. The problem is twofold. 1) Democrats don't even run on these issues. They don't run on medicare for all, they don't run on raising the minimum wage. 2) the reason they don't, is because it doesn't slot into their pro-corporate, pro-status qou world view. This goes hand-in-hand with their lack of a narrative.Why do so many people go from Bernie supporters to Trump voters? It is narrative. Bernie has his clear narrative. The Billionaire oligarchs are robbing Americans blind, so the economy needs to start working for ordinary Americans vis-a-vis universal healthcare and raising the minimum wage.The Democratic Establishment consistently prefers to kill its own grassroots movements over winning against fascism.

Most people just voted to deport migrants workers for jobs they won't do which will raise the prices of the groceries. Most people ignored that the current administration gave overtime rights to four million more Americans. Most people ignored that Donald Trump loves when working people fighting for better wages and rights get fired because he said that with his own words.

That's generally going to be true across the board, no matter what side you fall on.  Even the \\"I can't afford my food!\\" is emotive reasoning because they most likely don't understand why they can't afford their food.  Most people simply don't understand how the economy works and what affects the price of different foods.And yes, voting for Brexit had a lot of support from people who *wanted* it for some reasons.  Even those that understood it *completely* could have voted in favor of Brexit on account of some form of emotive reasoning.An example is the gun debate.  There is *practically speaking*, no reason why people would spend so much energy and emotions on that particular debate when their arguments are *primarily* school's getting shot up.  However, when you actually consider the number of people who die to gun related incidents in their entirety and compare it to other things that cause death, people *tend* to ignore everything else in favor of being angry that children died in a mass shooting at a school.  Those other areas of concern don't seem to bother people nearly as much.Guns, outside of being considered \\"accidents,\\" don't make the top 10.  And the reality is if you limit the availability of alcohol, force people to get a specific \\"alcohol\\" ID card, remove access to alcohol for alcoholics, and other things that are *already* part of gun control laws or at the very least have had a lot of support, you'd be saving *a lot more people* than by banning all guns.  Which one saves more lives?  Putting increasing limitations on alcohol sales and alcohol consumption, and increasing the punishments for breaking the law in regards to alcohol.  Which one gets more people talking?  Guns.  I am more scared of driving at night in a city in account of drunk driving and speeding than I am of seeing a gun on someone's hip at a supermarket.  I know which one kills more, and I know that if one were to be the death of me *it would be the idiot in the car high or drunk and speeding*.And that's a statistical fact.  But nobody cares about statistical facts, they care about their emotive response.  **All** of the corona response was *emotive*.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Completely wrong.

While it is true that, technically, their vote actively strips away your rights, they probably werent even thinking about that when they voted for Trump. Many Trump voters that I know were really struggling financially under Biden, and they truly believed that Trump would improve the economy. Lots of them were socially liberal and didnt agree with the Republican Party at all on issues relating to gay marriage/abortion. Unfortunately, many of them felt pushed to vote red due to skyrocketing inflation and weak borders. Its sad that there is no party to represent the libertarians of the world, but such is the country we live in. I tend to be more economically conservative, myself, but Im a single issue voter on abortion, so I voted blue. My vote for Kamala doesnt reflect my beliefs on economic policy, its just that my bodily autonomy is more important to me than the amount of money in my pocket. If I were really struggling financially, however, it might be a different story.What Im trying to say is that a vote for Trump doesnt necessarily mean someone is wholeheartedly against your union or that they support policies to disenfranchise you. They may, like all (flawed) humans, be putting themselves first, and might have forgotten you in the process. Its sad, but again, in the current two-party system, youre inevitably sacrificing some of your beliefs by choosing sides.As a side note, if your mother, grandmother, etc, are all planning on coming to your wedding, they clearly care about you and your partner and want to support you.

With 1/3 women experiencing those complications https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00454-0/fulltext as compared to 2% of ALL abortion issues (including miscarriages-medical necessity deemed abortions or other). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430793/ . Some complications from birth also exist as complications from pregnancy. But if you want an argument, I can also point out that your original statistic of 95-98% abortions not being medical is wrong (but that is based on the definition that cited concerns for health of either themselves or the child) at 7%. The majority of women cite their reasoning as being that they have financial constraints or other life focuses- caring for other dependents, finishing schooling so they can provide better for any child, factors that lead them to believe they will be a single mother. For me personally, those are not inconsequential reasons that show the callousness of women, but a responsibility to all current and future lives they are connected to. https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives . It is all a matter of perspective and situational awareness. The statistics are the same (unless it is manipulated) it is how you view the circumstances through your own eyes that changes your own conclusion.","title":"Something fishy in Arizona.

Right, because he's well known as a man of discipline dedicated to learning. They're already repeating the same mistake of delayed/poor transition.

His underlings don't have the authority to speak for anyone but themselves.The biggest risk here (outside of another coup, which could unleash something far worse than just Trump if the military steps in) is brain drain in the executive branch. He definitely has the power and people to do damage there.While I hear you regarding swing states, those Congressmen have to survive a primary firstEven primary voters lack the patience for a PowerPoint on how Joe Schmoe (R-ETC) slow walked a bill through committee while at the same time going on Fox to rant about trans people like a loyal soldier.

It beats values by 3-to-1. It beats character by 10 points, Lake said. Weve never had it that high before.And later: Biden, as he launched his campaign, staked his candidacy on stopping Trump from winning a second term that he warned would forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Yet some Democrats took note that there was little mention about what he would do affirmatively with his years in the Oval Office, other than undo the previous four.Biden naively campaigned in 2020 with the misguided belief that he was the only one who could end Trump's reign on the principle that making Trump go away would just magically make things better and snap his supporters back to reality. He wanted to turn a blind eye to the ugliness and persistence of fascism and sold a pipe dream to people who would be told four difficult years of recovery later, \\"No, this time it really is the most important election of our lifetime!\\" While arguably true, it rang on deaf ears.This time we had a discouraged voter base that was primed against the incumbent as well as a Donald Trump who seemed invincible against consequences thanks to his cronies on the Supreme Court and in Congress. Biden could have given us a chance to hold Trump accountable, but in a political ploy of pure pretentiousness, he appointed spineless centrist Merrick Garland as AG, killing any chances to keep his one primary vow to Americans.So yeah, Biden was the victim of undue blame.

I read a comment by another Reddit user a few days ago, and I have to agree with their realization:We all thought Trump lost the 2020 election because he sucked and people finally realized that. In truth, Trump likely lost in 2020 because *life* sucked (due to the pandemic) and Trump just happened to be President at the time.What that means is if Clinton had won in 2016, she probably would have also lost in 2020. If Trump had let professionals deal with the pandemic and 400k more people survived, he probably would have *still* lost in 2020.I'm beginning to wonder if reelection is only possible outside of any significant economic issues at the personal level.I keep thinking that Democrats should start having a primary every election cycle, even if they have an incumbent. But primaries really aren't going to guarantee that you get a candidate that can appeal to low-information and low-propensity voters, soo... Since the economy is tied (rightly or wrongly) to the current administration, maybe something even more extreme: no incumbents. Any new Democrat candidate would need to make it clear that they will deal with the current economic issue(s) that people are facing.This could allow voters to express their dissatisfaction with the current Democratic President, while still presenting them with a Democratic alternative that would push for *mostly* the same policies, but would give people the choice of something different when it comes to the biggest perceived pain point(s).Edit: Of course, the success of that will depend on if people are blaming the current *person*, or the current *party*.","title":"Democrats are trying to work out where it all went wrong.

Those won't just be an abstract thing they've heard of, those relationships will now be a thing they have personal experience with, and in a supportive and loving context.  This will make gay rights more **salient**, meaning they'll be more likely to think of it as an issue when considering political positions.  \\n * Second, it will **personalize** gay relationships.  Despite whatever hateful rhetoric they've heard from right-wing sources, you will have given them a *powerful* counter-narrative -- gay relationships can no longer just be \\"weirdos in SanFran\\", they'll forever be \\"Abe and Bob, who looked so *happy* at their wedding\\".  This will make gay rights more **positive**, meaning they'll be more likely to be in favor of them when they come to mind.  \\nTaken together, *this experience will nudge dozens of conservative voters in the direction of gay rights.*\\n \\nBy contrast, if you say \\"anyone who voted for a Republican is not invited\\", you reinforce the idea that gay people are the enemies of Republicans; as a result, you would likely nudge dozens of conservative voters *against* gay rights.To advance the cause of gay rights, inviting them is easily the logical choice.**However**, emotions matter -- how we feel about things is important, *especially* for something as meaningful as your wedding.  You're clearly unhappy about this idea, and that may be enough to make it worth culling the invite list.Two things to consider:  \\n * First, your fiance has made it clear that this plan will cause quite a lot of trouble for them down the road.  That may be the lesser of two evils, but keep in mind that every time that avoidable family drama afflicts your partner in the future, there's a real risk of them feeling a flash of (justified) resentment that you wouldn't let them avoid it.  Starting your marriage with that future conflict may not be ideal.  \\n * Second, you can perhaps talk with your fiance about more targeted non-invitations.  As an example, you mentioned that one or more individuals had posted hateful rhetoric about gay people online; perhaps not inviting them in particular due to that specific behavior is something your partner could be on board with?Finally, two things:  \\n * First, it fundamentally comes down to whatever you and your fiance talk over and agree on.  The right answer is *your* right answer, for you as a couple.  \\n * Second, congratulations!!  I hope your wedding is amazing, and your marriage even better!","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"I hope we've all learned the lessons that voters would rather laugh at the broken people in the unemployment line so long as their eggs are cheap.","title":"Chris Murphy calls for \\"a firm break with neoliberalism\\""},{"text":"They should have ate him alive his first term from a normal political standpoint, but here we are.

Consider the Iran-Iraq War in 1988. Iran blockade the Persian Gulf and began sinking civilian oil tankers. This drove gas prices up in the United States, which led to the US sending the Navy to ensure shipping lanes went unmolested. Iran mined the waters, badly damaged a USN vessel, starting Operation Praying Mantis, which saw the United States demolish Iran's navy. This normalized the gas prices as oil shipments resumed.When people launch a war over resource acquisition, they seek to reduce costs by seizing control of the resource. Now you don't need to bargain for it. But this isn't what the United States typically does. Instead, the US most often supports a sympathetic government regime in these regions, toppling the old hostile regime, which allows the US to buy oil from them at very low prices. The hostile regime was selling oil at ludicrous prices, making intervention profitable.This is why war can be both disruptive to oil markets, and also beneficial to a nation to engage in conflict.","title":"CMV: Liberals and Conservatives are all contradictory."},{"text":"Sadly Trump and his follower have unironically said all of that and don't see any contradictions in it","title":"Kamala Harris Stepdaughter Ella Emhoff Says Rumors of Mental Breakdown and Hospitalization Are Not True | \\"Theres nothing wrong with showing emotion and crying,\\" Emhoff, 25, wrote on her Instagram Stories"},{"text":"She just won her seat by ~24 points, so it would be a tall task to flip it","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 10, 2024"},{"text":"Why not?

Just because the democrats joined in on the game out of desperation post-Raegan, it doesnt mean it comes from liberals or is a Democratic thing. Its fucking globalism and free-market. Thats neoliberalism. Free Market has been the republicans calling card since forever before Trump flipped the table. Neoconservatism is invading Panama and Iraq its unilateral decision-making by the US that is then forced on other countries. Neoliberals set the economic policy, and neoconservatives started the wars that reminded everyone that even tho trade was free, the US was going to define what free looks like. As a reminder, Bill Clinton was extremely popular. The people complaining about neoliberalism now are likely the same people that were cheering it on post-Reagan. I dont blame the anger tho Reagan lied to them, they all lied to us afterward, and Trump is also selling them even more outrageous lies. The truth is, when prices stayed the same and the US was adamantly #1 with no challengers, the majority was super was cool with it. The truth of the matter now is that if the US pulls back from the world, China will fill the void, and prices will go up. That doesnt mean we shouldnt tone done both of the *rightwing inventions* of neoliberalism and neoconservatism, but it is also ridiculously stupid for Trump to fuck up all our alliances across the world. Those alliances make us prosperous. We sell them our shit, and they sell their shit to us under the umbrella of the USD, which affords us insane buying power. Sorry for the rant.

Liberals typically believe that government is necessary to protect individuals from being harmed by others, but they also recognize that government itself can pose a threat to liberty.\\nMost modern \\"Liberalism\\" in the Rush Limbaugh-style is actually Progressivism. Most of progressivism is actually reactionary against the rise of liberalism and industrial society that happened in the 18th and 19th century.   They were very worried about the state of the country, the decline of strong leadership, and how things seemed like they were falling apart (from their viewpoint). This is why they became very worried about things like Eugenics and Malthusian Theory.  https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/33719They felt it was very important to have a scientific approach to administrating society. https://ballotpedia.org/%22The_Progressive_Origins_of_the_Administrative_State:_Wilson,_Goodnow,_and_Landis%22_by_Ronald_J._Pestritto_(2007)All of this is very reactionary.  You can't leave people to their own devices. Capitalism is a race to the bottom and unfettered competition is fundamentally wasteful.   We need to preserve the quality of our protoplasm.  All of this was very important from a early Progressive point of view.This is very anti-Liberal if you use Liberalism in the original sense. But it meshes very well with things like Socialism and Marxism... which rose to prominence later.   Which are also Anti-Liberal born from reactionary pro-state philosophers like Hegal, who was the head of the philosophical department in the State-ran University of Prussia and incredibly influential to modern politics.\\nIn modern American politics we have this idea of left-right divide that really makes almost no sense. Libertarianism is born from a collection of old-school conservative and liberals that were disenfranchised by the growing power of the Federal government.

The point of this comment is to explain why people thought the economy was great then and why they think it's shit now. ---Those bailouts we the people got were amazing. For those of us who were working, wages were pretty high. For those of us that were unemployed, unemployment was all but guaranteed and it was super high. In Texas right now the maximum unemployment is $591, during COVID it was $1135 because of the extra $600(max was $535 in 2020). For a lot of people, that was more money than they were making at work. Right now, the maximum in Mississippi is $235. Same as it was in 2020. That extra $600 would have been a goddamn lifesaver. If you could also get food stamps, that was another couple hundred dollars or more per month. Rent was lower, and pretty much everything was waaaaay cheaper. Especially gas, which dipped all the way down to $1 per gallon in at least one Texas town. So all that extra money went even further than it does now. After the pandemic, wages eventually crashed back down. At least they did for my industry. The extra $600 for unemployment ended. Unemployment became harder to get again. And then the price of everything shot through the roof. When people talk about the economy, they don't care about the stock market, thats not what they're talking about. They're talking about how they're personally doing financially. And for a lot of people, how they're doing now is shit, especially compared to the pandemic. They credit Trump because they're brain dead, they blame Biden for the same reason. Truth is, the bailouts wouldn't have happened without the Democrats. Trump wouldn't have passed them, and only did so because they let him and his friends raid the coffers.","title":"Voters punished Biden for problems he didnt cause and effectively addressed"},{"text":"Independents are independent for a reason.

We need more women to vote. 2. WHY didnt those men vote for us.  WHY are they hateful. In the US boys, from 1st grade now fall behind girls. Boys need movement to learn. We have virtually eliminated recess. We need to adapt teaching methods to also support boys.We dont. Boys commit suicide at 300% the rate of girls.  Where are  the concerns, the vigils, why isnt Hoda lighting candles?So these boys are marginalized, and now these are hateful young men. And here we are.  And they will vote for many elections. Education is the vaccine for hate, including Trump and the GOP.  We must do our best to educate all of our children. We should have STEM programs for boys AND girls. Im with Bernie.  It does not help our society to blame these people.  Figure out what they need and help them. Most working people in the US need childcare.  They want their children to have a real shot.

As far as the regular everyday American who's on the left, I think it's a mental illness to be quite honest with you. I mean these people are losing their minds now. And they're letting the events of the election, rule their lives. That's textbook mental illness. And you ask them why they hate Trump, and not one of them can give you a legitimate answer. They will give you an answer, but every single answer is something that was propaganda from legacy media and is not necessarily true.So if you see how all these people are reacting, literally losing their minds over this election. And you factor in the two men that try to assassinate him, it's pretty easy to surmise that there is a mental illness going on with these people. Because check it out. These people become so enraged, that they become a public spectacle, or do something unforgivable. Unforgivable. These are reactions to a man being elected. But the actual things that are happening around them that the current administration is doing that makes their lives harder, like inflation, illegal immigration, and so on, they don't react to that at all. In fact, a lot of these people are reacting so intentionally to the things that Trump could possibly do down the road, like it's the end of the world. They're behaving just like children when you take away their iPad. Furthermore. The abortion debate has been around for how long? Why all the sudden people are reacting this intensely to it? It's just because it's Trump. A man that before he ever ran for public office, was not necessarily adored by the public, but nobody hated them.

The next step would be to pick a moderate Democrat or an Independent senator as a unity President.I think Joe would not go along with this because it would be too extreme and would hurt his legacy. Instead he will let Trump become President.If the Sisonites want to foment a lot of trouble, all they have to do is distribute their personal arsenals, such as those used for training during Socialist Rifle Association and John Brown Gun Club meetups, to everyone facing deportation.

Sorry, block Democratic poll watcher. He also bragged that in 2020 Biden would have won Texas if not for his policy and action.In 2020, Trump was caught on tape with two swing states outright asking them to cheat on his behalf. Georgia and Arizona. If you haven't watched Stop the Steal on Netflix, it was made by Republicans. In Arizona, our House speaker denied Trump the votes he asked to be 'found', with several other GOP officials pressuring Speaker Bowers to not certify the results.Trump and his ilk cried that the 2024 election was rigged. All calls of election interference stopped almost immediately. Between 1 and several flash drives containing vote counts in Pennsylvania went missing or were delivered corrupt without data.I believe it is extremely important to understand that if Trump lost in 2024 he is going to jail for the rest of his life. He's shown he has the capacity to cheat, whether it's in business, politics, or golf. Similarly, Elon Musk claimed that if Trump lost, Elon would also be in prison.

Turnout for Democratic candidates by population percentage comparing years where Democrats first won and what happened the next election:1976 to 1980: drop 13.1 percent. Jimmy Carter got in on Watergate, but could not sustain.1992 to 1996: rise 5.6 percent. Bill Clinton got in on Reagan-Bush fatigue.

Some went to Clinton.2008 to 2012: drop 5.2 percent, Barack Obama got in *partially* on Bush fatigue, then turnout dropped.2020 to 2024: drop 12.5 percent *so far*.

Khans FTC has issued rules banning non-competes, and enshrining right-to-repair and single-click cancellation. Gensler has been taking on both the big banks _and_ the crypto industry. Kanters DOJ has also been going after various industries for both consolidation and labor violations.

But it would still hurt Joes ego and legacy, so I think he will not resign anyway. But if he did resign, Kamala could appoint someone really partisan as the new Vice President, so he or she could preside over the opening of the ballots on January 6, 2025. The new Vice President could get the Senate to invalidate all electoral college ballots cast for Trump on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendments disqualification clause. The next step would be to pick a moderate Democrat or an Independent senator as a unity President.I think Joe would not go along with this because it would be too extreme and would hurt his legacy. Instead he will let Trump become President.If the Sisonites want to foment a lot of trouble, all they have to do is distribute their personal arsenals, such as those used for training during Socialist Rifle Association and John Brown Gun Club meetups, to everyone facing deportation.

The fact that such family members would even want to attend a same sex marriage speaks volumes, and makes me wonder if you're not telling us everything, painting a very biased picture of them.\\n2. The political spectrum is so polarized now that it's designed to tear people apart - family, friends, neighbors. The entire nation. Feeding into that feels wrong, especially when there's such huge, nuanced subjects that deserve a lot more discussion and grey areas than these blanket black and white polarized sides allow, both of those sides exacerbated by deeply restrictive echochambers people simply don't want to step out of because they're so comfortable and convenient.\\n3. I really think you should pick your family members' brains more. What would compel them to think differently than you on certain subjects? Did they weigh out the pros and cons of their vote, choosing what they saw as the lesser evil? Considering how you described them, they don't seem simply vindictive.\\n4. Even if you take the absolute worse approach to this and come to find these family members do in fact hate homosexuality, voting to destroy gay rights, and are very vindictive - this is a prime opportunity to prove them wrong by showing them compassion and love.\\n5. Moving past your family into your overarching ideology, keep in mind that Trump won by a larger margin for a reason. You don't have to agree with anything Trump, trump supporters, conservatives, or anyone else thinks, but I highly suggest attempting to at least understand where they're coming from and finding a way to coexist with them, because as the election results show, they constitute at least half the nation.All that said, you do you.

It is frequently associated with anti-establishment and anti-political sentiment.Sound familiar?Populism is old as dirt. The Gracchi brothers were Roman populists in the 2nd century BC. Trump isn't new. He's very, very, very old.The conventional approach to defeating populism is government reform. Populist movements are animated by people's perception of corruption, abuse of power, and apathy towards the plight of common people by the government. That sentiment is what populists latch onto and turn like a spear on the political ruling-class to upend the status quo that people feel has failed them. The populist, of course, has their own ends in mind, sometimes noble, often not.The political establishment could likely defeat Trumpism by just doing a couple things:- Eliminate dark, corporate, and organizational money in politics.\\n- Pass legislation against partisan gerrymandering.\\n- Make for-profit lobbying illegal.\\n- Crack down on insider trading by Congress.\\n- Establish an upper age limit for public office. There's plenty more to do beyond that, but just knocking out those few would greatly increase the electorate's confidence in the US government. The populist masses aren't pissed that problems exist. They're pissed that their government is ineffectual in addressing those problems because it's mired in corruption and fuckery --- Trump's proverbial \\"swamp.\\" Give them a government that's actually capable and held accountable and 90% of their anger vanishes.","title":"Bernie Sanders doubles down that people are angry with Dems after Pelosi said she didnt respect his remarks"},{"text":"Funny though.

However I would really like to see a higher level of conversation. Fundamentally its difficult for smart people to understand dumb people, for decent people to understand assholes, for empathetic people to understand narcissists. \\nDuring the campaign there was no policy comparison unless you count tariffs as an economic policy, Kamala owned that space. However the critics on the left have no choice but to criticize Kamalas policies because that is the paradigm under which they operate and cannot deviate from that. I count myself among those who did not see the problem approaching be Election Day but it is clear as day now. There is no policy that will sway those who fall for they are eating the pets, and this is the first lesson to learn. \\nThe real lesson to be learnt is how do the Dems produce rational fear to combat the irrational fear generated on the right. They tried with the threat to democracy and fascism which made sense but wasnt enough. They could have gone in much harder with the economic and pandemic fears especially with the mismanagement of Covid and the JFK jr. anti vaccine stance. They just need enough to peel away 5% of voters. \\nLastly, and most unfortunately, the Dems need to nominate a straight white guy next time. Competency is not an issue for presidents, the challenge is acceptability to the largest voting bloc. Obama was unique in his charisma and competence which allowed him to twice overcome the hurdle of racism in the electorate. That is no longer a luxury.

Fast-forward to Victorian Western Europe, a strange time for gender in sport history. Society expected women to be fragile and helpless.

I think you're right that a lot of folks didn't hear or know what Kamala was actually running on, but I think that is evidence of the incredibly fractious and unfavorable media environment more than not. At almost every turn, national media followed right wing narratives about Harris: she wasn't doing enough interviews, she had no policy platform, she was too rehearsed, etc. Even ostensibly liberal outlets like CNN and MSNBC did this. At the local level, Harris's many visits to swing states were barely covered, while they offered live coverage of Trump's. Harris barnstormed the swing states, and had almost nothing to show for it in terms of positive earned media coverage. This vacuum of coverage was filled by negative ads and malevolent voices on talk radio, podcasts, and opinion pages, who all castigated Harris as being too much of everything -- joyless, too fun, too bookish, too much of a dilettante, etc. That's to say nothing of the informal news media -- podcasts, TikTok/YouTube, etc. Trump dominated these alternative news sources for years, until Harris took over and started dominating on TikTok. However, the damage had already been done: people had been taught to loathe a good economy, to see a fairly active Biden administration as somnambulist, and to see Harris, a fairly standard vice president who cast some historic tie-breaking votes, as an inept ladder climber with no substance. Many of the most harmful narratives about Harris and the Democrats were set in stone months before Harris assumed the nomination, and no amount of bought media or campaigning would have dislodged them. This isn't saying she couldn't have won -- I still believe that Harris's embrace of Obama style mealy-mouth bipartisanship ultimately ceded too much ground to Trump on issues like immigration, crime, and social issues -- but I do think the media environment played a larger than usual role in shaping the electorate's views of the candidates.","title":"It always comes back to the DNC"},{"text":" Some commentators out there are telling you that there won't be a 2028 election.

With the U.S. threatening war unless Iraq turned over weapons that didn't exist, Saddam allowed U.N. weapons inspectors to return. A Swedish diplomat, Hans Blix, was placed in charge and visited with Cheney on October 30, 2002. **According to Blix, Cheney delivered a stern message: If inspectors failed to discover WMDs, the administration would discredit them.**By February 2003, Blix believed the Iraqis were largely cooperating. He met with senior American officials, including Rice, telling them that the intelligence he had obtained from the Americans was poor and that none of the suspected weapons sites identified by the CIA held WMDs. American intelligence wasn't on trial, Rice replied. **Blix was supposed to find the weapons, not question the quality of the CIA's work.*When Blix's inspectors came up empty, the Bush administration demanded that they portray the equivalent of popguns as major threats.** For example, officials told Blix that two items found by inspectors**a balsa wood drone** with a motorcycle engine and a rusted, decades-old bomb that amounted to little more than a massive paperweightshould be declared violations of the WMD restrictions. **When Blix scoffed at this, administration officials anonymously leaked lies that misrepresented what the two items were, falsely declared that the inspection team thought they constituted violations of the U.N. weapons restrictions on Iraq, and attacked Blix for hiding the truth to prevent war. Ultimately, Blix found nothing.** And, just as Cheney promised, the administration dismissed this strong intelligence as meaningless.[https://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/dick-cheneys-biggest-lie-333097.html](https://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/dick-cheneys-biggest-lie-333097.html)","title":"Senator Chris Murphy on Democrats losses: Our tent is too small"},{"text":"You can be against racism and bigots without messaging it so badly.

At some point you have to admit that any government entity, no matter how good, is ultimately run by a bureaucrat that can be corrupted. So there really is no \\"virtue\\" in helping people at the point of a gun. Some bureaucrat is inevitably going to come along and screw even charity up. When that happens, it is FAR FAR better that the charity is removed from government, or else you have to explain why it was government doing the social safety net to begin with.This recent FEMA thing is a really good example of just how messed up things can get. I wish there was a way we could social safety nets impartially and without fail, but inevitably someone somewhere is going to make a mistake either intentionally or accidentally, and we need to be able to immediate correct it as a society. It can be corrected instantly if it's a free market solution, it might not be corrected instantly if it's a bureaucrat protected by political regime.If you look at how the Nordic countries do \\"free healthcare\\" it's actually a very capitalist system but it uses \\"vouchers\\" that are redeemable based on the number of people helped by a hospital. We, in the US, run things like food stamps this way already. If we ran public healthcare and education like we did food stamps we wouldn't have the problems in healthcare and education that we do today. That'd be a good first step. I'd actually like to see the feds let some states try running healthcare and education like they do foodstamps to see if it could work before implementing it nationwide.Eventually, if done right, you could potentially still have the social safety nets without doing away with it completely. But then you have to remain diligent and fight the fraud. Even though there is fraud with food stamps today, it pales in comparison to the Social Security fraud going on right now so it'd be a good first step to move these thing to the market, IMHO.A lot of social safety nets were done by churches and fraternities at the turn of the previous century. I am confident we could eventually get back to the same sort of system, but it might take a decade or two of a voucher-like system as a transition.","title":"Liberalism vs Libertarianism"},{"text":"Generally speaking, Conservatives don't eat their own","title":"Why Democrats Are Losing the Culture War"},{"text":"George Carlin did say the public sucks","title":"Bernie Sanders says Democrats need to own why they lost the working-class"},{"text":"The DNC (and moreover, their oligarch handlers) would rather see the GOP control the country for the rest of the US's existence, than they would a single mildly-social-democratic politician as president for a single term.","title":"It always comes back to the DNC"},{"text":"How many second cousins do you have?

There are several black activists now, trying to educate people, but people don't want to listen.So what do you want?  \\nYou want us to read the books and do all the studying, and then give you the answers? Why? Let's look at who you are asking to educate you?  \\nAre you paying them for their time and effort? If not, why should they do it for free?   \\n  \\n**Why should we educate you when all the people who were actively trying to educate you were ignored?**The thing of world view.   \\nIf I know things that I think are so fundamental, and someone else is arguing the opposite, I don't even know where to start.

Moreover, decides to argue with me while lacking key information.   \\nThe time it takes to explain elementary concepts is ridiculous. And, it's been proven that trying to persuade people with facts does not work. People usually reject any data that goes against their worldview. So trying to educate others is usually futile.

Everytime I get into an argument with someone, I go back and do some digging. I usually find out that both of us were lacking in some information. But it also makes me angry because I'm always wondering if the person I was talking to was just ignorant or being disingenuous. and I usually land on disingenuous because I don't understand how someone can be so adamant about a position when it looks like they essentially lied to me. I'll be at work and just hear someone say something seemingly outlandish. I'll look it up later and find out what they're talking about isn't even true. When I see something that goes against my preconceived notions, and I really care about the issue. I will do a fact check. Use SIFT. I stop, evaluate the source, find better coverage and trace claims to the primary source.   \\nI do this as a way of life to keep myself sane.
