I actually think rejecting the false choice of two corrupted parties is the best thing to strengthen true democracy over the long term. So here are some alternative suggestions:1. Support Local and Independent Candidates: Start by engaging in local politics, where independent and third-party candidates often have a better chance of success. 2. Advocate for Electoral Reforms: Promote and support reforms that increase voter choice and representation. This includes advocating for ranked-choice voting, open primaries, proportional representation, and campaign finance reform. 3. Build and Support Civic Education: Encourage and participate in civic education initiatives that focus on democratic principles, critical thinking, and media literacy.4. Get Involved in Community Organizing: Grassroots movements and community organizing are powerful ways to build change from the ground up. 5. Hold Elected Officials Accountable: Engage regularly with elected officials and let them know that supporting policies contrary to values and/or democratic principles will cost them your support.6. Support Independent Journalism and Media: Quality, independent journalism is crucial. Start supporting independent media outlets and amplifying fact-based reporting to counteract the influence of biased or corporate media.7. Participate in Non-Partisan Civic Organizations: Join or support organizations dedicated to democratic reform, transparency, and human rights. 8. Encourage Dialogue and Bridge-Building: Actively seek to understand diverse perspectives and create spaces for dialogue with those across the political spectrum. 9. Promote Ethics and Accountability in Government: Advocate for stronger ethical standards for government officials, including transparency in financial dealings, limits on lobbying, and term limits for elected positions.","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"Yep, that effect is called \\"herding\\" where they trend towards a central response so as not to be the blatantly wrong outliers.","title":"Kamala Harris Slashes Donald Trump's Lead Among Men in Final Poll"},{"text":"I believe it hasn't been fixed yet, but we were able to cast our votes, and put them into a lock box to be scanned later.

But that obviously isn't possible and racism very much still existed and required us to remain vigilant.Because they weren't vigilant, they were first pulled in by less extreme rhetoric that pretended to appeal to the idea of being a common-sense moderate, which many Americans seem desperate to see themselves as.  The culture war boogeymen crafted by Fox News and right-wingers on social media (and then amplified by the algorithm) convinced them that the Dems were going further left.  As a result, they tried to stay central, but the actual reality is the right was going further right all that time and \\"staying central\\" was actually pulling them further right too.  They got slow-walked further and further right over time, and it is now after all that where we see them saying more overtly racist things.  I just don't think they started so overt.

These are the key pillars of Germany's denazification:* Legal accountability through the Nuremberg Trials and prosecution of Nazi leaders, establishing clear precedents about war crimes and consequences\\n* Complete overhaul of education system - new curriculum, textbooks, and emphasis on critical thinking and democratic values\\n* Constitutional reform establishing strong protections for human rights, press freedom, and decentralized power through federalism\\n* Economic reforms (currency reform, Marshall Plan) to create stability and give citizens a stake in democratic success\\n* Cultural process of \\"Vergangenheitsbew?ltigung\\" - actively confronting and coming to terms with the Nazi past through memorials, museums, and open discussion\\n* Development of strong civil society institutions and democratic culture, though this took generations to fully take root\\n* Integration into Western democratic institutions, providing external support and oversight for reforms  \\nSome don't apply as much to our situation, and some are spot on. But the critical takeaway is that even with all of the above, true change required generational change to happen. It literally took 20 years for the \\"old guard\\" mindset to transition out of power and the next generation to come in who truly believed in denazification rather than ignoring it or making excuses for it. I think that's what we're looking at here. But it is even more difficult to change, for example, the education system where it is run much more at the state and local level and the fascists have been very effective in getting their hooks into local school boards, for example.

I have good eyesight and was struggling to see as I filled out my ballot. There also did not appear to be bathrooms readily available to people while they waited or even once inside the voting area, which made me wonder how older folks and people who brought kids with them were handling that. They also were telling people in our long line that if they were not inside by the location's close (3 PM on weekdays during early voting), they would have to come back another time, which seems like pretty blatant voter suppression. I don't know if they have the same approach on Election Day (I sure hope not!), but we were pretty frustrated by that, given how incredibly long our line was - it kept growing as we stood there, too. Luckily, we were inside by 2:25 PM when we were there, so we got to vote after an hour or so of waiting outside in cold wind.

So...a rising tides lifts all boats is true in my view.Secondy, the right to abortion is an important issue because _a lot of women don't have it anymore_.  Your framing seems kinda absurd to me - that it's a state issue now is true.  It's also true that people in many states don't have that right.  That's dystopian for those who live in those states.  Having guns is not totally a normal thing and shouldn't be, but it's a right.  25% of women have had an abortion and it's reasonably consistent between righ/left political lines (arguably because a lot of republicans currently are pro-choice to some degree or another).  Secondly, you're more likely to be a victim of sexual violence and domestic violence, but less so of a violent crime (although much of male-on-male violence is contextualized within engagement in groups/activities with known violence).  You're more likely to be sexually harassed at work, experience unwanted sexual contact of various sorts.  I certainly don't feel like my wife has it \\"amazing\\" when she gets felt up once a week on public transit going to work or has someone on a bus jerking off just because she might look.  Those are _totally normal experiences_, but seem far from amazing.  Women also get left with children and no financial support from the father A LOT more than men lose custody, they carry more of the parental demand on average (lots of great movement in this area which makes this father very happy).  13% of women will end caring directly for an elderly parent, but 7% of men.  We lay the caretaking for family on women and men can take the \\"not my problem\\" approach they also seem able to take with children.  Of course there are lots of exceptions, but the differences here are real.  It's a mixed bag, but I think that while women have taken on more opportunity in education and work they have not redistributed the rest of what makes life run well at the family level - men have not taken up that work and responsibility proportionally (but things have indeed changed).","title":"CMV: American women have it amazing."},{"text":"Truth.

If one believes that parties are indeed in ideological/policy opposition within our two party system and truly wish to prevail over their opponent(which you seem to based on your OP),  then your lesser of two evils voting actually surrenders the biggest bargaining chip youve been afforded, the fundamental concept of democracy: if the person representing me does not adequately reflect my interests, they cannot win.

Anyone who understands how the branches of the government work and how laws are passed would know this isn't even a possibility. This is why they cheered on Biden doing unconstitutional executive orders that even pelosi said he can't do. They believe in a dictator model.","title":"Oprah says that if Trump wins, \\" we will never have the opportunity to cast a ballot again\\""},{"text":"Yeah fair enough, not like Im able to stop some of the stupid stuff that happens here.

So to me, its not about judging on a different standard, its about actually acknowledging historical events and the fact that culture is not an immutable characteristic and in developing countries it has more often than not been shaped heavily by colonialism.

We we where knocking on the door and ready to enact many policies that are still fought over today on the racism, police reform, women's rights, having a progressive supreme court majority ,etc fronts. It didn't lead to a single election cycle of arrested development on these fronts-- it led to a total shift in momentum and policy and conservative supreme court. There are also a lot of spooky similarities between those time periods and ours. There were supreme court potions that would be opening up soon, there were race riots and movements, there where counter movements for family values and law and order and xenophobia and earnest white supremacy. Hell the person running was the Vice President and he was strong armed into taking a pro war stance by the sitting president LBJ.If Trump wins, just like Nixon, he is going to double down on Israel. Just like Nixon he will probably come in and ignore his advisors' recommendations and say instead he wants to see a literal nuclear option to intimidate the Viet Cong into submission and peace. I watched some of the \\"Eyes on the Prize\\" PBS docu series in 2016 regarding the Humphrey. Unfortunately the 7 hours of episodes that cover 1967-1980s is not available for streaming broadcast but dvd copies exist at some libraries. Season 1 is on Netflix, max, pbs etcImo 1968 was a major fork in the road for America and we have seen what side won and the ramifications of that single election. The democratic and progressive base needs to stop being so dogmatic and eating it's own tail while the conservative base shows up on election day.","title":"CMV: those who don't vote because of a single issue (e.g. Gaza) don't care about any other issues"},{"text":"My parents are 70, not racist.","title":"Alarm grows over Trump and Musks blizzard of baseless voter-fraud claims"},{"text":"Honestly with how many insane meltdowns hes had it feels like hes trying to throw the election but I know hes just having a meltdown like a child","title":"'Disqualifying': Critics Torch Trump After Ugly Last-Minute Attack On Nancy Pelosi"},{"text":"What a wimp!

Please remember, the border is not only used by tourists or citizens of both Mexico and the United States, its used as a route to import items into the United States.Shutting down the border unexpectedly will harm the U.S economy, which can lead to a domino effect on to the people.If you dont want a repeat of COVID economic defects, you cannot shut the border down like that.","title":"Trump Promises Tariffs On All Products From Mexico Until It Curbs Flow Of Migrants Into U.S."},{"text":"May he rot In hell.","title":"Bernard Marcus, cofounder of The Home Depot and billionaire Republican megadonor, has died"},{"text":"Oh no.So whats everybody got to drink tonight?","title":"Bernard Marcus, cofounder of The Home Depot and billionaire Republican megadonor, has died"},{"text":"I think hes just implying they push pills on patients instead of promoting helpful natural remedies And anything else that advances human health and cant be patented by pharma","title":"RFK Jr is Ready to Run WILD in the Trump administration"},{"text":"Okay what a relief!

And genuinely, I want to educate you here. The establishment has planned this since his initial run in 2015. None of this has happened by accident. They CATAPULTED him into the nomination with incessant media coverage. Albeit often negative, the coverage made him appear as an outsider, an unexpected curve ball. This is the basis of his appeal with his base. Hes not like other politicians!The elite knew they had to cull an organic grassroots uprising of dissent, so to do this, they nip it in the bud by getting out in front of these sort of uprisings by placing their agents there first. A self made billionaire outsider who tells it like it is; perfect for the dumb fuck American public. Also, theyll make him an intentionally divisive and controversial figure, brand him as intolerant to that his entire base is characterized as that by design as well. You see how the foundation of this culture war we are in today is being formulated with this? Once the public trusts the controlled opposition candidate, they can steer that movement wherever they want, and they effectively absorb and neutralize the organic effectiveness of a grassroots uprising. But they attack him so much, clearly hes not in the big club! Au Contraire. You see, thats the exact reason why you trust Mr Trump in the first place.  Youre not dazzled with his articulate political points. Youre not moved by his compelling speeches. You simply see him seemingly being attacked by the establishment, and thats enough to establish street credibility for you that he is not in the club. Never mind his previous term where he continued the policies of the cabal (and didnt challenge them worth a fuck at All). Never mind his Rothschild connections via his Sec. of Comm, Wilbur Ross (banker who fixed his bankruptcy fuck up in the 90s).At the end of the day, you took the bait and embraced an obvious PLANT, and fell for the kayfabe because you let your unchecked hope and optimism override your skepticism. Childish behavior.Because of that, because you set your skepticism aside, we now have to deal with this fucking mess. A bunch of former skeptics who once viewed the left right paradigm as a mechanism of control and the electoral process as merely a charade to provide us with illusion of choice, are now chode deep into a psyop.

If we include the midterms, this is the fifth straight national election in which Trump and his MAGA movement have been the main character in our telenovela. Each time, they have consistently worked as hard as possible to communicate their hostility to liberal democracy and their intent to persecute their various real and imagined enemies. They have cleverly kept the American left and center-left in a state of near-constant terror, anxiety, and battle-readiness. Simultaneously, the movement has worn down the defenses of less politically minded people by relentlessly normalizing the new GOPs open racism and extremism.Its been a lot. And you can already see the seams of the endless, exhausting effort to push back starting to come apart. The truth is that the emotional and political toll of holding the line against Trumpism are not sustainable indefinitely. If Kamala Harris doesnt pull this thing out, Trump and his allies may very well be able to impose their bleak vision on an America whose will to resist has been depleted.  \\nFor more: [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/11/trump-kamala-harris-election-day-results-polls-resistance.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/11/trump-kamala-harris-election-day-results-polls-resistance.html)","title":"What It Will Take to Push Back Against Trump This Time\\n"},{"text":"It's in The [London] Times, so I was curious who wrote the article.

No cash bonds, catch and release laws, sanctuary cities, loopholes in the system and lack of serious consequences for offenders are what's ruining our great country.

I live in the US and have been to several battleground states. The enthusiasm gap between Trump and Harris this year is miles apart from the one in 2016 when people didn't like either candidate. There is gobs of confidence Harris can pull off the win, and very little that Trump can even from his own staffers.Joe Rogan isn't going to convince 10% of his followers to vote differently or even at all on election day, which I will remind you is today. Not going to happen. You know how many followers Taylor Swift has? 283 million. Know how many clicked a link to register to vote a day or so afterwards when she endorsed? Like 300k. That's not even a 1% conversion rate, and she is massively more influencial to her followers than Rogan is to the \\"I think independently\\" crowd that watch his podcast.I have apathy for Rogan myself. I think he gives platforms to bad/duplicitous actors and makes them sound credible (such as the aforementioned Jordan Peterson), but I don't personally hate him. But I know that people who are deep down the rabbit hole of Trump world don't see the rest clearly, and it's frankly sad. They think Rogan is the biggest influencer in the world, when he's not, or that this would sway the needle more than, you know, Trump actually being on the podcast, which he already did. Guess what the polls did after that? At best no change, and at worst they shifted a little to Harris. So I'll repeat again for those in the back who are hard of hearing. I have zero concern this endorsement sways the election.","title":"Joe Rogan endorses Trump on eve of the election"},{"text":"I kinda want a tattoo of that headline.Though I'll wait until after the winner is clear... don't want to fall afoul of Trumps ban on tattoos mocking him.","title":"For Trump, Its Either The White House Or The Big House"},{"text":"Reagan would be treated like Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney today","title":"Trump is no Ronald Reagan  we all need him to lose"},{"text":"Of course there is.

For another, they *always* target one or more groups from whom to take away rights in order to normalized taking away rights, like women, LGBTQ people, immigrants, people who aren't the fascists' preferred religion, etc. And they *always* talk about violence against their political enemies until they can get away with using actual violence. Therefore, I'm never surprised at what any fascist says. In fact, as a fascist, Trump is pretty boring. He has no flair, no charisma and certainly no statesmanship. He's a rude, crude, cringeworthy charicature of a politician who turns people off. He will only remain popular with the GOP until he gets them over the goal line by winning this election and establishing a Christo-fascist dictatorship. Then the GOP will oust him and replace him with a competent dictator who can reliably be counted on stick with their program instead of going off on tangents to enrich himself. If he fails to win this election, the GOP will probably work to replace him with a younger, more charismatic fascist over the next year. In other words, we should consider ourselves to be at war with fascism and not allow our democracy to be used by fascists to rise to power, take over and destroy democracy.","title":"Shock as Trump says putting Harris in the ring with Mike Tyson would be interesting"},{"text":"Okay so basically youre saying rigged if Kamala wins or not rigged if trump wins ??","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"Aka the reason this election is so close.","title":"Bernard Marcus, cofounder of The Home Depot and billionaire Republican megadonor, has died"},{"text":"Well there's a fing surprise.","title":"Trumps Most Loyal Fans Say Theyll Refuse to Accept a LossNo Matter What"},{"text":"Story of my life.

It means rules dont apply and you can do as you please.This seems obvious but its exactly it and isnt often discussed in this context.The fact is entirely too many grownups in America (and elsewhere) behave like entitled regressed children. It should never be lost on anyone that Republican voters have consistently been a ~90% white group, and there is a privilege aspect to why they feel so entitled to be so wrong and so arrogant.It should not be socially acceptable to behave like this. There should be social consequences for being so recklessly arrogant and wrong and voting like such an asshole.

Does Saudi Arabi commit human rights violations? Yes. Would it be worth it to invade, depose the government, waste human life, expend extensive funding, and more, only for it to potentially end up as a failed state? That's where the left says no.

Also running is Javier Jimnez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019.For decades, the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party would receive at least 90% of all votes, but that began to change in 2016, with newer parties attracting more voters amid economic and political turmoil.\\"That has been a very big change,\\" said Jorge Schmidt Nieto, a political analyst and university professor....On Tuesday, voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico's political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress.In addition, Puerto Ricans on Tuesday can support Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in a symbolic vote if they wish. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those on the island are not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections.Looking forward to the results of this election, even though it's overshadowed by the US presidential elections. Also, it's a continuing problem that those living in Puerto Rico still cannot vote in the presidential elections even though they are US citizens.","title":"Puerto Rico holds general election that promises to be historic"},{"text":"And if Trump wins they'll be appointed to a position?","title":"Trump staffer fired from Republican party for being a white supremacist"},{"text":"At one of his final rallies, Trump diehards say they know hell win.

Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.This is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?Internationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, \\"impolite\\" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.You also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.If I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.Tl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.","title":"Ron Perlman Says Donald Trump Is Fing Terrified of Kamala Harris and I Dont Think Its Going to Be Close on Election Day: Shes Fing Brilliant!"},{"text":"I hope Donald Trump and his cronies all see punishment for the damage they caused to the democratic process.

To quote his pinned summary:?The quality of construction lumber in America has declined since the last century. The reasons are many and complex, but much of it is due to the disappearance of old-growth forests and the increased reliance on tree farms with much younger trees. In the 1940s, most construction lumber was cut from trees that were decades old, today they may be as young as 9 years old. As a result, the 2x4s in the commons bin in a typical American lumberyard are cut from small, fast-growing trees, mostly \\"white wood\\" (SPF on the stamp, spruce, pine, fir).\\n?With younger trees being lumbered, many mills have relaxed grading standards.? The folks I have talked to who buy lumber from and for lumberyards consistently tell me that what we consider #2 grade lumber today (a common construction grade) would have been classified as #3 not long ago. Furthermore, boards are not graded for twists and bows. Carpenters are expected to \\"crown\\" the studs in a wall so the boards all bow in the same direction and the wall appears flat. The result is that even though the wood may be suitable for construction, the overall appearance of common 2x4s sucks dead toads.?\\n?And if the lumber's appearance is not bad enough, there are other problems you may encounter that are not so visible: ??Fast-growth wood is more likely to rot. ??Young trees have poor dimensional stability - they may even shrink lengthwise. ??The sugar in the sapwood may attract fungi and insects If the wood is dried quickly, it's more likely to develop checks, shakes, honeycomb, and other drying-related defects ? Young wood is more likely to have \\"reaction wood\\" that bows or warps as you cut it.\\n? But I did notice that the 2x12s that we used for the steps and stringers were of a much higher quality. Because they were wider, there were necessarily cut from bigger, older trees. They weren't perfectly clear, but there were fewer knots and defects than in the 2x4 stock, and the knots tended to be tighter. So we bought some 2x10s* and ripped our 2x4 railings from them - it worked wonderfully. *Why not 2x12s where you can get three 2x4s out of each? Because you have to use the middle board, and most of the defects, especially the pith, are closer to the middle than the edges. Furthermore, the outside boards tend toward quartersawn and riftsawn grain, which is a good deal more stable than the plainsawn middle.?\\n?As a bonus, the 2x10s were lumbered from Southern Yellow Pine (SYP on the stamp), a much stronger wood than the white wood 2x4s. If you want the numbers, the specific gravity of Ponderosa Pine (a common SPF) is just 0.38 on the average, compared to Southern Yellow Pine at 0.59, making SYP much denser and harder. Ponderosa Pine has a bending strength (modulus of rupture) of 1.29 Mpsi and a stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of 9,400 psi; while Southern Yellow Pine stands at 1.98 Mpsi and 14,500 psi respectively.??\\nThere is an important consideration you should be aware of, especially if you plan to use any of these woods in woodworking projects. Construction lumber is typically kiln-dried to just 19% moisture content. You will want to get that down below 10% before you can rely on the stability of the wood. At 19%, its still shrinking! This may mean air-drying the wood for 6 months to a year before you use it.

I have very strong pro-Palestinian views, including on the Gaza issue, but I still think you should vote. However, the strategy in mind is a long term one, not a short term one. The idea goes that, if the Democrats lose, and their loss can be attributed to the Palestinian issue, then next election, the Democrats will be forced to break on Israel and run someone either pro-Palestinian, or at least much less pro Israel. This is somewhat more realistic in than in the past - if Trump wins Michigan by a percentage lower than the Arab/Muslim population in Michigan, which is a possibility. Kamala winning by that margin would be helpful, but doesnt force the issue as much. Right now, on that particular issue, there isnt a meaningful choice - Republicans might be more pro-Israel overall, but the difference is still lip service: both parties administrations send Israel weapons, and dont put sufficient pressure on them to resolve the Palestinian issue. If you consider the game to and on Election Day, then you are correct. But its not a one election strategy, but an attempt to shift the Democrats in the long term so that the Israel position becomes contested instead of something both parties essentially agree on in practice. That being said - I still think Trump is far more damaging than Kamala. At least Kamala has pro-Palestinian people in the tent.","title":"CMV: those who don't vote because of a single issue (e.g. Gaza) don't care about any other issues"},{"text":"Get rid of toxic people, even if its family. ?","title":"My parents have threatened to disown me."},{"text":"Nobody consulted me on it, actually","title":"Alarm grows over Trump and Musks blizzard of baseless voter-fraud claims"},{"text":"I love women, especially when they go out to stand for their rights and save our democracy ??","title":"GOP Strategist's North Carolina Warning for Trump: 'Something's Going On'"},{"text":"Doesnt matter just get out and vote! ?","title":"Passed on to me from a reliable source, it's looking good for Trump"},{"text":"Rating and viewership have never been higher.. ??","title":"US politics has been a stage for decades and Trump is fucking up the whole show"},{"text":"","title":"Can you imagine today if we had Bernie in 2016"},{"text":"NC is a very purple state.

At the time there was a movement to dump Harrison and replace him with another candidate--the attempt resulted in a primary contest which resulted in him getting \\\\~500/900 delegates.Our situation echoes that one a bit; people are feeling nervous about the economy and a segment of the population thinks that doing a rematch to the prior president will fix things. Two notes about how this story ended:1) After Cleveland won, it didn't make a damn bit of difference and the economy crashed anyway. His administration got the blame. Probably same case here; the economy will do whatever it does regardless of who is in office, and this will affect the results of the 2028 election. In 1896 Cleveland's party lost, putting McKinley in office.2) Unlike Harrison, Biden did drop out when pressured to do so. This election will test if that is sufficient to placate people--it's never been tried like this before.","title":"Trump is hoping to win non-consecutive terms.

My intuition is Trump/Vance banking on the uneducated, young male voter, who historically have a low propensity for turning out, while pissing off women, minorities, among others, is a losing strategy. It could be a stroke of genius for the Harris campaign to put out ads/resources pointing out to married women especially that their vote is secret and their husband won't find out. My other intuition is people are just incredibly tired of Trump's bullshit and want to put it behind us.On the other side of the coin, my intuition also points to two key voters that could propel Trump to victory, besides the fired up Trump base: A) I still say there are far too many stupid people in this country who think presidents magically control gas/grocery prices, and that Trump will magically rein in prices (and again, these same voters will be crying 9-10 months from now after realizing Trump's doing jack shit). The problem is Biden ran up the tally with independents 54% to 41% in 2020, and I just don't know if Harris can get that from independents this time around. Certainly polls have NOT shown her doing that well with independents. At best, she might be like +5-7pts with them, but more likely this will break close to even between her and Trump. B) Sorry to say but the anti-Trans, moral panic stuff sells, and that's also a factor for moronic undecideds and independents.I also think the people/voter pissed off at Trump over Jan 6, and voting Harris instead Trump or Third Party, may be overstated. I just don't expect so many converts over to Harris. I hope I'm wrong.","title":"GOP Strategist's North Carolina Warning for Trump: 'Something's Going On'"},{"text":"Ya different carrot, same stick.

As a historian you should remember from 2016 and 2020 that the constant apocalyptic rhetoric is simply not that effective. When the opinion polls scream to you that voters are primarily concerned about the economy, that means they probably dont fully believe you when you say fascist and there isnt much you can do about it.Since the idea is to win, not convince people that youre correct, you need to be agile and pivot your messaging to address other issues like economic concerns as necessary. Its just as important to show why people should vote for your candidate on merit as it is to show why they should not vote for the opposing candidate. People seem to forget that.Keep strategy on the forefront. Showing everyone how morally upstanding you are by complaining about fascism nonstop is not a solution-focused mindset.

The Republican Party won the presidency in 2016 because Trump brought a lot of new (weird) voters out of the woodwork, and the rest of the party fell in line behind him. In 2020, Trump lost some of the Republicans who previously fell in line and Biden won the election. Trump will likely lose even more traditional Republicans this time. If Republicans run a Romney-style candidate in 2028, I'm sure most of the party will fall in line behind him or her, but will the weirdos that Trump attracted still vote (R)? I'm not convinced of that at all, and I think they're the only thing keeping the party competitive in a national election. If the Republican Party wants to win nationally, it's probably stuck with some form of Trumpism, and the normal Republicans will have to fall in linebut I don't see that happening, either.

In the most recent debates the issue is entirely about protecting human rights, not about picking sides in a religious confrontation. Finally, the last aspect that shapes this narrative, is that progressives in the US are often dismissive of criticism of Muslim nations. This entirely depends on context, but most often where this occurs is when the Muslim nations are brought up as a form of whataboutism or as a deflection from discussion of the religious right in the US. You clean up your own house before you worry about your neighbor. In the appropriate context, when not used as a deflection, most progressives are critical of sharia law and the hyper conservative misogynistic nature of Islamic culture.

This is a support of those countries and their choices, which indirectly supports the elements in power in those Non-Western states. In some cases, like Iran, this results in an indirect (and perhaps unintentional) support for traditionalist reactionaries and in other cases, like PR China, this results in an indirect support for entrenched social revolutionaries who actually have Leftist ideals. However, the Leftist is not supporting the particular result of any power structure in a Non-Western state; they are supporting localized self-empowerment. It could be traditional, non-traditional, or explicitly anti-traditional.The problems I would argue with the Left is that they fail to recognize that their support of the elements of power in Non-Western states, especially those operating either without Western assistance or in direct defiance of Western demands, are (1) that this often leads to a support of autocracies that violate the very rights that the Left argues are critical in their homelands (freedoms of expression, rights to vote, gender/ethnic/religious equality, etc.) and (2) it fundamentally ignores that many Non-Western countries, by their own agency, have decided to align with the West because of the governance and economy that the West can offer and assert that these relationships are imposed by the West rather than freely chosen.All of this said, I agree with OP's claim that any form of traditionalism can be criticized. The Left will condemn any traditionalism that is similarly condemned by the government of the relevant Non-Western state. For example, PR China's government openly rejects the sexism of the Qing and Guomindang periods (a violation of traditionalism) and the Left agrees with PR China that such sexism in China would be immoral; however, the agreement is conditioned on PR China making this assertion. The Left will only avoid criticizing traditionalism if the Non-Western state has a traditional entity in power as a method of indirect support for that entity.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Very few republicans today are old enough to remember what the party was like before Nixon, this is how its been their entire lives.","title":"Former Georgia lt. governor: Republicans could start hemorrhaging to Democrats if Trump wins"},{"text":"This is true, but if I'm talking to someone who loves Reagan, I'm going to draw contrast between him and Trump to explain how much of a shit bag Trump is.\\nReagan was bad, but Trump is several orders of magnitude worse.

And, if I lived in Hamtramck, that would have been the position I would have advocated for, like I have in the town where I do live. They were flying a flag that had a subtly Christian message.

I agree that AIPAC and the Israeli lobby is a massive problem in American politics. It's absolutely corrupted both parties, to the point where the US Govt is supporting and facilitating a genocide. So my question is, why would anyone support a political party that is beholden to a foreign power in this way, to the point where they become complicit in a genocide? If you vote for either Trump or Harris, you are actually helping entrench a deeply corrupt system. You're now part of the problem because by giving them your vote, it's your way of saying, \\"no matter what you do, you'll still get my vote because i think the other guys are worse\\". It entrenches a system where people in government aren't accountable for their actions. And that decision actually emboldens BOTH parties to become more extreme and more polarising. If both parties know they get votes based on deep polarisation, no matter what they do, they become incentivised to divide people. And AIPAC has cleverly understood that. They fund both sides and they also influence the media landscape, which also profits from extreme polarization. In this situation, it then becomes in the Democrats benefit (and AIPAC'S) that you have an extreme character like Trump. Because Trump makes it much easier for the Democratic Party to support and fund a genocide AND still get good people to vote for them. That's the system AIPAC has helped create. The more polarised people are, AIPAC wins. The Muslim travel ban and the immigration issue in general helps both parties as they can sell these extreme issues to their base.  But it's not just AIPAC, this pretty much applies also to the biggest corporate donors. So by participating in this increasing polarised system, it actually perpetuates a continuing corruption of democracy. It's a race to the bottom.","title":"This is going to be a no win election"},{"text":"I don't think Rs will have a normal candidate in 2028 if Trump loses.

Third, [Allan Lichtman](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/allan-lichtman-election-win/680258/) has called for Harris. He's called 9 out the last 10 elections correctly and has called for Harris. The one he missed was gore v bush. Its important because it shows his method may not be good for close races. On the other hand, he has a 90% success rate.In any case, i think they're positive signs but very thin to bet against Billionaires, organized evangelical extremists and a massive team that will do anything to install a would be authoritarian fascist.","title":"Whining about 'rigging' won't work for Trump.
