Most of these are usually some form of identity politics and what you find is that avoiding that divide means you avoid division of workers.  That can usually get you out of culture wars which are usually factional battles in some form. The key one is a division of the ruling class such as rich and ultra rich for example. Millionaires vs billionaires or factory owners versus old money tied to Britain and empire. Thus,  if you're trying to divide the masses,  you use divisions of labor. But if you want solidarity,  focus on divisions of the ruling class.","title":"Fear lots, for behold, I bring you sad tidings of great ploy, which shall be to all people: The Uniparty"},{"text":"I can't believe Olivia Troye was who was behind my high egg prices!!","title":"Trumps FBI Pick Kash Patel Officially Begins Crusade Against Enemies | Kash Patel is launching his crackdown on the long list of people he considers political enemies."},{"text":"Yes, there was so much of this in 2016-17.

But also, combine those business closures with the supply chain disruptions that lead to pretty fierce inflation at the start of Biden's term--there was actually *deflation* for a few months in '09.","title":"Donald Trump is ready to make Republicans touch the third rail Without a voting public to face again, Trump is gearing up to cut Social Security and Medicare"},{"text":"The party of unfettered hypocrisy, they should be called.","title":"Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument in United States v.

I'm not saying you shouldn't believe Sherk, and I'm not saying you need to prove anything to me, I'm saying you should hold him to the same high standard of evidence you would presumably hold anyone else to and not give him leeway just because you like what he says. I didn't actually make any claims that would run counter to his, so not sure why you felt the need to ask yourself \\"Hm, who to believe here?\\". If anything, I believe that kind of intransigence and insubordination *did* happen in Trump's administration, but I can't trust this report to provide an accurate assessment of that and this report did not provide a high standard of evidence that I could rely on in lieu of that trust.You believe that government employees blocking the executive office's orders is a good thing, you've made that very clear. Well guess what? They deserve to be fired, and the executive branch has plenty of authority to do so.Guess what? I disagree that they deserve to be fired if they had a good reason for doing so. If the DoE deep state opposes a Trump initiative to fund charter schools, they may *or may not* have a good reason to do so. If the HHS deep state opposes a Trump health initiative, they may *or may not* have a good reason to do so. Good policy doesn't come from loyalty. Sometimes it comes from disagreement. Sometimes it comes from firmly planted feet e.g. thalidomide never receiving FDA approval. Public servants and experts need to serve a higher purpose than the whims of the current president. If anything, the president should take heed from *them* on how to implement *his* agenda. He should work *with* them to determine what would be best for the nation.

Such measures risk disrupting the essential flow of these resources, undermining the competitiveness of North American industries, and exacerbating vulnerabilities in critical mineral supply chains that both nations are working to address.More than half of Canadas mineral exports  valued at more than C$80 billion ($56.9 billion)  were destined for the US in 2022, according to the Canadian group. Its members include Barrick Gold Corp., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Cameco Corp., BHP Group and others.?Meanwhile, Vancouver-based metals producer Teck Resources Ltd., one of the worlds largest integrated germanium producers, said its looking at ways to boost its output of the metal in the wake of Chinas export ban.?Germaniums uses include fiber optics, night-vision goggles and space exploration.

We shouldn't waste time fighting the last battle, we should focus on fighting the next one: Trump's disastrous second term. Republicans are very good at shaping the narrative as it forms; relentlessly pushing it in every conversation, molding it like wet clay to suit their needs. But we can do that too. And unlike them, we don't even have to lie. Every single mistake Trump makes, pounce on it. Every time you see something that reflects poorly from Trump, shout it from the rooftops.

The French Constitution (currently) says that elections cannot be called for a full year following the most recent election, except in the circumstance where a President steps down or passes away. So, as long as Macron remains in office (his term doesn't expire until 2027), the parliamentary elections cannot be 'redone' until Summer 2025 at the earliest.2. You may or may not be correct. Macron's center-right party has been losing power, but part of why the far-right doesn't control parliament outright at the moment is that the left coalition and the left members of Macron's Ensemble worked together to only run one of them in certain districts so that La Pen's party couldn't win seats with 40% of the total vote -- Macron was explicitly against this.Whatever the outcome of the next election, it will not be better for Macron than the last ones. The big question is what the slow death of Ensemble means for the left and right parties; Do the more center-left members work with the left coalition again? Do some of them swap parties outright? After a year of absolute chaos, how many of the center-right members of Ensemble lose their seats to the far right as their voters get annoyed at the gridlock? The same question of the center-left members of Ensemble.Who do the French people blame for all this? Ensemble, certainly, because this mess is squarely at Macron's feet -- But what that means to the voters in each district come next summer (or Macron's resignation) is harder to say.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 4, 2024"},{"text":"Yahtzee!","title":"Why do you need a pardon if the justice system is above reproach?"},{"text":"Anyone else see the Ottawa ad blitz:For generations, this ally to the North has been by your side: Ontario, Canada, a partner connected by shared history, shared values and a shared vision for what we can achieve together, a narrator is heard saying over video of Ontario landmarks, archival footage, and border crossings. and wonder which Ontario this comes out of?  &lt;https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ally-to-the-north-ontario-launches-u-s-ad-campaign-amid-trump-s-tariff-threat-1.7130176I.e., both Kathy Reichs and Margaret Atwood have nothing good to say of their southern neighbor and while the series Bones mightve done well, KR took her loonies and stayed out of DC . :P","title":"FIRST READING: Why the Americans would never, ever let Canada become a state.

All this (along with continuing to borrow against the incoming cash) leaves the system insolvable as it now stands.

Mr. Trump defeated  Ms. Harris because Mr. Biden (who is a different person than Ms. Harris) didn't defend the American soul for doing something legal, yet ethically questionable.Meanwhile Mr. Trump who embodies the American soul, has so many charges and allagations against him and has done outright illegal, immoral, and unethical things to the point where we can no longer count them.Mr.Trump is clearly a better canditate than Ms. Harris because a superior  in her vicinity did something  ethically questionable, but legal.Yeah that makes sense.... I understand now why Mr. Trump won. It sounds like a real vivtory.  You wouldn't want someone who was a subornate of someone who did a legally but ethically questionable thing once to be in charge...

Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room C with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process.\\" Reason 2, the case was unduly influenced by political actor for political gain.\\"Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunters cases.\\" Reason 3, the punishment was not going to fit the crime.  \\n  \\nActually, an argument could be made that someone in Hunter Biden's shoes would have been more likely to have been pardoned sooner upon petition to the president had they NOT been related to him.

Joe Biden has been bashed for four years by anyone who has an audience for being old, out of touch, favoring this group or that group, being too much this or that, etc. The reality is that he did bring a certain amount of ratonality and decency to government after four years of Trump, and leaving us an economy that is the envy of the entire world after the disarray that followed the pandemic.Now he is going to leave office toa bunch of lunatics who have sworn to use the DOJ as a retribution weapon. Hunter is no prize, but no one can rationally say that his prosecution was not politically motivated. I think the number of people who were found guilty of the same crimes and actuually faced prison time is a very small universe. Hunter has had, and would continue to have, a target on his back.So Joe Biden is, after having been unmercifully bashed by selfish commentators such as he has, supposed to turn away knowing that his son would likely spend jail time for crimes most people don't?

Don't y'all ever feel pathetic?Edit: here is finding from the investigationThe divisions investigations found the following:Bauer Food LLC, a Louisville-based operator of 10 McDonalds locations, employed 24 minors under age 16 to work more than legally permitted hours. These children sometimes worked more hours a day or week than the law permits, whether or not school is in session. Investigators also determined two 10-year-old children were employed C but not paid C and sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m. Below the minimum age for employment, they prepared and distributed food orders, cleaned the store, worked at the drive-thru window and operated a register. The division also learned that one of the two children was allowed to operate a deep fryer, a prohibited task for workers under 16 years old. The division assessed $39,711 in civil money penalties to address the child labor violations.\\nArchways Richwood LLC C a Walton-based operator of 27 McDonalds locations C allowed 242 minors between age 14 and 15 to work beyond the allowable hours. Most worked earlier or later in the day than the law permits and more than three hours on school days. The division assessed the employer with $143,566 in civil money penalties for their violations.\\nBell Restaurant Group I LLC is a Louisville-based operator of four McDonalds locations and part of Brdancat Management Inc., a larger enterprise that includes Jesse Bell I, Jesse Bell V and Bell Restaurant Group II, which operates an additional 20 locations in Maryland, Indiana and Kentucky. The division found the employer allowed 39 workers C ages 14 and 15 C to work outside of and for more hours than the law permits. Some of these children worked more than the daily and weekly limits during school days and school weeks, and the employer allowed two of them to work during school hours. To address the child labor violations, the division assessed the employer $29,267 in civil money penalties. Investigators also found the employer systemically failed to pay workers overtime wages they were due and as a result, the division recovered $14,730 in back wages and liquidated damages for 58 workers.[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/mcdonalds-franchises-fined-for-child-labor-violations-in-labor-department-crackdown](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/mcdonalds-franchises-fined-for-child-labor-violations-in-labor-department-crackdown)","title":"Republicans are ok with child labor."},{"text":"Based.

I think its a semi-fumble but it wont affect him in the polls. This was an extremely good week for the PM that started off shaky.Initially it looked like the government was very unprepared for broad strokes tariffs (and it may not have had a plan). The PM already has a reputation for being a bit weaker on Foreign Policy and the Trudeau-Trump relationship ended poorly the last term. Trudeau criticized Trump after the latter left a summit and was caught mocking him off camera, and Trump called Trudeau two-faced.?Then what happened over the past weekend unfolded. The PM getting a phone call with Trump was great. Getting a face-to-face, sitting down with his table for 3 hours at a semi-private Thanksgiving weekend dinner? Unbelievable win. The embassies in DC have apparently been going haywire with the Canadian Ambassador, asking how the hell we pulled that off. Diplomats are waiting months for a chance to meet with Trump and then our PM makes a phone call, asks to meet in person, and gets invited down for dinner a couple of days later.?If that wasnt good enough, by all accounts it was a very friendly and cordial evening between the PM and Trump. Dominic LeBlanc seemed genuinely floored at how well they were getting along. They got to have serious talks on the tariffs, but also swapped jokes throughout the night.Trudeau got to remind everybody that hes the PM and came off competent and capable of dealing with Donald Trump. Theres nothing Poilievre could really effectively call him out on over this that is going to change that.**That said.**?The PM has effectively undermined his partys ongoing political strategy of comparing Trump to Poilievre in a critical manner. As Lisa Raitt put it, he literally broke bread with Trump. Thats out the window.?This is also happening amidst the backdrop of the GST Holiday/cheques policy. The latest Leger numbers came out and theyre **terrible** on it. 7 in 10 polled just viewed it as a bribe to buy votes while only 1 in 5 thinks its genuinely good policy. About 80% believe it should be extended to seniors, which the government has refused to do. **22% say it made them less likely to vote Liberal,** compared to 8% saying it made them more likely. 50% said it wouldnt change their consumer behaviour, which was the basis of this policy to tackle the Vibesession.?Even worse than all of this for the Liberals, and an enormous boom for the CPC: the carbon tax. Poilievre hasnt stopped critiquing the government with requests to remove the carbon tax instead of the GST Holiday and has used the same attack line concerning the Trump tariffs.**50%** polled want to see the government give a holiday on the carbon tax **instead of the GST holiday.** That is compared to 28% who would prefer the GST holiday.?And to cap it all off, Leger has the CPC at 43 (+1), the LPC at 21 (-4), and NDP at 19(+4).?338s projections from December 1st have CPC 229 (+5), LPC 51 (-5), BQ 42 (-1) and NDP 19 (+1).So a very strong week for Trudeau on the US relations file, little to no room for Poilievre to critique him on this without looking like an ass. But in the end it doesnt matter politically because the government is getting killed on its GST Holiday/Cheques policy.?","title":"Poilievre fumbles the Trump crisis: a missed opportunity to show himself as a prime minister-in-waiting"},{"text":"Thats the worst case scenario.","title":"Trump considers DeSantis to replace Hegseth as Defense Secretary nominee"},{"text":"Opinions on that clown are already set in stone, ain't nobody changing their mind whether they're in favor or against him.","title":"Fulton DA Fani Willis Given Hard Deadline to Hand Over Trump Election Interference Documents"},{"text":"This is a repeat of 2016 all over again where Republicans had the House , the Senate and the Presidency and they still managed to look like one legged men at an ass kicking contest .","title":"House Republicans Are in Danger of Chaos as Last Race Called | Democrats managed to flip a key House seat."},{"text":"Maybe.

My gay uncle got to questioning me one night about politics, and I had TDS. My uncle supported Trump, and I just remember saying, \\"Trump is sexist! He's a racist! How are you gay and vote for him!\\"\\nI think it was about 3 months after that conversation he died. I questioned the way I talked to him and carried so much guilt. I had just lost my mom less than a year before him and started questioning the way I reacted. About 6 months after l met my current boyfriend, we talked day and night for months. One night, he told me he had a \\"confession\\" to make. This was in 2018, and Trump supporters were NOT treated well if they were known. Anyways, his confession was that he voted for Trump and understood if I didn't want to talk to him anymore. Honestly, I didn't give a fuck. I wasn't going to lose someone again over (what my reasoning was) politics.\\nFast forward a year, we started debating each other. Now, just because I didn't give up on us over politics, it doesn't mean it was easy! We did start debating, and i refused to bring our political views up unless it actually meant something to me! I remember my first revelation being about the \\"Luxury Tax.\\" &lt;- IYKYK \\nI literally looked it up to win this debate, and it wasn't what I thought it was!! Just know, this isn't the first time he won a debate. This was my revelation. After that, I started doing research since what I was taught was a bold faced lie. I forreal sat at my computer day and night researching everything I was told. Like I'm not kidding you! Every talking point I have heard, Trump speeches, the history of Marxism, everything! I barely talked to my boyfriend until about day 4. I cannot describe to you what happened to me without it sounding crazy. I was literally brainwashed all my life by democrats, and I felt like I had just the biggest scare of my life. All I can really say is, I was lied to. The world didn't feel real. My vision did something for about 30min after this 4 days. You know those Chuck e cheese pictures you can take? My vision did that, but in color. After that I was changed. I ranted to him about everything I learned, I was pissed.\\nThe point of my story has and always will be, is they have to actually do some research. And sadly, I wouldn't have made it 7 years with my current boyfriend if I hadn't loved him so much. I apologized for being so angry at him for ME being wrong after debates before the luxury tax one.","title":"My best friend has been brainwashed!"},{"text":"Jesus, even teenagers know not use mommy for a character reference.","title":"Trump Defense Nominee Asks Mom to Call Senators for Him in Effort to Land Job: Report"},{"text":"100%, it's a slam dunk.

I wish there were clear rules preventing the president pardoning himself or their family members. And you're right, he did it because it's his son.That said, I don't know if I would say it is the highest form of corruption. The pardon doesn't personally benefit Joe. It is not a quid quo pro. It does not hurt America's interests. It is nepotism, and perhaps a misuse of power, but it isn't really corruption in that sense. Certainly not in the sense of selling a pardon or exchanging them for criminal favors. I can accept that the Biden pardon is problematic, but it is 1 pardon compared to the dozens of corrupt pardons that Trump has handed out and likely will continue to hand out. It's fair to be critical of Biden, but it's not fair to blow it out of proportion in the context of more serious corruption issues.That said, there are definitely some mitigating factors. I think if Biden had no interest in the rule of law, he could have just pardoned his son from the beginning. Instead, he let the justice system independently investigate and charge him...even though Biden is the head of the justice department and could have directed them to quietly drop the case from the beginning. So this whole time Joe has been extremely careful about maintaining an appearance of impartiality and fairness...certainly more so than many others would have. So why undo all of that now?The purpose of the pardon power is to be a final guardrail against injustice. If we were to give Joe the benefit of the doubt, then we should take his word that he did this because he felt that there was an injustice. And by most reasonable standards, he is right. Hunter was politically targeted, no doubt. He was criminally charged for crimes that are not normally charged. His accepted a plea deal which was revoked (also highly unusual). He paid his back taxes. Yet still the justice system is throwing the book at him.Finally, Joe lost the election and the political enemies who have been relentlessly pursuing Hunter for more than 4 years will have complete control of the justice department. The president is so afraid for the treatment of his son by the next administration that he would make such an extreme and unpopular decision, risking his legacy and his reputation, to protect his son. What does that say about the state of our country?If Harris had won the election, I think it would be very unlikely that he would feel a need to pardon his son. Either way he would be a lame duck president, but at least he could have some guarantee that the legal guardrails were still in place.At the end of the day, while I'm disappointed, I'm not really worried too much about it. I'm certainly not worried about what Republicans think, because if someone voted for Trump then they clearly do not actually think that nepotism or corruption or abuse of power is that big of a deal and their complaints of Biden are in bad faith.[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/)","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"To be fair, he definitely wasn't sober","title":"Old Clip Of Pete Hegseth Slamming Trump As 'All Bluster' ResurfacesAnd Now It's Awkward"},{"text":"Half of Trump voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania want Medicare expanded and billionaires to pay more taxes.That's the problem with using issue polling as a proxy for voting behavior.

I dont support Russia but people seem to forget that war is making our lawmakers and war industry rich, its sad that they dont give a damn on who wins. People dont realize this and pretend to hate on military industrial complex but supplying weapons to Ukraine boosts demand for arms production, benefiting defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman. These companies often see stock price increases when there is sustained military conflict or high levels of aid. These people dont give a damn who wins the war, as long as theres war, they profit of that because congress immediately want to increase weapons production in every opportunity. Large military aid packages often translate into contracts for U.S. defense companies to replenish stockpiles or supply new weapons.Dont even get me started how politicians who own millions of defense stocks. Insider trading laws apply, legal gray areas exist around lawmakers using privileged information for personal financial gain. These people are bought off by defense CEOs and are lobbied by the defense industry for further preferential treatment and tax protections.","title":"Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave.

I don't believe we should have a different standard of justice for the rich and powerful. I thought that was an ideal of the Democratic party? I thought it was one of our main criticisms of Trump? He didn't abuse it. He literally used it. In no way is he doing anything that is antithetical to the constitution, again.. partly because it's the constitution itself that permits the action.Agree to disagree. In using the pardon power to pardon his son, after promising more than once not to do so, he abused it. It's a stain on his already lackluster presidency in my opinion and it's the sort of cynical action that fuels Trump's nihilistic narrative. The Constitution permits it. I never said President Biden did anything illegal in pardoning his son, I said it was an abuse of the privilege and deeply unethical. This is untenable moralistic nonsense... the country does't need hunter biden to go to jail. It changes absolutely nothing if he does or not, it's no country defining injustice that he doesn't. Claiming that using a pardon on friend or family member makes you unfit for office is likewise nonsense.I see you complain about \\"whataboutism\\" in a country where we have two viable options. The other option pardoned his cronies over and over and over again. Nearly every crime they committed was done away with.So what's so bad about Trump? When he pardoned Paul Manafort, what's the big deal? When he blackmailed Ukraine for dirt on Biden, who cares? Just moralistic nonsense, right? Go ahead and name me some ethically morally ritcheous presidentsNobody's perfect (obviously), but Lincoln wouldn't have done this. To use a more recent example, Obama wouldn't have done this.

The founding fathers included the presidential pardon as part of the checks and balances on the judiciary. The overall point of the pardon is to allow for a President to be able undo a perceived wrong. Either an unjust punishment, a prosecutorial error or even a change in the social fabric of the country that renders old punishments unjust. For this instance, it is argued by Pres Biden that the prosecution of Hunter Biden is a judicial overstep. The claim is that Hunter's prosecution is for more draconian than others with similar crimes and that if he wasn't the President's son, none of this would be happening and it would be a simple civil case. If this is the case, then Hunter would be a prime candidate for a pardon. His relationship to the President does complicate things, but since it's his relationship that caused the prosecution in the first place, it's an unavoidable situation, but not a corrupt one.It really comes down to whether one believes that Hunter's prosecution is just or not. If it is not just, and is a ploy to get at the President by the other political side, then there is no corruption in this pardon.","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"Here we fucking go again.","title":"Dr. Peter Hotez: We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st  Names Nearly a Dozen Viruses  All thats going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump Administration..."},{"text":"Dems arent the ones who rally around convicted felons and rapists.

It had taken the following three weeks to nail it down. The days leading up to it had been filled with intense preparation. Once in the meeting the Prime Minister and his officials made a determined effort to impress upon Mr. Trump that the Canadian border was not the porous menace he believed, but also advising him of the measures they were putting in place to secure it: drones, helicopters, personnel, the works.And what did they receive in return? Bupkis. No assurance of any kind with regard to the 25-per-cent tariff Mr. Trump has been threatening, since that supper-hour social media post, to impose. No indication of what measures, if any, would induce him to change his mind. Just a volley of complaints about how Canada was ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100-billion by which he apparently meant the U.S. trade deficit with Canada (its nowhere near that large but never mind).[...]A few things should be clear from this exchange, if they were not before. It never was about the border. Nothing we do about the border C not that there is much that can be done C is likely to avert the tariff that is coming our way. Mr. Trump cooked up the border crisis solely to provide himself with a legal and political pretext to do, on national security grounds, what he was going to do anyway.He is going to do it because he believes in tariffs C because he sees trade, as he sees life, solely in terms of winners and losers; because he understands a trade deficit, not as, essentially, an accounting identity, the flip side of a capital surplus, but as an indication that one country is winning and another is losing; because, most of all, every economist regards tariffs as an abomination, and because the closest thing Mr. Trump has to a code is always to do the opposite of whatever expert opinion recommends.So we can turn ourselves inside out on the border to please him. Mr. Trump may even seem to entertain our efforts for a time. This will produce in him another frisson, when at length he decides to impose them anyway: not only for the pleasure the tariffs themselves will bring, but the pleasure of crushing and humiliating Justin Trudeau.Even so, it is hard to fault the Prime Minister for trying. It is easy to say that the effort was doomed, even foolish; that Mr. Trump does not operate by any of the normal rules C of human behaviour, let alone international diplomacy; that efforts to appease him only offer him an opportunity to do what he likes best, to dominate.But to many people the Prime Minister will nevertheless have looked practical, reasonable, adult, in all, prime ministerial. It is not a given that Mr. Trumps bullying will be to Mr. Trudeaus disadvantage, politically. Mr. Trumps unreasonableness is well known. If Mr. Trudeau is seen to have gone the extra mile, or 1,300, to deal with him; if he then is forced to take retaliatory measures, painful as they may be, the public may conclude that he has made the best of a bad hand.[...]Where does this leave Mr. Trudeaus primary domestic antagonist, Pierre Poilievre? In the wake of the Trump tariff threat the Conservative Leader has looked jittery, uncertain, off-key. I think he senses the political danger. He knows, I think, that if there is one issue that can let Mr. Trudeau up off the mat, however implausible it may seem at the moment, it is this.If Mr. Trudeaus appearance with Mr. Trump struck you as cringeworthy, try to imagine how Mr. Poilievre would look next to him. Would he look like C behave like C a prime minister? Would he conduct himself with the dignity and the self-confidence that the job requires, knowing when to speak up and when to stay silent, when to show his hand and when to keep his cards in reserve?Or would he look boyish, callow, too eager to impress; talk too much, give away too much, signal insecurity throughout? Its difficult to say, of course. All one can do C all the public can do C is draw inferences from what we already know of Mr. Poilievres character and judgment, extrapolating from his comportment to date to predict how he will behave in future.And what we have seen of him to date has been, not a future prime minister, but a perpetual opposition critic, someone who is seemingly incapable of taking the high road, who never misses the opportunity for a partisan cheap shot, who is always, always in attack mode, no matter the issue, the setting or the situation.Certainly there is plenty to criticize in this government, and this Prime Minister. They have mishandled the economy, undermined public finances, ignored rising threats to national security, bollixed immigration, inflamed the housing market, and much else besides, all wrapped in a peculiarly divisive and doctrinaire form of identity politics.[...]Mr. Poilievres often incisive criticisms and relentlessly on-message performance have no doubt contributed to the governments fall from grace. But there is a time and a place for everything, and if ever there were a time and a place for a change of tone, this would be it.The Conservative Leaders many and justified complaints about this government would be, if anything, more persuasive, not less, if in the current crisis he were able to say something like: Whatever our differences, the Prime Minister has my full support as he defends Canadas interests against Mr. Trumps unprovoked attacks. The national interest must always come before any particular political interest.Nothing in that formula would prevent him from presenting constructive criticism of the governments approach, or indeed framing his support as support for his own preferred approach to the question. But the grace note would attract attention, not least in someone who so rarely displays it. It would mark him as someone with the ability to sense the public mood, to offer the strength and calm they are looking for in a crisis C in a word, to lead.Instead Mr. Poilievre has, from the day the tariff threat was issued, sounded almost hysterically harsh. At times he has seemed to take Mr. Trumps side in the controversy, even appearing behind a podium with the slogan Fix The Broken Border.His rhetoric, too, has sounded vaguely  Trumpian. The Prime Minister, he said, has vacated the border and turned it open to anyone who wants to come in. He is weak, weakened, unbearably weak. He has lost control of everything. And this flourish: with our border in chaos, our economy collapsing and everything broken, we need real, responsible leadership from a strong, smart prime minister who has the brains and backbone to put Canada first.Canada First, you say. Yup. The phrase, which I have not heard him utter before the last week or so, has cropped up repeatedly. We need a plan  to put Canada first on the economy and on security. I only care about Canada. I want to put our country first. And so on.Im not sure what he thinks he is accomplishing with this. Perhaps he worries that the Prime Minister will get a lift out of the crisis, a rally-round-the-flag effect often seen in public polling. Perhaps he is afraid that sections of his base, many of them vocal on social media, are inclined to side with Mr. Trump, especially on border issues, and might stray into the Peoples Party fold. Maybe he is betting the public believes Canada will be treated better with someone more in sync with Mr. Trump in charge.Or maybe its just that thats the only gear hes got. Mr. Poilievre is already unusual in a political leader for being his own attack dog, a task generally assigned to talented thugs and burner MPs. Until now I had been inclined to assume this was strategy of some kind, a matter of zigging while others are zagging.But it may be that Mr. Poilievre is genuinely unable to strike any other note C that his experience and personality permits no other. We shall see. Maybe he will surprise us yet. But it is hard to escape the feeling that the Trump question has become the dominant issue in Canadian politics, and may decide the election.!ping Can","title":"Poilievre fumbles the Trump crisis: a missed opportunity to show himself as a prime minister-in-waiting"},{"text":"Her district has all of north country in it, those people are hardcore self-reliant types and the region at large is very very conservative.Whoever her successor is will win because they have R next to their name.","title":"House Republicans Are in Danger of Chaos as Last Race Called | Democrats managed to flip a key House seat."},{"text":"The media has the power to fuck with this thin skinned loser on so many levels if they only had the balls to actually do something for the country.","title":"Now There's Resurfaced Video Of Pete Hegseth Completely Trashing Trump"},{"text":"Ah, the old ad hominem gimmick.

Yes, in so far as they give effective sanction for and deny fair accountability for serious misdeeds, or extend a level of forgiveness for offences that the president would not be inclined to people who they don't know. Though, in a legal sense, presidents are within their legal power to grant pardons. The constitution establishes that presidents may grant pardons and commutations for federal crimes. This power was established in the constitution based on a recognition that laws, while fair in general applications, may not always be fair in every particular application of individual cases. With this power, presidents may be able to pardon or commute the sentences of individuals they see as being unfairly or excessively punished. The effect of such pardons only extends to federal crimes that they have been pardoned for. The person may still be prosecuted, tried, convicted, and serve sentences for crimes under state and local laws.

Jerry Nadler has dropped out of the race for ranking member on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, according a Dear Colleague letter sent Wednesday. The decision comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) launched his bid to unseat Nadler as the panel's top Democrat. \\"As our country faces the return of Donald Trump, and the renewed threats to our democracy and our way of life that he represents, I am very confident that Jamie would ably lead the Judiciary Committee as we confront this growing danger,\\" Nadler wrote, endorsing Raskin as his replacement. \\"Although I will not be Ranking Member, I will still be an active member of the Committee, and I am eager to work alongside its new leadership in the battle to protect our most vulnerable communities and our most precious democratic ideals,\\" the New York Democrat added. Nadlers news comes after Rep. Ral Grijalva, who was running for ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, bowed out of the race after Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) launched his bid. Several lawmakers are also running for top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee against ranking member David Scott (D-Ga.). Raskin, in a post on X after Nadler's announcement, said \\"Jerry Nadler is an extraordinary lawyer, patriot and public servant. His dogged defense of civil rights and civil liberties is a great inspiration to our people.

Compare this to Trump -- people are simply used to Trump doing this kind of thing, and if he had done it (and he basically has already), it would just be another corrupt thing to add to the stack of hundreds he's already committed. In a perverse way, doing a lot more corruption allows Trump to get away with it, because people are tired of being outraged about it. We expect it. With Biden, we still actually have some kind of moral standard, so when we see him step out of line, we are outraged, and make posts about it on Reddit. You are playing right into this dynamic with this post -- you're not really wrong with the claim that it's corrupt, but your post, in contrast with your silence about Trump's permanent hypocrisy, lies, manipulation and corruption, is perfectly indicative of the strange problem with public perception we have in this country around Trump.
