That said, you might run across many ideas that run counter to those you might still be holding onto from your democratic socialist youth.I would suggest that any belief in democracy as an economic tool will be challenged.Many libertarians question the legitimacy of democracy. That takes many forms, most notable in the libertarian community is anarcho-capitalism. One of many objections is that all governments tend to eventually intervene in the economy due to democratic pressures to intervene.This would seem to be the fundamental premise of democratic socialism: the idea of the collective will making economic decisions. This is the antithesis of libertarian economic thinking in the collective will being expressed in a voluntary market rather than via the mandates of a majoritarian system of coercion.You could very easily end up going down the anarcho-capitalism rabbit hole, among others. But another one I strongly suggest following is the Austrian School rabbit hole.I see you learned a lot from Milton Friedman. He is a member of what is often described as the Chicago School. These two schools of economics probably make up the bulk of libertarian economic thinking. I would suggest the major difference in the two is monetary policy. But obviously this is not the only difference. Still, learning about the Austrian School will be well worth your time.","title":"I went from a democratic socialist to a libertarian :)"},{"text":"Solid pushback!

At the very least Id expect lenders to require the borrower to retain ownership of the asset during the loan, otherwise there is no point to pledging assets in the first place. And I dont think banks are offering this kind of service as some kind of friendly benefit to their rich clientele.So yeah, if someone matter-of-fact told me they just put the assets in a trust to avoid having to pay taxes and avoiding paying the loan I would need some really good evidence and specific examples of this scheme being real before accepting it as a fact.","title":"The \\"Buy, Borrow, Die\\" Method: Succs Beware"},{"text":"Hey so Syria is like a neoliberal shitpost now but whats up with the Kurds.

In classical econ, as suppliers flood the market, the equilibrium price goes down as the marginal unit isn't bid up as high. Here, the findommes aren't competing on price. Rather, since the number of potential consumers is some fixed constant, the **probability** of the findomme on the margin making an expected profit equal to/greater than their opportunity cost goes down as the number of findommes on the market increase.

Adam Silver works for the owners and its his job to make the league as profitable as possible. Thats the only job of the commissioner, make the league as much money as possible. Now heres the biggest problem with your idea, a lot of NBA fans would boycott the league. But lets adress the rest of your points.1. Bums making 20 million. The commissioner doesnt set salaries on individual contracts so this is a complaint for individual teams. The commissioner trying to implement anything such as caps on individual salaries outside of max contracts is going to be fought tooth and nail by the players association and theyre going to win that fight.2. How do you intent to force someone to play hard? Better yet show me a play where someone is checked out with 100% certainty that its not part of the offense and then show me that their doing it consistently again with each play being 100% certain that its not just how the offense is supposed to run. Theres no way to objectively tell is a player has quit on their team so theres not a way to punish them that will get past the players association.3. Load Management would still exist, theyd just put them as day to day on the injury report. Magical guys come down with knee/ankle soreness on the 2nd game of back to backs and stars tweak their shoulder the day before they play a garbage team during a 4 in 5. Youre not going to be able to force guys to play injured because the players association is going to kill that before it gets off the ground.4. Flopping needs to go but theres no way to get rid of it aside from fouls and fines. Thats a subjective enough foul that it doesnt need to be in the game and the fines would be appealed and overturned more often than not because of the subjective nature of the foul.5. Trade demands are going to exist as long as trade exist. The league isnt getting rid of trades and adding no trade clauses into each contract just gives more leverage to the players. If you want to hand out fines for trade demands, once again good luck winning that fight vs the players association.Youll notice a common theme here and its the players association. Thats going to be the main obstacle to all of your complaints regardless of who the commissioner is and regardless of who the commissioner is the NBAPA is a strong union thats not going to just roll over.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump should be the commissioner of the NBA"},{"text":"We found him.

The point Dems stressed about Trump sitting idly by the TV as they stormed the Capitol only worked to distance him from the event itself. Americans just didnt understand how Jan 6 was a viable threat to democracy - the insurrectionist civilians *were* jailed, and if Trumps role in the event was really that bad, then why didnt Merrick Garland seem to give a shit? For people to interpret something as a threat, they need to understand what happens when the threat is followed through, and that understanding didnt exist here. Dem leadership didnt communicate it.Look, you dont need to convince me, I voted against Trump three times in a row and my mind never wavered. I think he should have been sent to prison decades ago, for his conduct as a businessman, before he ever ran for office. That didnt happen, and so at the time I stressed that he should go to prison for his conduct as President. It made me feel crazy that I seemed to care about this more than anyone in the Biden admin did. The Jan 6 commission was pathetic, a bit of political theater that never materially threatened Trumps status. If I didnt hate Trumps guts as much as I do, I wouldnt bother arguing the point. It was and is ridiculous to claim that voters should prioritize holding Trump accountable for Jan 6 over their own material reality. Again, we didnt even need to do that, because Trump is going to be catastrophic for our economy. Not for nothing, but stopping inflation isnt greed, quite the opposite. Its the platonic ideal of an economic development that effects everything and everyone. There is no downside to mending its effects. But again, this feels like a non sequitur, because Trump will make inflation worse. That is precisely why it baffles me to pivot away from the economy as a pressing concern.","title":"Andy Kim says he worries Jan. 6 has been papered over"},{"text":"so - stopping certification? if you say yes- your inhibiting the constitution.

It's someone you respect.\\nThat's exactly right. But \\"respect\\" is a two-way street. Trump's tweets about NBA players, particularly LeBron James, have been divisive and childish. He's shown zero ability to respect the players as people, instead choosing to politicize their opinions.As for the notion that Trump would make the league like it was in the 90s, remember that the NBA is a global brand now.

His admin cut social programs and welfare benefits for countless Americans.Reagan took money from the social security fund to pay for his budget deficits.His admin rolled back labor organizing dramatically, and his handling of the air traffic controllers union strike was heavy handed and normalized union bustingReagan played the most prominent role in carrying out supply side economic policies. Part of this agenda involved removing regulations and lowering taxes on businesses and corporations, which was supposed to translate into things like higher wages for workers, better jobs, etc, hence the \\"trickle down\\" label.However, unlike the new deal response to the Great depression, which depended on the federal government intervening in the economy, the Reagan administrations response to \\"stagflation,\\" did not result in long lasting positive outcomes for the working and middle classes.Before Reagan's presidency, income tax on the wealthiest Americans was as high as 70%. By the end of Reagan's presidency that number dropped to 28%. Reagan was also responsible for generating major tax breaks for corporations and estates, all for the sake of limited government and a redistribution of wealth to the top.People brag about short-term improvements during Reagan's presidency, but the emphasis should be on short term, while it should also be emphasized that during this time, the rich got richer, and the poor, middle and working class saw little improvement.The incomes of the wealthiest Americans rose by over 100%, by comparison, the incomes of workers rose by a whopping 17%. All that wealth really trickled down huh? And since then, that wealth gap has only continued to widen. Since Reagan stepped into office, executive salaries have skyrocketed as much as over a thousand percent, while average worker compensation has increased by only 18%In 1980, the average CEO earned 36 times the average worker. Today, the average CEO earns 400 times the average worker.For the average worker, wages haven't even kept up with inflation. Where's the trickle down?Throughout Reagan's presidency, even though there were concerns directed at his policies, Reagan still maintained that if workers weren't getting richer, It was solely due to their own moral failures. And ever since Reagan, this idea has taken hold in the Republican consciousness.In terms of Reagan's influence on unions:The mid 20th century saw a peak in Union activity, nearly 1/3 of workers belonged to a union. Not only that, but unions had power, power to mount challenges against their employers. This even allowed unions to bring about important labor laws.During this time, Reagan was a member of a union himself. He was even president of the screen actors guild. But then he flipped.While he was president of the screen actors guild, he abused his power to grant his talent agency a waiver that would get him comfortable and well paid television roles. The FBI actually investigated this for anti-competitive behavior. His talent agency was eventually forced to shutter its doors.Despite this, Reagan still used his previous position as a union president to appeal to union workers on the campaign trail.\\n \\n**The air traffic controllers union strike:**These workers were striking for better working conditions and higher pay.The problem is that they were federal workers, and Reagan made it perfectly clear during a press conference that what they were doing was against the law, and that if they did not end their strike immediately, they would all be fired. Yeah, what a real working class hero.Two days later, 12,000 workers were fired, not only that, but they were barred from working for the federal government ever again.This actually crippled the labor movement, and it hasn't recovered since.At its peak, union membership accounted for over a third of all workers in the United States, at the end of Reagan's presidency that number was cut in half. Today, union membership accounts for around 10% of all workers. Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers sent a heavy-handed message to Union workers. That message, in part, not only legitimized Union busting, but made it more acceptable.Moving on...Today, Republicans like Trump have taken a page from Reagan's playbook, appointing corporate loyalists and cronies into positions of power within agencies like the NLRB where they can cripple the power of unions, make it harder for them to operate effectively, and continue disrupting whatever balance is left between employers and employees. While Trump was president, his administration rolled back labor regulations, making it difficult for unions to organize and negotiate for better working conditions.His administration also implemented policies that struck down protections for federal workers and restricted collective bargaining rights.Trump's policies favored employers over employees. Don't forget his recent remarks in front of a crowd of Union workers where he stated he \\"hated\\" giving overtime pay.Trump's new administration is expected to be the richest in US history. Billionaires funding billionaires helping billionaires, yet they run on a so-called populist platform. On the other hand, Joe Biden has been one of the most pro-union presidents in recent memory. Biden has publicly and outspokenly supported unionization efforts. He is the first president to join workers on the picket line. He has issued executive orders that have helped improve working conditions for federal employees, and he has supported legislation that makes it easier for workers to unionize and bargain collectively.By comparison, the labor relations board under Biden has been more active in protecting workers rights, even investigating union busting practices.Biden's policies have protected worker's overtime pay and pensions and have ensured federal support for union jobs, construction projects, higher wages, collective bargaining and labor standards.Under Biden's admin, the gender pay gap narrowed. His administration also targeted workplace discrimination and the PUMP Act provided workplace protections for pregnant and post-partum workers.Biden's infrastructure agenda funded tens of thousands of infrastructure projects nationwide. Many of these projects require that all manufactured goods and construction materials be made in America.Biden's CHIPS and Science Act invested in the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, in workforce advancement and training, and in chips research and development.The Biden admin also helped to implement a corporate minimum tax and a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.In the end however, the media and the American electorate have memory-holed Trump's record as president. The general public is an irrational force, a much too large percentage of American voters aren't making politically informed decisions, instead, they're letting their feelings decide the outcome of our elections. And that's what got Trump elected, *feelings*","title":"How the Democrats wandered away from Americas workers"},{"text":"Why are you copying and pasting this comment to every single subreddit there is?","title":"Jimmy Carter had an early ally in the Senate: a young Democrat named Joe Biden"},{"text":"Well would you look at that.

And the energy companies that supply those homes would not get to charge the home and business owners for those kilowatt hours.

Trump spun a fairy tale that he could easily fix this with sanctions and kicking out all the illegal immigrants. As it is, Trumps ideas are more likely to *inflame* these problems than fix them. Hes also made many unsubtle insinuations about declaring martial law, starting a war with Mexico, directing the Feds to terrorize his political opponents, etc. Stack all that ON TOP of worse than shitty prices/wages and youve got a bomb ready to go off. Plus, in the age of social media, it will be all too easy to publicize the worst civil rights encroachments made by Trumps administration. Not even current, highly repressive regimes can keep a *total* clamp on their misdeeds. People were more than willing to march and burn shit over George Floyd and other egregious displays of police brutality.

But in doing so, youre missing the fact that masculinity is far more diverse and pro-social than youre giving it credit for. Masculinity isnt inherently about stoicism, coldness, or manipulation; its a broad and flexible concept that can include strength, compassion, self-sacrifice, and emotional depth.The traits you admire in your role modelslike Jean-Luc Picards wisdom, Keanu Reeves humility, or Bernie Sanders integrityare as much a part of masculinity as anything else. They demonstrate that being a man doesnt mean suppressing humanity but embracing it in ways that align with courage, responsibility, and care for others. The toxic version of masculinity you describedominated by competitiveness and emotional repressionis only one small, unhealthy fragment of a much bigger picture.By framing masculinity as inherently sociopathic, youre not challenging the toxic elements; youre letting them define the entire concept. Thats not fair to the many men who embody pro-social, positive aspects of masculinity every dayfathers, teachers, mentors, caregivers, and friends who show strength and compassion in equal measure. Masculinity doesnt need to be rejected; it needs to be reclaimed, broadened, and redefined to reflect its best qualities, not its worst.Ultimately, the societal issues youre describingdisconnection, insecurity, manipulationarent unique to masculinity. Theyre symptoms of deeper cultural problems that affect everyone, regardless of gender. Reducing masculinity to a toxic stereotype does a disservice to the very people you seem to be advocating for and ignores the countless ways masculinity, in its healthier forms, supports community and connection.

I will agree that I have been lucky, but so too are pretty much all the men that I know.  This is the point of marriage, IMO, to have someone who shares your burdens.  That doesn't mean that men and women are the same . . . there is also an expectation that I will provide and protect her. Once, nearly 40 years ago, I found myself unemployed.  I did not go home and weep to my wife, because that would have accomplished nothing.  I looked through the help wanted ads in the local newspaper (this was before the internet) and went from business to business applying and begging for work (we also had a 1-year old at the time).  That was my role.  That was the \\"masculine\\" thing to do.  My role as husband and father put that burden on me, and I don't think there was anything toxic about that.  (And I had a crappy job in less than 24 hours.)  I have to admit that if I saw another man lose his job and then did nothing to provide for his wife and children, I would look down on him.  But again, I don't think my attitude would be toxic; I would think that that man was, well, not particularly masculine.*I just don't think masculinity encourages a man not to question his masculinity and air himself out to others without shame*Oh, I think you're absolutely correct about this, at least insofar as \\"airing out\\" their troubles means to the public at large.  Confiding such problems to a group of male friends *is* probably (as a general rule) looked down on, and is seen as unmasculine.  But I think most men *would* confide to their wives, perhaps contrary to what you think.  But I think the reason you doubt this is because one of the elements of masculinity is to not share such tribulations with the rest of the world . . . that is something for the home.  At least it is in the moment you are experiencing it.  Later such moments may become part of the lore that a man shares with his children.And this does bring us to a major problem in society today.  Too many young men lack partners.  Our society has (correctly) given women more agency over their lives, so that they can work and take care of themselves independently.  But at the same time many of these women are feeling something missing, and sometimes what is missing is a husband, a partner and protector.  But by the time this woman realizes this (at age 33), the men who would be a match for her have been emasculated by a society that has told them that their wants, their behavior, is toxic.  So they cease to pursue masculinity, and instead crawl up on the couch and play videogames, so they are not practiced in manliness when the women are finally interested.  Our society is in a real bad place.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

The issue is that the lines that are parroted often simplifying the problems that ail the country but giving the benefit of doubt to similar countries or counterfactuals is quite worrying. That is what I was trying to demonstrate with the Mexico example. I am not saying that you said it.India's challenges are not of its own making for the most part. The Brits did not plant sectarianism and other evils to divide the population in US  so that ruling them becomes easier.  They did in mine. In fact Cornwalis when he became the governor  of Bengal, he decided to do everything that he thought would safeguard against any humiliation inflicted like in the case of America. My own people got impoverished and as it was not bad enough, communalism was used to extract loyalties. Inheriting such challenges from beforehand and building democracy on top of that is absolutely mindbogglingly difficult. Something Americans would be unfamiliar with. It is a lot of hard work which is still being put forward by the common man or woman despite his or her many other obligations. When you throw around terms loosely, you make a mockery of their very actions. That does not sit well with one.  Turning up and standing in summer heat to cast their vote enthusiastically to bring real changes is still a system.Backsliding has happened in Indian history many a times. From the first Prime Minister dissolving the first non Congress CPI government in Kerala to Emergency to aspects that this NDA government tried to do. But we learned from them, we addressed the core issues driving them and it made our systems stronger. Imagine a Guardian journo travelling to civil war America and writing the death of democracy, which would have been a dishonest take because US also repaired itself and made their system even more stronger. This belief of mine gets affirmed from the results and how decisively the voter gave a mandate where they neither wanted the BJP to retain its majority but stopped short of kicking them out due to the opposition's incompetence and apprehensions about them.What happened with the lost decade was that Indian voters got a perception that too much narrow minded opposition with weak coalition government had set in policy paralysis which came for the economy also. They were half correct but now understands that the policy is not necessarily to give full majority to one party but to keep both opposition and ruling party in check which they should have done in 2014. It is a mark of a system that is self-correcting.","title":"A wild year for global democracy"},{"text":"He had an ally when he ran for governor to-George Wallace","title":"Jimmy Carter had an early ally in the Senate: a young Democrat named Joe Biden"},{"text":"That's of what I'm saying.\\nJust because you're mature enough to recognize the right moment doesn't mean you're bottling up or being unhealthy it just means you're a well adjusted person.\\nBottling up is a problem if you never face your feelings, not if you wait until the right moment and sit with your feelings.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

Your budding pugilist can become a golden gloves boxer or he can be a wife beater. It depends on the environment he is brought up in and the role models he is exposed to. The hard fact of the matter is that in life, many of us get faced with a situation (or situations) where we do have to man up, or we die (or someone else does). The actual situation differs for everybody. Sometimes it's making it through a period of homelessness, a stint in prison, addiction, an act of violence, actual combat, sickness or an emergency situation. It would be super cool if we could all just live a hundred years on earth and pass into oblivion happily in our sleep, but that just isn't life. Hardship is guaranteed. It's absolutely critical that folks in society have the ability to man up for another critical reason; not everybody can or will \\"man up\\" when the situation calls for it. Somebody will freeze, somebody will shit themselves, or somebody will panic. The higher up you go, the more experienced you get, that likelihood of catastrophic failure to \\"man up\\" decreases, but it never goes away entirely. Being able to \\"man up\\" makes you an asset to your family, your team and your community. You may not have the option to give up and it's good to encourage folks to have the intestinal fortitude to stick through it when things get really dark. That having been said, there is an important distinction to be made here. Man up during the problem, seek help after the problem.  Men are permitted to cry, but you better not do it when I need you digging your corner or triaging the wounded. Seeking help will keep you strong because you can't carry that burden forever. That doesn't mean everyone needs to see a therapist, sometimes it's just a friend, family, a clergy member or a coworker, but find someone to talk to about it. Teach healthy coping mechanism, go for a run instead of crawling inside a bottle. We don't need to perpetuate this false dichotomy between \\"manning up\\" and seeking help. We can and should do both. Give people the skills to endure hardship when they have to, but give them the support (both as a society and on the individual level, as fellow humans) when they need help making sense of those experiences and getting on with life.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

Forced with wars and the state of unacknowledged sanctions until 1991. Balkanisaiton was predicted far more times for India than Peter Zeihan predicted the collapse of China in the last two years. It is a complicated country where its often wobbly institutions that it inherited from the British era (while we are at it, the British did not give us democracy. Montagu-Chelmsford reforms were more used to exacerbate communal divisions than bring democracy. When democratic governments were elected in the provinces, the governor, a Scott went of his way to destroy and topple them) took ages to make the switch from an extractive state setting to a welfare state setting. The wounds of partition and the global legitimization of the two nation state has not been easy in India's journey to be secular. Hindu nationalism is a product of that wound being exploited, weaponised and ultimately opened up due to India's rather unfortunate history of being at the whims of hegemonic power outside the neighbourhood. The voters have shown in many cases than required that Hindu nationalism does not matter to them. Otherwise, BJP would not have lost from Ayodhya considering the Ram Mandir inauguration and everything. Hindu nationalism's appeal is overestimated. The entity with whom is associated is now telling people to tone it down. It is a flawed ideology which is becoming clear to even its creators.As for violence during elections or political violence in general, from the early 21st century we have seen a gradual reduction. Rhetoric might be high but people are getting less and less killed. We lament over political activists being killed. Even if one or two gets killed, it makes the headlines. In comparison in Mexico, mayors have been assassinated post elections. If a mayor in India gets murdered for political purposes, the country would be completely shocked. But the violence lecture would not be given to the Mexicans.India does struggle with media control. Big business and media houses have either a one way relationship or they are owned by them. During the emergency they also folded to government's whims and censorship. So one cannot expect anything better anyways. The irony of BJP entrenching that (not to forget the opposition does that in their own respective states also) at a central level when it was at other side and produced gems like Ramnath Goenka, S Gurumurthy and Arun Shourie  who held up a mirror to the country when many establishment media stayed silent. The award given to journalists for courageous and comprehensive reporting is named after Goenka given by his newspaper Indian Express, who still questions the government and holds it to account. But isolating this issue to India is na?ve. As Indians get more conscious of their rights, media landscape would resemble (and does to some extent) USA. Where big corporates or even oligarchs own your media and reporting truthfully is gone out of fashion completely.Saying this, critical media exists and do hold the government to account. Many of them were able to expose all party corruption (especially the ruling one) after the Supreme Court declared the controversial electoral bond scheme null and void. Information that was relevant to people when they voted. Unlike some supposed notion or he said/she said as one saw in the US, they published summary and proofs case by case basis. If this still means that India's press ranking is below Afg and other failed states, then there is something very wrong with Western press institutions. At this rate whether it is the BJP or Congress, Western media's often fractured relationship with Indians and India would become even more fractured.","title":"A wild year for global democracy"},{"text":"You can be strong and masculine and still compassionate and loving.\\nyeah but no... no you can't. oh people say that you can often enough but actually try and cash those credits and most of the time, it will very much not be ok.

These centers would be managed by a combination of local volunteers and paid staff who are hired directly from the surrounding community.These centers would be open to the public. And while the services they offer would vary based on local demand and staff capacity, they might include the following:* Free meals and social gatherings such as potlucks.* Happy hours and other social outings for adults.* Free childcare and after-school programs.* Free meals for children, especially during the summer months.* Volunteer opportunities, such as park beautification projects and visits to food pantries.* Board game nights, trivia nights, and intramural sports leagues.* Watch parties for movies and major sporting events.\\nhttps://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/the-party-should-throw-them-a-party","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 30, 2024"},{"text":"it is...most people are not walking around consumed by those things..it's just you alls answer to every single thing.","title":"Biden reportedly regrets ending re-election campaign and says hed have defeated Trump"},{"text":"Please.

Rather than addressing the claims made by detractors of fan service, defending the legitimacy of fan service in works of fiction, you're saying \\"well the content you enjoy sucks because the characters aren't sexually appealing\\". If you are going to stake the claim that fan service is good, then it's your responsibility in the discussion to defend that stance with evidence instead of addressing the supposition that the detractor thinks fan service is bad. Additionally, people defending the updated character design aren't making the claim that fan service is bad, just that the validity and legitimacy of a character shouldn't rest solely upon their ability to appeal to a specific gaze.You can't make this argument primarily because lack of fan service rarely, if at all, detracts from the quality of a work of fiction. It's relatively safe to say the majority of LotR fans aren't disappointed there's not a thirty-page explicit sex scene between Gandalf and an ent. There is a small portion of people who, undoubtedly, will think a pair of boobs makes everything better; if the purpose of the work is not to be appealing in a sexual or interpersonally aesthetic way, that opinion doesn't matter. The burden of proof again would fall to the people defending the fan service as their belief clashes with the intent of the creator and the narrative. The Witcher franchise fans are excited for the new game so they can experience a new narrative in a captivating setting, not to spend $70 watching Ciri bone every villager in Skellige. But even for the latter, I'd prefer \\"cute\\" over \\"sexy,\\" and \\"sexy\\" over \\"ugly.\\"The issue with this is twofold. First, consider again the intent of the designers of the different characters. With Krystal and Rouge, you have designers intentionally creating female characters as vixens, characters who provide love interest and femme fatale intrigue to the story. Side characters intentionally sexualized to appeal to and hook a demographic that wants that alluring fictional character in media. Krystal and Rouge don't necessarily drive the narrative of their respective games forward, more so serving as plot points or challenges for the protagonists to overcome.Ciri, on the other hand, serves as the protagonist of the new game and with that the responsibility of driving the narrative forward. She is an immensely powerful character in the lore, highly-trained by one of the most skilled fighters in the lore, proficient in alchemy and brewing, has a breadth of knowledge concerning the world she inhabits and the foes she encounters. Her purpose narratively is to be both liberated from the circumstance of her birth and to liberate those in need from danger. Sexualizing her beyond asserting her gender identity is female would run counter to the purpose she serves. It's ok that she is, by some standards, conventionally attractive. But not making this the emphasis doesn't take away from the value of the work.To your follow-up questions:1. I don't touch on your argument that \\"assuming someone who complains about a character being 'ugly' must be ugly themself\\" is unethical because this is a moral equivalence fallacy. Comparing anons being mean to other anons online to behavior or rhetoric that is genuinely unethical by societal standards (murder, assault, theft, etc.) is inaccurate. Being mean online is petty and should be avoided, but it's not the same depth of negative behavior as, say, online stalking, threats, or abuse. Further, whether a thing or behavior is ethical or not is relatively subjective; individuals, communities, and nations all have different beliefs that guide their perception of what is ethical. So by whose standard are you judging the ethical value of that behavior? Your own, or a wider, more agreed upon set of philosophies?2. I'm not distancing myself or throwing my hat in with the crowd of people making fun of people who don't like the updated model because the purpose of the argument is to persuade you that the content of the mockery (\\"if you don't like new Ciri you must be a thumb\\") doesn't invalidate the very real and legitimate counter-arguments to \\"New Ciri Bad\\" that it A) doesn't matter if you think she's attractive, and B) she looks nearly identical in a side-by-side when you account for the fact that the in-game models and the trailer model are different ages.3. I don't have a \\"bad feeling\\" with my argument because it is not a defense of people people being mean and mocking to others based on their opinions. Again, the purpose of the argument is to convince you, or encourage you to consider, that your claim that the mockery invalidates the genuine stance that Ciri's look doesn't diminish the quality of the work might be misplaced. It's fine to condemn people being assholes on Reddit, you won't find me disagreeing. What I do disagree with is the assertion that some people being assholes on Reddit disqualifies real arguments against \\"New Ciri Bad\\".","title":"CMV: I don't know what the complaint about the Witcher character is, but whatever it is, it seems to have been validated, retroactively, by the fact that those mocking the complaints make unverifiable statements about what the people making it look like"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 5:  **Comments must contribute meaningfully to the conversation**.

I was going to just say \\"Good, don't change your view.\\" But first, let's disentangle male from man from masculine. Masculine refers to a set of valued traits in society. Male refers to a sex. Man refers to a category of identity surrounding social roles.In culture, these things are heavily conflated to the point we can barely speak of them properly. But in truth, women can have and should be positively valued for having masculine traits. As should men for feminine traits. And vice versa. The fact they're gender-loaded (and partly caused by sex) is beside the point. The fact that \\"man up\\" is used in an almost exclusively toxic manner is beside the point. \\"Masculine\\" still refers to socially valued, pro-social characteristics.The issue is that men (all male individuals, really) are pushed (by everyone) to be specifically masculine to the exclusion of other positive traits. That's what's problematic. We need to be wary of standards for masculinity, not masculinity itself.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

Men and women hold guys to these gender roles just as much as men and women hold women to standards of beauty. It all comes down to sex and raising successful offspring, which is more likely with a woman with good genes reflected in her appearance and a guy who is ultimately self-actualized: he's generous, can easily put others first (e.g. his pregnant wife), has few insecurities, can communicate really well, has strong relationships, etc. All these things if you put them in the context of the stone age when these neural circuits were put in place, would help raise successful children with plenty of resources.This is why if women want guys to stop holding them to standards of beauty, guys shouldn't be held to self-actualized standards of having a nearly perfect personality.

So I was able to correct the worst mistakes. But what I could not correct was the general emphasis of the thing. He had his agenda. Obviously he wanted to write a piece about global warming and I was just the instrument for that, and I am not so much interested in global warming. He portrayed me as sort of obsessed with the subject, which I am definitely not. To me it is a very small part of my life. I dont claim to be an expert. I never did. I simply find that a lot of these claims that experts are making are absurd. Not that I know better, but I know a few things.

It was not specialized labor, merely a Bachelor's and enough hours to qualify for the CPA exam in a given state (sometimes required Master's, not always). While H1Bs were paid the same as Americans, it enabled us to get the number of people we needed each year without raising the wages for all entry level staff. Accounting grads can go work in industry (e.g. directly for corporations instead of accounting firms) and make 20-30% more while working 20% fewer hours. Many choose the firms to accelerate their career growth, but there aren't enough without improving working conditions and pay, and H1Bs fill that gap. Without the H1Bs, firms would have to pay more and work their people less.I recognize that the economy needs extraordinary talent from abroad, but I think the current system is much more abused than you are giving it credit for. For reform, assuming the purpose is for great talent and not just a general \\"open borders are good\\" thing, I think that companies should have to bid on the H1B visa. How much are you willing to pay the government to give that visa to your prospective employee? The most productive employees will have the highest bids and will get their visa. Just like the treasury auctions minimize the financing costs for national debt, H1b visa auctions could maximize the talent the US gets from the program.

If more men start acting like what we consider as feminine, then there is little justification for them to have a higher social status- so you have to force it upon them.a large heap of gender is a mere performance forced onto you from birth. the behaviors you engage in arent as innate as you would think. This serves the function of reinforcing the status quo and justifying hierarchy by defining success through masculine terms.think about it- the traits one would have to adopt to climb up the social ladder are associated with ones that society deems as masculine: assertiveness, confidence, etc. when you instill this in men from a young age, you are reinforcing their right to climb to higher rungs of the social ladder.when a boy is told not to \\"cry like a girl,\\" it simultaneously demeans both his emotional expression and girls/women as a group. So its really intended to demean men for engaging in behaviors that are associated with women, because society views femininity as inferior or weak. Its centering maleness as a standard for courage and strength.I do agree that telling men to man up does restrict empathy functions. This is very demonstrable in studies and the lile. Your childhood is a very formative experience, and growing up with such assertions will dull your emotional intelligence almost permanently. this is nearly entirely a nurture response. But I disagree with the center of the intent and the extremes.edit: this is probably going to get downvoted, because you guys seem to dislike this kind of stuff, but oh well. I also added a few points for clarity. Those who benefit from the hierarchy are less able and willing to see that it exists. I see this behavior in men and in women. So few people are willing to look inward at the sheer absurdity of certain roles, and its sad. justifying your roles is exactly what you were directd to do. The system is working as intended.

There is a LOT of reading on that subject, and I would recommend that you do some reading to help you underatand what you are just now articulating.Having said that, I think there is another side to masculinity, one that is not so Toxic. There is something to be said for gentle strength, for having the strength, but only using it to help build, not destroy. If you haven't read/watched/listened-to *Les Miserables* I recommend it. Of course it's a work of fiction, but I think it shows what healthy masculinity can be. And to be clear, Valjean is NOT a perfect example of a man, he is willfully blind to the suffering of those under his care, but he is *Trying* to be a better man, to use his strength - both physical strength and strength if character (*hard won*) - to help the people around him. And not only does he succeed in helping many of the unfortunate, but he also does understand his failings when presented with them.If you'd like a more modern example, I would point you at the [Filmography of Jeffrey Dean Morgan](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0604742/). JDM is - in my opinion - the greatest modern example of masculinity, both the toxic and the gentle kinds. I haven't kept up woth his work for a while, but his appearances in *Weeds* and *P.S. I Love You* are excellent examples of a gentle masculinity, while his characters in *Supernatural* and particularly *Watchmen* show Toxic Masuclinity very clearly (*Watchmen being cartoonishly Toxic*).I have heard some talk that the modern push away from masculinity might have some negative consequences as well, namely that people are unable to cope with real hardship in the same way their parents did. This is not only present in boys, but girls as well. While we might call this \\"Masculinity\\", the term used is \\"Anti-Fragile\\". In men we would say \\"Toughen Up\\", and while that terminology is oerhaps a bit too synonymous with Toxic versions of Masculinity there is a benefit to being \\"Tough\\". Now as you describe, the problem with \\"Toighness\\" is the inflexibility of it - that you should just \\"Man Up\\" and not talk about it. \\"Anti-Fragility\\" on the other hand isn't about pushing uour feelings down, it's about not letting hardship define you as a failure. When boys would go out and play rough it often taught them that losing is just something that happens, that you can get back up and try again, or if not that you can come back another day and try again. And of course I use the language of \\"boys\\" because this is a conversation about Masculinity, but this is true for girls as well. When \\"Men were Men\\" as it were they wouod alsp \\"put women in their place\\" so women would learn it too. Now I'm obviously not promoting the idea that we go back to the bad old days like that (*that's where the Toxic part comes in*) but there is something to be said for building stronger character and not being defeated by failure. Being \\"Anti-Fragile\\", on both a personal and a societal level. This doesn't necessarily have anything whatsoever to do with Masculinity, but I have heard that the prevailing belief is that this change in behaviour seems to have stemmed from a societal shift away from masculinity.Final closing thought because I just spent 5 paragraphs talking about the positives of Masculinity: Yes you're absilutely correct that Toxic Masculinity exists. Yes it looks exactly like what you describe. Yes it's far to prevalent in modern society. But don't let society tell you what Masculinity has to be, define your Masculinity as you see fit. Take the best parts, don't throw away the worst parts - acknowledge them, you can't remove them entirely - but don't let them define you either. Be the best man you can be *on your terms*.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

I had a rubric, with a high score of 76, and depending on that president's score out of that is where I put them.\\nCriteria 1: Background. This should not be the number one thing to look out for in a president, but we need to have a mature president, one that doesn't scream and become crybaby in chief. We need one who is intelligent and is willing to take risks. Integrity is a huge thing too. In this criteria, the top scorer was Roosevelt and the lowest was Harding.Criteria 2: Their abilities as a president. These include: Executive, Leadership, Communication, and compromising. A president should not be ineffective, and they should have some experience in knowing how to lead, and knowing how to compromise.  America is not just supposed to make one party happy. Technically, America shouldn't even have parties as Washington said but I digress. The top scorer here was Lincoln and the lowest once again was Harding (his famous quote \\"I am unfit to hold public office and I should never have been here\\"\\nCriteria 3: Accomplishment as president. The retrospect. How united they made America. For this, they needed to progress the world and make changes instead of just holding it back. They needed a good economy and good foreign policy. The top scorer here was Lincoln and there was actually not a bottom scorer, as everyone did fairly well in this category\\nOverall, to boil it down, if they were good people, lead the country into a good era and left the people united more than against each other, I considered them good. I mean, Lincoln literally got us out of a civil war that the Democrat warhawk before him got us into. Tell me that's not a great president.

That's not sociopathy, it's emotional maturity.Like I said though, there is a spectrum to all of thisExactly - but you're only focusing on one extreme end.

The way I see it, if the low point for Co2 was 280 ppm pre industrial revolution, then in 150 years we have increased Co2 by 52% or 145 ppm. If it stays at the same rate of increase whether calculated by percent of increase or just the same amount of PPM increase then by 2175 it could range from  570 to 646 PPM which is still within the bottom 13% of Co2 limits.If you look back at how much we have advanced in 150 years I am completely confident that in the next 150 years we will no longer need fossil fuels. The rate of technology is increasing at a faster and faster rate and I honestly think we will perfect better alternatives in the next 50 years before we reach the top end of my rough estimates.Granted it is all conjecture, but how can you not be very optimistic for the future when you look at the rate of increase of technological advancements. I would think one would take comfort in the understanding that we will most likely achieve fossil fuel independence in the next 50 years without the need to mandate people to change. Things change when there is a better economic alternative. You will not have to mandate people to change because the alternative will eventually be the better option anyways.So you say the world is too fragile to adapt, but beyond temperature what other impacts of change come from increases in co2? From what I have read as the ppm increases, the impact on temperature has diminishing returns and temperatures will not increase at the same rate with the same amount of Co2 increase.One other thing I think people do not always take into consideration is the amount of environmental damage that currently comes from producing some of these alternative energy solutions. When people try to artificially push an option that is not completely ready yet they seem to ignore the negative consequences because they want to feel like they are doing something to make a change.From what I have read the mining of these rare earth minerals for the batteries require a lot of toxic chemicals for the processing and strip mining damages the landscaping around it. I would love to see a study that compares the end net result of our current production of some alternative energies verse options of reducing Co2 by other means. An example would be take a solar farm and what goes into the material and energy consumption to build it and how much Co2 production is created in the process of building it, plus consider how much land is taken up for these solar farms verse taking that same land and planting trees on that parcel of land with whatever trees have the biggest Co2 absorption rate per acre. what is the end net result from each approach?","title":"Is carbon dioxide (CO2) a \\"planetary villain\\" its being made out to be?

According to the studies you posted they posit that it's due to lower job mobility for H-1B workers and a lack of salary negotiation.From the 2024 paperThis puts H-1B visa applicants at a distinct bargaining disadvantage when negotiating with potential employers, because employers likely understand the costs, fears, and constraints of applicants and can potentially use this information to depress offered wages (e.g., Svejnar, 1986).We present these latter two potential explanations for completeness, and we acknowledge that observing an H-1B visa holder starting wage discount (relative to other peer new hires) could be attributable in whole or part to these pressures, as opposed to employers having higher bargaining power (e.g., Aobdia et al., 2020) when negotiating starting wages for these employees.Also the 2022 paper only argues that H-1B workers see a wage decrease during their first application round.Consequently, when these workers seek jobs in the subsequent year (t + 1), they have a wider array of choices and greater insight, potentially enhancing their ability to negotiate higher wages. This increased negotiating power stems from the availability of more options at hand and a better understanding of the market, ultimately leading to improved job matches and higher wages.","title":"Clearing up misconceptions and misinformation about the H-1B visa"},{"text":"Debate performance mean nothing in this climate.

The nitrogen bonds to another nitrogen, diatomic.\\nObviously a same atom bond like N2 has little effect. Same atom means same charge forming a strong double bond. It's spectrum is more like specific lines than a band of absorption. So obviously little effect at all.\\nGood thing for us as most of the atmosphere is N2 and O2.\\nThe ozone is a highly reactive oxidized, and while harmful is quickly bonded to complex molecules.\\nBut really it's water, H2O, that dictates what is important for effecting the temperature.\\nBecause water also absorbs and emits in the center and upper end the infrared that Earth radiates.\\nAnd while water is not as strong in the central region, there's enough to saturate in the lower atmosphere.\\nWhich means for most chemicals to effect Earth's infrared emissions they have to pass into the troposphere. That area around 12km where Earth's atmosphere temperature drops significantly. Condensing out water and many other chemicals into clouds.\\nAbove that water averages about 6ppm, which is less than ozone average.\\nYou probably also see a patern. CO2, H2O, methane, all these have multiple bonds with different charge atoms, meaning flexible bonds and wider absorption.\\nMost of CO2 effect on temperature is above 12km. Once water condensed out it's the gas responsible for how high it keeps energy bouncing around before escaping to space.\\nSo for Earth's temperature, there are specific barriers for gasses to effect. Mainly not interactive with water, not condensing at 12km, and light enough to rise.\\nNow H2O, and CO2 don't cover all of Earth's infrared emissions. There's a window where nothing blocks the radiation except ozone. Ozone, or O3 is not diatomic, and is actually a potent greenhouse gas?\\nMethane, while not as wide spectrum, is on the lower end of Earth's emissions spectrum. It's highly effective and covers an area not really effected by other gasses.\\nMeanwhile you have sulfer exhausts. Which actually absorbs and interferes with incoming solar radiation. It actually cools down the planet. Unfortunately, it also causes acid in rain. Which washes away nitrates in the soil.\\nWe can see from greenhouses, which purposely pump CO2 to increase plant growth, that they have to add nitrate or the extra plant growth from extra CO2 will deplete the soil of nitrates and cause the plants to suicide.\\nSo from greenhouses with added CO2 we know we need more nitrates or the plant life dies. So acid rain washing away nitrates would destroy diversity. It won't kill all plants, some have symbiotic relations with nitrogen fixing bacteria. This plant life is resistant to nitrates depletion.\\nSee it's not that complicated to talk about the different exhaust composition, and yet to focus on what has the highest effect on temperature.","title":"Is carbon dioxide (CO2) a \\"planetary villain\\" its being made out to be?

It was a great success never again repeated by succeeding president-elects. Mr. Carter then chose civic leaders and other solid progressives to head regulatory agencies such as NHTSA, EPA, OSHA, FTC, and for other high positions in government. Starting in 1981, Ronald Reagan undermined many Carter Administration health and safety initiatives.\\n \\n Mr. Carter was also the last president to authentically recognize Palestinian rights and charge the Israeli government with imposing a system of Apartheid (worse than in South Africa, he said) over Palestine. However, he failed to get Israel to agree to a comprehensive peace settlement, including the creation of a Palestinian state, and had to settle for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.\\n \\n Citizen Carter was easily our greatest former president. For over 40 years his indefatigable work ethic was applied to advancing peace efforts, initiating health programs in developing countries, supervising fair elections overseas and, with Rosalynn, joining Habitat for Humanity as a manual laborer (he was an expert woodworker, among his many skills) to build houses around the country for needy families.\\n \\n The range of interests expressed through his 32 books and conferences revealed a practical, results-oriented, humble Renaissance man.  His compassion and honesty infuse the Carter Center to this day.\\n \\n He nourished the norms of personal and civic decency, dialogue, truth-telling and working for a just society, expressing his Christian faith in action.\\n \\n Compare Jimmy Carters life with the rancid, corrupt, cowardly politicians spoiling todays Washington landscapes.\\n \\n There are legitimate criticisms of Carters foreign and domestic policies that others will examine. But overall, his legacy will live on to inspire future generations of Americans to elevate their expectations and strive toward them with civic dedication and commitment.\\n \\n I was always in awe of how efficiently he used his time every day and truly amazed by his relentless productivity. This alone would have been a worthy book by Mr. Carter were it not for his genuine humility. \\n \\n -Ralph NaderThe first line in his tweet, which I've highlighted, broke my heart.

Basically people who didn't know what they were doing were telling other people who didn't know what they were doing what to do in all sorts of confusing ways.They also found that Boeing doesn't take effective measures when explicitly confronted with the issues. They've been given repeated chances of correcting their issues, and they don't fix anything.Furthermore, they found that this stems from Boeing not being able to retain staff because they pay is lower than the industry standard. I also read something about a manufacturing facility being located in New Orleans and that being part of why they can't find and retain properly trained people. And that makes sense, because new Orleans is fun during Mardi gras, but it's got a huge crime issue and the infrastructure is trash.

To me, what seems to really bother you is not the fact that people want to know about political or military decisions, but more to the fact they feel entitled to the privacy of public figures.If so, I'd say you are right. I do believe no one should ever feel entitled to know who is sleeping with whom (unless it's illegal - You know, criminal) and what university the kids of X goes to and what they are studying.The political part is honestly the one I could care the least for. Political decision should be public. Exception should be made of course, but generally it should be kept public.Millitary is one that I am fairly angry for because reckless news publications or demands cost lives. And it kills me that people feel themselves entitles to know things whose publishment would endanger lives.The part on the private life is a big part too. Just because a person is influencial doesnt mean his private lives should be looked at as if he is a labrat in a test.A person deserves their own privacy. When you say that it should be privately investigated, do you mean by the journalists or by a government entity? If by the journalist, yes, they should bring up allegations only if they have enough sources and material to back up their statements.Ideally by both. But corruption could very much lead to the government making deliberatly incompetent investigation or not making one at all.

Despite the fact that H1-B guidelines state that an employer needs to have a position available for each H1-B petitioner, they submit H1-B petitions for a huge number of their employees, more than they relocate to the US. They calculate how many jobs they need to fill, what they expect the acceptance rate to be, multiply to find out how many petitions they need to submit. These companies thus get more visas than companies like Amazon, but they're not just importing the top talent. This makes a lot of sense. In the stickied thread I was mentioning how strange it is that I'll work with people from these companies that are far less competent than developers I know who were dependent on winning the H1B lottery. There was somebody in a software development position who didn't know how to write any code!I think the fact that these companies have got this process down to a science as well as offering such cheap rates for quick staffing means the companies they work with are fine taking the risk that some of the people coming in are going to be duds, they're typically giant companies with tens of thousands of employees anyways so the organizations can handle it.

Its called the fallacy fallacy. You correctly identify an argument one side is making as fallacious. In this case an ad homeneim attack to one persons looks. One which you add the target cant even refute, not that it matters in my opinion, its a shit argument anyway.But you then conclude that side is wrong and the other right. That doesnt follow. You can use faulty reasoning to argue in favor or against anything. Therefore its existence on either side doesnt discredit any position. You get why?What does discredit a position is the lack of sound arguments in favor of it. Or an inability to counter arguments made against it. So that part addresses your title and main point. Btw, there were other arguments other than calling the guy ugly. That was more engaging on ridicule which is warranted when someone is being an ass.But you go further and here you position yourself in agreement with the original complaint, somewhat.Now, I like you dont remember what that guys exact complaint against Ciri was (or if we are even thinking of the same twitter thread). I will say he came off as a clown. Im thinking about the one that drew arrows pointing at face features that would be imperfections. Cause thats not something people stop to watch on other peoples faces. He was using some convoluted mumbo jumbo, probably out of his ass to define a character as unattractive when in fact many people found her very good looking. I just did a search and theres nothing wrong with her, shed be considered beautiful irl, no questions about it.I disagree with you about the realism not being important. I think anything that doesnt take you out of it when you want to depict a realistic art style adds to the experience. Im not against there being sexy characters in games. But I disagree that Ciri was made ugly to be realistic. Ive seen people compare her to other characters they claim are peak beauty which I dont prefer over her. An image of an anime style woman with perfect makeup and huge round boobs come to mind for instance. And I have nothing against anime or big boobs but that would be out of place in The Witcher. As a last thing, and this may come out of the left field but are you ok? You go into a tirade on how while you are good looking or, in your words cute, you dont date cause you are afraid of being dragged into poverty by child support bills and thats just not very normal or healthy. Added with your post topic it kinda gives a lot of resentful, bordering on misogynistic vibes. Im trying to say you are spewing incel rethoric. Most women arent looking to tie you up with child support. Condoms are a thing. The justice system isnt as fucked as you think that theyd make you raise some random child on a womans word. But most importantly, even if we disagreed on how many women are looking to screw you over, hopefully we can agree that some arent and you should be able to build an idea on people you meet, get to know them and develop trust (you can still wear a condom if you are still worried of being wrong). This is useful not just for dating but professional relationships and more. The idea that you cant know anything about people cause they may lie to you is a very antisocial and limited view.

As with many games featuring a major female or feminine character, many people (particularly masc/men) project their personal perception of feminine beauty onto the character and don't believe her beauty is accurately portrayed in the trailer - and have given a number of baseless, misogynistic reasons as to why they believe that in an attempt to pass off their personal criticism as something rooted in factual evidence. [You can see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1hd8lcq/evolution_of_ciris_face/) a comparison of the character's face in different ages, lighting, and angles. The crucial difference between these screenshots is the first two are in-game images captured on the graphics engine whereas the last one (the \\"problem image\\") is a pre-rendered cinematic trailer (that likely wasn't created by the devs themselves, but a third-party professional trailer studio). Often, game trailers are much more polished than the game they are advertising; fidelity is higher, lighting and shadows are more realistic, faces look and bodies move more naturally, etc. [Comparatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher4/comments/1hf74iw/ciri_looks_too_different/), here are side-by-sides of the previous games' protagonist, captured from the three different games, with the second being from a pre-rendered trailer. The backlash was not so pronounced in this case as Geralt is a man, and men online feel more comfortable criticizing women's appearances than other men's. Many posts [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher4/comments/1hd9y07/ciri_comparison/) complain about her being \\"generally less attractive\\", without considering that between the last game and the trailer there has likely been a significant amount of time passed. People age, their features develop, and they don't look exactly the same in different periods of their lives. It would naturally make sense that Ciri looks have changed between games.To the point that developers should strive to make all their characters as sexy as possible, that's a wonderful belief to have, but it's a projection of your belief onto the creative endeavors of people with different sensibilities. If you want to play games in which the main characters are eye candy, you totally can, and there are a near infinite amount of games where this is possible. But creators aren't beholden to this belief; if a studio wants to make a hyperrealistic game with hyperrealistic models, they will. If they want to make a cartoony pixel art game, they will. Some games don't even have humans in them, so it would be impossible to project these standards onto the characters without some amount of anthropomorphizing, which may be antithetical to the purpose of the game. It just doesn't make sense to say \\"I think devs are wasting their time if their characters aren't hot\\" when creativity doesn't stop at \\"how much should I want to sleep with this character.\\"To your argument that criticism of the initial criticism - that which you deem mockery of the critics' appearances - the personal anecdote you share doesn't provide a strong defensible base for the argument that you can write off people being critical of the critics if their comments are about the person's appearance. You feel valid in writing off those opinions because they're not rooted in a perceptible truth, but the point of saying \\"if you think new Ciri is ugly you're probably an ugly, undateable chud yourself\\" isn't to make a concrete argument that someone is actually unattractive, but to write off their criticism as coming from an insincere and malicious point of view. It's not \\"I think you're ugly in real life\\", it's \\"Your opinion is invalid because sexiness is not the message here\\". Similarly, you claim that the only way to discredit someone mocking a critic's appearance is to dox yourself with a picture. This simply isn't true, as it rests on the assumption that every post or comment mocking the \\"Ugly Ciri\\" believers needs to be refuted. They don't. The two ways to engage with that kind of rhetoric would be to 1. not engage and go on with your life, or 2. provide actual, factual, provable evidence as to why the difference in the model is both worse than the older version and makes the widespread enjoyment of the game less. And even if someone provides a reasonable argument supporting the latter, they'd have a hard time convincing commenters as this belief is rooted in a personal, curated perception of what beauty should be. A refutation will be more difficult when you have to not only prove your claim, but defend your argument as rooted in fact rather than feeling.","title":"CMV: I don't know what the complaint about the Witcher character is, but whatever it is, it seems to have been validated, retroactively, by the fact that those mocking the complaints make unverifiable statements about what the people making it look like"},{"text":"It should've been a massive story before the debate when it was already obvious.

The last years of his term saw the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, high inflation, and the Iran hostage crisis. IIRC, his political opponents cut a deal with Iran behind the scenes to delay the hostage release until Reagan took office, but that did not become publicly known until years later. Ted Koppel milked the crisis every night on ABC. I don't remember Carter's team having any really effective spokesperson or apparent media strategy to counter the negative press. In the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution (the Shah was deposed in February 1979), there were very long lines at gas stations, even gas rationing. To address the energy crisis, Carter gave a speech in July 1979 that came to be called his \\"Malaise\\" speech ([text](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/carter-crisis/)), in which he did lay out some policy strategies but which is most remembered for lots of sermonizing about the country's crisis in confidence striking at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. Reagan's campaign theme \\n\\"It's Morning in America\\" was a direct response to this and helped finish Carter on election day. There's a fair chance that the consensus will turn in Carter's favor over time as it has done for Truman. At least among historians, Truman is said to be generally ranked now among the \\"near great\\" presidents, whereas Truman was [very unpopular](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/final-presidential-job-approval-ratings) when he left office (Eisenhower was inaugurated January 20, 1953), and Truman's presidency was not viewed favorably for decades thereafter.","title":"Jimmy Carter from memory"},{"text":"Trump couldnt learn decency if Jesus Actual Christ descended from heaven to teach him personally.","title":"Biden says Trump could learn decency from Jimmy Carter in tribute address"},{"text":"Its about quality not quantity.

They are the shibboleths that signify your capacity to uphold social boundaries and norms. People aren't wasting my time when they engage in small talk, they are demonstrating that they understand the social cues of this conversation, the depth of intimacy we share, and they are capable of following an appropriate social script. That's the gateway through which we are able to bond more closely and exchange more raw, emotional, or intimate subject matter because we've both displayed social competence and safety to each other first. I can trust you to behave appropriately, and you can trust me to do the same. That doesn't change the fact that you might hate it. But hate it or not, it's there for a reason and it isn't a waste of time.

We see it in every single action he takes. Most leaders however actually have a desire to continue things , not Mango. Mango wants to be the great destroyer because that's what his buddy Vladimir wants. If terror or threats to Mango's family and interests are what keeps him in control , all someone like this or that Prime Minster has to do , is do what Angela Merkel did to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi after Berlusconi chaffed at having to ask Chancellor Merkel for billions because PM Berlusconi's government's spending got a tiny bit out of hand. After giving Italian ministers good terms on their debt, it should have been a celebratory moment for Italy and Germany. But exactly like Mango,  PM Berlusconi had an unswerving capacity to be the biggest asshole in the room, on a \\"hot mic\\" when a reporter asked what the terms of the debt deal were,  PM Berlusconi noted among other items that Chancellor Merkel was an \\"unfuckable lardass\\".When that reached back to Chancellor, she may, or may not , have dropped a dime on  PM Berlusconi with the NSA/CIA and her own intelligence services. And within days, the Milanese police department was innundated with wire-taps, recordings and a small avalanche of electronic evidence to convict  PM Berlusconi of corruption, and whatever improprieties one gets up to when your 80+ year old ass captures 16-17 year old children as sex-slaves. So a few weeks later  PM Berlusconi is no longer  PM Berlusconi, and a few months after that, the trial means that  PM Berlusconi becomes convict and former  PM Berlusconi. It turns out Chancellor Merkel , despite rumors to the contrary is perfectly capable of fucking people when they need it.So it should probably go with Mango Mussolini.","title":"So the person who refuses to pay his bills is demanding others must pay theirs.

This will definitely cause Republicans to lose the midterms and possibly the 2028 election.There are a hundred other reasons the Biden administration wants to spend money making Russia weaker.

Firstly, the New York Post didn't just find out anything. Maddrey is a top cop in NYPD and he directed the press Department to specifically leak her information. The NYPD press has a long history of selectively giving out information about overtime to news outlets for people who step out of the thin blue line. They withhold other numbers- she was not the only person who retired with a lot of overtime. Just the only one they sent directly to the Post. And isn't it so interesting they aligned that leak to the Post with her court filing? It's almost as if this was direct retaliation on behalf of Maddrey and the department.And why did they send it to the Post - their favorite right wing news outlet? Because Maddrey knew she was already suing him and wasn't going to keep her mouth shut. She retired to get away from her rapist. That entire case wasn't formed over a single day between the Post publishing that hit job and her story coming out. That story and that case were crafted long ago and Maddrey knew it which is why he leaked that to the press. You really think she got an entire complaint together in 24 hours? She probably hired that lawyer looooong ago when she decided she was going to leave.If y'all knew even a quarter of what NYPD does or is capable of you wouldn't be surprised.","title":"Ex-NYPD official admits a relationship with subordinate, but denies he demanded sex for overtime pay"},{"text":"Which is why they need to go extra hard on Trumps mental fitness, you see","title":"CBS News' Jan Crawford says most underreported 2024 story was Biden's mental fitness"},{"text":"The House?

After doing so I decided to make a second post on this topic as an update to what I found. Also, I mention Genghis Kahn as an example because him and his family tree share extensive similarities to how vast they have become, not the way they were conceived. Its important to recognize that Genghis Kahns genetic legacy is far more widespread simply because of the size and scope of the mongol empire at the time compared to King John who would only oversee England and some parts of France and reportedly only had five legitimate children. Overall, this is why i make the distinction in what I wrote by saying kinda when relating the two.
