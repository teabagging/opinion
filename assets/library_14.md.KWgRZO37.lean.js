The questions when the economic crisis inevitably rises will be \\"were they more concerned with getting laid in the most obscene ways then running the US economy?\\"The problem with Trump surrounding himself with sheer incompetence is that the likelihood of a career ending crisis happening grows exponentially with each problematic candidate and on top of that when the crisis hits the character defects will be used as ammunition to tar everyone in the Republican Party and Trump supporters will basically lose all credibility with the large number of people who held their noses while they cast a vote for Trump under the mistaken belief that Trump understands the economy.So midterms will happen in less then 2 years and the makings of a massive crisis in already getting baked into the pie by Trump.

Its mostly a messaging failure that this didnt happen, the median voter doesnt know what a facist is, they just think their guy isnt one. Comparisons to hitler lead people to think that well trump isnt doing the holocaust so he isnt hitler. It wouldve been more effective to just say that trump hates you and thinks anyone who votes for him is a fucking idiot. A big point I kinda skimmed over was that fear isnt going to be very effective with a non-incumbent (hence the 2020 turnout where fear was at an all time high), especially with trump who had an nostalgia effect, where people believed his approval rating averaged around 48%ish, when it was actually 31% average during the presidency.Instead dems shoulda stoked the anger of their voters, its a really simple tone shift, oh if trump gets in hes going to do this and that and thatll be horrible. Instead, are we really going to let this dumbass do this horrible shit? No? Then vote godammitAlso another part of the dumbass strategy was hope &amp; fear, were going to do these amazing things and hell do those horrible things it draining on someones energy to constantly shift between hope and worry.You just want to believe that people left the left because democrats bullied trump too much despite trump moving farther to the right and democrats pandering to centrists and republicans throughout the campaign.These are just the messaging failures though.

If I were OP, I would have made some of these things more clear beforehand. But I've adjusted my position based on conversation to agree that in abusive situations, it's warranted to lie in order to avoid retaliation or lack of agency over your decision. Having control over your body is more important than making your partner happy. I only add that if making your partner happy requires you to lose control over your body, then your relationship is the problem. But I think the original point still stands for more common, regular relationships.I'm sorry to hear about the abuse that happened to you, and I agree that in that situation, lying about it could be the right play.

See how that works, then see if we need to expand. Am I too soft-hearted?It makes sense. Go after the criminals first. Those who have not committed any crimes (including identity theft) other than immigration law violations could be given an amnesty. Not citizenship obviously, that's not an amnesty that's a reward for breaking the law which is patently ridiculous. No, the amnesty could involve signing up to register for a short-term visa (say, 6 months) which allows them to stay in the country legally while they get their affairs in order and make plans to return to their own countries. A small financial help for relocation could possibly be given. Possibly even an exemption for their violations so they are not permanently barred from returning on a legal visa. Things like that.I don't see what you need to \\"see how it works\\" though. They aren't undocumented or without home countries though, they have documentation in the countries they are citizens of. It's not really kind hearted to allow them to continue taking advantage of American citizens and violate their laws.","title":"DEMOCRACY: 73% of Americans think Trump should make mass deportation a priority of his administration; majority believe ALL illegal immigrants should be deported"},{"text":"I am a lawyer.  5 SCOTUS crooks can do the same thing.","title":"Trump says he will impose new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on first day"},{"text":"He doesn't seem to like to travel for work either.

I'm not going to trust any of this until President Trump is safely in the Oval in 2025.  And even then, the things Biden &amp; Obama do right now could have severe consequences and repercussions that could conceivably last well into Trump's second term, and make life very difficult for the incoming administration and all of us as Americans.

Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict ones prejudgment simply need not be believed C in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical C and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one.

I am just an hourly employee, and for weeks and months, we were told about the upcoming contract and how large the orders were going to be and the preparations involved. Then, immediately after the election, those orders are paused with no confidence in the contract that was supposed to start at the beginning of the year. I have been a Democrat since I knew the difference between the two parties. And even though I live in the deepest red state in the union, I still vote blue. In September when the contract was officially confirmed we were told that so many units were desired proactively in November and December and then at the beginning of the year the numbers would be large enough for massive hirings and discussed expansion to a second facility. But as I said right after the election, all the boxes for the last couple of months of the year were canceled, and when asked about the new year, I hear crickets. On top of that, both working persons in our home work for the same company, and the third person is on Social Security.

I don't necessarily fully disagree with it. I just think in this case, it's often a context where it's more than just whether or not you're making a decision that's good or bad for yourself. You most likely hide it when you'd want to abort because you think your partner wouldn't want you to. Now you're doing more than just making a decision your partner disagrees with (which I think is totally okay, but was the confrontation you'd likely be afraid of) but instead you're leading your partner on into thinking that there's a chance they'll have kids soon or in the future, when you have no intention of doing so. I think that's a pretty large violation of trust in my opinion, and is kind of messed up.  If someone is lying about their willingness to have a child  \\n Lying about pregnancy is not in the same category because there is no justification for anyone else having any control over that processHow is it not in the same category? If you choose to abort when your partner would prefer a child, and you don't tell them before, during or after, you are lying about your willingness to have a child.Telling your partner about something should not be surrendering control of your own body to them. If that is the situation for anyone, it seems that they need to escape that relationship, and/or seek therapy. But of course for clarity, as I've said before, if they do believe that control of their decision will be removed by sharing the information, I think it's justified to hide it.

The right to freedom of expression may be restricted with respect to yelling \\"fire\\" in a theatre - this is known as a qualified right, that is partially restricted at all times, not just emergencies.There are further differentiations for rights which are not absolute but still may not be derogated, but that's getting a bit too academic for this thread I think.Because OP makes the case that such a right can be restricted in abusive relationships they are talking about qualified rights.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"How much unnecessary misery are these policies going to cause?\\nAnd all to solve fictional and exaggerated problems generated all for the pursuit of power and money by cynical politicians and their backers.","title":"1,400 acres of Texas land for deportation"},{"text":"Sit your friends down and calm them.

A large share of the country is tired of hearing about it. Tired of hearing that Trump is a threat to democracy, that he's the new Hitler, that he's going to burn the Constitution. If Jill Stein decided to say that, that's one thing. Or Chase Oliver. Or Gary Johnson. But a lot of working class Americans don't want to hear that rhetoric anymore from the current big name elected officials in the Democratic Party. It's been used since 2015, and where did that get Democrats? Trump has won twice. This time, the victory was a sweeping repudiation of the current Democratic Party and it's failed policies and choices. You can't be the Party that cries out dictators and then steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders in 2016, then proceeds to not have a real primary in 2024. A small group of Party \\"elites\\" chose Harris after Biden was forced out. And who decided a scandal ridden aging politician like Biden should be the nominee in 2020? The same small group of Party \\"elites\\" like Obama and Pelosi. In 2016, a lot of votes were not for Trump, they were against Hillary Clinton, who was a horrible candidate. In 2020, a lot of votes were not for Biden, they were against Trump, who had his mistakes and scandals used against himIn 2024, a lot of votes were not for Trump, they were against the reality or perception of the failures of the current Democratic Party. Democrats need to clean their own house first. None of this rhetoric is effective. It's likely turning even more voters away in the next election cycle to boot. Every time someone on the left keeps shouting Hitler or Nazi or dictator, that's really like campaigning for Trump's House candidates to win in the 2026 Mid Terms. And Schiff was one of the worst culprits. He kept pushing Russia collusion when it was revealed later, under oath, by Robby Mook, one of Clinton's top lieutenants, that Russiagate was a clear disinformation campaign, paid for, approved and coordinated by Hillary Clinton herself. No one wants to hear the rhetoric anymore. Want proof? All the major left leaning mainstream media outlets that were banging the Trump is Hitler narrative are all tanking in the ratings and most of them are worried about losing their jobs. Not enough people want to hear what you are selling to win a general election. All you are doing is losing more voters to Trump by doing this.","title":"Schiff on possible Trump retribution: Thats dictator talk"},{"text":"For decades republicans were hard over on free market economics, being the party of law and order and the importance of character.

Your argument was that her sole case was that shes not Trump, and now youre off talking about how she compared herself to Biden...You cant even keep your own fucking arguments straight.You need to chill out lmaoI said when she was asked directly what she would do differently than Biden, her answer was not much. This meant her case wasnt much more than Im not doing anything new and the other guy sucks.  WHEN THAT WAS LITERALLY HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. Then you werent listening to him. He made it very clear that he was anti-immigrant and anti-trade. He blamed Democrats for not doing enough because of identity politics.  It seems like its less to do with a candidate and just more to do with the constant pendulum of blame based on absolutely zero understanding or nuance.I mean its a simple decision calculus for most people: we gave these people a shot, did my life get meaningfully better? No? Okay, the other people get a shot. You can try to explain to them what improvements you made, but you cant tell them they should be satisfied if theyre not. The middle class has shrunk for decades regardless of the party in charge. No ones side has alleviated that decline or a lot of their precarious situations.And the *voters* hate this process. A lot. Theyre always voting based on dissatisfaction, not a vision they actually like. This idea that a message matters really just feels like bullshit. Before writing it off, consider that we just havent had a coherent one. Again, Harris was asked point black what she would do differently multiple times. She just couldnt answer that question. Sometimes shed say Im not Joe Biden and Im not Donald Trump, sometimes shed say not much, sometimes shed say she was just VP. It was a pattern. Look at The View, Colberts show, that MSNBC interview in the field.  Youre just cherry picking a single interview and acting like thats all that exists.Feel free to give me the interview or stump speech where she nails the answer, because she briefly mentioned price gouging in one speech and then her campaign rolled back from emphasizing that. She also refused to respond to media requests that asked her if antitrust lawsuits would still be going forward after she met with CEOs of companies that had ongoing suits with Bidens admin. She undermined her own ability to come across as a prosecutor going after corruption and corporate greed.There was a pattern of poor communication here. The idea that because she didnt throw Biden (and herself) under the bus so she didnt have a good message is beyond stupid.I agree, which is why I never said to throw Biden under the bus. To act like Trump isnt some unprecedented level of stupid is just insane Again, never said it wasnt. Im saying its stupid for Democrats to think voters will automatically agree with their assessment of stupid and not have to make their case when history has shown you always have to. Complaining about the way things work is just whining Literally not what I said, just pointing out how dumb your argument is.Hes not about change, but he is going to make a lot of changes I dont likeok lol And this is your solution?

Its more a collection of ideas. And it doesnt have a platform. They arent successful because of this. There really does need to be a true liberal party. I think its hard for us here in America to truly understand what a liberal party is. And its definitely hard for liberals to get tough about what we want. Weve havent had anything for decades. The 70s were the end of a middle class based party. Think of pensions, doctors that werent too expensive, and housing that could be saved for and purchased if, after you got married, instead of moving out, you would live with your parents for a couple of years to buy your home. 50 years later, this idea seems extreme. But that was the world. I started working for $1.88/hr as a teen. Homes could be bought for 20k back then. Cars could be bought for a couple of thousand. This wasnt that long ago. We have been screwed over so hard that it seems foreign to think that a paid off house or car is possible. But it is. Trump and Musk are going to wreck the economy. The only good that could come out of it is that when we put the pieces back together, this time either money goes up or housing goes down. Thats it. It doesnt work any other way. You cant have a minimum wage that hasnt significantly moved in 30 years. But it wont work unless a significant portion of people demand it and do something. If we hit a depression, the solution cant be to bailout Wall Street. Unfortunately democrats will do just that. They are part of the problem. We need the idea of a new, left party with stated goals and filled with people that will drive those goals. The Republicans will never work across the aisle until they are broken. Theyve been getting away with bad behavior since W and the rise of the Teabaggers. Its worked too well for them and until they are whipped, they wont change. What have democrats really done or stood for? When they held a supermajority during Obamas first 2 years, they didnt enshrine abortion. They allowed the government option in the ACA to be pulled out because nobody would use any other plan (Im serious. That was the reason) and, as usual, a group of democrats in moderate states wanted Republican type policies so they could appeal to their base. I saw it before with Clinton. Same exact thing. The big problem is democrats arent liberal. They have been trying to pick up moderate right wingers for 30 years. I advise you to look at what theyve done. Dont take my word for it. The US will never have a left policy as long as its just republicans and democrats. The right will get more extreme and the democrats will keep chasing the right. They cant even win against a rapist. Or a guy that offered no policy except personal vengeance. They cant win against a guy that Russia openly wants as president. If that doesnt tell you something, nothing will. Ignore all the BS stories about why Democrats lost. They lost because they ignored the left, assumed they had us (they got me. I voted for Kamala), and they went after Florida and Texas instead of taking care of their house. Screw the right. Pursue left policies. Support the Middle class. Do that and even people that dont agree with many of your policies will have to choose between getting something for their taxes and installing a tyrant. And frankly I dont care which way they go. If that choice is a problem, I want nothing to do with you anyway.  Sorry for the rant and I appreciate the question. But Im not kidding. There has to be a new party for the left.","title":"The Smarter Anti-Trump Resistance: More Facts, Less Outrage"},{"text":"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/trump-s-portrayal-was-faked-for-the-apprentice-former-nbc-chief-marketer-says-222159941556","title":"The Smarter Anti-Trump Resistance: More Facts, Less Outrage"},{"text":"[2024-2025 budget is roughly $290 billion in spending.](https://ebudget.ca.gov/budget/2024-25MR/#/Home)","title":"California Governor Develops Plan To Intervene if Trump Kills Bidens EV Tax Credit"},{"text":"Its already begun, its like a 10B lawsuit for defamation iirc.","title":"The View hosts forced to issue four legal notes in a single episode spent trashing Trumps cabinet picks"},{"text":"Hmmm, does she have a 3 way tie with Jen Psaki and Rachel Maddow then?

As far as I'm concerned, pregnancy is a medical issue that is none of your business... much the same as something like a burst appendix. The removal of a pregnancy is much the same as the removal of a burst appendix - the obligation for disclosure depends on the relationship. As someone in a happy and trusting long term relationship I'd know if my husband had an appendix burst (hell I'd likely be the one forcing him to go to urgent care) but for some casual hookups in my youth, I'd be less likely to tell because I'd have no idea how it would be received.  On the other side of my personal moral watershed is the medical stuff that *does* affect you - like not disclosing a contagious illness before interacting. Or planning to take a pregnancy to term and give birth. That is something that I could see legislated into required disclosure (with some exemptions for things like safety or donor conceived babies). It is a total dick move to show up to a date without telling your partner you have covid.

It's a physiological condition which has serious consequences for the person going through it, up to and including the risk of dying, and yet in and of itself it has absolutely zero consequences for anyone else. It's not physically possible for two people to share a pregnancy.I think it is pretty reasonable to say that a monogamous couple in a healthy and committed relationship *should ideally* discuss pregnancy. But at the end of the day, if the person who is actually pregnant doesn't want to do so they do have that fundamental right.It is neither illegal or difficult to pressure someone into making a bad decision, but when it comes to pregnancy the consequences of a bad decision are extremely serious, extremely permanent and not equitably shared. If someone does not want to have an argument because they do not trust themselves not to make a bad decision under pressure, then good for them for being self-aware enough to realize that.If someone is lying about their willingness to have a child in order to keep someone else in a relationship, that is the actual problem. That is a deliberate, calculated attempt to take away someone else's control over their own life. Lying about pregnancy is not in the same category because there is no justification for anyone else having any control over that process, even if that control takes the form of psychological pressure that isn't actually illegal.

This is nothing new and something we all engage with.Is it morally right to kill a person? No. That is another human life and should continue to exist. From a purely selfish standpoint I don't want to live in a world where killing a person is ok because I don't want to be killed, so therefore it is wrong to kill a person.Do you have a right to protect yourself from harm? Yes. We all have a right to protect ourselves from harm of any variety, be it mental, physical, or emotional. We have a right to do whatever it is we need to do in order to protect ourselves.Now let's say another person is attempting to kill you. They have a gun and are actively attempting to shoot you. Would shooting them with your own gun be moral? According to our first statememt, no. It would be killing and killing is wrong. According to our second statement, yes, you have a right to take any necessary measures in order to protect your self.Here we see our morals coming into conflict. Ultimately it is up to the individual person to decide which is more important, but choosing one way or the other does not invalidate that exist of the opposite moral belief. The same argument could be made for stealing vs right to food. Honesty vs not causing harm.A partner in a committed relationship does hsve a right to know if their partner gets an abortion. At the same time the other partner has a right to protect theirself. If these two things are in conflict then it is up to the person to decide how to proceed. That doesn't negate that a partner has a right to know, it just means thet in the contest of moral obligations they choose to protect theirself, over his right to know. And thats not wrong. That's how it should work. But the default is, he has the right to know.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"Very scary","title":"I found the biggest Trump hater in New York City..."},{"text":"And the business thrived because of Trump. ??","title":"I found the biggest Trump hater in New York City..."},{"text":"Yea I gotta agree with you there.

There is no direct combat asset that the Trump can order to stop fighting.Because of that, the US fundamentally cannot be a signatory to a peace treaty or cease-fire agreement.  They simply aren't involved at that level, and that has serious implications for the meaning of the statement \\"We will pull out and make a peace deal\\"  because in terms of actual warfighting and hostilities, there's nothing for us to pull out of, and no one to make a peace deal with.  Trump can be a mediator at best, but he's speaking and acting as if he thinks he has control of the situation.And given that Trump's only leverage in the situation is to take weapons and aid away from Ukraine, what result will that lead to, and do you think that result means a safer Europe?","title":"CMV: Trump is bad, but Biden/Harris would have been infinitely worse."},{"text":"Thank you.

Your argument was that her sole case was that she's not Trump, and now you're off talking about how she compared herself to Biden...You can't even keep your own fucking arguments straight.\\nAnd I just have to point out that it's beyond fucking comical that you keep going on about how she lost because her only argument is that she wasn't Trump...WHEN THAT WAS LITERALLY HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. He ran on next to no actual policies, and basically just ran on \\"Sleepy Joe and Comrade Kamala suck\\".Why would it matter when they dont have any faith that you have a coherent vision to tie those policies together?Politics is not just about policy, its about being the face of a set of policies. This is so basic that I genuinely do not understand how most people here thought politics worked.Yeah, this is pure unadulterated bullshit. At best, it's just about being a face. But I think after the last 2 decades there's a decent argument that doesn't even really fucking matter. It seems like it's less to do with a candidate and just more to do with the constant pendulum of blame based on absolutely zero understanding or nuance.10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan? Let's vote Obama. 8 years of the same dude? Fuck it, let's vote something different and non-establishment. A massive pandemic? Someone new. Inflation high? Someone new again.This idea that a \\"message\\" matters really just feels like bullshit. At best maybe you can try and tap into what the sentiment already is. But Kamala was basically screwed because of inflation, and no amount of \\"messaging\\" was really going to save her.And they asked her what she would do differently. She didnt have a clear answer.She did have an answer. The current administration did amazing and we're going to continue and improve those policies and go after corporations that are being greedy and keeping prices high at your dinner table. You're just cherry picking a single interview and acting like that's all that exists.Then there you go. People said they were unhappy, and your starting position is well its not like we can acknowledge thatHeres what a smart politician would say: Biden did an amazing job handling the recovery, but now we need to pivot into a much more aggressive attitude towards building the middle class and stamping out corruption. As a prosecutor, I canInstead, she said she wouldnt do that much differently, but that shes a different person. Seriously, go back and look at those answers.Again, you're just cherry picking a single interview. She literally said all these things continuously on the stump. She constantly acknowledged that average people were still hurting. She constantly talked about how she had a plan to fix it. The idea that because she didn't throw Biden (and herself) under the bus so she didn't have a good message is beyond stupid.Whats stupid is all the Democrats saying this as if anything is new and feeling like theyre above having to explain themselves in a way voters like. People have been saying voters cant handle a democracy for thousands of years. Youre also kind of stupid if you look at all of that and think no but surely this time the voters will read our policy papersSorry, but again, this is just fucking stupid. To act like Trump isn't some unprecedented level of stupid is just insane and honestly makes me think you're just trolling. People aren't talking about this a lot now for no reason at all.But as I spoke to before, \\"messaging\\" really doesn't fucking matter. There's way more variables at play that have a much stronger impact.So you dont think hes going to change much from the Biden administration? Then were all kind of freaking out about nothing lmaoLiterally not what I said, just pointing out how dumb your argument is to claim Trump - who was President just 4 years ago - really isn't some beacon of change SINCE HE HAS ALREADY BEEN PRESIDENT.You lack some serious reading comprehension that I have to continually point out your errors of basic understand and following of the discussion.We lost the popularity contest.

Mexico is indeed your biggest trading partner overall, but in terms of only exports, we're still number 1. So effectively, he has put tariffs on two countries that make up nearly 30% of all American trade. Including China, about 40% of all american trade. Even worse, the top 2 countries in order that you guys import crude oil from are 1. Canada 2. Mexico. Fuel prices are going to rise like you've never seen before. Which is going to hurt rural folk even more when you think of gas-powered generators. Also, prices are going to rise on all goods even ones from non tariffed countries and even domestic goods when you add in the simple fact in order to move any goods you need fuel to put in trucks, ships, and planes. This is how you grind an economy to a halt if I've ever seen one. And if people talk about domestic oil production, in order to fuel your own country, you're going to have to massively reduce the export of oil and fuel, so not only is gas going to get more expensive the income from the export of oil is going to be significantly reduced as well. The blue-collar workers on oil refineries and truckers are most likely going to get laid off.https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/imports/companylevel/#:~:text=Monthly%20data%20on%20the%20origins,States%20(see%20table%20below).And to drive home just how much oil you guys import from us alone, according to  this article https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=268&amp;t=6#:~:text=EIA's%20data%20for%202023%20indicates,production%E2%80%941.301%20million%20b%2FdYou guys produce about 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, where the previous says in august of 2024 the US imported 3.8 million barrels of crude oil from Canada per day.","title":"Trump Plans 10% Tariffs on China Goods, 25% on Mexico and Canada"},{"text":"She knows about hypersonic missiles and the numbers of nukes but apparently didn't know that Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons..  hmm ??","title":"CMV: Trump is bad, but Biden/Harris would have been infinitely worse."},{"text":"What does \\"peace\\" mean to you?

Does that outcome make Europe more safe, or less safe, than one in which the pre-war status quo is restored? Which end does the US reducing or eliminating their involvement make more likely?As a bonus question:  What event do you think prompted the US to allow long range use of weapons they've supplied?Even more important bonus question:  What does the phrase \\"We will pull out and make a peace deal\\" mean when it is said by the leader of a nation that is not fighting the war in question?

So Trump at least complied.Refused to return them after being alerted that he had them. He also bragged about and showed them to others indicating he knew he had them.As did Hillary. Refused to return them in the face of a court subpoena.Hillary received over 70 subpoenas for her email server and refused all of them.Lied to the government about returning all the documents (and also lied to his lawyers) while moving the boxes in Mar-A-Lago to keep them hidden from investigators.Lied to the government about her server.Asked his staff to delete footage of them hiding the boxes.Server mysteriously deleted by a low level employee.These are not the same.

Remember, off Hitler's victories in Austria and Czechoslovakia, he not only got supplies, fuel, tax money, and industry, but he also united the German people behind him since everybody loves a victor. He became more powerful than ever and the German people were willing to fight and die against the entire rest of the world on his behalf - they were much less enthused about picking a fight with the Soviet Union, France, and the UK before these victories.I would encourage you to look at policy rather than political speeches - what matters is not what a politician says, because talk is cheap. What matters is what a politician does - Trump's actions suggest to me he is an isolationist who would rather appease Putin and allow Putin to do whatever he likes.

It makes sense that youd look for someone who seems like theyre pushing for peace. But I think its worth questioning if Trump is really the safe bet here, or if his style of leadership might actually create more risks in the long run.Lets look at his track record. Sure, Trump talked a lot about staying out of wars, but he wasnt exactly the king of de-escalation. Remember when he ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general? That almost threw the U.S. and Iran into direct conflict. Plus, pulling out of agreements like the Iran nuclear deal didnt exactly calm things downit made the region way more volatile. So, would we really be avoiding war with him, or just swapping one crisis for another?And Bidenyeah, it feels like theres been a lot of escalation lately. But is it fair to say hes starting it, or is he responding to Russias aggression? Ukraine didnt invade anyone; theyre fighting to defend their country. If the U.S. just backed off completely, would that stop Russia, or would it just encourage them to keep pushing? History shows that ignoring aggressors doesnt usually end well.Also, Trumps peace deal talk sounds great on paper, but lets be realwhat did he actually accomplish with that approach? He met with Kim Jong-un, took some photos, and nothing changed. Peace deals are more than just saying well work it out; they require trust and consistent follow-through, and Trump hasnt proven himself great at either.I totally get wanting someone to calm things down, but I think we need to look at the bigger picture. Is pulling out and leaving Ukraine hanging really going to make the world safer, or could it just lead to more chaos down the road? Maybe theres no perfect option here, but Im not convinced that Trumps the guy to fix it.","title":"CMV: Trump is bad, but Biden/Harris would have been infinitely worse."},{"text":"This is the rub.

I don't think it follows that the man necessarily has a RIGHT to know. Within the bounds of a committed relationship, both partners have a right to not be lied to about important things, and so pregnancy/abortion would fall into that category by being an important thing.\\nHowever, that right is a right to not be lied to, NOT a right inherent to knowing about the pregnancy. So in situations where partners either do not have a right to not be lied to (i.e. in a very casual relationship, or a one night stand, keeping big secrets both ways would be normal until trust is established), or a partner has forfeited that right (either by lying themselves, or giving their partner a reason to believe it would not be safe to tell them the truth), then the woman would be within her rights to withhold that information.\\nThe important thing to note that it is the absence or modification of the right to not be lied to, NOT anything specific about the pregnancy, that changes the situation. Therefore, there is no special right afforded to men regarding the pregnancy of their partner - it is all derived from a different right to honesty, which does not universally apply to all pregnancy scenarios.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"You do know I was being facetious right?","title":"1,400 acres of Texas land for deportation"},{"text":"Only break one law at a time.

This isn't something that a couple can just compromise on and that one can be kind of okay with it and one can really want it. A huge way to ruin a relationship permanently is to be vague or lie about your stance on having children. A serious discussion is warranted in general about where you stand in wanting to be child free versus not. Obviously things happen. It's not an ideal world where everyone gets to sit down and have a conversation, but in a healthy relationship both partners would have had this discussion and be on the same page about it.

And yes, Trump is never going down for this even if by some miracle he is indicted again. But heres my version of the future. Smith leaves the possibility of re-indicting open.  Trump shows that he is in fact a coward and pardons himself. He probably does it 3 years from now to avoid midterm fallout.   Then a Democrat takes the presidency.  And they allow a special prosecutor to challenge the idea of a POTUS pardoning themselves.  SCOTUS rules that the POTUS can in fact pardon themselves.  All of the emperors are naked because they had to admit they are above the law.  The narrative shifts from witch hunt to I am the law! And maybe, just maybe, people see the shit for what it is. And leaving open the possibility of this? Courageous also.

So actually you're wrong, there is more than enough out there to make an informed decision.  The problem is the massive amount of misinformation being pushed on social media, the spinning of reality, and people just seeming to go with it.  There wasn't a witch hunt against Trump, there was actual evidence of actual crimes.  It was spun as a witch hunt and enough people bought it, I guess because it's easier to do that than to sit down and read an article or two about the facts.Also, as an aside, you are completely wrong about me.  I am constantly evolving my views and positions on topics as evidence comes out and events take place.  And I know what nuance is and don't see everything as black and white.

I mean, I agree that ideally, yes, major decisions should be made together in a relationship, and in a relationship, people should support each other and they can only do that if they know whats happening, etc. But is a woman ethically wrong for not chasing down an ex or a one night stand to tell him shes already decided, theres nothing he can do to change her mind, etc?  She has to pay for it, undergo the pain and suffering, take the time off work, go through the risk and shes a bad person if she also doesnt have a conversation that may be scary/dangerous/upsetting/ terrible for her future etc? And why would he want to know so badly when theres nothing he can do? Many men would assume she would only tell him in order to extort or trap him. Id say a woman has more of an obligation if she doesnt choose to abort. Id feel badly for a man who found out years later there was a baby he never got a chance to know (as long as it was not because he was abusive and awful). But having sex with a woman who isnt ready to have a baby, that shell abort and youll know your fetus existed for a few weeks is kind of just a risk you take.

He finds out and confronts her and she eventually says something along the lines of I just can't talk about it, not even with you. He accepts this and they move forward and it's fine. I'm a librarian, amongst other things, and my primary area of study as an information professional is information behavior (the behaviors humans do and do not do regarding how information is spread, shared, gained, etc). I found Downton Abbey really interesting in terms of information behavior bc everything is so incredibly secretive and yet often the people who need to know things do find out. The functionality of it (and dysfunctionality) just is really fascinating (of you're into that sort of thing). That particular thing with the wife actively hiding personal health information from her husband and him being fine with it was something I found particularly interesting. There is a common idea that keeping secrets means we're doing something wrong or happens for nefarious purposes but I don't think that's the only option. One aspect of dignity is that we get to choose who we share private information with and what private information we share. People keeping private information to themselves is an aspect of people protecting and maintaining their dignity and us accepting their right to privacy is us respecting their dignity in that way. Wanting something to remain private bc it just is your own personal private business that you do not want to share is a very reasonable, normal, ethical thing to do. It can also be ethical to share but I don't think that's necessary as an expectation it's just a desire that we have with people we're intimately involved with. That desire for sharing doesn't beat out respect for dignity though. Preferring privacy is not ever something anyone is doing wrong, it's a personal preference we all get to choose for ourselves and a partner can respect that or not, their choice. If I want to keep something from my partner for my own dignity's sake I get to do that and if my partner doesn't want to be in a relationship with a private person then they need to not be in a relationship with me. I would argue that the ethics of maintaining privacy and respecting dignity outweigh the ethics of someone simply wanting access to information. Nobody has a right to access someone's personal, private business. A desire to know does not beat out a right to privacy and the need to respect dignity. People who don't want that level of privacy in their relationships shouldn't be intimate with private people and not wanting to deal with privacy doesn't create an ethical right to know something a person doesn't want to share.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"More accurate to say \\"Trump considers America's enemies to be his friends.\\"","title":"Trump promises 25% on products from Mexico, Canada"},{"text":"You keep forgetting as VP he was never supposed to have ANY of them.","title":"Biden's DOJ drops all Jan 6 charges against Trump.

For some men, if they're told prior to the abortion then it could be a bit of a slippery slope since it opens the door for manipulation and control, where a woman is likely to be guilted into changing her mind. Women should get the choice ultimately as it's their body that has to carry and birth that baby, all telling men seems to do in general is cause animosity and hurt if they decide they want the baby, or are against abortion.Some men will accept it and want whatever is best for that woman, and that is where I feel it should be at a woman's discretion.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"I dont think you can have it both ways.

John Duarte, a Republican who represents the Central Valley in California, said that small towns would \\"collapse\\" if Trump's deportation plans were to go into effect, a stark cry from MAGA hardliners who claim immigration hurts American workers.He suggested that Trump's administration *should not target immigrant workers who've been in the country longer than five years and maintained a clean criminal record*. While the H-2A visa program has given certification to 378,000 seasonal workers, the program has many barriersCmainly, many immigrants cannot afford the visa's wage and housing requirementsThe farm industry has a reason for concern about Trump fulfilling his deportation promises. In Trump's first term in 2017, his administration conducted raids at agricultural worksites, including poultry processing plants in Mississippi and produce facilities in Nebraska.The fact that Duarte suggested this is huge. You could sell it easily as an incentive for immigrants to not commit crimes (they already do at a lower rate than Americans, but selling these facts is difficult), and to stimulate the economy. Immigration is extremely challenging at the moment, and a reform like this would be a massive net positive. We should try to follow and support thisand otherproposal as much as we can.","title":"Trump's Mass Deportation Plan Could Keep Food Off American's Plates, Farming Industry Warns"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|FbiL9rsmZN3ib2JSGo)","title":"Trump with another victory"},{"text":"Sweet liberal tears.

Male birth control: If you really want to make sure you aren't knocking people up, put the pregnancy prevention in your court. We already have to be on top of the birth control here, but now we also have to report on our stages of reproductive cycles and how we plan to handle a bc failure? Take some of the stress off us and just take your own birth control pills already.   \\n2.) Abortion is such a touchy topic and you never know how someone will react to you telling them you want one/had one. Statistically, the leading cause for death among pregnant women in the US is homicide. Disclosing a pregnancy or an abortion could result in out casting, judgement, or death. It's an extremely vulnerable time and if the relationship isn't an ideal one, disclosure isn't necessarily safe.   \\n3.) In an ideal relationship, one where you have an intimate connection and a sense of safety, I think it would pretty common to go through this decision together as a couple. But there are a lot of relationships that are not ideal, and are yet also not abusive. They just aren't close emotional safe spaces to disclose something that is truly such a personal and private experience. A marriage of convenience or one that is just dead altogether. No one wants to rock the boat in a situation like that if it can be avoided. Or perhaps the partner is extremely religious and would try to talk her out of it, or would divorce her for not keeping it. Or would tell everyone they know or apply pressure in other ways to coerce her decision. There's not just personal physical safety at stake, it's your space in society, your whole life, your emotional well being, that could be jeopardized. I guess you could classify this under emotional abuse, but there's varying degrees of that and some are still socially acceptable.   \\n4.) There can be a lot of shame in making this decision. Especially for people that were raised religiously. It can be something that is just too hard to talk about, and it can cause people to shut down or shut out the people they care about. It can be a really difficult emotional time, plus hormonal changes, and can effect mental health. It might be something someone wants to talk about, but just cannot bring themselves to do it.   \\n5.) I don't think most women would hide a pregnancy or an abortion to be callous, vindictive, secretive, or evil. Maybe some, but not most. In most cases, I think if someone was hiding this, it would be for very understandable and valid reasons.   \\n6.) Where is the line where his right to know negates her right to handle this information as she feels led? Not knowing doesn't change his life, except for if he finds out he will feel left out of a secret. But for her, disclosing that information could just be added stress to an already stressful situation. If she wants to evade that stress, shouldn't that be her right too?","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"I'm all for seeing Steve Bannon's and Stephen Miller's dipshit brigades fight each other.","title":"Heres How Badly Trumps Extreme Transgender Ban Would Damage Military"},{"text":"The declaration isn't law.

Republicans were not in any way dissuaded from voting, they won the popular vote for the first time in forever with really high turnout, higher than 2020. The lies and exaggerating about Trump in no way energized the democratic base, who had significantly lower turnout than the previous election which occurred during COVID lockdowns. in 2024 dems didnt have the same fear to energize them.You think the reason democrats lost is because they didn't exaggerate enough? This is the same guy that has been titled Hitler for 2 prior election cycles now, you think like 7mil democratic voters were just not scared enough of the person they have previously voted against and see as Hitler? A much more plausible reason is that in those 4 years a portion of democratic voters have become disillusioned by the highly divisive and sometimes false rhetoric coming out of their party, and can't vote for them with confidence. If Trump truly is Hitler, there shouldn't need to be any exaggeration to make that clear to voters, just honest journalism. Through their exaggerations, the democrats have confused and lost some of their base. You can argue that Republicans do the same thing, and I am sure they do somehow, but clearly this isn't working for dems and they need a new strategy.

Would you say that someone has a right to know about every medical issue and treatment their partner has?I also agree that in a healthy relationship that is something they should have a conversation about, but I'm not convinced that the man necessarily has a right to know about it. I would definitely want to know and I would probably be pretty hurt if I found out later that my partner kept something like that from me, but it's not because I feel I have a right to know, it's because I would be hurt to find out that my partner didn't feel that she could talk to me about it.

If a man is not notified of, or cannot be reasonably expected to be aware of, the existence of his child, he should not be compelled into legally being the father.If a man does not want the responsibility of a child within a reasonable abort timeframe (lets say two months), they may recuse themselves of all parental responsibilities. The date of recusal is that of either filing the recusal documents or notification of the partner (whichever comes later). This window is extended for as long as the man is in unaware of the existence of the child add two weeks. It is key that this is done in a timely manner so that the woman is able to make an informed decision as to whether or not to keep the child, but the burden of notification is on the woman's side as she is the only party with the necessary information access for such a responsibility.If a man consents to sex under the pretense of non-procreative intercourse (and can prove such), he cannot be compelled into being the father. There may also be a rape case to heard there, same as when a condom is intentionally punctured (in the reverse direction).A man has no intrinsic right to the goings on of pregnancy, but then must also not be made responsible for an unwarned birth.No one should be compelled to assume life-altering responsibilities they are unable to consent to. Nobody should have to have a child under false pretenses, and no child should be born to unwilling parents.I am very pro abortion, but it is currently an asymmetrical system. My proposed system still puts the burden of abstaining from the child on the man, where the woman may at any legal time receive an abortion. If there are legal complications with the abortion process then we can throw this proposal out the window.","title":"CMV: Men have the right to know if a woman is pregnant with their child and wants to abort it."},{"text":"He did this shit all the time last term.

In [Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/731/), the president must be permitted to carry out his official duties without being concerned about liability for civil damages.While this ruling addressed civil and not criminal charges, I think the current SCOTUS would interpret the Constitution the same way for a criminal charge. That is, the SCOTUS would most likely find that the president must be permitted to carry out his official duties also applies to criminal proceedings. Deference to official duties for the current SCOTUS is a given as evidenced by the recent Trump v US decision on official acts. So it isnt cowardice but an understanding of how SCOTUS views prosecuting presidents based on precedent.  What chance do you think, based on these two rulings and the current court composition, that Jack Smiths case will survive a SCOTUS ruling on the issue of ability to prosecute a sitting president?","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"Sad but true.","title":"Lauren Boebert Is Now on Cameoand About to Get in Legal Trouble"},{"text":"Wouldn't be the first time he reneged on a legally binding contract.","title":"Trump promises 25% on products from Mexico, Canada"},{"text":"Heads are exploding!!","title":"Jack Smith Files to Dismiss Jan. 6 Charges Against Donald Trump Before Inauguration"},{"text":"I saw an article that quoted a woman who thought that Roe v Wade was a \\"law\\" that Biden overturned and that Democrats were responsible for abortion restrictions so she voted for Trump.

America First. That tight little patriotic sounding populist slogan was both a dont get involved in the war rallying cry and a good profile boosting vehicle for members of Congress who for whatever reason were opposed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was just an electoral juggernaut at the time.The Justice Department had failed to convict the members of the Christian Front who tried to overthrow the government. They had failed to act on advance warning of explosions at American munitions plants, planned as sabotage. Private activist groups operating outside law enforcement were tracing stolen U.S. military weapons and complex, violent plots involving homegrown violent fascists with help and financing from Berlin. Amateurs were turning this stuff up, not the authorities.William Maloney was an experienced federal prosecutor. Hed spent years at the U.S. Attorneys office in the Southern District of New York handling high-profile federal cases of fraud and corruption. William Maloney had managed to run up an eye-popping, 400-to-nothing record as a prosecutor there. Hed never lost a case.In reality, a number of the most high-profile America First members of Congress were in cahoots with a paid agent of the Hitler government who was supplying them with propaganda intended not just to keep the U.S. out of World War II, but also to divide Americans along political lines, racial lines, religious lines, class lines, all in the interest of national demoralization. George Viereck and the Nazi government were using the America First movement and America First members of Congress for those ends.Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, a leader of the America First Committee, has threatened to demand a Congressional investigation of the way the Justice Department has been handling the prosecution of Nazi sympathizers.This is a moment of great political danger, for these men.Wheeler used his position as a sitting member of the United States Senate to lobby the Justice Department to fire Maloney.

Documents found at the Penn-Biden Center. These appear to have been improperly moved and stored. There was no indication biden was ever aware of them. Negligent? Absolutely, but probably not even on Biden's part, but some mid-level staffer in his VP office.2. Journals found at his home. These contained classified information, and Biden knew they did, but Biden had a reasonable belief (dating back to Ronald Reagan doing the same thing) that he had the right to have these as personal property.Trump, by comparison:1. Took a ton of marked classified documents along with other presidential records.2. Returned some of the records when demanded by NARA, which alerted the government that he had classified documents.3. Refused to return them after being alerted that he had them. He also bragged about and showed them to others indicating he knew he had them.4. Refused to return them in the face of a court subpoena.5. Lied to the government about returning all the documents (and also lied to his lawyers) while moving the boxes in Mar-A-Lago to keep them hidden from investigators.6. Asked his staff to delete footage of them hiding the boxes.See the difference? The latter shows willfulness. It shows intent.

Thats Just the Start.](https://www.propublica.org/article/tim-dunn-farris-wilks-texas-christian-nationalism-dominionism-elections-voting)Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks are poised to take their Christian nationalist agenda nationwide.Texas Monthly - [Under a Second Trump Administration, America Could Look a Lot Like Texas](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/donald-trump-promoting-texas-style-policies/)Over the past decade, Texas has become a model for the extreme policies Trump is promising to pursue in his second term.James Talarico - [Project 2025](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB91I55Juz1/)Project 2025 is rooted in Christian Nationalism. We all know that Donald Trump is not religious. I doubt hes ever opened a Bible. But Trump is surrounded by religious extremists. As long as they give him power, hell give them their policies, just like he did when he overturned Roe v. Wade. The man who is rumored to be chief of staff in a second Trump administration is a self-proclaimed Christian Nationalist.In Project 2025 theyre already planning to ban abortion nationwide, ban IVF, ban contraception. Theyre even talking about banning what they call recreational sex.In my view, this is the Christian Taliban. They are perverting my Christian faith and subverting our American democracy.For those in blue states, Project 2025 is theoretical. But for those of us living in red states, Project 2025 is already here.I know whats coming because I see it every day at the Texas Capitol. Banning books, banning abortion, forcing every teacher to display the Ten Commandments, replacing school counselors with untrained, unsupervised religious chaplains, defunding public schools to subsidize private Christian schools, teaching Bible stories in our state curriculum as historical fact.We are sleepwalking toward theocracy in this country. And we all must act with the urgency this moment demands.","title":"The Bible, American values and federal funding: How Trump could change CT schools"},{"text":"Jill Stein will save them any day now dont worry","title":"Far-Right Pundit Sebastian Gorka Returns to Trump WH, Recently Claimed Palestine Doesnt Exist"},{"text":"Like a King?","title":"Judge dismisses special counsel's election case against Trump"},{"text":"Even if it worked that way...

The overwhelming majority of people still only know it to mean ok, so how can you use it tell if someone is white supremacist. Yeah, I get the whole point of it is plausible deniability, but at some point you do need evidence. Like 1488 is not a coincidence, but ??is more likely to be a coincidence.And then, I recently learned that Norse mythology is associated with or coopted by Nazis.

There was a whole post on a baby name sub about how OP shouldnt give their kid a Norse inspired name unless they wanted everyone to assume they are Nazis.

They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or churchThere is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts.For Christ's sake, and quite literally, even Jesus believed in the separation of church and state Mark 12:17, Jesus said to them, *\\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\\"*Our founding fathers staunchly opposed any union between religion and government.In fact, some of them were devout deists, believing that rationality and reason should govern our society, not religion. That God has no hand in the matter.Thomas Jefferson coined the phrase \\"*a wall of separation between church and state\\"* in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association. Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878 and his writings on the separation of church and state have been referenced in a series of important legal cases throughout our history.Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for *\\"a wall or hedge of separation\\"* between *\\"the wilderness of the world\\"* and *\\"the garden of the church.\\"*There you have it, an early American statesman and minister, and a profound authority on the matter, acknowledging the need for this separation. James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's \\"doctrine of two kingdoms\\", as a conception of the separation of church and state.During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended *\\"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\\"*In his writings years later he documented his support for the *\\"total separation of the church from the state.\\"**\\"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States\\",* Madison wrote, and he declared, *\\"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution...\\"*John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, \\"A Letter Concerning Toleration,\\" Locke argued that, *\\"ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate'\\"*Even George Washington supported this separation.George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated *You will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.*That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, *If I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure  no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.\\"*John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, *\\"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute\\"*Furthermore, *\\"One Nation under God\\"* wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, red, white, and blue bleeding Christian \\"patriot\\" for that matter.The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of the *Youth's Companion*, an American Children's Magazine.Francis Bellamy a Christian SOCIALIST, who *\\"championed 'the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources, which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus.\\"* worked for the magazine and drafted the \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas, a marketing gimmick. Bellamy *\\"believed in the absolute separation of church and state\\"* and purposefully did not include the phrase *\\"under God\\"* in his pledge.What's more, Bellamy *\\"viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.\\"*Additionally, *\\"In God we trust\\"* wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the big bad atheist communists of the Soviet Union.And all of that aside, I shouldn't have to remind conservatives that our very first amendment prohibits the government from *\\"respecting an establishment of religion\\"*. While the Supreme Court has expanded on this clause, settling the debate further by establishing three basic rules that must be followed in order to not violate the clause.Government actions:- must have a secular purpose\\n- must not promote or inhibit religion\\n- must not create excessive entanglement between the church and state The fact of the matter is, Christian nationalism has never been and never will be a foundational code for this country, its government or its laws.

In law details matter a lot. And you're just not paying attention to them so coming to very odd conclusions. This whole Starr memo is a great example of that.The memo was not written by Starr! Not one word. It was written to him, not by him. Independent Counsel have disagreed with the OLC opinion in the past. Notably, Kenneth Starr rejected it in his internal 1998 memo stating: It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the presidents official duties, the Starr office memo concludes. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.This is a memo written by a professor at UIUC, Ronald Rotunda, whom Starr asked to provide some argument for this position. He literally asked this professor to write the best argument possible for ignoring the OLC. And this is the result. What did Starr do with it? He found it so unconvincing he locked it in a filing cabinet never to see the light of day again and never to speak of it again until a random FOIA request 20 years later.Anyway, while the memo is totally irrelevant and written by someone who carries as much weight as you or I, let's look at it for a moment. At no point does it say the OLC's opinion is not binding. It says the OLC is wrong.We can all have our opinions on whether the OLC is right or wrong. The problem is, the Supreme Court recently also changed the game and made the president largely immune of everything. So this memo is even more irrelevant.You really should read something about how the OLC works and why it works that way. https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/cdozo15&amp;div=29&amp;id=&amp;page= The OLC is binding on the executive. Period. There is no legal scholar that disputes this.Garland doesn't need to tell the OLC to screw themselves. Either Biden or Garland can tell the OLC to change the guidelines. They refused. They continue to refuse. Blame them, not the OLC not Jack Smith.","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"See your better than me I just want them dead not murdered but dead because at this point its Darwin award shit and I am sick of cons making things worse as its going to get people killed in Ukraine, gaza in America and probly everywhere else due to climate change?","title":"Trump doubles down on universal tariffs starting in January promising to cripple the economy"},{"text":"Im more shocked that there were people who actually thought Trump would face real consequences.","title":"Jack Smith moves to DISMISS the January 6 case against Trump WITHOUT PREJUDICE."},{"text":"This wall gets it ^","title":"Trump promises a 25% tariff on products from Mexico, Canada"},{"text":"God didnt exactly do much to help him feel better about the situation either.","title":"Jack Smith files to drop Jan. 6 charges against Donald Trump"},{"text":"This is the Republican and far right Israeli script now.

I'm not sure how important the AG report would be, I'm trying to find more on that.  But I think there were two other considerations that were important for Smith:First, the fact that dismissing the cases himself allowed him to request that they dismissed *without* prejudice.  It is highly unlikely that Trump will ever be prosecuted given that the statute of limitations will run out before his presidency ends.  However, it is now in the court record (in the dismissal documents themselves, as well as the Judge's orders) that the cases were not dismissed due to any lack of evidence or legal grounds or other lack of merit, which I believe is important.  There will be no rewriting of history, no ability for Trump and his sycophants to claim that there was never a real case, it is now in the court record that Trump needed to rely on the DoJ guidelines against prosecuting sitting Presidents in order to avoid prosecution.Second, there are ongoing cases against two other individuals that were involved in the classified documents scandal.  By formally withdrawing the case against Trump, at the same time Smith was able to request that these other cases remain open and move forward.","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"He can't actually believe it raises money.Have you listened to him?He absolutely believes tariffs raise money.
