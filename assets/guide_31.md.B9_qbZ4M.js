And even then, homeschool students stand out overwhelmingly as needing extra help when they hit college or high school. It is not an overstatement to say most people fail at this.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Unfortunately there's nothing to be done.

And that seems like a great thing for a parent to do.Also, to be super-clear, I absolutely think we should be concerned about school shootings. They aren't just deadly, they're terrifying - it's tough being a parent these days and seeing all the news about school shootings, and knowing there's nothing I could do for my kid if one happened at their school. It's also very sad that political leaders on the right are unwilling to put in place basic, common-sense rules that would make our schools safer, like requiring more background checks and making it harder to get the very deadliest weapons.All that being said: do you think that your extra safe driving training will drop their odds of dying by a factor of many hundreds? Do you think that you, yourself, are *hundreds* of times safer than the average driver?Keep in mind that some people die in car accidents while driving perfectly safely, simply because the drivers around them are driving irresponsibly. Even if you could make your kids the perfect drivers, they would never be perfectly safe. That's one of the challenges of being a parent: when you release them into the world, even if you *could* control their every action, you have to accept that they might get hurt.That said, if you don't like the car example, consider: [1800 kids](https://www.alexslemonade.org/childhood-cancer/about-childhood-cancer/facts) die of cancer each year in the US, compared to (as I mentioned) 6 kids dying in school shootings. We should be 300 times more worried about a child dying of cancer than we should be about them dying in a school shooting.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Once again, Trump is clueless and purely self serving.","title":"Trump says it's 'terrible' that some people are valorizing Luigi Mangione: 'That's a sickness, actually'"},{"text":"I mean they are completely right","title":"These convicted felons say if Trump can be elected president they shouldnt face a stigma when applying for jobs"},{"text":"Trump's supporters, including some that he plans to pardon, chanted \\"Hang Mike Pence\\" on 1/6/2021.

I'm not as concerned with most regarding socialization as I never met homeschooled people with issues or unusually bad manners or criminal instincts. They all seem to be nice everyday people. I agree with the concern expressed by others regarding time. Repetition remains critical to early education, even for critical thinking, and that means efficiency and novelty won't be great time savers.

I.e. rethinking how or if you wish to do homeschool. As for IT, they could make it impossible to game but I admit they don't. I will say though, attempting to game is limited due to the monitoring i.e. watching every kids screen simultaneously using a program as well as the punishments and rewards in place for doing what they're supposed to do. My district uses classdojo to punish and reward kids depending on behavior. If kids do x minutes of ST math they get xyz and if they don't do what they're supposed to then they \\"get a red point\\" which means they lose a point. These points are tied to various rewards depending on class. In my school at least, kids fooling around is not much of an issue. Plus many homeschoolers do not have the same programs to allow for proper monitoring and they may end up using it in a way that negatively impacts social and emotional development. I.e. parents who track kids phones often cause their kids to develop trust issues and inadvertently encourage them to be sneaky and break the rules.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Unless its a progressive member of their caucus or a challenger in a primary, then they become seal team 6.","title":"Biden, Harris Urge Major Democratic Donors To Stay Engaged After Tough Loss To Trump"},{"text":"Tim Walz misspoke and suddenly he's getting crucified for being \\"friends with school shooters\\" ?? fucking stupidity","title":"Donald Trump Gets Bad News About His Tariff Plan From Americans in New PoIl"},{"text":"McCain too","title":"Mitch McConnell: The Price of American Retreat"},{"text":"Next he'll be working on removing division from elementary school math classes so people won't know what to call his methodologies anymore.","title":"Trump's tariffs threat is dividing business owners across the country"},{"text":"Promised he'd move out if he lost in 2020 lol.

They just dont have an easy scapegoat to explain it.Personally, as Im starting a homeschooling journey for my own daughter (also with the goal of eventually rejoining a school setting), I think the real questions are about parental means and abilities. As in, these were the things we had to take a hard look at in ourselves:* Can you live comfortably on one income? Have you put together a full budget for supplies, activities, etc., and confirmed that you can afford all elements without undue hardship on your family?\\n* Do you have the executive function to keep to your children to some form of a daily schedule and ensure learning occurs each day?\\n* Do you have the patience to be with your kids essentially 24/7? Especially at the early ages, you will be *with them* all the time. All the time.\\n* Do you have the stamina and capacity to spend hours researching curricula, specialist classes (i.e., P.E., art, music supplements), state standards, standardized testing procedures, compliance, and ways to go above and beyond for your childrens education, while also having the energy to implement these ideas on, again, a daily basis? \\n* Do you have the humility and self-awareness to seek out expert help to fill gaps in either your knowledge and/or your childrens knowledge as they come up?\\n* Are you a steady and consistent person who can help your child through both hard and sometimes boring things without either of you losing your cool or giving up?\\n* Are you a flexible person who can see if/when something isnt working, and adjust accordingly?\\n* Assuming you have a spouse, do the two of you have really strong communication and a joint commitment to devoting a major portion of your daily lives (monetary, emotional, physical) to your childrens education?If the answer to any of these is no or even Im not sure, then I would not recommend homeschooling.(Obviously this is assuming you do eventually want them back in a traditional classroom and youre not interested in philosophies like unschooling, which is a different discussion altogether.)(ETA: I also want to note that while I am new to homeschooling, my husband was homeschooled from 1st-9th grade and these questions are based on his experience along with our copious research.

Along the way there were times she had social struggles, but we started in homeschool from a young age and socials struggles were never the reason she came out. Her experience changed my opinion on public school for the positive.Our son struggled more with anxiety and has some social anxiety, and didn't want to try public school, but did go to the same private school for those two years. He was then homeschooled for a year. We insisted he try 6th grade, which he continued into 7th, though I'm not sure he'll stay there. So in his case, there were some mental health struggles that influenced our decisions, but it wasn't socialization-based, though we're keeping an eye on it as we continue to watch how his education is working out.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"A Cabinet of Crooks.","title":"Donald Trump's incoming administration is filled with 'losers'"},{"text":"What are you doing, man.

Beyond lowering trade barriers and expanding market access for U.S. companies, the agreement was designed to establish favorable rules of the road for international trade in a critical region of the world. The parties to the proposed agreement represented 40 percent of the global economy. But rather than strengthen and harness the power of Western economies, the first Trump administration and then the Biden administration sometimes actively antagonized them, including with tariffs that have strained relationships with allies and tested the patience of American consumers.

I'll start by focusing on the idea that kids aren't safe in schools.A question for you: when your kid is 16, will you allow them to drive a car?The average American has a roughly [1% lifetime risk](https://meyersinjurylaw.com/blog/what-are-the-odds-of-dying-in-a-car-crash/) of dying in a car accident. I think it's fair to say that this makes driving a car a risky activity - if you do it regularly, you could die, and many people do! However, we still drive cars, for a variety of reasons. Partly, we drive because we can control our risk to a certain extent. For example, if you avoid excessive speeding, always use your turn signal, never engage in road rage, never drink &amp; drive, avoid driving when you're exhausted, etc. etc., you can reduce your risk significantly below 1%.Partly, though, this comes down to the fact that a tiny chance of dying in a car accident over your entire life is an acceptable risk.Now, what do you think the odds of dying in a school shooting are? Keep in mind that kids spend much more time in school than they spend driving - 7+ hours per day, every day. The answer: average, about [6 kids per year](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/a01/violent-deaths-and-shootings) die in school shootings. By comparison, [3 kids die per day](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/813456) in car accidents. In other words, your kids are *hundreds* of times more likely to die in a car accident than they are in a school shooting.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Just keep giving us money while we do nothing.","title":"Biden, Harris Urge Major Democratic Donors To Stay Engaged After Tough Loss To Trump"},{"text":"Im confused where you are getting your ideas about math in school.

Now you know better.I had always thought that if Trump won, he'd throw Ukraine under the bus. Yet I saw some people -- from random people on Reddit to political opinion columnists -- speculate that maybe Trump won't be so bad and maybe there should be hope that Trump is going to help Ukraine and not play along with russia. I don't know why anyone ever said that. I always thought it was obvious that Trump wouldn't support Ukraine.Asked by a reporter if he would consider reversing the decision once in office, he responded: I might yeah. I thought it was a?[very stupid thing to do](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/18/why-trump-is-staying-silent-on-biden-ukraine-missile-u-turn/).Let's go over what's happening here. russia constantly fires missiles and drones into Ukraine, **deliberately** killing civilians. Ukraine is outnumbered by russia, which has a much larger population and landmass. That's why Ukraine needs help trying to defend itself. Some of Ukraine's allies, including America, have given Ukraine long-range missiles to fight against russian attacks and **save Ukrainian lives.**But America restricted Ukraine's use of America's weapons, saying they should not be used for deep strikes into russia. This bad decision helped russia out a lot, making it easier for russia to attack and kill people in Ukraine. Finally, America allowed Ukraine to do deep strikes, and of course russia doesn't like that. And what a coincidence! Trump just happens to agree with russia on that! Now he's saying it's \\"stupid.\\" **So it's stupid for Ukraine to do something to protect its people from being killed??** That's what Trump thinks.He doesn't care because it's not his family and friends who are in danger. That's how it is with all these people who don't want America to help Ukraine. *Their* family and friends aren't in danger, so they don't care that random people in Ukraine are dying. They'd have a whole different attitude if their own loved ones were the ones at risk. But since it's just random people, who cares, right?This is the kind of person America decided to put in charge.

While school violence is in the news a lot, percentage wise kids are extremely safe at schools. The commute to school (or the grocery store) is far more dangerous than being in a school.2. Schools occasionally use software on tablets or computers. For example, my grade school daughter has used a computer to type stories, and they used a math program to learn some math concepts. I think learning to type, and in limited situations using tablets for learning is just fine. It's not like they're zoned out watching YouTube.3. I haven't seen / heard any \\"I said so\\" learning. As far as I can tell, teachers are very interested in kids asking questions, explaining science/math in seventeen different ways to try to make them understand numbers. I think you should talk to a teacher at a local school before assuming some type of memorization style teaching. I've always been impressed when I talked to a real human.4. Kids do spend far too much time sitting. I think for young kids they do a great job of getting them out of their seats, walking around the classroom, recess - but it's still a confined space. In my mind one of the best reasons to home school is if you intend to get your kid to be active.5. Banned books make the news, but it's not a huge thing. It's not like there's a short limited list of books allowed in schools. And there's nothing stopping you from assigning your own kid some reading of banned books if you think an important one was skipped. But there's such a long list of excellent books they'll read in school.6. I feel they did a really good job of history lessons. They barely mention \\"columbus day\\", which has mostly been renamed.

I think the complex topics (long term racism impact on suburban demographics for example) take time to teach, but they're not \\"white washing\\" everything - they're giving them age appropriate explanations of topics their brains could understand. Not something you'd be able to credibly teach a kid before middle school anyway.There are absolutely great reasons to home school kids, but I think most of yours are overblown by the media, and don't necessarily represent a real school experience.Reasons I think you could homeschool:1) Schools go at set paces. If your kid is extra bright, it can be boring as heck to wait for the rest of the classroom to catch up if they could learn much faster.2) Movement. As you said, they're stuck in a classroom. If you were a great homeschooling parent, you'd hopefully hike with them, travel the world, etc. Because that'd be a great differentiator.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"They take over my local library three afternoons a week, and I do NOT live in a terribly crunchy area.?","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Was that socialization outside of yours or another adults view?

America seems to be ok with children laying their lives on the line for the right to bear arms.Yes, there is a risk here. But you have to consider how high that risk is (the chances are incredibly low, and we overestimate the risk because the violence is so spectacular). It's like how most people don't realize driving is the most dangerous activity you do, and get nervous on planes when planes are orders of magnitude safer. ALSO C?balance this against some of the social risks of home schooling (ex. not having friends, shared experiences, dealing with groups of other kids)Too much screen time. I'm not anti technology but I think it should be introduced to kids in bits and pieces, while being warned of how addicting it is. I'm told schools give kids tablets to work on their in class work. This strikes me as bizarre, unsafe and unhealthy.Tablets at school are EDUCATIONAL. They aren't letting kids watch coco melon for 8 hours. The real risk of screen time is at home, not at school. If your kid is a toddler, it isn't a huge deal and you're overblowing the risk.Math and science being poorly taught. Math and science in the US don't seem to be taught as tools for problem solving. Both seem to be lectured to kids in a \\"because I said so\\" fashion with rote memorization in being seen as a key. I loved the concept of \\"new math\\" and I was alarmed to see how much push-back it got from educators. I also refer to my point about screen time and think more math should be taught as mental math and/or done by pencil and paper. Calculators are valuable tools, but it's important to know how and why they work.Are you a math or science teacher? If so C are you going to be able to teach your kid better than a teacher trained to teach math or science? Your criticism is valid, but what's the alternative, and is it realistic to think you can do it better, just because you can critique it? I agree rote memorization sucks, but when you're between kindergarten and third grade, you are learning basics (ex. memorizing basic arithmetic) not constructing proofs.School kids spend entirely too much time sitting still paying attention. Recess is being slashed in schools. Requiring kids to spend 8 hours per day focused on obeyed adults and listening to lecture is a recipe for disaster. How about more hands on classes? How about requiring more short periods of time walking just to take a walk and be alone with their thoughts? Adults are taught this is healthy why can't we teach kids to do it?Are there specific schools you will send your kid to, and do they have recess? I also strongly would ask yourself C?can you give 8 hours of quality education to your kid, or are you going to be \\"giving them a break\\" and they'll end up with half the education of a kid their same age? I get school can be glorified daycare, but consider the alternative.Banned books is a ridiculous concept. I know that most educators agree with me on this but come the hell on.Is this happening in local schools around you? If so, take up the problem with them and read the books with your kid out of school.History is terribly whitewashed. America has a problem with putting its historical figures on pedestals. The founding fathers didn't build this country by themselves. They had enslaved people running their households or made loads of money buying and selling enslaved people. Thomas Jefferson raped a teenager repeatedly, he isn't a demigod because he signed the constitution. Do kids know why the cities and suburbs have such different demographics? Do they know the ramifications of Black people not being allowed to purchase homes or take advantage of the GI Bill? Do they know what year woman could finally have financial independence without a husbands signature?Show me a single elementary school that teaches about the GI bill or slavery, or alternative histories. Kids basically can't understand history at this age beyond wide strokes.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"I feel like this is just a ploy to blame disasters on Dems, and kneecap any potential actions he could take along the way by refusing funding.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"Its not about the schools or being monitored.   \\nIts about interaction with their peers.   \\nSome are nice, some are assholes, some get away with stuff, some dont, just like real life.","title":"CMV: I am strongly tempted to homeschool my kids for the first few years of school."},{"text":"Public school is an absolutely inferior context for development of social skills.

Seems outside of a bad 1H 2020 and 2022/Q1 2023, they were steadily profitable and had huge returns in 2H 2020 and 2021 and probably slightly profitable in 2023/2024.vs competitors: say, Sequoia and a16zWhy don't you do this instead? Any reason the onus is on me to look up your information/points for you?Anyway: [here's](https://dmxvlyap9srmn.cloudfront.net/article/pictures/33c8d954-da12-4cfc-870c-93619c53f552.jpg) what I could find in 30 seconds for Andreessen Horowitz. But it's a private fund, so I can't really get the same information I can for SoftBank. And because they're private, and because of the difficulty in valuing young funds, I don't know how to actually value their newer funds. They could be doing as poorly as this suggests, or they could be doing *much* better and are simply not mature.Sequoia is [8.8%](https://www.sequoiafund.com/performance/) over the last 10 years. This is an easier look at [SoftBank](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SFTBY/performance/total-return)'s returns. 10 year CAGR is 8.14%, 15 yr is 11.52%. So... somewhat similar to Sequoia, about 10% underperformance vs Sequoia. Unknown vs a16z. Are you sure you aren't anchoring your perception yourself on their wins from a long time ago?I don't really follow SoftBank specifically, and didn't know or care that they had a massive exit from an Alibaba investment.

The agency has already dramatically scaled back conversations with social media companies about online misinformation following a right-wing backlash, but Trumps team could force CISA to abandon even more of its election security work. CISA staffers worry that Trump will block the agency from participating in state and local election officials Trusted Info initiative, which encourages Americans to listen to their local election supervisors instead of provocative online claims.I think that work is probably dead, says a third CISA employee.South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, Trumps pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, embraced election conspiracies after Bidens win in 2020. Kristi Noem is a Trump loyalist who has backed him in election denial claims, and now shes going to be in charge of the agency that oversees [CISA], says the cyber official. I have a lot of questions about what happens there.The third CISA employee expects to see the persecution of those who have done election security work once Trump takes office.Weakening Authorities\\nTrumps victory could also have serious consequences for other CISA missions.Under Biden, CISA gained broader authority and new funding to monitor other agencies networks for suspicious activity, turning it into the centralized defender of federal networks that many experts always hoped it would become. That could change under Trump, especially if senior officials close to Trump bristle at CISAs oversight.ADVERTISEMENTI can absolutely see the new administration coming in and saying, Hey, you guys are not letting agencies do what they need to do. You have  too much power [to look] at how the agencies do things. Were going to reduce your power, says the first CISA employee. That will prevent us from doing the very necessary work that we need to do to protect the American people.One of CISAs most formidable powers over other agencies could be watered down for an unexpected reason.CISA can order the rest of the government to rapidly patch vulnerabilities and make other security improvements, and it has repeatedly used this authority in response to emerging digital crises. But while these directives only apply to federal agencies, some businesses treat them like unofficial government dictates and push their security teams to implement them.If corporate leaders complain about these directives effects on their bottom lines, Trumps team could force CISA to scale back its use of this authority.The Trump administration could also try to cut costs at CISA by slashing the free services that it provides to state and local governments and critical infrastructure providers.My concern would be that some of those programs would just kind of fall to the wayside, says the first CISA employee, who also fears that CISAs ability to express to the nation what we do and what services we offer will come under attack.Dimming the Stars\\nTrumps influence on CISA could also undermine the agencys long-running uphill battle to attract talented experts away from lucrative industry jobs and into public service.Multiple CISA employees say they worry that Trumps election will mean the end of what one called star hires like senior advisers Bob Lord and Jack Cable, the corporate cyber veteran and young security whiz, respectively, who lead CISAs secure-by-design program.I can absolutely see guys like Bob Lord and Jack Cablebig, well-respected individuals in the security communitydeciding that they want to take their stuff elsewhere if they dont believe that the administration is serious about helping companies be more secure, says the first CISA employee. Lord and Cable declined WIREDs request to comment.This country has gotten so much more politicized over the past eight years to where it gets in the way of us doing our jobs, the first CISA employee adds.","title":"The Top Cybersecurity Agency in the US Is Bracing for Donald Trump"},{"text":"I mean that is the reason autism rates would go up, right?

As a practical matter Russias conventional forces are no match whatsoever for NATOas is evidenced by Russia being held off by a Ukraine fighting with one hand tied behind its back and no NATO armies to speak of. This means that if the two sides were to clash directly, Russia would almost certainly have to go nuclear as it has no other cards to play. I think NATO well recognizes this and is playing a game of brinksmanship where it steadily ratchets up the pressure in the hopes that Russia folds before the two sides have to face each other directly. The incremental expansion of the terms of engagement for Ukraine is that pressure and brinksmanship.There is one other way in which this conflict is different from others though. Which is that it appears to be part of Russias imperial ambition to rebuild some kind of USSR-era empire. That means rolling over more of Europe than just Ukraine. And no one is going to stand for that. So the thinking seems to be that if Russia is allowed to take Ukraine then other nations will be next. Thats why Putin has to be defeated before that point. Does it risk wider war? Sure. But Putin doesnt want wider war either (see the above for the reason) as neither he nor Russia would survive it, so it would be pointless.NATOs gradualist approach gives him a continually open off-ramp where he can retreat with himself and his country intact.","title":"Trump suggests reversing permission for Ukraine to use US missiles in Russia"},{"text":"Perhaps microplastics and PFAS and an assortment of other unregulated and untested chemicals in our foods, pesticides, cosmetics and packaging are actually hurting people and causing a wide range of conditions like autism, endocrine disruption, cancer, etc?","title":"Trump says somethings wrong with increased autism rates when asked about vaccines"},{"text":"We know what American private healthcare looks like, as its the status quo.

Good governments never equally distribute anything. There is always going to be value judgements of who or what in society needs the most money allocated to it, and those value judgements change literally every year. Thats why the budget is so hard to pass in America is explicitly because its the governments job to determine who and what needs the most money. Conservatives argue that, based on the governments iffy record with giving money to places that may not need it (see Pentagon failing to pass audits and government still giving them billions of dollars more every year), they would rather make the decision of who gets money individually.","title":"Cmv: Most Republicans/conservatives are either soulless, un empathetic creatures or have a mental deficiency."},{"text":"Well at least you tacitly acknowledge that your claim was full of shit.","title":"Netanyahu Tells Trump Israel Must Complete Its Victory"},{"text":"If the drones were not American, dont you think the army would have shot them down immediately.","title":"Fox News anchor and Republican congressman push theory Chinese migrants behind drones"},{"text":"Would buying Truth Social be an investment in a U.S. firm?","title":"Softbank CEO and Trump announce $100 billion investment in U.S. by firm\\n"},{"text":"As someone who had my workload increase tenfold thru the first round of trade wars with China, it absolutely baffles me that no one talks about how terrible it was before 2020.

Downballot candidates were pretty successful in many places, and we were only an estimated 7,309 votes from taking the House across multiple races. We did well in state races.Still, some ideas raised to center party focus on the working- and lower-class have been raised by people like Chris Murphy and Pat Ryan (the latter of whom outperformed Harris by double digits), and still hold enough weight to be true. Others, like Kristen McDonald Rivet (outperformed Harris by 9%), see it mostly on a partisan scale rather than an economic one, saying her new constituents don't like either party. Whether any direction is the right one to take, the big conclusion is that Democrats did nowhere near as terribly as it seemed the first morning after.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 16, 2024"},{"text":"meanwhile lets pardon the J6 people","title":"Trump says it's 'terrible' that some people are valorizing Luigi Mangione: 'That's a sickness, actually'"},{"text":"Do you think he gives any shit about where they go to school?","title":"Bet trumps grandkids will go to schools that have vaccine mandates"},{"text":"Your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.

They have let a dirty bo*b into the country and are pretending to try to find it with these drones but will tell us that after the fact and of course it gives them an excuse for not disclosing the drones for fear of mass panic. But it also gives them something fall back on as appearing to try to stop it. I believe this is the best theory out there rn and is probably true. Theyre using those drones to pretend search for it Im outside of Philly and if you were to do something like that the tri state areas would be the place to do it, massive concentrated population, Wall Street and financial institutions its even close to DC. Im afraid and I rarely fear this kind of thing but its very close to me and my family and in the wrong hands we would be talking about a disaster far greater than anything the world has ever seen. I also do not doubt that Biden/obama would allow this to happen as an election contingency plan. Those two took American politics and the gov from one of the most balanced and moral in the world to a complete joke thats corruption and willingness to do evil puts us in competition with African countries and North Korea. With the crimes against humanity they have to cover up along with the largest and most blatant money laundering scheme in history to the covid vaccine thats finally starting to be uncovered they desperately need to do something this extreme to avoid spending their life in jail. \\nWhen the pentagon lost all those billions of dollars a plane just happened to strike the exact place (on 9/11) that had the records on the missing money. Oh and prob just a coincidence but they insisted that they had no backups and never stored this info anywhere else. Sounds reasonable, you know they prob didnt want to spend all that money making a backup of those files, I bet they were just trying to save the tax payers money- thats usually their priority right?? Bottom line, killing 3,000 people that day to get us into a war and cover up the pentagons 6B fraud (who knows how bad that was) was the trade off bush and Cheney felt was worth it to pump up themselves and their buddies in the industrial military complex while protecting themselves and their buddies with the 6B. Now diff with Obama and Biden, here we are talking about two guys that have even less morality and are far more motivated bc they are backed into a corner with serious risk of being destroyed by any one of many many things they did. Maybe its related to diddy, or covid or Ukraine, assassination attempt, more likely its a combination of a lot of things they know could be uncovered from the last 4 years- this was when they went full out, nothing to lose bc Biden wasnt planning to run in 2024 originally so he and Obama saw it as possibly the last time they would be able to exert their power to shape the world. Then by the time Biden changed his mind he was mentally inept and Obama was the one holding the power, giving him the ability to do anything through the empty vessel of Biden bc obama would never have to explain it or be accountable for it as he wasnt in politics at the time. So they held nothing back with the boarder, giving trillions to be laundered tho other countries, fully and openly used every gov agency to go after political opposition/christian/white people, even trying to kill political opponents. The list goes on guys, if you think they were going peacefully I think you could be very wrong. Also, why did every billionaire build a bunker in the past 5-10 years? If I had the money I would take myself and my family away from the east coast until a month or two after Trump has been in office, assuming he even gets that far. Best guess on how this goes down - while Biden and Obama are far away from the east coast this nuke that was very easy to get here with a conveniently and unprecedented open boarder, goes off and Trump just happens to be in the vicinity, maybe playing golf in bedminster by chance. Biden calls a state of emergency of course, gives himself temporary unilateral power as the King of America, blames the disaster on a scapegoat country with a gov we wanted to overthrow already. Says Americans wont be safe until this is resolved so he must stay in power as a transition give the enemy an advantage would put too many lives at Risk.  Trump isnt alive to fight about it anyway and that makes it much easier to justify. Then it goes as you would expect from there, the end of freedom, we will still have the illusion of democracy but the elections will be pre determined by Obama and the deep state. There by they keep the power they need to keep their crimes covered up and nothing of significance will stand in the way of the new world order which will be shaped in whatever way the deep state and Obama wants. I would say this is more probable than the alternative of them letting Trump take power bc once he gets a couple people in these agencies on other crimes they will start divulging info little by little to save themselves and things wont stay covered up. They were too grand, too brash and large to be hidden without holding absolute power over every gov agency - btw very convenient that those two are the only presidents I can remember who filled the cia fbi doj fema and every other gov agency with extremist who are willing to do anything asked of them no matter how immoral as it can be justified and rationalized as for the greater good and preventing Hitler from destroying democracy lol. And this need for control of all levels of all government institutions is why DEI was created! COULDNT DREAM OF A BETTER WAY TO  MAKE SURE THOSE IN POWER ARE LEFTIST!? Use billions of dollars of our money to openly discriminate against whites, Christians and conservatives. Very clever way to get left leaning people into every gov position from top to bottom and even were able to use esg and DEI in the private sector. Anyone who could see how wrong it was or realize it was completely against the constitution/BOR was harassed into quitting with biased unfair performance reviews which then are used to determine raises/promotions, with bad reviews and no promotion opportunities the white male sat back and watched their co workers get unending praise and promotions for doing the same job but slightly worse. If that didnt get the white conservative to quit they turned to mandatory white hate training that was used to humiliate and destroy their self worth but more importantly to show them how powerless they were to stop it while removing any hope. Telling people that youre bad and should feel shame for how you were born and if you fight that good luck bc we have all the money and all the power to make sure you get this message and properly settle into your new role as second class citizens. You wont advance and you white men need to understand that this what you deserve, what your children deserve. Make them believe they should be apologizing for their privileges and their horrible history, make them apologize for all the benefits they have in a society that gives them every disadvantage possible what better way to complete a mission than that, this will truly be studied by historians and its insane to witness it.

They do all of this. Why? Because the conservative moral system has, as its highest value, preserving and defending the system itself.

George Stephanopoulos referred to what the president-elect had been adjudicated of having done to E. Jean Carroll as \\"rape,\\" when the jury had judged him to be liable of sexual abuse. The case for the defense, believe it or not, was that, because the jury found that the president-elect had used his fingers and not his dick, according to New York rape law at the time, what he did was not \\"rape.\\" Presiding?[Judge Lewis Kaplan complicated things](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/)?further in July of 2023 when he wrote in a ruling regarding a motion by the defense for a new trial:The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was raped within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump raped her as many people commonly understand the word rape.' Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.All of which would seem to make ABC's payment of tribute to the incoming administration even more ridiculous and cowardly. There was absolutely no way that ABC would have lost that lawsuit, unless the judge was a former busboy at Mar-a-Lago. Beyond the public figure defense, and Justice Clarence Thomas has yet to realize his golden dream of overturning the Sullivan decision, the real cause of action should have been lodged against Judge Kaplan. But it was very important for the incoming administration to demonstrate that it could bluff major media corporations into submission. And, with his predator's instinct for an opponent's weakness, the president-elect scored a massive victory. And we will be deprived of the spectacle of watching the fingers-not-dick defense work its way up through the judicial system until some judge finally keels over in disgusted laughter.","title":"The Curious Case of Trump and ABC News"},{"text":"Honestly its been tough because I truly believe this wasnt going away.

Its just one of those things where if they are the sole available option for a service you need, you unfortunately have to decide if continued access to that service is worth the confrontation. Even if youd rather tell them where to shove it. Im with you, I dont like showing ID, especially when not even legally obligated. And I respect your willingness to assert your beliefs. Just keep in mind we dont live in the world we wish we did, and act accordingly. But I also have way bigger fish to fry. If I needed access to that resource bad enough then Im gonna play their game just to reduce further inconvenience to myself and to focus on the primary goal. I also dont really have the time or funding for a legal battle. So it really is just a math problem of is making a stink over showing my ID worth the potential loss of access to the resource. I may dislike it and it may even be objectively wrong, but with lack of ability to change the situation you kind of just have to play the game. The consequences of loss of access may be more significant than the consequences of a privacy breach. Pick your battles.For me? If I absolutely need access and the rent-a-cop comes over to bother me for ID, sure here you go you weirdo, now leave me alone so I can focus on the task at hand. If theres other options and Im bored that day maybe now I can afford to be petty and make a stink about it, knowing the outcome will likely be negative but at least I will have the satisfaction of knowing I put them on notice. Again, sometimes theres a cost to having to be right. Case by case you have to decide if being right is worth the confrontation and fallout.

When Biden took over in 2021, there was a historic spike in encounters at the southern border. We went from 50,000 encounters per moth to 200,000 and stayed there for quite a while. And a large/growing chunk of these encounters were people claiming asylum. And to be clear, the growth in people claiming asylum is a direct result of American pro-immigration NGO's promoting and coaching immigrants how to claim asylum. Basically, these groups knew we had this \\"loophole\\" where anyone can claim asylum and move to the US indefinitely while they wait for their case to be heard.Why did this become a problem? Because initially, the people claiming asylum in particular could not work. They were being shuffled into American cities without an ability to house, feed, cloth themselves. And American taxpayers were footing the bill. Back in 2022, there were all these stories about municipal resources reaching a breaking point as many of these asylum seekers were being housed in shelters, hotels, etc. on the taxpayer's dime. Eventually, Biden did take executive action to shorten the time required to get work permits, but much of the damage was already done.Secondarily, there was an influx of people coming to the US from places like Venezuela. These were not people with experience working agriculture. They were born and bread urbanites. And they mostly moved into American cities. Many of these people could not speak any English and initially struggled to find work in the service sector. There were also a number of people who resorted to gig work using borrowed or sold accounts under someone else's SSN. This an aspect of the 2021-2023 immigration boom which Americans became more closely acquainted than previous booms.Meanwhile the immigration court backlog continued to grow, border encounters continued at this very high rate, and the Biden administration basically did nothing. And they didn't really do anything until late 2023 when the bipartisan border bill was negotiated, then 2024 when Biden took executive action. It was too damn slow. Border encounters sharply dropped in 2024, but again, the damage was done. People had lost trust in the Biden administration to handle this issue.","title":"Majority of Americans are ready to support Trump and large parts of his agenda, says CNBC survey"},{"text":"I'd be surprised if Trump can name all his children, much less his grandkids.","title":"Bet trumps grandkids will go to schools that have vaccine mandates"},{"text":"\\"I think its really terrible that some people seem to admire him, like him...\\" coming from the guy that said he himself could \\"stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody\\" and not \\"lose any voters.\\"And he could.

Because you don't think they're inevitable.  Makes perfect sense.Do the fucking math yourself,Why do you think I keep talking about flipping 10 states?  Because I did the fucking math.Anything that comes out of a Constitutional Convention has to be ratified by 75% of the state legislatures.Since you need some help, 75% of 50 is 37.5.  Since a state can't half-ratify, that means 38 states have to ratify anything coming out of a Constitutional Convention.Republicans control the legislatures of 28 states.  28 is less than 38.  It is, in fact, 10 less than 38.  Golly, there's that 10 states thing I was talking about!!So unless you're going to argue that Republicans are supermen who can make anything they want happen, they'd need to convince 10 Democratic legislatures to vote for their amendments, or they'd need to flip 10 additional state legislatures.Which 10 legislatures Republicans will flip?  They gonna take Vermont?  New York?  California?Instead of running through this whole thread responding to everyone like a grade school correctionWhen you don't seem to understand 28 is less than 38, what sort of correction do you need?

He mentioned that he is already working on a lawsuit against the Iowa  pollster, Ann Selzer &amp; the Des Moines Register/Mediacom &amp; CBS News/60 Minutes for fraud &amp; election interference, replacing an answer that Kamala Harris gave, &amp; Bob Woodward. Trumps campaign whined about, &amp; still do, about Lawfare (use of legal action to cause problems for an opponent or to challenge the legality of a policy) they accused Democrats of using against us.  Was just reading about Steven Donziger, an American Environmental Lawyer that represented Brazilian indigenous peoples in an area that was ruined, polluted, by Chevron, for money to repay them &amp; for healthcare that resulted from the pollutants released into their communities.  Steven Donziger was hounded by Chevron, through American, Brazilian, Canadian &amp; International courts, at the cost of $2 Billion (thats what Chevron admits to), eventually getting Donziger imprisoned, liable for millions of dollars, home arrest for years (in a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment), defamation &amp; disbarment.  Talk about Lawfare!  This I see as an upcoming tactic of Trump, his administration, his diners &amp; followers.  They will use their own money &amp; raise large amounts of money, to direct environmental,social (abortion), taxation, real estate, etc., up through the US Justice System, like they did Dobbs, to land these cases in front of Judges &amp; Courts that are favorable to their opinions and can be bought (as obviously it seems Donzigers NY judge was).  I fear, &amp; I believe, that Trump plans to use the Federal Justice Dept, to use our American citizens taxpayer money to fund these Lawfare lawsuits (also many of the colossal &amp; vast Corporations will be funding many/most of these cases).  It is reasonable to suppose that there will be so many, so complex, so detailed, etc., that the common hard-working middle-American will not be able to keep up, to keep aware of the real issues, and many things that wont benefit will be shoved down our throats, against our needs &amp; against our well-being but in the interests of the super-rich Corporate Class, in the next 4 years at least.  They hope that many of us will not notice, that we dont have the intelligence, energy &amp; certainly not the finances to match their hired hit-men, &amp; so, they hope/believe that well let it pass.  And, theres no doubt, when you release enough water, the dam will leak or break totally, and much of these BS lawsuits, that will actually harm many Americans, but that Trumps religious &amp; corporate backers will try to shove down our throats (like the Dobbs decision, &amp; his 1st Administrations the biggest tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the Corporate &amp; upper-class 1%-ers.  Were just getting started.  My friends &amp; family are donating to the ACLU, what little we can (they have legal staff, lawyers &amp; non-profit money in action already), to help those who will be targeted by Trump &amp; his administration, whos hes already lining up for their expression of their FIRST AMENDMENT rights.  The Corporate Class want to dismantle parts of the First Amendment, which would silence those of us who speak up &amp; vote for the rights &amp; freedoms of the middle-class &amp; lower-classes that already pay mkt taxes per capita than the upper 1%.

Two court cases decided in the space of two months re-wrote the book on campaign spending and ushered in the era of the Super PAC. First, there was the Supreme Court ruling now referred to simply as \\"Citizens United.\\"The story begins six years earlier, when **Conservative nonprofit group Citizens United** filed a complaint with the Federal Election Committee (FEC), the body charged with refereeing campaign finance disputes, saying television ads for Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" were effectively -- and illegally, because Election Day was so close -- advocating against President George W. Bush's re-election. The FEC rejected the claim, so Citizens United decided to start a production company of its own. Three years later, its \\"Hillary: The Movie,\\" an unsympathetic documentary about then-candidate Clinton, was completed and ready to air on DirecTV. But the FEC, backed by a lower court ruling, blocked the group from running ads promoting the film.By the spring of 2009, the case had made its way to the Supreme Court. After some legal gymnastics, the question before the justices was broadened and on January 21, 2010, the decision came in. The Court struck down all caps on the amount of money a person could give to a PAC.More controversially, the ruling also declared that corporations and unions could also make unlimited donations.The groundwork had been put in place and two months later, another court ruling -- Speechnow.org v. FEC -- cleared the way for the creation of \\"independent expenditure-only\\" groups, or Super PACs.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/super-pac-short-history/story?id=16960267It's because of conservatives that Super PACs exist.You seem to be forgetting that dem's spend way more than republicans.musk was giving away free trump advertisement for over a year.

[Here's Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/opinion/tariffs-trump-china-taxes.html): Which consumers? Bear in mind that Trumps economic program calls for a combination of tax hikes in the form of higher tariffs and tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals. He has even floated the idea of replacing the income tax with tariffs, which almost certainly isnt feasible, but we can ask what would happen if he collected as much tariff revenue as possible while cutting income taxes by the same amount. [Here, according to Kimberly Clausing and Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute, is how that combination would affect Americans at different income levels](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs): **The net effect would be negative for 80 percent of the population, especially for the bottom 60 percent, while extremely positive for the top 1 percent.** There are two reasons for this regressive outcome. First, lower-income families spend a higher share of their income than the rich, so they would be hurt more by what would amount to a large sales tax. Second, income taxes are disproportionately paid by the affluent  around half the population doesnt pay income taxes at all, although they pay lots in other taxes, such as the payroll tax  so the benefits of cutting that tax would flow mainly to the top.GOP donors would love to swap income taxes for tariffs.","title":"Mitch McConnell: The Price of American Retreat"},{"text":"Same God.

They fool themselves into thinking they have vastly more knowledge than they in fact do by convincing themselves that banal matters they don't have the knowledge to fully understand, are in fact deeply surprising. Because the brain interprets surprising messages as containing more informative value than less surprising ones, they've convinced themselves that they have vastly valuable information.

MCConnell willfully blew up the bipartisan consensus on key issues in this country through his manipulation of senate rules and obstruction and crippled the legislative branchs ability to pass laws.  This led to two outcomes that seemed inevitable to literally everyone but him.  1) a further trend toward an imperial executive would both attract and remove guardrails from a strongman with authoritarian leanings like Trump, and 2) if bipartisan consensus was shattered and replaced by partisan politics on domestic issues, what would stop the parties from drifting apart on foreign policy ones as well?  So, as I read this Op-Ed I have to wonder: what was Mitchs expected outcome other than this?  An authoritarian strongman who hated Russia and China more?  One that was nicer to his wife?

He makes too big a deal out of evidence that is too easily debunked by people with a fraction of his resources, he's either legendarily incompetent at his job (investigating UAP's) or purposefully ignores the flaws in his evidence in order to push a narrative that keeps him in well-paid positions.What turned me against the whole \\"we need a government commission to investigate this modern 'UAP' evidence\\" movement are Mick West's videos debunking these modern videos. His GIMBAL, GO-FAST, and \\"Tic-Tac\\" videos are all-timers, but the one that actually impacted me the most was [this video](https://youtu.be/pbxtTEWczRk?si=97iiWyidfYRpcoKM) debunking footage from a Navy ship showing unidentified pyramid-shaped flying objects. The deputy director of Naval Intelligence is in front of Congress telling them that their UFO commission has studied this video for years and determined that the video shows unidentified drones hovering over a Navy exercise... and a random dude on the internet can prove in 10 minutes that those \\"drones\\" are just stars.What is the point of these government run UFO commissions if it's clear that they're not actually investigating anything? It seems to me that these programs (such as UAPTF) are just a way for UFO grifters to launder their \\"evidence\\" through official sources so that the average person thinks that the government is endorsing it. How else does that \\"pyramid\\" video get through to Congress without professional UFO researchers realizing that those lights are just stars?EDIT: To put a finer point on calling these people \\"grifters\\", I want to mention that the original AATIP program was started by Harry Reid on the advice of his friend Robert Bigelow, founder of Bigelow Aerospace and at the time the owner of Skinwalker Ranch (somewhat of a Mecca for UFO sightings and general conspiracy theory bullshit). AATIP was allocated $22 million to study UFO's for 5 years, and what Nevada-based small aerospace company do you think won the contract for all of that $22m?https://thedebrief.org/defense-intelligence-agency-paid-22-million-to-chase-ufos-and-werewolves/Reid told The Debrief that Bigelow Aerospace applied for the $22 million contract and won because the company had facilities that met the requirements for the project. When asked if Bigelow had been pre-selected for the contract due to his connection to Reid, as well as his preexisting public interest in UFOs, Mr. Reid stated flatly, No. It was like any other government contract.Among other tasks, [Bigelow Aerospace] sent its investigators to Utah to investigate sightings of strange phenomena at the infamous Skinwalker Ranch and in the greater Uinta Basin that surrounds it. Skinwalker Ranch is currently owned by real estate mogul Brandon Fugal; prior to his purchase of the property in 2016, the 512-acre ranch was owned by Robert Bigelow himself.It is unclear if Bigelow was in fact attempting to glean information from UFOs on breakthrough technology applications employed in future aerospace weapon systems, as per the DIA mandate for the AAWSAP program. What is clear is that his team was also chasing werewolves and goblins at the same time.Documents examined by The Debrief show that [Bigelow Aerospace] investigators interviewed multiple witnesses in Utahs Uinta Basin who had claimed to see a dog-like creature that allegedly stood on two legs, was over 6 feet tall, and smelled of sulfur. In another document, those same witnesses reported sightings of little people that resembled goblins, standing roughly three to four feet tall and with arms that hang down to the ground. A third report discusses a ghostly human figure standing on a mesa overlooking Skinwalker Ranch.","title":"The New Jersey Drones, UAP Hearings, and a UFO Religion for the 21st Century"},{"text":"When two woman there made a report a few years ago attacking Bernie Sanders, I totally gave up on NPR.","title":"Awful Precedent: ABC Gets Whacking for Rolling Over and Settling Trump Suit\\n | The network had previously tried to get his lawsuit dismissed"},{"text":"He was and is constantly called out for his lies...\\nMany outlets were and are calling out the insane shit he said and did in and out of the debates...","title":"Journalists anticipate a renewed hostility toward their work under the incoming Trump administration"},{"text":" You absolutely did not answer my question.Your false analogies do not interest me.Since you didn't seem to have understood my question, I'm going to rephrase it more simply: is there or not a contradiction between a supposedly loving god and the existence of hell into which he will throw all his unbelieving creatures?","title":"Reversing the \\"weaponization of Christianity\\": How \\"religous freedom\\" can be used to fight Trumpism"},{"text":"Yep.

The Israeli prime minister has been quick to cultivate his relationship with Mr. Trump, &amp; was among the first leaders to call him after his victory in November.Many analysts have said that Trump is broadly supportive of the Israels governments goal of ending the conflict with Hamas on its terms. This month, Mr. Trump threatened hell to pay if the hostages in Gaza were not freed before his inauguration, prompting praise from Mr. Netanyahu.Mr. Netanyahu said that he had explained to Mr. Trump in their call on Saturday that Israel had dealt a tough blow to both the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and to Hamas, which attacked Israel in October 2023, setting off the war in Gaza. Both groups have been supported by Iran.Israel has largely destroyed Hamas as a military organization, &amp; killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, in an offensive that has shattered the enclave and killed tens of thousands of people.Israel also launched an intense campaign of airstrikes and ground attacks in Lebanon that severely weakened Hezbollah.In recent days, amid the fall of Syrias longtime leader, Israeli forces have moved into Syria beyond the Golan Heights &amp; launched airstrikes on military targets in that country.Mr. Netanyahu said he had told Mr. Trump that Israel was committed to preventing Hezbollahs rearmament and used the statement to repeat a warning to Hezbollah and Iran that Israel will continue acting against you as much as necessary, on any front and at any time.Abridged (shortened) article [https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldgsxnf7zs2b](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldgsxnf7zs2b)","title":"Netanyahu Tells Trump Israel Must Complete Its Victory"},{"text":"Its almost as if those are bargaining tools and yes, gifts to the union.

Such thinking is commonplace among both isolationist conservatives who indulge the fantasy of Fortress America and progressive liberals who mistake internationalism for an end in itself.

Neither camp has committed to maintaining the military superiority or sustaining the alliances needed to contest revisionist powers.\\nId say this is a pretty good criticism of both parties but its coming from the wrong damn person. Because the Mitch whos writing this feels like politician Mitch. But thats different than legislative Mitch who blocks damn near every action Dems and Republicans try to take. The man has blocked a fuck ton of bipartisan legislation yet wants to try to have criticisms like this. It makes no sense.Standing up to China will require Trump to reject the myopic advice that he prioritize that challenge by abandoning Ukraine. A Russian victory would not only damage the United States interest in European security and increase U.S. military requirements in Europe; it would also compound the threats from China, Iran, and North Korea. Indeed, hesitation in the face of Putins aggression has already made these interconnected challenges more acute. The George W. Bush administrations failure to respond forcefully to Putins invasion of Georgia in 2008 was a missed opportunity to nip Russian aggression in the bud.Again a fine criticism and a take I agree with. We shouldnt abandon Ukraine and Russian history would make things worse for everyone.

But theres a wide gap between the two. It can be simultaneously true that American conservatives lack a cohesive vision for progress while American liberals are distracted by a false collectivist promise.The fundamental thing the former misses is that in reality there will always be a significant portion of the population who, for example, either cannot afford to or do not know the right way to or dont feel its worth it to give their kids a proper education. Those kids end up in the same society the rest of us live in, have equal voting rights, have access to guns and booze and cars, etc. At some point having your neighbors be uneducated is as big of a tax on your life as whatever public education might have cost. Its true that America is big enough and sparse enough that currently most dont feel the effects of this - because those uneducated are far enough away. But as a vision for the future this dodge isnt sustainable.The fundamental thing the latter misses is that collectivism is also extremely unsustainable if it truly means collectivism for the 100%. This is why, taking the same topic, public education in the US is so expensive. We have the simultaneous requirement that no one is excluded, including that fat tail of problem children, with the goal to treat everyone on a level playing field. So you end up with the dual problems of having to overpay to be a glorified day care center and having the quality of education suffer as the promising pupils dont focused learning time.Its actually possible to have a cheap enough and high enough quality education that would both be palatable to pay for and can be easily defended for its qualities. Simply tier pupils by learning ability, and only provide resources towards focused goals. So many public schools essentially become day cares - we dont need highly educated teachers or expensive equipment or facilities, just chaperones essentially. And many public schools essentially become learning centers - we hire only good teachers (trim the staff) and give them the mandate to teach willing and motivated students, provide them with equipment that we dont have to worry about breaking. Drop all the unnecessary admins and counselors, remove social workers, etc.The question isnt purely - why am I obligated to provide for others. It can also be, would I want to live in a society where my neighbors never afforded these things. In more explicit terms, Im not paying for a public toilet for your sake, Im paying it for my sake, because otherwise the your toilet business happens on the streets.","title":"Cmv: Most Republicans/conservatives are either soulless, un empathetic creatures or have a mental deficiency."},{"text":"That is what people do take a knee!

The original constitutional convention in 1787 was convened to address amendments to the articles of confederation that were necessary in light of Shay's rebellion.   The Congress of the articles of Confederation only endorsed the convention on the specific terms \\"\\"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation,\\" and specified that the Constitutional Convention would produce a report upon which the Confederation Congress could take up necessary amendments to the articles of confederation.  So what happened the first day of this new convention? On May 25, a quorum of seven states was secured.  They unanimously elected George Washington to be the presiding officer, then they adopted rules providing that each state delegation received a single vote which was to be cast based on the majority opinion of that state's delegates present. If the state's delegates were equally divided, that state would not cast a vote.  They agreed that the convention would remain secret until the conclusion of the meeting.   Very early on, on May 29, the Virginia plan and the South Carolina plan were presented which entirely dispensed with the articles of Confederation, and on May 30, a majority of the convention expressly voted to adopt a new  national government that would have three branches, entirely dispensing with the articles of confederation.   At the conclusion of the convention, a signed constitution was produced which was self-executing to some degree. *The convention resolved \\"unanimously\\" to ignore the Confederation congress and transmit the document directly to state legislatures for ratification, and it would become effective upon the ratification of 9/13 states.*  So transplant this into a modern context? what could it look like if it were captured by a political party? 34 states call for a constitutional convention.  Maybe some previously called, maybe some new ones call.  Maybe there are conditions attached, maybe not, because it may not matter.   27 State Legislatures are currently *exclusively* controlled by the republican party, with 17 democratic states having exclusive control, and 5 divided.   A convention begins,  the convention immediately votes to adopt rules of procedure requiring that each state delegation gets one vote, and a majority of states will control.  Republicans now control 28/50 potential votes in the convention.   Then along a series of party line votes 28-22, 29-21 or 30-20,  Republicans repeatedly drastically re-write the constitution, and get to specify the terms under which the results of this convention are adopted by the States.","title":"A Constitutional Convention?

Well, guess what. When you mass deport all of the immigrants that do the job no American are willing to do, then that drives the cost of labor through the roof and all of their gripes about housing and food costing too much is just going to get worse, not better.

Even if he did it, its been so long that it no longer exists. The jury had to make a verdict in the civil case where they had the ability to disregard any evidence and if they all felt like, Meh he probably did it. Then that was enough for Trump to lose the Civil lawsuit.Now for the judge to say that what Trump was paying for would be considered commonly as rape is a true statement. But that is a lot of careful wording. Saying that Trump has to pay for something that is commonly known, is not the same as saying he physically did anything and now he has to pay for it. Saying something like the evidence recounted makes clear that the Jury found that Trump did it. Is fancy judge speak for, apparently the evidence was enough for the jury, since they decided he was guilty. Nothing the judge said is untrue, could only be said in hindsight after the verdict, and never actually directly says Donald Trump actually did anything at all. Im not defending Trump.

Why is he entitled to give to those who reject him?The elements themselves are his creation. Air, water, mercy, life and everything that can be made with the elements provided. Then you have justice. We seek it and how unfair would it be if justice didnt come? Many probably dont care for justice but many who dont care for justice sure do seek revenge. Then there those who seek justice but in the end offer mercy because they themselves also seek mercy. Hell is where justice is being served.

The option has never been used, but most states have long-forgotten requests on the books that could be enough to trigger a new constitutional convention, some scholars and politicians believe.Some Democratic officials are more concerned than ever. In California, a Democratic state senator, Scott Wiener, will introduce legislation on Monday that would rescind the states seven active calls for a constitutional convention, the first such move since Donald J. Trumps election to a second term....Since 2016, the year Mr. Trump was elected president the first time, nine states that had Democratic-controlled legislatures have been concerned enough that they rescinded their decades-old requests for constitutional amendments, sometimes with support from their fellow Republican legislators. They feared that they were leaving open the door for a Republican-led Congress and state legislatures to pursue a conservative revision of the laws underpinning national governance.The founding fathers set almost no rules governing how such a constitutional convention would work. Article V of the Constitution says that the document can be amended if legislatures in two-thirds of states  now 34 out of 50  agree to convene for the purpose. But it does not set guidelines for how the gathering would function. If the convention produces a proposed amendment, the change would still need to be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures....The founding document does not say whether 34 states need to agree on the specific amendment topic or whether signaling that they want a convention for any reason is enough to trigger proceedings. There is no explanation of whether each state at the convention would get one vote or more, whether topics not on the agenda can be raised, whether lobbyists or special interest groups could participate, or who would referee disagreements. Constitutional scholars are unclear how even the most basic questions would be resolved.More than 34 states appear to have standing requests to change the Constitution, some dating back more than 150 years, according to the Article 5 Library, a bare-bones website that scholars pointed to as the best known repository of applications to change the Constitution.The list reads like a chronicle of generational concerns. In the early 20th century, more than 20 states wanted to insert anti-polygamy laws into the Constitution. In 1949, six states wanted to create a world federal government. Many of those applications remain active....Given the broad control that Republicans will have in Washington next year, other Democratic-led states may be motivated to rescind their constitutional convention requests. Lawmakers in Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut previously introduced resolutions to take back their applications, but those measures stalled.By the count of David Super, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and an expert on constitutional conventions, the highest number of active requests for a convention on one specific topic is 28, for a balanced budget. But, he said, if Article V is interpreted as allowing any request to count toward convening a constitutional convention, the 34-state threshold has already been reached.If Congress declares under whatever crazy counting theory the convention advocates support that weve met the threshold, then well have a convention, Mr. Super said.This, along with so many other issues that are facing the nation, seems to indicate that relying solely on the founding documents to determine contemporary and future policy decisions is not necessarily a helpful way to go. It would make more sense to continually revisit how we are governed so that there aren't these anachronistic vestiges that could potentially be (mis)interpreted to justify bad-faith actions now and in the future.","title":"A Constitutional Convention?

Bad enough that Trump is surrounded by the New Apostolic Reformation evangelicals.New York Magazine - [How Opus Dei Conquered D.C.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240919134645/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/opus-dei-members-catholic-washington-dc-politicans-jd-vance.html)In a few years, he succeeded in converting some of the most influential American conservatives of his time, among them Robert Bork, columnist Robert Novak, Kansas senator Sam Brownback, Larry Kudlow, Newt Gingrich, as well as lesser-known figures like right-wing publisher Alfred Regnery. Fox News host Laura Ingraham credits Opus DeiCconnected lawyer Pat Cipollone with her conversion.A great deal has been written this year about the resurgence of the Catholic right in America. This is not President Bidens liberal Catholicism. In surveys, American Catholics as a whole are firmly in the mainstream in their political opinions, from contraception to divorce, gay marriage to abortion rights. But there is an elite vanguard on the rise that holds much more conservative views  many of these elites have some association with Opus Dei  and has sought to influence policies that might be enacted in a second Trump presidency. The now-infamous Project 2025 was cooked up under the auspices of the Heritage Foundations conservative Catholic and Opus DeiCconnected president, Kevin Roberts. All three of the Trump-appointed Roe-wrecking Supreme Court justices (two of whom are Catholic) got there thanks in part to the tireless dark-money-funded efforts of the right-wing Catholic Leonard Leo, a major CIC donor who has also become the go-to conservative disburser of anonymously donated big bucks to political causes. The three other justices in the Dobbsmajority are hard-right Catholics. Beyond the high court, current and former Washington power lawyers and influencers have Opus Dei connections.Now Leo and his fellow crusaders have a chance to not only remake the Supreme Court in their image but also the White House itself. J.D. Vances path to conversion began with Opus DeiCconnected priests and other converts, starting with Rod Dreher, a convert himself and post-liberal writer staunchly opposed to gay marriage. Dreher has since moved from the U.S. to live in Viktor Orbns Hungary, where he works for the Danube Institute. Dreher has approvingly compared Vance to a young Orbn.Meanwhile, Leo recently promised to spend $1 billion of his dark-money war chest to crush liberal dominance.Religion News Service - [A new book chronicles the behind-the-scenes Christian nationalism of Opus Dei](https://religionnews.com/2024/10/07/a-new-book-chronicles-the-behind-the-scenes-christian-nationalism-of-opus-dei/)Having definitively lost the culture wars on these very issues, they have in recent years turned to nondemocratic means to pursue their religious agenda. Their motto is: If you cant persuade them, strong-arm them.Weve rarely seen conservative Catholics organizing in this way. Instead, using dark money and behind-the-scenes political manipulation, they have put a Catholic majority on the Supreme Court  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, with Neil Gorsuch, an Episcopal fellow traveler who was raised conservative Catholic. When Roe v. Wade fell to the Dobbs decision, not a single white evangelical vote was involved.Opus Deis own documents say that its mission in the United States is to re-Christianize America  by which they do not mean accommodating Christians of all stripes.But according to Gore, Opus Dei has cultivated powerful politicians, academics and the wealthy to pursue its dream of cultural domination. He documents the groups close ties to Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society major domo who drew up a list of potential Supreme Court nominees for candidate Trump and succeeded in placing three on the high bench.","title":"The Catholics in Trumps administration could take GOP in whole new direction"},{"text":"The same reason CNN settled with Nicholas Sandmann--corporate media not only doesn't defend 'free press,' they actively concede freedom.","title":"Why ABC News settled with Donald Trump for 15 million."},{"text":"Or, almost worse: The Trump National Yosemite Golf Resort.

We *have* to oppose him in order to prevent a larger wrong, and trying to victim blame liberals is a ridiculous tactic.Further, you seem to be fixated on and irrationally angry about one specific thing I said rather than my argument as a whole, which is that the entire ethos of our country is that anyone can come here and make a better life for themselves. Unless you're a Native American, at some point your ancestors adopted that ethos and came here. America is an idea as much as it is a chunk of land. Our culture doesn't date back to time immemorial. We don't commonly descend from a specific tribe of antiquity. It was built relatively recently as a new nation, conceived in liberty. Saying \\"Oh, you're not a *real* American, so you can't follow the American Dream\\" doesn't make any fucking sense. It would be like saying \\"Oh, you're not a *real* vegan because your parents weren't vegan.\\" In my book, if you come here seeking opportunity and promise to play nice (and categorically saying all illegal immigrants are criminals when their only crime is illegally immigrating is a tautological mess), you're an American.","title":"Trump plan to end birthright citizenship is more conceivable in second term"},{"text":"There were trucks with a decal covering the entire tailgate that made it look like Biden was chained up lying in the bed of the truck.

They courted nonexistent republican defectors instead of focusing on progressives. Yes, the deck was stacked against them in a major way but if it's truly stacked to the extent that you can't beat the worst candidate in history then it's already a wrap in my opinion.Liberal democracies are beginning to crumble because the people want change. The systems aren't working for them. Liberalism isn't about up ending the status quo, it's about maintaining it and making marginal improvements. Conservative populism promises the change people so desperately want but lies about what it'll give them. Populism is the way things are heading and if liberals don't adapt to that then we're in for another dark age. My personal theory is that the oligarchs have already won and are starting our slide into neo serfdom. I was hoping that covid would help level the playing field but it seems to have had the opposite effect.Look, I get that the economy was good on paper and inflation was wrangled pretty much perfectly, but they weren't screaming it from the rooftops every chance they got like they should've. I don't even know if that would've mattered, to be honest, because I think the vast majority of people don't give two shits about policy or nuance. Trump won because he said he'd make groceries cheaper. Didn't say how, just that he would. That tells you a lot. It also doesn't help that it comes across as out if touch to tell people that can barely afford to eat that the economy is actually doing really well.

There is currently no legal way for Trump to become president for a third time.It's worth mentioning that the constitution was amended to include this less than 100 years ago. It's not something that's been a fact of life for America's entire existence. There are people alive today who were around to witness FDR's fourth term. It was only then that the Republicans spearheaded an effort to change the constitution to limit president's to two terms because they were afraid of losing to the Dems so hard again. Spineless Dems went along with it to make up the 2/3rds majority. Here's my fear-mongering scenario: Supreme Court says no person can be *elected* to office of President twice. The only way to become president without being elected is through the line of succession. A president who's been elected twice, cannot run for Vice-President, however the 3rd person in line for the Presidency is the Speaker of the House. If Trump were somehow able to pressure the GOP to make him Speaker of the House, and then somehow pressured the President and Vice President to step-down, he could theoretically be president for a third time if the Supreme Court agreed with his literal, word-for-word interpretation of the 22nd Amendment.","title":"Steve Bannon Is Already Claiming Trump Can Run Again in 2028"},{"text":"Wed better keep his security deposit!","title":"Biden admin quietly clears away border wall parts for auction ahead of Trumps second term"},{"text":"Well, the \\"problem\\" that Democrats have is that they want two more Democratic senators, and retrocession doesn't do anything but make Maryland slightly bluer.
