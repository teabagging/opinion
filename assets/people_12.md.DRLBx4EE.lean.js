What's the first thing they teach you about economics?   What sets price?     It's supply and demand.Supply and demand.   Not cost.     Cost can make a business not worth doing, but it doesn't change the price a good can be sold for in the market.Fundamentally in your thought process it goes \\"I would like to make the same profit, so if I am paying more, I will raise my prices.\\"     But \\"Making sure I make x dollars per sale\\" isn't how the price of anything works.      They charge whatever they can get away with.   The real thought process is \\"how much can I get away with charging.\\" and then working backwards to \\"how can I keep my costs as low as possible?\\"Or to put it another way, do you really think if McDonalds could charge you 50 dollars a burger and stay competitive, they wouldn't do it?This is also why all the mergers and consolidations for the last 40ish years have really hurt the american worker and consumer.     The whole reason markets and capatilism work is because of competition, and we've removed almost all competition from our markets.    in the 80s, there were several hundred media companies that split the market.     Today, 6 media companies control over 90% of it.   Two soda brands control 97.2% of the soft drink market.      When you have 1 competitor, you don't even have to price fix.   You can just assume the other company will match you to increase their profit.

It would spark the largest global depression in history. I am being grave serious when I promise you we would never see the US as a global superpower - or even a regional power - again. It's not just that the interest rates are higher. The vast majority of global trade is denoted in USD because it's the safest store of wealth in the globe. The Federal Reserve would no longer be able to fund the FDIC or the NCUSIF (the credit union equivalent). This will cause massive bank panics. The Federal government would no longer be able to fund at any level beyond the most minimal options. We wouldn't be able to afford to maintain the social programs, park system, regulatory body, or even the US military. Ever realize how rarely we hear about cargo ships getting hijacked, confiscated, stolen, blown up, etc.? That's because the US Navy protects the global waters for trade. We'll even put soldiers on those cargo ships or provide escorts to protect them if necessary, even if they're foreign ships coming to and going from foreign ports. We'd no longer be able to do so. Global trade is denoted in USD. Why? Because the dollar is backed by the US government and Treasury bills. These are considered the safest store of wealth in the globe. The US has never defaulted, it's a liquid cash equivalent, it's predictable, and it's quite literally used as the definition of \\"risk-free return\\". A default will lose this status and cause a panic as investors and traders would no longer be able to appropriately complete price discovery. A default would hurt everyone globally, even China.

Understanding why higher taxes are an issue for billionaires will add further context to your knowledge. I will add further points below -1. Historical tax rates and general math around it- US practices incremental tax rates. Before Ronald Reagan the top bracket used to pay as high as  ~70% taxes. I am using the numbers ad an example so don't quote for accuracy but understand. So if you made a billion dollars your income above say 400k would be taxed at 70%. Last time Elon musk revealed how much he paid in taxes someone pointed out that he paid only 11% of his annual income. So increasing the taxes for people making above 400k was an actual issue for Biden and democrats to run with. For context, Above 400k income individual is among top 5% approx. earners of US. I think increasing the tax rate for people above 400k year would greatly help the economy of US and will help bring needed equality. And can actually cause a significant dent in the money and power billionaires have.\\n2. \\"Power is power.\\" - Cersei Lannister. And I agree with Cersei. We have an understanding in US elections money is a continuous source of power. If There are elections in US every two years so maintaining the control of the US elected leaders is driving a lot of spending on elections and controlling the leaders. So if there is a place where they might have less money to spend then they will be unhappy about it.3. Greed cannot be underestimated and they are not idiots. Billionaires don't even donate without getting something in return.  - ( watch John Oliver episode on philanthropy of billionaires). Even spending a few millions more Bezos can staff warehouses well enough to give the workers break for going to toilet. This would also help the workers he makes money from happy. You think he will be happy with increased taxes causing him inconveniences and reduced spending? There is a reason why Koch brothers et al fought to ensure that elections can be bought and that too by spending money.  Lobbying is not free speech it's actually bribing in a fancy dress.4. Do watch documentaries like Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich as well. It will further add context.","title":"Reclusive billionaire heir Timothy Mellon gave $125 million to help elect Trump, even more than Elon Musk donated"},{"text":"It appears that over a decades-long career, Homan was a police officer in New York, a US Border Patrol agent, and a special agent with the INS before Obama appointed him to ICE.

The state tried prison labor, but that didn't pan out. So they quietly rescinded their anti immigrant policy and invited the immigrants back in.I don't know the answer to this.  Vance says we need to stop letting all immigrants in. He ranted against the legally  hired Haitian workers in his own state. ( They're eating cats and dogs!)  He says they are keeping wages low, keeping housing prices high. I don't get this one - houses are pretty much built by immigrant labor where I live.  As to low wages, Vance invested in a greenhouse in appalachia where the work was so brutal and the wages so low, Americans refused to work there. They brought in migrants. People have gotten used to cheap products, cheap food. Is it morally alright to use immigrants that suffer low wages and abuse?   If not,  are we ok with paying 10$ for a tomato? Who knows how much for a roof.  Att hired all immigrants to lay cable in my neighborhood. The people doing lawn maintenance are all immigrants.

Yes, realistically it is a bad idea, but reason why it is a bad idea aren't sexy and are easy to be dismissed.IDK why you are ignoring that point when it is the main issue with America deserves a raise campaign. You leave yourself open to questions of 'How would you give US a raise' and 'Who will pay for it' that don't have good answers. Raising minimum wage can be easily reflected by stories of small businesses who are struggling with payroll and question of payment opens you to being labeled as government that wants to raise taxes.In reality with large parts of voters at the same time fearing gov't overreach and suffering from bad economy, promise of better pay is not going to win you elections if you don't have a sound plan. And any sound plan would be scary for a large part of population.Only way to break that cycle would be to not aim at the economic issues from the side of pay, but from the side of labor protections.

People can believe what they want about the DNC not wanting him around, but the reality is that he wins too few states by too small a margin, while getting annihilated south of the Mason Dixon line. It hasn't been a winning issue then, there's little reason to believe that's what's going to push voters over the finish line in 2026/28. Second. A lot can happen in a couple years. Especially with Trump in the Whitehouse. Democrats managed to flip the House despite steady economic growth and a tax cut. Two years later, they had control over everything. The party's economic messaging never changed. It was the electorate souring on the party and president - fair or not. It's entirely possible we'll see a similar crisis, flip at least the House back to Blue in a couple years.  And third. There's the candidate. Harris ended up quitting the 2020 Primaries before they even got started. And ended up losing states in this election despite those same states electing Democrat Senators (AZ) and Governors (NC). That's reason enough to believe that there's a candidate problem - not a policy one. Barack Obama didn't win 2 elections on policy, he won it because he was following the Bush Administration and just happened to be the most charming guy to run for office since Regan. The Party needs a new face. There's plenty of roads to victory for Dems in the future. No reason to hitch the wagon to a proven loser this early in the game.Edit: formatting","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"It was probably rigged this time as well, they just got the formula wrong.

And as your own source says:During the previous summer, the Trump administration's \\"zero tolerance\\" policy of separating immigrant parents from their children was so widely rejected by both political parties that even First Lady Melania Trump took the unusual step of repudiating it. In response to the backlash, U.S. President Donald Trump (falsely) pinned the blame for the child-separation policy on his predecessor, Barack Obama.-One year later, amid an ongoing national crisis of conscience over immigrant children incarcerated in detention facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Trump again attempted to pin the blame on his predecessor. -Trump also attempted to deflect outrage over photographs of immigrant children being kept in \\"cages\\" by asserting, \\"Obama built the cages. I didn't build them. Obama built them\\"\\nJust so we're clear here - this Trump supporter is using an article about how Trump deflected from criticism about his twisted family separation policy with \\"But Obama built detention centers!\\" - to deflect from a discussion about Trump's twisted family separation policy, by pointing out that Obama built detention centers.This is how little they care about anyone else.  As long it helps Trump, everything goes for them.2nd edit: And despite what the person above says in their other comments, taking children from the parents was 100% intentional.

So that I can vote for Trump again."},{"text":"You make some solid points, but there are a lot of problems with this platform especially if you run it like a Democrat. I'll explain what I mean.1: A minimum wage on a federal level is a bad idea. Because each state has a vastly different cost of living. For example if I am looking to buy a house in West Virginia it's going to be around $150,000. If I am looking for a similar house in California it will be in the $750,000 price range.If we set the Federal Minimum wage to \\"What best fits California\\" then West Virginia is going to have everyone losing their jobs, and becoming homeless.If we set the Federal Minimum wage to \\"What best fits West Virginia\\" Then people in California are going to be getting underpaid and struggling more. They would be able to find work, but it would not be good paying jobs.Because of this States, or even just counties should be the level of government that is setting their own minimum wage levels.2: Your plan doesn't call for any form of \\"Energy Independence\\". This is very key for a healthy economy. Everything is shipped, and reducing shipping costs is always beneficial for the economy. To improve the economy you may have to make some environmental concessions. Being less environmentally friendly goes against the Democrat ticket. Democrats often oppose any sort of new pipeline or fracking for instance. So catering to environmentalism will always make the economy suffer. So, this will cause in fighting in the Democrats.3: Illegal Immigration is a major concern for many American voters. Democrats have the perception of being limp wristed and ineffective on border policy. The massive influx of illegals also takes jobs away from Americans. Not only that, but they also must compete over other resources like food, and shelter.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"Question from an outsider...Can trump fire him and he is out the building or is there some sort of legal steps to do first?As trump is about causing chaos","title":"If Trump Tries to Fire Powell, Fed Chair Is Ready for a Legal Fight"},{"text":"Get off the cross, we need the wood.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"They won both waysGot paid to endorse Harris.

And problems continued long after 1946, after all in1968 the current communist government of Poland did raise an antisemitic campaign that was quite successful. It is worth noting that the reason for those was the same as any other problems with xenophobia - people were suffering and bought a lie about \\"them\\" being responsible. Those who are labeled as \\"them\\" change from time to time, because they are just an useful scapegoat to push for some agenda - whether it would be raising power of magnates, consolidating power via false unity or any different agenda/aim.That is why Eastern Europe does not have the \\"right\\" to be xenophobic and in reality no one has \\"right\\" to - because this is only a lie fed by oppressors to get power and exert control.

Economic plans that are simple and make sense to normal people. Most people know if you raise minimum wage, it raises inflation specifically on those who purchase minimum wage created products, because business raise prices to account for it.  You get paid more, things cost more. It's basic common sense most people understand. This is food to name the most important one. You cannot raise minimum wage, you have to find ways to lower prices, create competition between corporations, and stop the monopolies that exist in basically every single sector of private industry now.  Incentivize being a business owner, small business owner, etc. Raising minimum wage is a naive and childlike idea.2. Wars overseas need to stop or we stop being involved. The normal citizen doesn't want to see a shitshow after a hurricane from the feds sending a pittance of bullshit to families, while sending a bazillion dollars to ukraine and israel.3. They need a plan to stop illegal immigration, without trying to poison pill the bill to allow amnesty to millions and millions of people.  Everyone normal knows why they want to give amnesty to millions.  (This should be an easy get for Dems at this point knowing that hispanics are leaning more Republican on this topic, they will switch their stance sooner or later anyway... easy get).4. Stop taking certain demographics extremists seriously.  Can't be more specific because you aren't allowed to have opinions on it on this sub or you get banned.

It is a cost like any other, and has to be covered like any other.So if wages were mandated to be raised across the board in a significant manner, hiring in the USA stops and prices rise as employers compensate for higher costs. So inflation, people make more, but the higher wages buy less.And given inflation under Biden, and the tone deaf attitude his administration had in it, I believe this was a reason Harris was beaten soundly by Trump. The truth was that prices were lower under Trump, and people had an easier time of paying the bills.So the winning message is to raise the minimum wage to help those who need it most, because few actually make minimum wage by percentage, but to really push for a lower cost of living.Democrats would do well to change their tactic from what it has been and focus on making life more affordable without policies that can and would be called inflationary.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"I felt bad for that mic","title":"Karmas a bitch"},{"text":"\\"Across the board, the economy was a top issue for Latino voters in this election\\" who will, going forward, have to spend much of their hard-earned money making sure all of their citizenship verification paperwork is current and organized since they will be stopped and processed every time they leave the house.

The antichrist and destroyer of Hope and democracy?They came out last time when the polls had Biden winning in a blowout..... But they didn't come out this time when the polls were neck and neck and they were begging for votes to beat Trump and saying how close it was? If in the next election..... If JD Vance gets 75-80 million votes and the Democratic candidate gets about the same as Kamala but a bit more in line with  population inflation..... If we can't replicate something close to Biden's performance, at what point do we admit that there was funny business in 2020?And this is Biden we are talking about. The guy that was wildly unpopular as Obama's VP and took the blame for a lot of things..... He's not some beloved figure that you can believe blew the doors off the barn....They defended Biden's results by saying that people hated Trump so much that they showed up in force to vote against Trump...So what? After J6th and the felonies? Democrats are less threatened by Trump and didn't show up?","title":"Elon Musk and Trump Allies Back Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader"},{"text":"Its wild that there are people out there who still dont think that if you stay a few extra feet away from some who is sick, it will help you not get sick either.","title":"Extreme rhetoric from Mike Flynn retruthed by Trump today"},{"text":"So all the comparison between Nazis/Hitler and the Republicans were just flat out propaganda/lies to influence voting?

Some battles should not be fought in order to win the war.  Progressives never understand this and need to scream for everything.

They used to support bathroom access and medical treatment being available for adults but I'm not sure anymore cause the country has been shifting right cause of how far you guys have been pushing for sports which they do not support.  And cause now we will have a president against it.Trump took advantage of the sports disagreement and now adults will even be losing medical care.  He has promised an executive order limiting federal financial aid for gender affirming care which essentially will force many medical facilities to stop providing it.  And transgender are worse off than if progressives had just kept their mouths shut over the items in the first place.just an FYI, kids cannot get nearly all items (ie cancer treatment, psycological care, etc) you mentioned above  in nearly all US states, even blue and putple ones.  So why were you fighting for transgender getting special treatment instead of the more inclusive and less controversial fight of letting kids get medical treatment in certain cases without parental permission?

Impose a few inconsequential tariffs, throw out some illegal immigrants, and launch a PR campaign around those. His voters would eat it right up, and claim declare a huge victory. After that he can pretty much retire to the golf course, while other people are packing the courts. But I suspect he's so fixated on tariffs that he can't see straight. I figure that with China going to a debt crisis, Trump imagines he can strong-arm China into unfavorable trade deal. If China calls his bluff or injures his ego, he could very well start a full-scale trade war - just for spite. Same with immigration. It's one of those policies that he can enact by a pen stroke, without being actively part of it - all the policing will be handled locally. If/when local police won't cooperate with him, he'll feel offended and lash out on those states. It's a damn shame that so much of the upcoming Trump policies hinge on his day-to-day mood, and whether or not his ego has been bruised.

Most of them still won't want to manufacture in the USA and some raw materials must be imported no matter what because they just can't be sourced here. He should stick to the tariffs that are for national security (example, push chip manufacturing back to the USA) and penalize industries that already have the ability to easily pivot to manufacture in the USA but refuse to. Forcing the American consumer to pay more won't bother corporations and won't light a fire under them to change anything. Basically, yeah, a 60% tariff means you will pay 60% more at the store. The corporations aren't going to take the blow for you and they can't absorb 60% even if they wanted to. Where the money made on tariffs will go, I'm unsure. No one has said.

Four months later, the board of directors pressured him to resign as chairman and CEO.[42] He was succeeded by Thomas F. Frist Jr.[43] Scott was paid $9.88 million in a settlement, and left owning 10 million shares of stock then worth more than $350 million.[44][45][46] The directors had been warned in the company's annual public reports to stockholders that incentives Columbia/HCA offered doctors could run afoul of a federal anti-kickback law passed in order to limit or eliminate instances of conflicts of interest in Medicare and Medicaid.[43]During Scott's 2000 deposition, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment 75 times.[47] In settlements reached in 2000 and 2002, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and agreed to a $600+ million fine in what was at the time the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history. Columbia/HCA admitted systematically overcharging the government by claiming marketing costs as reimbursable, by striking illegal deals with home care agencies, and by filing false data about use of hospital space. It also admitted to fraudulently billing Medicare and other health programs by inflating the seriousness of diagnoses and to giving doctors partnerships in company hospitals as a kickback for the doctors referring patients to HCA. It filed false cost reports, fraudulently billed Medicare for home health care workers, and paid kickbacks in the sale of home health agencies and to doctors to refer patients.

Are they forced to prevent their children from marrying the undesirable ethnicity? Not to mention that racism has well documented effects on individuals, societies, and governance.

And paying our tax money to do so is like doubling our losses (we pay for the operation as well as lose tax revenue from those who are deported).  What would be much, much smarteris to develop pathways for those who qualify to earn legal status and become full tax contributors.  But no, instead youd rather get on here and heartlessly, mindlessly, ignorantly celebrate forcefully deporting whole families.","title":"Trump expected to announce hes hiring Tom Homan, his former acting ICE director"},{"text":"What Trump Has Promised to Do on Day 1:Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one","title":"Trump pressures candidates for Senate GOP leader to fill his Cabinet right away"},{"text":"For a very long time in many areas of the United States, it was perfectly legal to kill me in a fit of passion and illegal for me to attempt to prevent it.

Our bodies are biologically adapted to both plant and animal-based diets. Our ancestors were hunter-gatherers who relied on a combination of plant foods and animal protein for survival. In many ways, eating meat has been integral to human evolution, providing essential nutrients like protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are difficult to obtain from plant sources alone. As such, meat consumption has played a significant role in the development of human societies and civilizations.Second, while factory farming practices are undeniably harsh and inhumane, it is possible to source meat from ethical and sustainable farming practices. Many small-scale farms and regenerative agriculture practices emphasize animal welfare, allowing animals to live in more natural environments where they are treated with respect and dignity. Ethical meat consumption, in this context, supports farmers who prioritize humane practices, and it can reduce the demand for factory-farmed meat, encouraging more responsible agricultural practices.Furthermore, the argument that plant-based alternatives are abundant and accessible overlooks several practical considerations. For many people, especially in rural or low-income areas, access to fresh, nutritious plant-based foods can be limited, and for some, plant-based diets may not provide the same level of satisfaction or nutrition as meat. In some regions of the world, meat consumption is not just a matter of choice but a necessity due to limited agricultural resources or the lack of access to diverse plant-based foods.Additionally, theres an argument that humans have a responsibility to use the resources at their disposal in a sustainable way, which includes consuming animals. If we are going to utilize animals for food, it is important to do so in a manner that ensures their treatment is as humane as possible. The focus should be on improving the conditions in which animals are raised and slaughtered, ensuring that the process minimizes suffering, rather than advocating for a complete eradication of meat consumption.Lastly, the argument that eating meat is hypocritical because some people condemn the treatment of certain animals but not others overlooks the complex nature of human moral reasoning. People often have varying degrees of empathy for different species based on factors like sentience, social structures, and cultural significance. For example, some may have a strong emotional connection to pets like dogs, while others may not view farm animals in the same way. This doesnt necessarily imply hypocrisy but rather reflects the complexity of human morality and the difficulty of balancing the treatment of different animals.In conclusion, while the ethical treatment of animals is a crucial issue, the argument that eating meat is inherently disgusting and depraved oversimplifies the complex relationship between humans and animals. Meat consumption has deep roots in human history and culture, and when sourced responsibly, it can be a part of a balanced and sustainable diet. The focus should be on improving animal welfare standards and encouraging more sustainable agricultural practices, rather than condemning meat-eating outright.","title":"cmv: eating meat is one of the most disgusting and depraved things someone can do"},{"text":"Check out r/expat \\nIt just depends on the country.. you skill set .. some have bloodline citizenship.. work visas some welcome remote workers  you can get a gig teaching English in some countries missionary.. \\nsome will accept retired people with guaranteed income..","title":"Self deportation will be in the millions says Vivek Ramaswamy"},{"text":"Is it fair for you to judgeFuck, yes, it is fair for me to judge.

He was born in the 30s, educated in the 40s &amp; 50s, &amp; started a mid-level insurance job with practically no mobility. After working that job throughout the 60s, and along with my grandmother who was a public school teacher, he was able to finance &amp; open up his own independent agency. He wasnt exactly Scrooge McDuck, but he did well enough to have a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood as well as a vacation home, and that was with 5 children to feed. His sole employee, a secretary, had two children &amp; owned a 3 bedroom house with a pool along with two daily drivers &amp; a summer convertible. By the time he stepped away, Id say he retired with around $2 million; his secretary eventually moved herself down to Floridas gulf area. He was still a relatively rich man, but what is impressive to me is the fact that this was actually seen as feasible; basically the pinnacle of the American dream (both parents died before he was 3; he grew up in extreme poverty). We might call people like this self-made, but he had different advantages: New-Deal era, a strong social safety net, quality public education, affordable higher education, and all of the stuff that helped people along the way. His children had that too, and they all went on to be successful. Then, he started voting it all away in the 80s, and that $2 million or so I mentioned got sliced upon the crash of 07-08 after all of the fellas he voted for decided to deregulate the fuck out of the insurance &amp; securities sectors.

I cannot stomach the thought of enabling their hypocrisy, specifically their ability to perform acts that harm us one day, then show up to congratulate us and share in our joy the best day.Normally, i'd agree. But over the last few days, i've had conversations with people about the elections and it changed my mind on it forever.You make a good point, it seems hypocritical to vote for republicans and simultaneously attend a same sex marriage, if you take these stances in a vacuum. But, when you're voting, you're voting for so much more than just whether you think same sex marriage is ok or not. For many people, this probably doesn't even play a part in their decision.The issue with the US voting system is that you've only got *two* parties to vote for, that doesn't allow much leeway for nuances in your views to surface. When you're having a conversation with someone, and they tell you they vote democrat, people tend to automatically assume that they agree with every single democratic stance. This is often not the case. When you're voting, you're not voting just for Kamala or Trump, you're voting for the entire prebuilt coalition of parties that fall into the republican party or democratic party. It's a conglomeration of soooo many different views, opinions and ideals, that you can't, and shouldn't automatically assume that one holds a particular stance when they tell you they vote one way or the other. You can't conclude that untill you speak to them personally, because when you vote republican, you're not just voting for same sex marriage rights, you're also voting for economic policies, immigration policies, etc etc. It's a hard sell to tell someone to just give up on their vision of what will benefit the country and vote the diametrically opposite way because of a couple stances they don't even necessarily agree with.Here in the Netherlands, we have a different system that imo, works much better, although it still has it's issues. We have many parties, each with their own policies, representation and such, that all run for office. The coalition doesn't get formed untill after the vote results for this pool of parties come in. Allowing for much more nuanced views. Let's say for example that we've got two parties, they both have the same economic policies but one supports same sex marriage and the other doesn't. We can just vote for the party that supports same sex marriage and have the best of both worlds. In your system, that's not an option. You'd have to sacrifice your views on economics and so many other policies in order to appease this one stance (same sex marriage) so you become stuck between a rock and a hard place.So i'd say, have a word with these people individually if you can, as it's not at all ensured that they hold the beliefs you think they do.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Never in my life have a seen a guy fail upwards like Rick Scott.

Your anger and frustration are understandable, especially in the face of potential legal and social setbacks. However, lets think about the broader implications of your decision.First, is it possible that by excluding these family members, you could unintentionally deepen the divide and reinforce their views, making future dialogue or reconciliation harder? Could there be another way to address your concerns, perhaps by engaging with them about the issue before the wedding, explaining your feelings and the stakes involved in a more personal conversation? If they understand how their political actions directly impact you, would that be more meaningful than simply asking them not to attend?On the other hand, could you argue that your wedding is a deeply personal event and that you have every right to decide who shares in your joy? If their actions directly threaten your right to marry and, by extension, your happiness, might it feel morally inconsistent or even painful to have them present? Does your desire for a peaceful day and the chance to celebrate your union outweigh the potential for family conflict?Would it also be worth considering that this moment, as significant as it is, might be part of a larger ongoing struggle for equality and recognition? Could it be possible that by standing firm, you set a precedent for others in your family to reconsider their stance in the future?Lastly, in light of your fiancs concerns about family fallout, could it be possible to find a middle ground? Is there room for compromise, such as having a small, more intimate ceremony with your nuclear family and closer friends, and then hosting a larger reception or celebration where these family members might not be the primary focus?","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"He is already the president based on how things are unfolding on the international stage.

They have historically been the spearheads that made cars get progressively worse, over time. CARB has historically been way more aggressive on regulations than the EPA, and that has always given the EPA an excuse to enact regulations over all 50 states, often citing Well, theyre already doing it in CaliforniaThis has made cars progressively worse. The reality is that not everyone wants an EV and EVs are not necessarily the best fit for everyone. And the tailpipe emissions standards have added extra complexity onto cars that has ended up making them less reliable. Issues like turbos overpressurizing and blowing blocks or wrecked main bearings at 10k miles or blown head gaskets at 10k miles..that just didnt happen when you could get a reasonably priced naturally aspirated V6 that had reasonable power and fuel economy and was easy to service and reliable.Or being overzealous with the types of refrigerants allowed, to force everyone to buy brand new air conditioners that cost $10k more than their predecessors because the new Freon is flammable and requires extra safety systems.Like I said, California can do California all day.

Social science reports that assess the objective outcomes for children raised in homes aside from a heterosexual, intact marriage are clear: All other family forms involve higher levels of instability (the average length of same-sex marriages is half that of heterosexual marriages); financial stress or poverty; and poor behavioral, psychological, or educational outcomes.For the sake of child well-being, **programs should affirm that children require and deserve both the love and nurturing of a mother and the play and protection of a father.** Despite recent congressional bills like the Respect for Marriage Act that redefine marriage to be the union between any two individuals, HMRE program grants should be available to faith-based recipients who affirm that marriage is between not just any two adults, but one man and one unrelated woman.\\nGiven the context of Heritages previous and ongoing stance on same-sex marriage, Trumps and his staffers association with the group, and the past success rate adopting Heritage policies, its hardly fear-mongering to suggest theyd like to undo gay marriage.Americas religious liberty is under attack with this impending vote in the Senate,\\" [said Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts](https://www.heritage.org/press/heritage-foundation-heritage-action-launch-13-million-ad-campaign-highlight-religious-liberty). \\"This legislation does not add one additional benefit to same-sex couples in the United States; its an attack that sets the stage to take rights away from people of faith.

I, for example, would never be able to excel in any of a good number of disciplines, because I'm not tall enough. Does this bother me? No. I can still enter competitions, if I want, I'll just never be part of the national team.But it highlights one fundamental problem with sports: No matter, how hard you train, your draw in the genetic lottery will have a significant impact on your performance. This is especially obvious in the difference between \\"XX\\" and \\"XY\\" chromosome pairs. \\"XX\\" chromosome persons have, on average, less strength than \\"XY\\" persons. The traditional solution is to have those groups compete in separate \\"womens\\" and \\"mens\\" competitions. It's still not fair, there are a lot of \\"XX\\" people who's bodies are better suited for, say, basketball, than that of short \\"XY\\" people. Unless we can fine-sort athletes into groups with similar genetic advantages (and how would we do that?), sports will always be \\"unfair\\".Is there a good solution? No. We could get rid of the \\"women\\" and \\"men\\" split and have all compete in the same class with the result that XY persons would dominate in almost all disciplines. If we don't want to do that, then maybe we should not split the athletes into \\"men\\" and \\"women\\" groups, which, being binary, does not reflect the spectrum of sexual identities anyway. Instead, maybe we should make it a \\"XX\\" / \\"XY\\" split. This is still not ideal, due to the inhomogeneity within the groups, but unless we get rid of professional competitive sports altogether, it's probably the best solution.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"Well.Bye","title":"Trump says goodbye to Nikki and Pompeo"},{"text":"Seriously?

I'm no Trump supporter, but on LGBT issues he's actually been huge not only in generally supporting them but getting his supporters who seem to think he's the second coming to agree with him. You cited a poll that said only 46% support same sex marriage, I saw a poll that said it was just over 50%, but I'm sure that's just within the margin of error. The point is, close to 50% of Republicans support same sex marriage. Want to know how long ago only 50% of Democrats supported same sex marriage? 2008. Today that number's up to 83%. It's also worth noting that 25% of LGBT people are registered Republicans. So if Republican is a bridge too far, you will be excluding a good number of LGBT people from your wedding as well.  \\nBut at the end of the day it's your wedding and you and your fianc are the ones that get to choose. If voting for Republicans, even though half of Republicans support same sex marriage, is a bridge too far for you, it's your wedding. At the end of the day it's your day, and if having people who support politicians who tend to oppose same sex marriage, even though they have absolutely no ability to do so, is a bridge too far, then honestly that's completely fine. I'm in an interracial marriage, and if one party had language in their platform at the state level opposing interracial marriage, I would have felt a bit weird inviting them too, even if there was no chance interracial marriages were ending any time soon. You're the ones paying for it, you get to decide who will be around you on what will likely be one of the best days of your life.  \\n  \\n  \\nBut consider the fact that if they're accepting an invitation to attend your wedding, they at the very least support your gay marriage. And also consider that although it may sting, they didn't necessarily vote against your right to marry. They more than likely voted for things like lower taxes, opposition to illegal immigration which they saw as a grave threat to the country (I disagree with that, but that's for another post), a stronger foreign policy which would equate to fewer wars (again disagree but trying to explain their side), and maybe they read the party platform on gay marriage and said \\"well the supreme court ruled on it, Trump removed opposition to gay marriage from the national platform, states don't get to decide that anyway, so I'm not going to vote for the candidate who wants to get us into more wars, raise my taxes, and allow open borders so illegal immigrant criminals can come and make my family less safe and take my job merely to make sure same sex marriage stays legal as it will either way\\". Again if voting Republican is too far for you, you can make that decision to not invite them. But just remember you might also risk making not only the wedding but your future life much more wrapped up in politics than it needs to be. When I look back at my wedding pictures, I think of all the people who loved and supported us. There are plenty of people there who I massively disagree with politically. But that's not what the day was about. The day was about celebrating my wife and I as well as our families coming together to become one single family. And honestly my wedding day is the best day of my life so far. The amount of love and happiness we got from people who are die hard Trump supporters when both my wife and I are anything but that wasn't diminished in the slightest. So maybe think about putting politics aside for one day and inviting anyone who is interested in coming to celebrate you and the person you're going to commit to sharing a life with for the rest of the short time you have on this earth. Or again, if it really is a bridge too far, you also shouldn't feel like you have to invite people who will make you feel uncomfortable on what will hopefully be the best day of your life.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"None of the 3 who are mentioned as potential leaders should be picked.

They then resent that offer to the millions on the email list NINE TIMES over the next two weeks.From a NYT investigation into the emails:Since former President Donald J. Trump announced his 2024 candidacy, his campaign has promoted dozens of contests for supporters to win signed merchandise or V.I.P. trips to meet Mr. Trump. It has offered adherents myriad exclusive opportunities to join clubs to give counsel to Mr. Trump, and it has repeatedly claimed that Mr. Trump is personally reviewing lists of small donors.But most of the contests seem to have no winners, and the campaign did not confirm or provide evidence that the club members have had any opportunity to advise the former president or that Mr. Trump is paying any attention to small donor rosters.His campaign was only able to confirm the name of one winner.I've been marveling at how he could possibly get away with all these blatant lies and scams to raise political funds, and would you look at that... apparently he's been thinking about the same thing. This is obviously a very aggressive move to absolve himself of any backlash from his ethically questionable campaigning, and a way to pave a clear and easy path to carrying out this kind of manipulation moving forward.[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/report-the-trump-campaign-email-sweepstakes-are-possibly-illegal-definitely-cringe](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/report-the-trump-campaign-email-sweepstakes-are-possibly-illegal-definitely-cringe)[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/10/us/politics/trump-campaign-donations-merch.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/10/us/politics/trump-campaign-donations-merch.html)","title":"Robert F.

But neither political party has shown the slightest inclination to break apart large companies, except when they are mad at Silicon Valley software companies for some reason.

He blames all his issues on the left and cries that he won't be getting his social security (he's 55 - lives at home still and will be inheriting his parents house when they pass -  I don't believe congress has the balls to take SoSec away but we shall see) but won't ever vote dem as he told me he's a lifelong conservative and can't ever change.  Apathy is the driving force in all my 50+ trumper friends.  ALL of them see the world as bad.  They get worked up over having Fox on all day long.  They get fired up on Facebook where 20 of them congregate to share shitty memes.  It's a sad thing to witness.  Personally, I'd rather just focus on my life, my wife and the few normal friends I have then spend anymore effort being made miserable by somebody intent on taking it out on me once he's had too much wine.","title":"Extreme rhetoric from Mike Flynn retruthed by Trump today"},{"text":"The concerning thing about people spraying and praying is that enough bullets will eventually hit something.","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy, Dark-horse Secretary of State Candidate"},{"text":"Name one solid policy proposal from Lindner and the FDP in this coalition.","title":"The collapse of Germanys government will delight Trump C and his European friends"},{"text":"Buddy, you probably dont even know how inflation really works and your response is gonna be Well I see my eggs higher than 2017!!!","title":"Vivek Ramaswamy, Dark-horse Secretary of State Candidate"},{"text":"Conservatives tried being quiet.

Additionally, both men and women deal with the possibility that a person of the same sex could act massively inappropriately in those spaces. Any hard and fast rule on this sort of issue will likely create as many problems as it solves.  It is worth discussing for sure.  One of the reasons I think this creates so much division is because for  Trans individuals it is an a direct attack on there ability to participate in society.  If a person who presents as feminine goes into mens restrooms because *that's the law*,  they face the same kinds of risks that people think having Trans women in womens restrooms will cause.

Donald Trump took credit for the vaccines. Donald Trump was close friends with Jeffrey Epstein for over twenty years. Donald Trump (and the majority of Republicans) have very clear ties to Russia which has resulted in multiple indictments of his inner circle including Flynn.The level of cognitive dissonance here is literally insane. The last election cycle Republicans were crying out that Joe Biden was too old to run for office and now Trump is even older than he was back then. Republicans always rail against the \\"East Coast, Ivy League elites\\" running the country while Trump brags about being part of that exact same demographic. At this point the MAGA crowd is so divorced from objective reality there is no reasoning with them and THAT is what makes them so dangerous. When the idiotic policies this incoming administration implements end up disproportionately harming their own base - do you think a pathological narcissistic Donald Trump is going to take ANY accountability? Of course not. Trump will deflect it onto some relatively defenseless scapegoat like the LGBTQ, Muslims, Latinos, etc. and the terminally stupid MAGA mob will blindly believe him. This type of rhetoric is what gets innocent people killed.

It's estimated that less than 100 transgender athletes compete in school sports nationwide, but Republicans would have you believe that it is some widespread, inescapable epidemic. This is what they do. Moral panics, fearmongering campaigns, complete distortions of reality, all for the sake of inciting hatred and vindicating a small faction of conservative's prejudices, phobias and paranoid delusions.Despite all the histrionics from conservatives on social media this election cycle about the radical left's plot to indoctrinate the masses with transgender pedagogy, to perform sex change operations on students and immigrants against their will, to \\"groom\\" children and expose them to pornography in schools, to flood women's sports with men, to force children to attend drag shows, to expose young kids to graphic material in class, to use the education system to recruit children into the LGBTQ movement, to use companies to promote the transgender and gay agenda, so on and so forthdespite all this culture war driven nonsense, voters did not turn out en masse to protect their children from all of these LGBTQ boogeymen.Because it's just a bunch of scare tactics, the same old story told again and again about some liberal agenda to transform American culture into something depraved, abnormal, irreligious, and evil.*I also want to address the hysteria around \\"wokeness.\\" Conservatives claim that it's \\"the left\\" who is obsessed with race, gender identity, but what I see is often the opposite. Where figures on \\"the right\\" constantly condemn \\"woke culture\\" and criticize a liberal, race, gender or DEI related agenda whenever the opportunity presents itself. I see conservatives instigating this culture war conflict disproportionately more than I see liberals living up to these criticisms.*Think about the panic around critical race theory, and how we are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting for parents, albeit accurate. Think about how some conservatives now claim that racism is over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat. Think about the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives haven't even read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think the outrage and panic centered around Bud Light after the company sent a single custom can to a transgender personality. Think about the moral outrage directed at target for selling rainbow sandals and t shirts. These are just a couple of examples where conservatives act like a coalition of liberals got together and forced these things to happenThink about all of the hysteria around \\"DEI.\\"Think about all the race related criticisms that Letitia James received, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.Think about how when gay or black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Think about how when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives rally around them and claim *their* appeal to black people.Thinking about the AI images that circulated over social media of Donald Trump posing with black people.Think about Trump's disingenuous showings at black events, where he sometimes rambles on incoherently about how he's done more for black people than Abraham Lincoln, or remarks that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black.Think about the outrage over litter boxes in schools. Think about how race, and gender identity and sexual orientation in particular are the target of myriad Republican-led legislative efforts.Think about Republicans wanting to roll back civil rights based on sex or gender discrimination.And all the fearmongering propaganda centered around the LGBTQ movement.The fixation on pedophilia and conspiracy theories, their tendency to accuse their opponents of being pedophiles.Think about... Well, the list goes on. The point being, who's really obsessed with race and gender identity?At any rate, this is the Republican M.O., and it's become much more effective lately at riling up a loud minority of seething culture warriors, because misinformation, propaganda, unsubstantiated rumors, clickbait, outrage and hate spreads farther, travels faster, circulates for longer and reaches wider audiences compared to anything resembling the truth. Studies have shown this consistently. Sadly, the truth receives far less engagement.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"At this point my response to said frustrated Americans who voted for him is this is their problem they created so they need to suck it up.

Disinformation is sadly not illegal.  Media of all forms is now so heavily right wing that it's hard to pop the MAGA bubble.There was no fraud, but this certainly wasn't an aboveboard election.  Trump figured out in his first term that if something wasn't explicitly illegal, it was technically legal.  It's why he has so many dog whistles in his speeches, or why he has the people around him say and do the corrupt stuff on his behalf - it creates plausible deniability.  It's why he broke with so many longstanding government precedents, because there were no laws requiring that he follow those precedents.  It's why all the January 6th crimes were so hard to bring to trial, because they don't fall cleanly within the lines of existing criminal law, and ex-post-facto law enforcement is unconstitutional.  It's why he wasn't removed from office after either impeachment, again because his high crimes and misdemeanors weren't clearly and plainly high crimes and misdemeanors.  He's clearly had decades of training on how to skirt the law without breaking it, seeing as he can afford dozens of lawyers at any given time.  In this election, that strategy expanded to everyone around Trump.  Musk's PACs, the disinformation campaigns, the fake text messages with voting misinformation and false claims about Harris' policies, and more - all of it technically not illegal.And of course, his plan is to ensure it stays that way.  He already has a plan to stop the government from calling out disinformation, or from asking social media platforms to highlight disinformation, under claims that it violates the first amendment.  Technically, he's right - the first amendment largely prevents the government from deciding what information can and cannot be shared.  But that means the only check remaining on disinformation is the listener/viewer/user themselves, and we all know that social media algorithms are designed to keep us addicted to the same content over and over and never prompt us to challenge our beliefs.","title":"2024 election inconsistencies"},{"text":"Fed independence is one of the things that keeps the US economy from exploding.
