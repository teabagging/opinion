They call him authoritarian, a threat to democracy, a threat to America, a threat to the environment and peace, and \\"existential\\" threat to this and that. They claim he is in cahoots with Putin to destroy America, and yada yada.  All of this is, of course, nonsense.  But there is a certain time of low information, low IQ person out there that buys into such crap.  It just so happens that this type of individual is dumber than a dick and is easily swayed.  Thus, this type of moron usually votes for Democrats and supports nonsensical, unconstitutional ideas.  So, at present time Trump has been subject to 2 assassination attempts, that we know of.  Steve Scalise almost died due to a crazed leftist goon.  Rand Paul was attacked by an out of control leftist idiot.  Justice Kavanaugh was subject to an assassination plot by some young leftist cuck-boy. The first Trump assassin was a leftist.  The media say we do not know his \\"motivation\\".  LOL!  Uh, yeah, I think we do.  He sure did not choose to go after a Democrat.  Leftist trannies have been shooting up people recently, as have the GOP hating and leftist pro-Hamas and Antifa morons.  MAGA people?  Not so much.  MAGA people have jobs and kids, and down to Earth values.  MAGA people are not brainwashed to be motivated by fear and anger 24-7.  The left can deny it all they want, but the following statements are simply true:1. Leftist hate rhetoric directed at Trump is putting Trump's life in serious danger.2.  Most on the left would be perfectly fine with Trump being assassinated.  3. Trump has done absolutely nothing to create \\"this atmosphere of vitriol\\".  Trump is calling nobody, let alone himself, \\"Hitler\\".  4. Democrat voters tend to be dumber than shit, and ignorant of our nation's history and constitution.  They possess no civic values that are consistent with our nation.  5. The current Trump wannabe assassin appears to be the archetypical weak-minded cuckface retard prone to influence.  Trump never did anything to hurt our nation and our citizens.  In fact, in many ways he improved our lives. But the left is so power-hungry that they are willing to engage in election fraud, defamation, government led propaganda propaganda campaigns, etc... to destroy Trump.  And now, when one or two shit-headed idiots actually take what they say as true and try to harm Trump, they deny blame.  \\"It's not our fault.  Trump created this hostile environment.\\"  To me, this says one thing:  The left wants Trump to be killed.","title":"Trump Unloads on Democrats Over Second Assassination Attempt: 'The Enemy From Within'"},{"text":"Kamala should go too, dont know why a primetime speech in Springfield denouncing all of this shit for the fascist rhetoric that it is isnt already scheduled.","title":"Haitians in Ohio demand apology after chaotic week of false pet-eating claims"},{"text":"Why would they?

This makes people cling more to their jobs even if they dislike them because they fear being unemployed for some time. It is basically some sort of power struggle. ITs like treating a donkey. You want it to pull as much as it can. You also want to minimize food cost and time spent nurturing it. If the donkey were able to work more, you would simply increase its workload.If we look at the 10th century and i would use the donkey metaphor again then i would say that people did not care as much about the donkey. It was ok for the donkey to simply die of exhaustion and there would be no institution in power that would cry much about it. Instead of viewing the donkey as a cog in your machinery, it was possible that they simply saw the donkey an entertainment object. It could very well be that they had fun killing that donkey.

I get a bit tired of the bothsidesism. \\"They're killing your dogs!  They're killing your cats\\" ( and then bomb threats): is this the political violence the writer finds must be condemned?  It's unclear.  As far as I can tell the first would-be assassin was a right wing nutso.  Are the Dems responsible for him?  #2 posts he voted for Trump in 2016; are the Dems \\"responsible\\" for him also?  It seems to me that Trump intentionally whipped up the Jan 6 mob that tried to hang Pence and kill Pelosi.  Is this \\"political violence\\" that must be condemned?  Interestingly, it isn't even mentioned.I appreciate the sentiment and never want to re-experience 1968; I watched the MLK and RFK funerals as a 10 year old.  But this article is incoherent, suggesting that Dems are responsible for the 2 assassinations.  I doubt it.  On the other hand, there is the 12 year history of Trump's incitements to political violence. Choose well, to quote the knight.","title":"Political violence is horrific and must be condemned"},{"text":"Let me stop you right there. You're grasping at straws, desperately trying to draw false equivalencies between two entirely different issues. You claim that both sides are undemocratic, but what you're doing is conflating administrative missteps, party infighting, and procedural flaws with a movement that openly rejects democracy itself. One side is built on the foundation of systemic checks and balances; the other side wants to burn the system down because it didn't serve their interests.You bring up Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton? Thats a matter of party politicsa private organization choosing its nominee. Unseemly, perhaps, but not a rejection of democracy. The people still voted, the process was ugly, but elections continued. What you fail to grasp is the scale. No one from the DNC stormed the Capitol. No one tried to nullify an election with force.And your argument about \\"soviet-style snitching\\" is frankly embarrassing. Fact-checking and efforts to combat disinformation are not tyrannical; theyre necessary to prevent the rot of falsehoods that undermine the very system you're claiming to defend. Reporting misinformation is not the same as silencing dissentit's safeguarding reality.If you insist on framing these bureaucratic moves as undemocratic, then you're missing the forest for the trees. One party is working within the bounds of the systemflawed though it may bewhile the other flirts openly with authoritarianism. The Constitution may survive both, but dont insult our intelligence by pretending the dangers are equal.

[https://johnperkins.org/blog/global-politics/trump-exposing-the-shadow](https://johnperkins.org/blog/global-politics/trump-exposing-the-shadow) I published The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man last year, twelve years after the original, because things had gotten so much worse. The tools we EHMs used in developing countries C the corruption, the deceptions, the debt, the threats, the fear, and the false stories C had come back to haunt the US, Europe and the rest of the so-called developed world. In addition to updating the original book, I added fifteen new chapters to describe the ways contemporary EHMs have created a global Death Economy that is failing us C and also to provide a strategy each of us can use for turning that Death Economy into a Life Economy.The patina of oblique rhetoric I wrote about a year ago has been ripped off. During the first months of the Trump administration, corruption, deceptions, debt, threats, fear, and false stories have become overt.Over the years, Ive often condemned the revolving door thats been part of American politics. There is nothing new about presidents with close ties to Big Oil, like the Bushes and to Wall Street, like Clinton and Obama. There is nothing new about cabinet members and heads of agencies who hail from and return to the very businesses they are supposed to regulate. There is nothing new about elected officials who earn millions of dollars as lobbyists after leaving public office. There is nothing new about laws and court decisions, like Citizens United, that give increasing power to corporations C and legalize what once was considered as corruption and bribery. These things are wrong. They are contrary to the principles of a democracy. They should be changed. But they are not new in America.What is new is a president who makes no attempt to hide his immense personal commercial interests in businesses that are known to be hotbeds of corruption, such as casinos, and where US foreign policy is jeopardized, such as in dealings with Russia. What is new are the many politicians in our national and state capitols who openly advocate bigotry and policies that favor the rich at the expense of all the rest of us. What is new is the overt declaration that the US is an imperial power that needs to increase its already huge, offensive, and budget-breaking military presence around the world. What is new is the lack of even an attempt to sound as though our country wants to defend equality, fairness, and the democratic principles that most of us were raised to champion.Perhaps the great gift of the Trump administration is that it has ripped off the patina. Those who claimed that US business and politics were essentially transparent, those who argued that the US was a true democracy and that our political system might not be perfect, but it is the best in the world, those who sneered at the under-the-table dealings in banana republics and held the US out as a shining example of how to do it right C all of those people, all of us, have been forced to look at the dark shadow that lurked beneath that patina.How do you remove a shadow?You walk under the light.Now that the patina has been removed, we in the US can walk under the light. We can expose ourselves to the true weaknesses C and strengths C of who we are. By being forced to look at our shadow, we have been liberated from the platitudes that have blanketed us in self-deception. We are free to admit to our liabilities and assets. That is the first step to change. It is a step forward into revitalization C and along the path to realizing our true potential.","title":"A lot of people don't seem to understand the two sides of the United States of America"},{"text":"Idk why anyone uses twitter anymore.

Not everyone is on both sides of the spectrum and to claim that one side is and not the other is a gross generalization. Just like there are a lot of right wing absolutists there are also many left leaning absolutists, that don't understand that there is nuance to political opinions and views.   I am a registered Democrat and have voted Democrat up until 2020. I voted for Trump in 2020 and will vote again for him this year. I am a history buff and actually have an above average understanding in civics and how our government works. With that said, I let myself get washed away by the media and left leaning influencers that shouted to the winds that Trump was/is a fascist dictator back in 2016, when the checks and balances are there to prevent that. 4 years passed without issue and a bunch of things changed my mind.   By the time the January Capitol protests happened in 2021, I had already disassociated myself from the media after 4 years of the Boy who cried Wolf from them and left leaning influencers, plus the disaster that was 2020 with disinformation and biased news reporting from the left leaning media covering Covid and the George Floyd riots. So while I was a bit shocked at the Capitol protests, reading about it from both sides and looking at the videos and stuff, I was convinced that the protests were indeed peaceful and people were let in to the Capitol by security. Plus historically, a fascist takeover/coup is not one done by the people to the government but by a leader with the backing of the armed forces; the former is more of a revolution more than anything but since the protestors didn't take anyone hostage nor claim to take over the country but were contesting a controversial election, that's why I see it as a protest.   Anyway, the more I started to see videos of Trump's 2016 campaign, I saw that his comments were taken out of context. He is crass and definitely not professional but he is not necessarily saying lies but exaggerating the truth. What turned me over was videos of him admitting to using the system in his favor when accused of rigging it by Hilary or Jeb, but then throwing it back at them of spending decades in power but not doing anything to stop those loopholes and benefiting from them as well. Then the fact that he is fact checked but when you read those fact checked articles, like mentioned before, they show that he was exaggerating but still right.   Then in a personal level, I am tired of the left screaming racism, mysoginy, bigots, Nazis, etc., for things such as disagreeing on issues. That if you are a Democrat or liberal, you have to agree 100% on all issues or else you are a right wing bigot. That I can't escape leftist politics anymore because they are invading movies, video games, work, and others. Things that the left has always criticized of the right bleeding into non political things, are now things they are doing. The fact that these leftist groups are full of contradictions and can't get anything done because everything has to be inclusive when that is impossible to do. Seeing my home state of California and home of Los Angeles become this shithole due to disastrous policies that I voted for (like higher taxes to help the homeless) only to see the percentage of homeless go up and hear about $20 billion go unaccounted for. Seeing a push for gender laws go into effect, seeing universities lower their standards of admission, seeing a push to go all electric when our grid infrastructure is not even ready for it....like it's all going so fast to show that they are doing something when in reality they don't see the long term consequences of the policies they are doing.   So how does it relate to Trump, since local government is separate from the federal? Well my disatisfaction with how the Democrats have run things in my state stretches to how they run the country. Blaming the right for things they also do, like insider trading (like Nancy Pelosi's husband). Things like higher gas prices (which does beg the question of whether the oil companies responded to it because of Biden stopping the pipeline and/or because they are greedy), the war in Ukraine and sending billions there when our citizens are homeless.   Now, I'm no neocon. I still consider myself a liberal and support freedom of speech, of choice, and stuff but not the intolerant left that wants to get rid of it to avoid offending others or of people who they disagree with them. I want a government that wants to compromise to get things done but no one wants to give in. Just like how I don't want religion taught in the schools, I don't want gender stuff taught there. I don't want a political party doing things and then turning around and saying that they didn't do that but the other party did.

They are those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met.  They wish to eliminate the Electoral College, stack the Supreme Court, eliminate the filibuster, allow non-citizens to vote, and remove all ties of ballots to actual legitimate voters, all for the sake of taking power.  If they have their way, it will be a tyranny, one where the democrat party takes control and then wrecks the processes and changes the rules to ensure no other party will ever take control (drop boxes, no signature or ID requirements, etc).The vast part of the Democrat voters wish to get rid of our representative republic and replace it with \\"mob rule\\" via direct democracy because their power base consists of 6-8 giant blue cities and not much else.  If your opinions are generally in line with most of the things the Cackler stands for, you are likely a low IQ voter that lets the glowing box in the living room or the one on your desk tell you she's popular and smart and that they did not push her into this position without a single primary vote, thus negating ANY semblance of democratic procedure.All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th when democrats attempted to lock up anyone that objected to the obvious democrat cheating to set an example so that no one else would try it again.  They were partially successful, but a non-DC  judge is in the process of overturning the weaponized DoJ and those decisions (I really hope there are civil suits to follow).

What the video shows isn't unrelated newcasts all mysteriously saying the same thing. They're all local channels that have been quietly bought up by the same right-wing billionaire and he's been plausibly accused of forcing the local channels to push propaganda that promotes his personal politics. He wrote a piece, forced every channel to run it, because he now owns all those channels. That kind of thing is main problem even if you agree with a lot of what this guy also thinks.https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/02/598794433/video-reveals-power-of-sinclair-as-local-news-anchors-recite-script-in-unisonSo rather than trying to make some kind of \\"followup\\" video that find people just using similar wording then implying the same thing is going on there, you should just look into media concentration and the loss of independent channels.That's the actual story. They don't need secret media handshakes when media outlets are losing revenue so you can just get your checkbook out and start buying up floundering local newspapers and stations, then force them to write/say what you want because you're the boss now.Most of the time the reason for similar wording will merely be laziness, because they all copy-pasted some other story without checking it, stole it from Reddit or Twitter conversations, or they all read the same Associated Press or Reuters news feeds. Basically, lack of revenue has meant that stations and newspapers no longer have their own reporters, it's cheaper to \\"buy news\\" from some provider who has a business model of producing news and selling the same stories to many papers and channels.How fake stories get into the media doesn't require them to zombie-control every outlet, they just choose some weak link to feed the story in, and make sure it's got a couple of viral 'hooks' which will cause every outlet to want to run it - basically, they make clickbait that rubs a couple of key points people like, and there will be a \\"payload\\" which is some lie they wanted to spread (but more often that not, it'll be purely profit driven and about getting you to buy something). but that's attached onto the clickbait part.

A therapist is least concerned if the individual can work a 40 hour work week but instead the focus is on providing help so that the individual can decrease their suffering and limitations, whatever that looks like. If a therapist hears that a client has found a way to live their life in a satisfactory even if, for example, they live on disability thats a success! - a therapist is not a politician. They cant change the environment or society / system that the individual lives in. The therapists focus is the individual, with the goal of enabling the client to lead a life that is doable for them. You are putting an expectation(?) on mental health care providers that is not in the realm of their possibilities and reach (and its good that its not in their reach because they are neither economists or sociologists).

Believe it or not, I've had some very similar thoughts. How so?Multiple sclerosis. It's supposedly to be an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath cells in the CNS.But what if it's not really just a random autoimmune problem? What if there was a viral exposure, some brain cells get infected... and then the immune system goes after the brain?One likely culprit could be a virus that \\"likes\\" to infect cells in the CNS. Turns out there's a whole family of viruses that fit the bill...Overview. Herpes infections are very common. **50 to 80 percent** of American adults have oral herpes (HSV-1), which causes cold sores or fever blisters in or around the mouth. Genital herpes, caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, affects one out of every six people in the U.S. age 14 to 49.So at least half the population are carriers. And maybe some of them, for whatever reason, have an immune reaction that involves the immune system attacking cells in the nervous system.And once the immune system gets \\"trained\\" to go after a certain cell type, it might keep on going even after the initial infection has passed. The respiratory epithelium is well suited to handling viral infections. If your sinuses get plugged up, you can still breathe. If there's inflammation and cell death, the cells in the respiratory epithelium can be replaced. Same thing goes for the cells in your gut.So a viral infection in the respiratory system is actually the best way for your immune system to \\"learn\\" a new pathogen and gain immunity to it.When I read your comment about the link between various viral infections and dementia, it makes me wonder if something similar is going on. As people get older and their immune system weakens, these unavoidable viral infections spread beyond the respiratory system and (because of the immune response) the brain takes a beating... with dementia being the result.Maybe.","title":"Biden said covid would give everyone Alzheimers and dementia back in 2021, and now data is coming out on MSM saying its true"},{"text":"Ahahaha yessss ?","title":"Biden Must Let Zelenskiy Bomb Putin to the Negotiating Table"},{"text":"Yes he was vehemently anti-Trump after 2016, with all of his donations going to Democrats.

Each side is so convinced theyre right, that will never change. You arent going to convince a republican theyre wrong and theyre not going to convince you that your view is wrong. Why do you think politic discussion is a sensitive topic in most times and places? In the general case, republicans advocate for less central government control, which can be both a good (limit power) and bad (remove protections like roe v wade). Its just the fact theyre voting for someone with an unattractive personality thats became the issue in the last decade. The entire roe v wade thing was not a we dont believe abortions should be legal in terms of the supreme courts rationale, it was a the central government does not have authority to put a blanket ban on abortion prohibition leaving it up to the states. Democrats want central government to enact policies that increase safety, equality, and security which can also be a good thing in cases of improving protections for certain people, or bad thing in cases of limiting freedoms some hold very closely, the right to defend yourself with firearms being the most prominent topic here. Republicans rationale (not the racist bigot far right ones) is if the government has power, that gives more freedom to live life and less potential for dictatorship. Whether or not trump and his team plan to push the country into a dictatorship is up for debate. His personality is not an indicator of guarantee of that. Democrats rationale to argue against that is everyone should have protection from discrimination or abuse, even if it limits what you can say and do. But republicans view this as an easy path towards a dictatorship overtime. Its not a guarantee howeverBoth sides have good points, but it seems impossible to have both safety, inclusion, and security with unlimited freedom. So these parties will never agree. Democrats believe the government can protect everyone with enough policy, republicans believe the government cannot protect everyone and can in fact be damaging. Everyone has different values and perspectives, not one side is right but both sides have pieces of shit extremists.

The selected projects will maximize the environmental benefit of solar energy technologies by increasing system lifetime and work to facilitate material recovery once the system is decommissioned. DOE also launched a prize program that will open new markets for solar energy system equipment, announced winners in the American-Made Solar Prize Round 7, and issued a notice of intent for up to $20 million to advance solar manufacturing. These investments will support the Biden-Harris Administrations efforts to boost domestic manufacturing and competitiveness while reducing waste and improving sustainability of solar technologies.  \\n...  \\nDOE announced the selection of four research and development projects to receive $16 million, including $8 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at reducing the costs and impacts of solar energy technologies. The Materials, Operation, and Recycling of Photovoltaics (MORE PV) funding program supports DOEs Photovoltaics End-of-Life Action Plan, which aims to halve the cost of recycling by 2030 and reduce the environmental impact of solar energy modules at end-of-life. Keeping solar panels in the field longer by making them more durable and easier to repair will slow and reduce the flow of solar panels into the waste stream. Research to understand and prevent common causes of early breakdowns and power loss, such as damage from extreme weather, can extend solar panel lifespans. The funding program also set up the Solar Partnership to Advance Recycling and Circularity (Solar PARC) to improve materials recovery and develop safe end-of-life practices for PV system components. This partnership of about 30 organizations, led by the Electric Power Research Institute and including academic and industrial stakeholders, aims to improve the circularity and lifecycle impact of PV systems through technology solutions, strategic partnerships, and community benefits.  \\n...  \\nDOE announced the selection of four research and development projects to receive $16 million, including $8 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aimed at reducing the costs and impacts of solar energy technologies.

You can identify the strengths and experience of players like Steph Curry and LeBron James, but you cant meaningfully predict that they have a 70% probability of beating France if the US mens team will only be playing their team in one game. They either win or they dont. \\n  \\nAlso you (like many others) fundamentally misunderstand what Im saying about the flaw in Nate Silvers statistics you **CANNOT** tell whether his 70% probability was accurate. For each prediction he makes, he is either 100% correct or 0% correct. You cannot go back and repeat those elections 10x to see if his prediction was correct 7 of those times. \\n  \\nAnd in a similar vein there is no meaningful difference between 70% probability to win or 90% probability to win. If that person wins, he was 100% correct. If that person loses, he was 0% correct. Theres no difference between those two outcomes (the 90% state is no more and no less successful than the 70% state if the candidate wins in both). Again, unless you can run those two elections 10x, you dont actually know whether his probability was accurate. Maybe that state had a 100% probability to win and he massively underestimated it. Maybe it had a 40% probability to win and he massively overestimated the odds, and got lucky. Either way, he was no more and no less accurate than anyone else making an educated guess without his probabilities.","title":"Democrats Kamala Harris More Likely to Win Alaska Than Florida or TexasNate Silver"},{"text":"Just a cop caring about and trying to protect his community as anyone would do. /s?","title":"Portage County (OH) sheriff: 'Write down the addresses' of Kamala Harris supporters who display yard signs"},{"text":"How could a title be so unfathomably based?","title":"Biden Must Let Zelenskiy Bomb Putin to the Negotiating Table"},{"text":"I think its more appropriate to say the Republican Party is a threat to democracy.","title":"Donald Trump Is a Threat to Democracy, and Saying So Is Not Incitement | Opposing political violence does not mean ignoring authoritarianism."},{"text":"me when I spread disinformation on the Internet","title":"Biden Must Let Zelenskiy Bomb Putin to the Negotiating Table"},{"text":"You're one of those #notallmen people, aren't you","title":"How the Last Eight Years Made Young Women More Liberal  For a generation of girls raised to believe they could be anything, the Trump era moved their politics to the left, a new analysis shows."},{"text":"And watching them both try to attack him as not a real reporter doing the same thing that they do, sensationalized entertainment, not news reporting.

Trump tried to subvert the election. He failed. And in context of his voters, was it subverting the election, or a genuine concern that it was subverted against him? After all, an unprecedented global pandemic led to unprecedented voter regulations, which led to unprecedented voter turnout. Historically, unnatural voter turnout is heavily linked to fraudulent elections. For many Trump voters, it wasnt seen as stealing the election, but rather protecting it. Especially before all of the investigations into fraud were concluded. On the other side, we saw in 2016 democrats undemocratically choose Hillary as their candidate despite Bernie outperforming her in primaries. And now in 2024, we saw democrats hide Bidens mental decline until there was no time for a fair democratic primary, and no time to financially back a new candidate. 2/3 elections democrats have ignored their constituents and selected their candidate. It actually shocks me how little outrage there is amongst democrats in their flawed system, but it does make sense because at the end of the day, infighting only helps Trump. Theyre forced to accept candidates they dont want. Republicans/independents can see these very fair criticisms and decide they want no part of it. 2) choose the enemy you know rather than the one you dont. We can all see Trump, all his flaws, all his fascist undertones, etc. Piggy backing off #1, we see him try to overthrow the government, and we see him fail. However with democrats, can we confidently assess whos even running the country today? We know Joe Biden is not mentally there, so who is calling the shots? Whos making the decisions? Whos deciding to hide him in order to shoehorn in Kamala? Who are the people subverting democracy on that side? Its clearly happening, but we have no idea whos behind the curtain. Youre simply a conspiracy nut for even asking those questions, and with this current war on misinformation you might even find yourself in trouble for asking them in the not so distant future. A future ran by Trump is far less scary than one ran by the unknown. 3) the damage to democracy Trump can do is less than the damage democrats can do. piggy backing off #2. There are checks and balances in this country that limit government power. Without nearly universal approval from their constituents, its impossible to truly upend this country and turn it into a fascist dictatorship. Notice how much Trump distances himself from project 2025C if he endorsed it he would lose a substantial portion of his base because his base doesnt support the contents of it. Any attempts Trump makes to upend our democracy will be universally shot down, and youll see his own supporters turn on him. Democrats on the other hand have a scary amount of support for some awful fascist ideas. Example 1 is the war on misinformation. A sizable portion of democrat voters full on support tossing the first amendment in regards to misinformation, equating it to hate speech. This is a fundamental step in installing a fascist regime define anything against them as misinformation, and prosecute wrong think. I can very much see democrats successfully pursuing anti misinformation legislation much more so than I can see Trump cancel elections in the future. 4) Global conflict. Democrats demonize Trump for having working relations with some of the worlds worst dictators like Kim jong un or Putin. However many republicans see this as a good thing. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Under Trump we created an agreement to peacefully withdraw from Afghanistan, we initiated sanctions on Iran effectively defunding Gaza and keeping peace in Israel, he deescalated the Korean crisis, and he appeased Putin and kept him out of Ukraine. Its no coincidence that backing out of our agreement with the taliban cost US soldiers their lives, ending the sanctions on Iran led to all out war breaking out in Israel, and terminating our relations with North Korea and Russia led to increased tensions in Korea, and all out war in Ukraine. At the debate, Kamala did not give any hope whatsoever to end either the Israel or Ukraine conflicts. She said she supports Israels right to defend themselves, and Gazas right to their land effectively stating shes content with that conflict continuing in perpetuity. And she said she would continue to support Ukraine, without any consideration of helping to negotiate a peace treaty. It is very reasonable to believe that under Kamala, all of these conflicts will continue to escalate, and could very likely cause World War 3. If you are against that, then you are for Trump.5) economy. I dont care how informed you are, especially in these times no one can accurately predict how each presidents plans will help the economy. In all likelihood were heading towards a recession, regardless who gets elected. Both have policies that could help/hurt things. You cant call anyone misinformed or antidemocratic for believing trumps plans will help more, and basing their vote on that in these struggling times. 6) immigration. Saved this for last because it kind of encompasses everything. Even legal immigration comes with strains on jobs and infrastructure for citizens. Illegal immigration only exasperates these problems because its not controlled for. Experts agree the proposed border bill shot down by republicans wouldnt have come close to addressing all of the issues illegal immigration causes in this country. Trump is going to address the issue with an iron fist, whereas Kamala will be soft on it. The fact all she could say on the issue is that they almost had a bill passed spoke volumes to me considering the ineffectiveness of the bill. Welcoming immigrants strains the economy, it opens questions of the validity of our elections, and it begs the question why *not* take it seriously? All of these issues are enough to go you know, Trump might be an idiot, but I can trust him checked more than democrats unchecked, I can see he wants to end global conflicts, and I actually think hell help my bank account more than Kamala.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"At the very least, it's another stick in the \\"maybe we should looking into how we're doing this whole gun thing\\" fire.","title":"Trump says Biden-Harris 'rhetoric' to blame for Florida assassination attempt"},{"text":"He's another one of the phony Republicans.

In July of 2020 Biden signs started appearing in our old neighborhood.  There were a few Trump signs as well, but that was my first indication that Trump did not have it in the bag as many people suggested at that time.  I went out and made a couple purchases like a FAL just to make sure I had what I wanted even though that wasn't the time to be buying guns as there weren't deals to be had.  I just drove through the old neighborhood and what caught me was the lack of any political signs.  There was one house that must be a big Union person there as they always have whatever Democrats are running signs.  Another couple of Trump 2024 signs, but that was it.  Now I know the neighborhood was in the process of turning when we left but I look at our current neighborhood and there isn't a single political sign.  When we moved in Spring of 2021 there were those \\"In this house we believe in...\\" signs around, that June there were pride flags out, but then a couple of Hijab wearing Muslim families have moved in and we haven't seen a pride flag in the years since.We're in an area that 15 years ago was solid red, but turned purple, and now arguably light blue as younger families have moved in and the older generation has died or moved out.  Hell even the big house that had the Biden sign in 2020 had a sign for a Republican running for Secretary of State during the primaries a couple months ago.

I see it claimed *so often* in online discussions but rarely with actual evidenceAnd the thing is, if you do expanded means tested benefits via refundable tax credits paid out by the IRS, you can do simple means testing on the basis of income information the IRS already has, and have the benefits be doled out and adjusted via mostly automated systems. It's not all that complicatedSomething to consider: the IRS gets something like $10 or $15 billion a year, more or less. The Biden child tax credit expansion added means testing to the CTC that didn't previously exist, yet this didn't make the IRS need to pay substantially more in order to do that (because, again, it was a simple income roof with taper)And again, despite some populist rhetoric about the \\"99%\\", most people aren't struggling, and we'd basically just need policy, ultimately, that expands benefits to the bottom 30%. If you want to be very charitable, you could go with something like the bottom 40 or 50%, but that still allows for *a lot* of savings from not giving benefits to half the population. If you are giving out money to the public, the benefits generally end up costing much more than the administration, as we see with things like the CTC where the entire administration of the IRS as a whole is just a small chunk of the total cost of just that one CTC program expansionand (2) by giving the benefit to rich and poor, you incentive the rich to advocate for quality benefits.Uh this doesn't appear to be how things work IRL. The rich have often just sent their kids to private schools and opposed public education despite the universality of free k-12 education.

If one were to believe that those people were representative of the right in this country, one might be taken a bit aback.What partisans of either stripe refuse to realize is that once the \\"death camps\\" are established (by whichever jersey color is in power at that instant), the pipeline of people to be killed/disenfranchised/deported/ground-into-dust will be filled with people from either team, *regardless of jersey color*. The tribalism abstraction breaks down, once one finally realizes that *everyone* is disposable to the Oligarchs. We are all \\"useless eaters\\", as far as they are concerned.Just because your tribe gets to kill the other tribe today does not mean that your tribe will not be next on the conveyor belt into the meat grinder. In short, you can't tell the jersey colors by tasting the Soylent Green.It is all rather moot, in any case- the oligarchs in the blue jerseys  will have their nuclear war, and sooner than later. While I'm not at all a fan of nuclear war, and would strongly prefer to live out my remaining years in something resembling peace- at this point, I wouldn't mind that too much. At least it will *finally* make the brainless partisans on both teams Shut The Fuck Up.","title":"\\"Imperialism, like or not, does benefit Americans.

I just don't believe that the popularity of people like Tate proves that there *isn't* a positive message for them. I believe that there are plenty of positive, progressive male role models, they're just less popular because it's extremely difficult to compete with fascism as a solution to the problems of young, straight, (mostly white) men.There is always room to improve messaging, and we should try to make it as good as possible, but we need to be clear-eyed when discussing the problems. Appealing to young men with real solutions with people like Tate as your competition is essentially trying to convince your 3 year old to eat broccoli when their other parent is offering them their favourite candy. You have to do SO MUCH BETTER than the other person to win that battle. Convincing young men to self-reflect and work to build a better society is so hard when the alternative is \\"vote for a fascist dictatorship and we'll give you all the benefits of the other guys without you needing to do any of the work\\".Gender equality is important and we should push to improve conditions for men as well as women, even if the men who will benefit from that will never vote for us. And we should make sure our door is open and do our best to reach out. But let's not let the right dictate the narrative by buying the lie that we don't care about men. We do, we're just not willing to sacrifice every other group in society so that (straight, white) men can feel better about themselves. And sadly there is a substantial chunk of the population that we'll never win over as long as that's the case.","title":"How the Last Eight Years Made Young Women More Liberal  For a generation of girls raised to believe they could be anything, the Trump era moved their politics to the left, a new analysis shows."},{"text":"Is that an actual quote?

They don't blame men and boys for causing these problems, nor do they expect men alone to fix the problems. These authors correctly identify the culprits of men's issues as a larger issue with society, specifically the way society treats men and boys.

Whenever he makes baseless allegations against others, he's actually confessing to what he's guilty of.","title":"Trump says Biden-Harris 'rhetoric' to blame for Florida assassination attempt"},{"text":"Okay we need to talk about the 2020 Election and Trump's response to it.Undeniably, the 2020 election was a strange one. Trump got more votes that he did in 2016 but Biden got by far the most votes of any presidential candidate ever despite being a far less inspiring candidate than Obama. Everyone went to bed on election night with Trump in the lead and on track to win and then woke up to him trailing after the vote counting was mysteriously paused in some states and there are reports of poll watchers being sent home before the counting was done. The graphs of the vote totals also show Biden falling behind and then suddenly jumping up ahead of Trump in multiple swing states. Also, many states allowed widespread mail-in ballots and had very low standards of authentication (no I.D. required to vote, low signature authentication standards). That's not even to mention that the FBI covered up the Hunter Biden Laptop story including telling social media sites like Facebook to suppress it despite knowing it was true at the time. So, try to imagine- if you were Trump, or a very avid Trump supporter, how would you react to seeing all of this? Sure the media is telling you that nothing fishy is going on at all and that you should just move on, but that only proves (to them) that they are in on it. How could you not question the results? Regardless of what you think happened, to them (and kinda to me as well) this looks exactly how I imagine it would look if the establishment in D.C. decided they were going to steal an election. Loosen the rules around voting and election security, cover up stories making your candidate look bad and amplify ones against the other candidate, have stores of fake \\"mail-in\\" ballots that can be brought out overnight to boost your candidate's vote totals, and then have the media and official government sources all strongly announce that anyone who questions the results is a danger to democracy or an insurrectionist or something. Like, that's probably exactly how I would do it tbh. And even if that didn't all happen and there are alternate explanations for some of all of it, you have to understand how it looked to Trump and his supporters. So with all of that in mind, I think what Trump did was actually very reserved. On Jan. 6th he gave a speech calling on supporters to tell their representatives to legally inquire about the election results, and told them to peacefully protest. Very shortly after his speech was over and before anyone could heard the end of his speech and walked over to the capitol, a small number of people did try and get into the capitol building before the doors were opened and a bunch of people walked in and looked around, basically. Trump didn't tell them to do this and it didn't actually benefit him in any way. In fact, this strange and fairly harmless act (none of the people who entered the capitol were armed) was immediately called an insurrection by Democrats and the media and used as an excuse to completely shut down any legal inquiry into the election. In other words, what the media claims was a planned insurrection by Trump was actually a strange event that he did not want to happen and actually made things worse for him.  \\n**Ultimately, here's what you have to think about. What is one supposed to do if an election actually is stolen? If the ones stealing the election have a lot of institutional power and control over the media, the of course they will deny it happened, destroy evidence, and call anyone who questions the stolen election a conspiracy theorist, traitor, danger to democracy, etc. Since they destroy the evidence, they may even be able to convince people for \\"lying\\" about it being stolen since those people can't produce enough evidence. And many people who still trust these institutions will believe them and pin all of the blame on the individuals questioning the election. But it is clearly NOT anti-democratic to point out that a stolen election was stolen.** Also, Trump has no anti-democratic policies that he would put in place at all, unless you think basic election security measures are anti-democratic (like voter ID laws). The Democrats are the ones with anti-democratic actions (manipulating party primaries, appointing Kamala) and policies (abolish the Filibuster in congress, pack the Supreme Court, etc.)","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"But the mainstream media is still trying to determine the shooter's motivation...

If you think 50% of the population should be able to make their own life decisions and work, then many will. As more women work and are mothers then that will become a requirement for those not wealthy enough to forego the income. This is a self reinforcing cycle. Then you have childcare which is a low paying job without career advancement. Finding a way to pay childcare workers $60k+ a year would probably do a lot to fix the issue of supply and overwork, so would subsidizing SAHM at something like median income+20% but both of those are politically nonviable.

Unfortunately, similar to most things in life, once the layers of details are pulled back the picture becomes more complex. While Trump supporters can be painted as all believing or adhering to the same ideologies or having the same goals and beliefs, that is an incorrect assumption. This is why a person might hear a Trump supporter state something along the lines of yeah, he can say vulgar things at times, but I support him because of the one thing I really care about. It comes down to differing, but multiple, priorities that a number of persons rank above ideals such as democracy or compromise. In other words, there are multiple Trump supporters that follow or adhere to the beats of many different drummers. I believe the core group (or perhaps even labeled as the original Trump supporters) are those folks that have felt left-behind so to speak (minimal economic advancement opportunities and related considerations). Ive been through or seen many areas in this country where it can be easily ascertained that area and most of the folks living or residing in that area have been left behind - and there are a lot of areas. Trump spoke TO that group. He offered who was to blame for them being left behind (Democrats, immigrants, etc.) and it didnt really matter if those groups or individuals were or were not responsible for them being left behind, Trump told them that was the case, it wasnt those folks fault, and he was going to help them - and he was believable to them. This desire for someone to help them is stronger than any tradition, form of government, and so on. Unfortunately, I believe those folks needs and what they are looking for has been lost in the grand scheme of things; as it has become very evident that Trump has been telling them what they want to hear as opposed to what they need to hear since actions speak louder than words. As for other folks, the notion or idea that Democrats are evil or the enemy is not new. This was a relatively small group of individuals for several decades, but Trumps messaging to the folks left behind simultaneously resonated with these folks that believe Ds are bad. They do not believe the Rs should compromise with the Ds to pass legislation - and the nature of the legislation does not matter - Rs should be dictating all the legislation in their eyes because they believe in the fundamental platform elements postulated or advertised by the Republican Party (patriotism, god, freedom, powerful military, law and order, and so on). And there are multiple other flavors that Trump was successful in pulling into under one umbrella. In other words, Trumps messaging resonated with all the groups that were on the fringes of the Republican Party and even some on the fringes of the Democratic Party; and collectively they outnumbered the actual core Republicans that are referred to as RINOs now. But the key to understand how this occurred is the messaging. Despite all his faults, Trump is a very good salesman - he knows how to sell his products (which in this case is garnering votes). His messaging and promises to help or look out for all those folks that have fallen under the Trump banner is first and foremost in the mind of his supporters - how he or they get there is inconsequential because they all have (but not the same) a certain core belief (abortion, economic opps., government spending, and many more) above any other normal or conventional consideration that Trumps words catered to. There are also those Republicans from the previous era that truly believe in the supposed Republican mantra of smaller government. Trump added the promise to drain the swamp to his platform and continues to do so; so that brought those folks along as well. Most of these folks are the ones that say Trumps statements and actions will make them cringe, but smaller government is more important to them than anything else. Which is sort of ironic in that they want the government to fix their perceived problems of government. Long story short, most of Trumps supporters have a priority or belief that outranks every other consideration due to their present condition or experiences. Trump is a sort of means to the end - and the means dont matter as long they get to the end. Trump has been successful in tailoring his message (he is a good salesman) that was not only able to pull all these differing priorities under a singular umbrella, but also to amplify those priorities in the eyes of his supporters. And it doesnt matter how they achieve those priorities or what needs to be sacrificed to realize those priorities, its simply that those priorities become reality. But, actions speak louder than words IMO - but its tough to see those actions when the words are powerful enough and tailored towards what someone believes is more important than anything else.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"'What do you mean MURDER isnt allowed by my 1st anendment rights?'What sick fucks.","title":"NH Libertarian party posts, then deletes Tweet calling for Kamala Harris' assassination"},{"text":"Pot, kettle and all that","title":"Trump rips Biden and Harris rhetoric against him despite his own history of going after rivals"},{"text":"Definitely not his own hateful rhetoric about Haitians people eating cat and dogs that are cause bomb threats left and right","title":"Trump blames Biden-Harris rhetoric for latest assassination attempt, says he will save the country"},{"text":"St Donald the Savior.

If they ever do get their closed borders (and it seems to be trending that way given that Harris touts the bipartisan immigration bill, which is a horrible, horrible bill, as a solution to the immigration problem), theyll turn back to racial tensions. If they purify the voter base, theyll turn to political persecution, and so on. There will never not be some outsider that they can use to make people fearful and reactionary. And the left leaning party to combat that is too feckless to do anything other than appease them, every once in a while granting us a win that is really just a reversion back to something the right wanted 20 years prior. Like, if they cant get the abortion issue fixed (and given that its a great issue to raise money on, theyre not exactly motivated to fix it), in 20 years a Dem win will be something like a national law that allows citizens to get an abortion within 12 weeks if theres a threat to the mothers life, or in the case of rape or incest, and only on even numbered days in odd numbered months.","title":"How the Last Eight Years Made Young Women More Liberal  For a generation of girls raised to believe they could be anything, the Trump era moved their politics to the left, a new analysis shows."},{"text":"And the latest guy voted for Trump in 2016, but resents him now.","title":"Another chance for Trump to frame Democrats as dangerous has emerged"},{"text":"If youre anti-trump does it matter if youre dem/rep?These are disgruntled Trump voters who believed the bs Trump sold not knowing there was no solution to the made up problem.

I attribute that 100% to one factor:In my entire political lifetime, Republicans have *never* presented a serious, good-faith effort to make a single thing better for anyone, *even* the wealthy. They have invented conspiracies, sabotaged legislation for political points, stripped away rights, and mangled our tax code for the benefit of the rich. Their policies are fundamentally flawed on essentially every level, and they ignore rational thought to fellate religion.

However, I'll turn it around and point to really the only policy that Trump has actually said he has a plan for if he wins: tariffs.[https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/child-care-trump-what-matters/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/child-care-trump-what-matters/index.html)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R04kdtujO38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R04kdtujO38)Here are two examples of Trump talking about tariffs (although it took me a while to realize that's what he meant in the first one).He was already the president of the US for four years. He has bragged about instituting tariffs on other countries. He clearly has no idea what a tariff is. The interviewer in the second clip is obviously horrified on Trump's behalf as he realizes that Trump doesn't know what a tariff is and tries to give softer and more leading questions to help Trump out.He's saying we're going to \\"tax\\" other countries to help our trade deficit. That's not what a tariff is. A tariff is paid by American companies and passed on to American consumers. If he puts tariffs on Chinese products, China doesn't pay those taxes, Americans do. He clearly doesn't understand that. He talks about funding all of our domestic programs and even paying off our debt by taxing other countries with tariffs. He's a complete buffoon.That should be a really big fucking concern to republicans, that a man who has been president and claims to have done these things doesn't understand a simple concept from Econ 101. He also has no idea what a trade deficit is, what a budgetary surplus or deficit is, what causes inflation, and has fumbled so many basic econ and civics questions that he clearly has no idea how our government or the economy works at all.Regardless of what you think of Harris and her policies, surely you'd rather have a president that actually knows how our government works and what the most basic of economic principles are and how they apply?","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"And some more things that are important to know: Trump supports project 2025:Trump has publicly rejected Project 2025 as Vice President Kamala Harris campaign has sought to tie him to some of the plans most extreme proposals.

In one, the new president offers the country better prospects, relying on science, solid evidence and the willingness to learn from experience. She pushes policies that boost good jobs nationwide by embracing technology and clean energy. She supports education, public health and reproductive rights. She treats the climate crisis as the emergency it is and seeks to mitigate its catastrophic storms, fires and droughts.In the other future, the new president endangers public health and safety and rejects evidence, preferring instead nonsensical conspiracy fantasies. He ignores the climate crisis in favor of more pollution. He requires that federal officials show personal loyalty to him rather than upholding U.S. laws. He fills positions in federal science and other agencies with unqualified ideologues. He goads people into hate and division, and he inspires extremists at state and local levels to pass laws that disrupt education and make it harder to earn a living.One of two futures will materialize according to our choices in this election.

As a voter, part of your responsibility is ensuring the people you vote for align with your values regarding how a society should operate. If your values include impartiality of the judiciary (which they should) then you have to look not only at their qualifications and experience, but also that they too hold the impartiality of the judiciary as a core value. Ideally this will help them to be cognizant of their own biases and do their best (as many good judges do) to eliminate them from their rulings. Beyond this, when their biases do inevitably leak through their rulings from time to time (because that is the nature of a human run judiciary), you can hope that they will align more with your values (in my case, empathy for the citizenry over which they hold power).","title":"Portage County sheriff: 'Write down the addresses' of Kamala Harris supporters who display yard signs"},{"text":"Ryan Wesley Routh, John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald.

How many times have they followed up on these threats?They haven't.  So let's talk about why they haven't hit that big red button. There's two things mainly standing in the way of Putin pressing that button.  \\nThe first is the doctrine Russia holds to when it comes to using nuclear weapons, I don't have the exact text (and I don't speak Russian) but the jist of it is that they will only deploy them if there is an existential threat to the Russian state. So far this condition hasn't been met.  \\nNow I'm aware that this is a rule that maybe only exists on paper. But there's been more then one case where a Russian operator refused to press the button to employ nuclear weapons. And if Putin tells his general staff to turn Ukraine into glass tomorrow I'll bet a lot of money on that general staff instead deciding to put a few holes in Putin.The second reason is that actually deploying any kind of nuclear weapon would be utter suicide for Russia. There are embargo's, and there's a lot of ways Russia is managing to skirt those. And they still have allies they can lean on like China.  \\nIf Russia let's nukes fly, any kind of alliance of friendship they have with anyone in the world is gone. Nobody is going to try and support or deal with Russia after such a move. So even though they could wind up flattening a city, or several cities, after that Russia becomes a total pariah, bereft of friends and allies.

He pushed for 10,000 national guards to secure the Capitol but was turned down. When the capitol was breached, he pushed for immediate help from Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Clearly in his speech before the riot and his tweets he called for the protestors to remain peaceful multiple times.

Examples: David Dorn killed by confirmed BLM protestor Stephan Cannon, the same single night 4 police were shot, 55 businesses attacked, and convenience store set on fire yet none of these were counted. Barry Perkins died from a FedEx truck fleeing looters. James Scurlock killed in a scuffle with protestors. Isaiah Thomas Willoughby, who previously lived in Seattle, admitted he used gasoline to soak a debris pile outside the abandoned police precinct on June 12 and set it ablaze. Antonio Mays Jr. / Horace Lorenzo Anderson shot and killed in the CHOP zone, **an autonomous zone in the United States** made by protestors of the movement supported by Kamala Harris and they were only 16 / 19 years old. Police were blocked from helping secure the area for ambulances to pass through. These \\"mostly peaceful\\" demonstrations weren't included as violent in the dataset.Kamala Harris used her platform and called her supporters to donate to an organization which bailed out violent protestors like these, some of which committed murder after being set free.Oscar Lee Stewart Jr (This black parent was killed from fire started by BLM protestors.

Particularly if you're getting therapy covered.If you're a therapist, your priority is to addressing your immediate clients needs, otherwise why wouldn't your clients go to somebody else?It's not that it's a scam, on the individual level there's good evidence that psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for depression, although that doesn't mean it doesn't frequently fail to produce results.  In fact if you don't use these mental health resources and your peers do, especially if you have free access to these resources, you're only getting yourself further behind and getting yourself into a position where depression is more likely.It's just a cruel reality of the world that the existence of an efficacious treatment for depression just makes the powers that be realise it's not such a big deal to push and neglect the little people to the point they're depressed.  I hold the simultaneous view that mental health treatment is efficacious on the individual level, but on the systemic level does not improve collective mental health.  ---But since you asked the question, I'll mention that several things are just as efficacious as therapy, but you've heard them all before:Fixing your physical health issues, note that mental health doctors are specialists and specialists tend to be especially incompetent at treating or diagnosing issues outside their specialty, even if they're adversely affecting mental health.Second is exercise (especially high intensity cardio, best bang for buck in terms of results/effort).  Regular exercise is CLEARLY more efficacious than any individual mental health treatment, psychotherapy or pharmacology.  I feel people are downright irrational in how much they underestimate exercise's efficacy and don't take it seriously as a mental health treatment because they can't help but think you need mental treatment for mental health.  I honestly don't see why a personal trainer is a less rational investment than a therapist - if you aren't currently exercising and would with a personal trainer then probably the PT might very well give you more bang for your buck.Third is pharmacology.  Note that all the drugs are efficacious, most of them don't work, and a lot of them stop working after you're dependant on them, but taking something like an SSRI is SO EASY and SO CHEAP that it's hard not to recommend trying antidepressants.Fourth I'll mention is obvious, but diet, although I see less evidence of this being effective than the former two with the exception of dieting for weight loss when overweight.Fifth is generally faking it until you make it.  Just acting like a not depressed person tends to make you less depressed.  Be showered, well groomed, nice clothes, and so on like everything is fine and often spontaneously you'll just feel fine.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"[Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_no_one_rid_me_of_this_turbulent_priest%3F)","title":"Elon Musk deletes joke about 'no one trying to assassinate Kamala Harris'"},{"text":"Service ensures citizenship!","title":"Portage County (OH) sheriff: 'Write down the addresses' of Kamala Harris supporters who display yard signs"},{"text":"Who's going to know in a poll though?","title":"How the Last Eight Years Made Young Women More Liberal  For a generation of girls raised to believe they could be anything, the Trump era moved their politics to the left, a new analysis shows."},{"text":"That's awful politics.

This process forces smaller companies out of competition or into acquisition, leaving the market in the hands of a few giants whose primary motive is profit maximization. The pursuit of profit at all costs has historically led to negative consequences, such as declining product quality, deteriorating labor conditions, and an overall erosion of quality of life. It was the liberalization or 'freeing' of the American financial markets in the previous century that ultimately led to the crash of 2008, as well as the elaborate debt system that the USA knows today. These massive corporations become so disconnected from the realities of everyday life that they no longer have a stake in the well-being of the communities they serve. Their indifference to the impact of their products and practices reveals a deeper truth: they care less about what they sell or how it's made, as long as it turns a profit.Contrary to popular belief, market efficiency is not synonymous with freedom. In fact, it often results in a kind of corporate domination that restricts true economic liberty. Instead of a marketplace where innovation and choice thrive, we are left with a system where consumers and workers are stuck in the claws of a handful of monopolistic entities. This isnt freedomits corporate enslavement.David M. Kotz wrote an interesting book about this called The Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism.","title":"This is the Trump Shooter from today, his name is Ryan Wesley Routh.

They rigged the 2016 primary to ensure Hillary would win the nomination and got rid of Bernie. In 2020, they did much the same thing by forcing all the primary contenders to drop out before super Tuesday so the party could decide the nominee as Biden. Most recently, they wouldn't let RFK into the primary and refused to hold a competitive primary then had a June debate so they could dispose of Biden. This early debate was staged on purpose to showcase Bidens decline. It was blatantly obvious. The DNC then staged a coup to replace Biden with their chosen candidate. They blackmailed Biden with threats to 25th amendment him or investigate his business dealings. 2.  The democrats have had no issue with locking up political opponents. They locked up Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro for not complying with a congressional subpoena, which hasn't been the norm, but they refused to even charge Merrick Garland with contempt of congress for the same thing. They went after Trump with lawfare, finding any little thing he did wrong to try and bankrupt him. They are going after Jan 6ers (which was very much an inside job) for just standing there and filming. 3. The democrats and Kamala have been opposed to absolute free speech and created a 1984 style truth commission. They also wrote emails to social media sites Facebook and Twitter to remove content they didn't like. This is a direct violation of the 1st amendment and an abuse of power.

The reason is that while our brains create great inventions, they remain at the caveman-level politically."},{"text":"Some key points from this opinion piece:Since its just a broad idea, we cant measure the American dream in empirical terms. If its alive, it would be found in the minds of ordinary citizens who feel like theyre part of a project that is rooted in both their individual advancement and national advancement as a whole. And simply, the American dream is dead because ordinary Americans say its dead.Only 27% of people polled this year said the American dream holds true. Just 13 years ago, it was double that number. This doesnt just reflect increasing cynicism in general: a majority of Americans say the American dream once held true but doesnt any more. Whats happened to change so many of our minds?That polling isnt uniform and correlates closely to both income and education, both proxies for social class. Among Americans who dont have four-year college degrees only 22% say that American dream still holds true, half the mark of those with postgraduate degrees. Our national crisis of confidence is mostly a working-class problem.Americans as a whole, critics retort, are wealthier than ever. But, rather than argue with them, if we want to figure out why people dont feel like theyre staying above water, we need to examine issues of income disparity and social wealth....Of course, some of the pessimism that people feel is inflamed by ideological actors. From parts of the left, earnest attempts to right historical wrongs might have fueled an excess of negativity about the progress weve made in recent decades. On the right, a much more dangerous tendency is built around the idea that immigration C a key component of the American dream and our economic progress C is a social ill that needs to be combated.Thankfully, the United States has a rich, dynamic economy. Thats a good thing and it allows us to support well-designed universal programs to improve the social mobility and material wellbeing of our poor and working classes. We can pursue taxation policies that better redistribute wealth and create greater state support for health care, childcare, housing and job training. We can shift the funding of K-12 education away from unequal property taxes and to a more equal base of federal support. We can also support worker unionization and expand policies to revitalize domestic manufacturing.As for concerns over immigration, a key part of Donald Trumps appeal, we can support native-born workers feeling pressure in the job market from immigrants without elevating their situation to a zero-sum, existential battle in which either new Americans or established Americans will survive.We also, however, need to rally behind a vision of politics to go with these social-democratic policies. A vision of politics in which we assert the moral worth of every American and strive together to build a healthier and more optimistic society.There are some interesting points in this piece that are worth considering, the most important of which might be why more people than ever feel disconnected from the national project. The increasing inequality, largely borne on the backs of low and middle income individuals, families, and communities have removed the ability for people to improve their situations in any significant way. Meanwhile those who are wealthy are accelerating further away from the rest of society with their embarrassment of physical and social resources. Bring the ends back together looks to be a worthwhile endeavour, and if some version of social democracy can accomplish this without too many challenges, then it should be seriously considered as a system that might be adopted. Regardless, the most damaging response to these challenges is pessimism or doomerism. We should all be working towards identifying the failures and successes of the current systems, and creating a better system to move us all forwards.","title":"The American dream is dead for many.

I have another question for you: what happens if China, or another country, achieves parity with the US? Or rather what will happen before that?Parity is difficult to discuss. Because one, the US is clearly the top dog in global geopolitics. But wider, NATO is the proper top dog, with the US at the helm. So if China/Russia/whoever takes a leap forward to be contesting the US for the biggest stick, it would then need to be compared to NATO.If we did have an advancement on that level to rival NATO, multiple countries would likely be involved in that counterparty. If that were to happen, I think the level of threat and externalities would effectively neuter the chances of a large-scale conflict.

That is literally undermining the electoral process.Now, you could say the guardrails held, but the crux of this is that it was really only Mike Pence that stopped this. Our institutions allowed for the elector slate fraud. Our institutions allows for fringe legal theory to decide that the ECA would be unconstitutional. Our institutions wouldve allowed for the House to fraudulently vote Trump into presidency. Really, the only thing that stopped that chaos going into motion was one man.You know what JD Vance said hed do differently? Hed go alone with Trumps plan next time.So, no.

This was openly displayed to all of America during his debate and the reason why he was removed from the race. The Biden Administration has been exposed to have attempted to control public thought via official statements released by Facebook. This is a fact.The term \\"misinformed\\" is being *wildly overabused* by people who want to push their own ideology on other people instead of attempting to have actual discourse or accepting disagreement.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"Thats a polite way of him asking Trump to stop picking agents based on loyalty and not ability.","title":"Biden says Secret Service needs more help in wake of second Trump assassination attempt"},{"text":"I suppose, if you define a radioactive waste-scape as peaceful.\\nYou can't be serious?

It's as if they take nothing from history multiple times bigger countries like the UK and France parlayed with Hitler and allowed him to swallow entire countrys and it didn't stop. We know from Putin's own words and letters he sees the breakup of the USSR as a shame on the Russian people and wants more than just a small part of Ukraine. He marched for/towards their capital Kiev. If we capitulate now he will regroup his forces and economy and do it again bit by bit and if an American leader puts doubt on mutual defense it won't just be Ukraine. And Trump says he would end the war in a day because people are dying. That would mean a surrender of all occupied land. It's essentially forcing them to live on their knees when there are actively proving they would rather die on their feet. Same with China and Taiwan historical precedent holds zero weight here. Taiwan's people now by vast majority don't want to take back China and definitely don't want to be taken over themselves they want to live in peace and prefer there own government. They have seen Hong Kong which by treaty eventually falls completely within China's scope and yet China can't even wait out the clock there to take away rights and march against freedom of choice. America went a little overboard some would say with Domino theory but it proved true whereever we left communism spread and still it never worked. When did Peace at any cost become the norm. Should  we have gave all of Europe to Hitler. Should colonists have gave up there arms and not fired the shot heard round the world. Should Christ have refused the cross. And nukes change nothing we don't suddenly have to piss ourselves we have them too and we're not forcing regime change inside of Russia and China only denying them advance. If they want to use them tactically all bets are off and they will lose their too. https://youtu.be/JDVT-8tUfiE","title":"CMV: The world once more marches towards a great war.

When was the last time you heard someone say \\"OMG that was the best interview ever!\\" and it bumped a campaign?  About never.  However, think of the number of campaigns where a bad, unscripted moment lingered: Sarah Palin, Dan Quayle, Boris Johnson, Howard Dean, etc. Even if you believe \\"the media is liberal\\", they are not liberal to the point that Fox/Newsmax are conservative.  On a scale of 1-10 for bias, NBC, ABC, CBS are probably +3 Liberal (CNN maybe +4).  But, Fox is +8 Conservative.  Newsmax is +10 Conservative.  Because of this, it creates a situation where Trump/Republicans can safely go on Fox/Newsmax and only be given softball questions with no challenge.  For example, Trump's is doing a \\"interview\\" with Hannity who asks a softball question like \\"can you promise not to abuse power as retribution\\".  Lol, and Trump STILL screws it up and says \\"I'll be a dictator on day 1\\" to which Hannity says \\"Well, that's not retribution\\", which is the Fox News mode, ask a question and then shape the answer to pro-conservatism.Harris would not be extended that same courtesy on NBC/CNN/whatever.  Case is the Lester Holt interview - he went after her with tough questions and didn't cut her slack.Also, the Dana Bash, CNN interview.  It wasn't HOSTILE, but it was a tough interview.  She was asked point-blank about her position on fracking, and badgered on it for not taking the question directly.  Bash went after Walsh on his statements of \\"carrying weapons of war\\".  And the list goes on.I know that Trump supporters love to claim bias/etc, but the fact is the \\"liberal media\\" does go after Democrats in a way Fox/Newsmax NEVER goes after conservatives.  So where Trump has a safe haven for interviews, Harris does not, and there just isn't a reward for taking the risk.Now - we can argue that MORALLY Harris should.  Well, MORALLY we should have Trump/Harris taking tough questions with deep policy analysis.  But the fact is less than 10% of American care.  They want the drama and personality.

The DNC in 2016 actively worked against Bernie Sanders. The head of the DNC got caught giving Hillary debate questions ahead of time to help her prepare and win the debate. More recently they propped up Biden and once he dropped out, they could have had a very quick primary season but decided against letting their party members vote and undemocratically anoint Harris as the nominee.  The DNC is a private organization that is allowed to make decisions like this internally. The organization exists for only one reason - to influence politics by collaborative effort of members. While I personally hated seeing their treatment of Bernie, I recognize that it was not only within their rights but in fact the most likely action for them to take because Sanders was not likely to toe the organization line and move in the direction that that organization *really* wants to go. I would argue that the RNC would be in a better place for the projected future had they been a little stronger in their handling of Trump and had pushed against his takeover of the party ideology, but perhaps they really wanted to move in the direction that MAGA has pushed them all along. In addition, off the top of my head, It's been Democrat administrations who tried to institute soviet style snitching. Obama made an official notification page and e-mail address where people could report their neighbors and family for saying \\"misinformation\\" about Obamacare. Biden tried to institute a 1984 style \\"Truth commission\\" to fight against \\"misinformation\\". \\nI can't find any record of any reporting system for reporting neighbors or family for spreading misinformation about Obamacare. I can find some things about reporting *fraud* and *scams* related to obamacare, but that is a perfectly reasonable thing. As for Biden's commission on misinformation, this is also something that should be expected in the current age of deep fakes and viral hoaxes causing real harm and panic. His choice to make this part of the DHS and for who to oversee it are fairly questionable, but honestly the scope and breadth of the organization was never even really fleshed out before it got shut down. A judge placed an injunction stopping anybody from the government from even *meeting* with social media companies to discuss handling of fake news, disinformation, and other propaganda, but I wonder how this would play it if Trump were to become a president who literally owns and operates his own social media company... Just in the last month we have multiple Democratic Secretaries of States trying to remove 3rd party candidates who hurt Harris's chances by drawing votes away from her and fight to keep on 3rd party candidates who hurt Trump's chances by drawing votes away from him. Courts have overturned some of these decisions because they weren't based in the law.This is politics as usual, but I agree that it is shady to use an official position in a partisan way... Except perhaps if one was elected to that position in a partisan election.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"NOT A JOKE","title":"Elon Musk deletes joke about 'no one trying to assassinate Kamala Harris'"},{"text":"Did you write this yourself?","title":"Portage County sheriff: 'Write down the addresses' of Kamala Harris supporters who display yard signs"},{"text":"Boycott X/Twitter, Tesla, and Elon Musk!

You may argue about Roe v. Wade's validity until the end of days, but the SCOTUS, thanks to Trump giving them a GOP majority, has also shown absolute corruption, a flagrant inability to accept that a \\"precedent\\" shouldn't be reversed without some major new breaking piece of information changing the data set, and have given him a blanket immunity for official act (nowhere in the Constitution does it say he does), have revisited homosexual marriage, have refused to take on and/or strike down religious establishment laws, and have voiced an interest in revisiting the slavery clauses.That is to say, without amending anything, just by changing who interprets the text in their own political views, he changed the effects of the Constitution. And he did that in a way that the ripples of it can be felt long after he was done playing pretend in the Oval Office.He reinforced the colossal divide in the country in a way that is so utterly nefarious, you would be excused from thinking he was anything but an asshole. He actively dismissed actual, demonstrable facts just because they showed him being wrong, or not jiving with their ideology. He delegitimized actual data and science to boast people who are being shills for a larger company, or who aren't even in the right field of expertise to express an enlightened scientific opinion or theory (like Jordan B. Peterson on how COVID-19 was not stopped by masks and hand sanitizer), and he platformed multiple people who are strong fearmongers or violence-supporters, accusing those who pointed out the horribleness and impropriety of the behavior that was applied... of being the ones who are hateful and cruel.He also managed to reinforce the concept of hatred towards minorities, and changed the public's general trend of perception from acceptance to overt phobia. Gays were being more and more accepted, now they're being called pedophiles in the open, and some public figures, without being arrested for inciting violence or forced to put a public apology, are calling for them to be lined up and shot in the back of the head.

She is not planning on riding that fall out with him, and she seems to care mostly for Barron. So, this is what logically, to me, she must do to ensure all of that. If Trump gets the presidency again, Melania is only gonna lose, as Chief Roberts of SCOTUS is clearly planning and already has turned the highest court into Trumps plaything. And Trump, very publicly, already has her replacement lined up.If Melania does anything less, she stands to lose big, and get shut out. There is a world where she bets it all on Barrons scheme, and tries to fade into the background while living off her son, but thats a gamble. She needs a backup plan.

Let's be clear. Trump encouraged no violence on January 6th. He gave no orders to overthrow the government. He actually offered additional security in advance of the protest and was turned down by Pelosi. So to start with, to say he attempted to commit a coup is demonstrably false.Furthermore, the violence on January 6th was nowhere near the level of a full blown coup. There was some vandalism, some assaults on police by a minority present, and not one shot fired except by the police. Videos have shown that many of the protesters did not engage in violence of any kind, were actually friendly with officers, and some even show officers inviting them inside.In contrast, months earlier a protest at the white house saw people try to violently enter the white house and when they were prevented from doing so they set fire to a church across the street. No one calls that a coup, and frankly it falls short of one, but it was more destructive and violent than January 6th. And it was perpetrated by leftists who wanted to oust Trump from office, if not outright assassinate him.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"The Right:  \\"It's time to start eliminating the vermin - gays, the trans, the immigrants, and the communists that choke this country like a cancer.\\"   The Left:  \\"The Right's eliminationist rhetoric is extremely concerning.

At the same time, the prevalence of psychotherapy has gone up and up.I think OPs cynical contention is that psychotherapy doesn't exist to help people's mental health, it exists to improve our ability to tolerate abuse so we can be put under more stress as workers.  It also means people can live in worse conditions, have them all live in an isolated shoebox with no means to afford to visit \\"3rd places\\" to meet eachother and have everybody hang out on their phones instead.  It's cheaper.Essentially, the individualistic nature of psychotherapy is fundamentally flawed because the only way to improve collective mental health is to work as a community to demand better wages and working conditions and lower rents and so on.  Whereas psychotherapy is, essentially, victim-blaming, if you feel upset or unhappy about the status quo it is treated as a personal failing which you need to work to address with therapy.  Famous psychologists like Jordan Peterson say things like \\"Fix yourself before you try to fix the world\\", this psychologist also being infamous for abandoning his patients after becoming famous.I'm actually more of an extremist than OP on this point, and see psychotherapy as not the only thing like this.  I'll point out the treatment for basically all mental illnesses, developmental disorders, and so on are focused on making somebody employable.  People are encouraged to get more mental health accommodations than ever, but the legal right to such accommodations is limited to work or work training (school), because the system sees it as a success if you're able to work accommodated even if you're functionally impaired in your broader life.  As such, no further treatment for somebody's underlying impairment need be given, since there is no profit motive to do so.Essentially, psychology and psychiatry are fundamentally corrupt.  This is not to say everybody in this system is corrupt, not every psychologist is a Jordan Peterson and honestly I'd say most working in the system agree with me to a degree, but feel trapped because among other things their very livelihood is tied to perpetuating the status quo.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"Literally registered Democrat in this years primary according to North Carolina State Board of Elections.Source: https://www.ncsbe.gov/You have to put in the effort to search his name.","title":"??

Would you argue that the peace architecture that has (very honorably) been attempted is holding?Yes, post WWII diplomacy is working. Global powers capable of starting and contributing to a \\"great war\\" meet regularly. The amount of military might tied up in alliances has been extremely effective in stopping large conflict. Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Arms Control has provided stakes and transparency to any tension between large nations. Economic Diplomacy has been horrendously effective in driving situations to preferred endings. Do you have any evidence to the contrary?  If so, why is it all coming undone, with defense stocks increasing many times over? If you have the patience, I would ask you to phrase your answer without resorting to \\"it's the other guy's fault\\".Sure. I'd argue its three-prongedthe Balance of Power, Deterrence, and Collective Security.The Balance of Power is seated by the group with the loudest voice and biggest stick. Having those two costs money. Deterrence requires sufficient threat of harm, which also costs money. Collective security seats several large nations together, all promising protection and the same level of continuity. This level of military, political and diplomatic might requires heavy investment.","title":"CMV: The world once more marches towards a great war.

We have so many more that can help men, including as you've said housing and mental health because men are the primary victims of homelessness and suicide.

Instead, a lot of our messaging is \\"well, men caused these issues for themselves\\". As if other intersections like class and race and sexual orientation didn't exist in the creation of these societal dynamics and those old unjust laws. The rich did this to poor men and our messaging is out there blaming the poor men for their own exploitation? Like, WTF are we doing by repeating such messaging?The truly leftwing thing to say would be: \\"you, too, are victims of complex, changing, and often subtle social and institutional dynamics. Here's how we can help you\\". Instead we're lecturing young men with what they perceive to be negative and accusatory language. For example we don't propose therapy out of charity and good will, we often say they have to \\"fix\\" themselves with therapy because they're \\"toxic\\".

The DNC in 2016 actively worked against Bernie Sanders. The head of the DNC got caught giving Hillary debate questions ahead of time to help her prepare and win the debate. More recently they propped up Biden and once he dropped out, they could have had a very quick primary season but decided against letting their party members vote and undemocratically anoint Harris as the nominee.The bylaws of the DNC dictate what to do when a candidate has won a primary vote and then drops out before the convention. They can't exactly launch a new statewide election. In addition, off the top of my head, It's been Democrat administrations who tried to institute soviet style snitching. Obama made an official notification page and e-mail address where people could report their neighbors and family for saying \\"misinformation\\" about Obamacare.

Psychotherapy helps people navigate the world that they have created. Greed, war, and exploitation are older than capitalism. I mean, we're talking about a world where humans enslaved other humans.Psychotherapy doesn't enable the system, because the system has existed and thrived way before the rise of therapy.  Also people obviously still suffered from mental health illnesses in the past. It's just that instead of getting help, they either killed themselves, abused their families, or ended up stuck in a \\"looney bin\\" with no autonomy at best, and a lobotomy at worst. Those mentally and emotionally hurting individuals passed on the trauma to their kids through abuse, and the cycle continued until we reached a generation that took the steps towards healing.You're also less likely to think about societal change if you're not well. How could someone too depressed to leave their bed set forth to organise at their workplace and create a union? In my opinion, the current system is what enables the current system. It's a self-powered, well-oiled, and self-sufficient machine. We're kept just comfortable, materialistic, and exhausted enough to not fight for change.If you truly care about your patients, your goal won't be just to push them back into bad conditions. Ideally you want to help them rebuild their health, self-esteem, self-worth, and self-respect, and empower them to make better choices for themselves so they can persevere in this capitalistic hellscape that we all have to live in.

And it's all by design.Every second the MSM uses breath to talk about immigrants eating pets or the next crazy thing is a second that can't be used by Kamala to get her message out or reach undecided voters.  This is an information war and trump is denying access to publicity to Kamala by doing this garbage.  Again, it doesn't matter if it is negative for trump at all.  He has his voters and that's not changing.  This is all about suppressing the potential vote for Kamala and without contact to Kamala these undecided people are more likely to shrug their shoulders and think both sides are equally bad (and not vote).

He's a rapist and a child predator.\\"Well, Ill tell you the funniest is that before a show, Ill go backstage and everyones getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and Im allowed to go in because Im the owner of the pageant and therefore Im inspecting it, Trump said during the interview. You know, Im inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good.  And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that,Then the guy flew on the epstien jet 9 times AND hired the guy who let epstien walk into his cabinetAnd his chief of staff, national security advisor, press secretary, and many more of his \\"great hires\\" said he's a threat.

The capitol riot was simply one part of a multi-step plot.1. Organize the \\"Stop The Steal\\" protest. This included multiple tweets in the days leading up to Jan. 6 in which Trump called upon his base to prevent or delay the certification of the vote. On Jan. 6th, Trump spoke at the rally and demanded his supporters \\"fight like hell\\" or \\"you won't have a country anymore\\" among many other calls to action. He also demanded Mike Pence \\"do the right thing\\" or he \\"will be very disappointed\\". Note that this crowd was infiltrated by the Proud Boys who had been plotting a literal Coup for months leading up to this and their leader is now charged with seditious conspiracy. Trump then marched the protesters to the capitol where the riot occurred. This riot succeeded in delaying the certification of the vote.\\n2. Fire the Attorney General and appoint a loyalist that would call into question the legitimacy of the vote. In the days leading up to Jan. 6th, Trump intended to fire the current attorney general, who repeatedly refused to sign off on Trump's fraud, and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, who had absolutely no qualifications, in order to legitimize Trump's calls for a new election/house vote/new electors. The only thing that stopped Trump from carrying out this plan was hundreds of members of the DoJ including every single assistant AG threatening to resign from their positions if Trump carried out the appointment of new leadership.\\n3. Fake electors plot. Trump employed Kenneth Chesebro to create a scheme to use a fake slate of electors in 7 states to challenge the results of the election. These electors were referenced dozens of times by Trump leading up to Jan. 6 and during Jan. 6 itself. The fake electors were intended by Trump to be accepted by Mike Pence on Jan 6th or for Mike Pence to pretend to be confused about multiple slates of electors and either call for a re-election or kick the vote to the House, where republicans had a majority. On December 14th, using instructions provided by Chesebro, the fake Trump electors gathered and participated in signing ceremonies in all seven States. In five of these StatesArizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsinthe certificates they signed used the language that falsely declared themselves to be the duly elected and qualified Electors from their State. This declaration was false because none of the signatories had been granted that official status by their State government in the form of a certificate of ascertainment.Understanding the above points, one must ask themselves, if Trump had succeeded in this plot, would it be considered a Coup? I think so, and if a Coup fails, it's still an attempted Coup of the US government","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"Thats factually not true.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"Good for her!

In his monologue on *Saturday Night Live*, Dave Chappelle discussed how Donald Trump openly highlighted the tax laws that benefit the wealthy. During the presidential debates, when Hillary Clinton accused Trump of not paying federal taxes, he candidly responded, \\"That makes me smart.\\"Chappelle pointed out that this admission effectively exposed how the rich exploit loopholes in the tax system. He described Trump as an \\"honest liar,\\" someone who openly acknowledges using systems that disadvantage others. This transparency sheds light on a rigged system designed to favor the wealthy, bringing broader economic inequalities into the conversation.I find this concept of an \\"honest liar\\" intriguing. While no one appreciates dishonesty, there's something to be said about someone who doesn't pretend to be anything other than what they are. Trump's candidness about exploiting tax laws doesn't excuse the behavior, but it does highlight flaws in the system that need addressing.In contrast, leaders who present themselves as entirely honest while engaging in similar or worse practices can be more problematic because they perpetuate a facade of integrity. I'd rather deal with someone who openly shows their cards than someone who hides behind a veneer of honesty. It prompts a more genuine discussion about the issues at hand and pushes us to confront and potentially fix systemic problems.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"The maturity of this guy astounds me.

Mental health clinician here.I first want to start with agreeing with you. Yes, many many peoples' psychological stressors and troubles are resultant of the social conditions that they are situated in. This is something that I personally hold in mind when I am serving my clients and it is something that I always encourage peers and colleagues to keep in mind when approaching a client's situation. I also believe that as practitioners we should be engaged in assailing the systems that cause so much trauma and harm, and advocating for a better world for everyone. Otherwise we are simply just trying to make people into better producers of capital. Personally I lay a lot of this blame at the feet of the insurance companies, who prioritize cost-savings and \\"evidence-based\\" therapies over actually meeting someone where they are and addressing the actual problems that they have.That said: psychotherapy is a very, very broad practice and there are many stripes of therapists and theories. You may find some of the more theoretical psychodynamic writers interesting; Fromm, Bordieu, Fanon to name a few. Lynne Layton published a book recently, \\"Toward a Social Psychoanalysis,\\" that interrogates the very same questions and concerns that you seem to have. Regardless on your views on psychoanalysis, it is insightful into the ways in which the therapist can (consciously or not) maintain oppressive structures that inhibit true healing. My point being: the concerns you are raising are part of a conversation that has been going on for practically as long as psychotherapy has been in practice.Personally, I don't see psychotherapy as \\"fixing a problem\\" so much as it is creating a space for someone to be authentic and receive positive support and feedback, regardless of what their authenticity entails. Let's use the weight-lifting metaphor. People on average can lift 10 kg - the system wants you to lift 11 kg. You can manage it, but it fucking sucks to do and you feel terrible about it every step of the way. You try going to personal trainers, and mostly they just focus on you getting to a point where you can do the 11 kg without stress. Hell, they even want you to go higher! You see the gains, sure, but you're still miserable - miserable about the lifting, that it is so hard for you to lift while everyone else seems to be able to without issue, no one else sees the issue with a society based on powerlifting, etc. etc. The issue, though, is not that you cannot do the lift - but that the lift is necessary for you to survive at all, which is not a natural state of living. What about a personal trainer who is less focused on you making the lifts, and more focused on what your body needs to be healthy? This trainer does not exhort you to endlessly lift and produce gains, but instead to contextualize you and your well-being in a broader system that forces everyone into the same lifting rat-race; they exhort you to understand your misery about lifting not as a personal failure, but rather a natural response to living in a society structured around artificial and unequal practices. There is something freeing about recognizing that some things are the results of circumstances beyond your control - knowing what you can and cannot control, what is being imposed upon you versus what is of real importance, and seeing the system for what it is - and to me that is one of the greatest parts of therapy. A good therapist will help someone to see themselves in the context of the systems within which they live (familial, economic, social, etc.) and nurture a broader sense of the client's self.","title":"CMV: Psychotherapy is enabling the current exploitative system"},{"text":"That joke was never funny.

If you think capitalism makes life hard, well... try living under feudalism, or every single attempt to create communism, or hunter-gathering, or, well... anything. Life has been traumatic for people ever since we crawled down out of the trees before we even developed money or economics.And the basic issue with that is scarcity. If and only if we can get to post-scarcity is there any hope of that changing, but... so far... the fastest approach we've been able to find to that is... capitalism. A mixed economy is likely the best *version* of capitalism, but by definition that's working on a capitalist base. And... trauma and psychological issues are prevalent in the best mixed economic systems we have *too*. The truth is... people need help no matter what system we're in. Literally anything you do to survive in a capitalist system is supporting the capitalist system, even living on government handouts, because you're still... buying stuff. So... best anyone can do is make the best of what we have and advocate for changes that make it *less* exploitive. But you can do that while... helping those exploited people be happier.If there's some other way you can find that you think will do that *better*... don't worry, there is no shortage of psychology majors in industrialized nations.

Yet gun violence consumes my life. I see victims of gun violence from family tragedieschildren, adolescents, and adultsalmost every day.Addressing violence and death is the duty of anyone who has ever had to mend the wounds of a gunshot victim, to attempt heroic measures in the trauma bay, to meticulously care for the injured in the intensive care unit, or admit defeat in front of their loved ones. I have found no worse feeling than having to tell a mother or a father that their child has been killed by a bullet. We have practiced and perfected evidence-based medicine for decades. We should similarly practice evidence-based health policy. As it pertains to guns, some of that evidence already exists.As a physician, I understand the limitations of science. The best research, at least in the biomedical sphere, usually requires the findings of randomized clinical trials, but running those for policymaking often isnt feasible. In public health, the next best option is a natural experiment, in which one jurisdiction implements a policy and a similar, nearby jurisdiction does not, and policy makers can observe the difference.Full story: [https://www.wired.com/story/an-er-doctors-cure-for-americas-gun-epidemic/](https://www.wired.com/story/an-er-doctors-cure-for-americas-gun-epidemic/)","title":"An ER Doctors Cure for Americas Gun Epidemic"},{"text":"Isnt he a registered independent though?

Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met.

The DNC in 2016 actively worked against Bernie Sanders. The head of the DNC got caught giving Hillary debate questions ahead of time to help her prepare and win the debate. More recently they propped up Biden and once he dropped out, they could have had a very quick primary season but decided against letting their party members vote and undemocratically anoint Harris as the nominee.  In addition, off the top of my head, It's been Democrat administrations who tried to institute soviet style snitching. Obama made an official notification page and e-mail address where people could report their neighbors and family for saying \\"misinformation\\" about Obamacare. Biden tried to institute a 1984 style \\"Truth commission\\" to fight against \\"misinformation\\". Just in the last month we have multiple Democratic Secretaries of States trying to remove 3rd party candidates who hurt Harris's chances by drawing votes away from her and fight to keep on 3rd party candidates who hurt Trump's chances by drawing votes away from him.

I can not know the breakdown, but it must be true that a portion of Trump voters believe that the current regime controls the media representation of all facts related to Trump (biased news is propaganda after all). Many of those probably believe that the Department of Justice has been politically weaponized. Given that it has been in the past (War on Drugs), why not now? What information do you have that you can be sure is untainted by bias? How do you know, beyond the shadow of any doubt, that a Democrat-run DoJ isn't being pointed at Trump in a concerted effort to take him out of the race?I should note that I am no conspiracy theorist. I do not like Trump. I would not vote for him. I also do not believe the things I noted above are happening. But I can not dismiss them out of hand. In the same vein, I can not simply swallow the narrative being fed me.So there are more options than the two you propose. The narrative you believe simply isn't the narrative they believe. Whether that be due to ignorance, malice, or misinformation.Some points to consider:When it really comes down to it, 10 news networks running the same story doesn't mean that 10 independent stories all reach the same conclusion. It is usually that one source supplied the same story to 10 different outlets.Nobody who found themselves on the wrong side of history ever thought they were wrong. They were judged wrong after the fact.If you are certain you are right to the point that it simply doesn't make sense why anyone would think differently, you are not thinking critically. The definition of indoctrinated. It is entirely possible you are right and have all the facts you need to make a correct and principled decision.

To the extent that 2021-2022 inflation was influenced by budget deficits (most was the global supply chain crisis), Trump owns most of that.Fed budget deficit was projected to be $560 billion in Jan. 2017 (CBO). 7 years of declines to that point.That ballooned to $1 trillion by Jan. 2020, a 78% increase before the pandemic. So Trump put us in a very bad spot going into it. Media rarely covers that.That deficit hit $2.9 trillion actual in 2020.Projected deficit for 2021 was $2.3 trillion in Jan. 2021 - Trump's last budget - before Biden took office. While clearly much of that was needed to get through the pandemic, Trump's budgets ultimately added $10 trillion before interest.While the deficit is less now, it's still elevated but largely due to a far larger percentage of the current budget deficit being composed of interest payments on existing debt, roughly half now. That includes interest payments on Trump's budgets. Keep in mind the last Republican president inherited a surplus and left a record projected $1.2 trillion deficit (Jan. 2009). If both W Bush and Trump had kept the budget steady (Bush maintaining the surplus, Trump keeping the deficit at $560 billion), we wouldn't be remotely in any kind of fiscal mess.So $10 trillion plus growing interest on that debt is Trump's fiscal legacy.

And, on top of all this, the cost per impression in Alaska is 5x lower than in Florida. So if we assume voters in both states are equally elastic, and ignore the obvious political momentum in each state, then the cost of flipping Alaska is 50 times lower than the cost of flipping Florida. Now whether any amount of spend is worth 3 EVs is another story. I run a (questionably accurate) nowcast model and Harris loses the EC by 3 or fewer votes in 6.5% of the scenarios (262 out of 4000 simulations). In 87 of those 262 simulations she loses Alaska by 5% or less (2.2% of total simulations). Thats about 15,000 votes. If she can find a way to shift 15,000 votes, she improves her odds of becoming president by 2%. Thats not a lot, but if shes spending a billion dollars campaigning this election, spending 0.5% on Alaska ($5MM) would disproportionately improve her odds.","title":"Democrats Kamala Harris More Likely to Win Alaska Than Florida or TexasNate Silver"},{"text":"\\"When people ask me...What's gonna happen if the Flip - Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins??

My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if theres a more nuanced explanation.One of the many quirks of the American electoral system is how decentralized it is.  We don't have one big election, we functionally have 50 little ones. This design was not intended to create some failsafes against a coup or massive fraud, but it does so nonetheless.To get to Trump's behavior when he lost in 2020, we have to look back to more recent history:* In 2000, Bush won Florida by an actual whisker, around 530 votes. There was a lot of legal fighting over the recount and outcome, but the end result was Bush winning the state and having his electoral votes certified.  Nevertheless, when it came to certify the electoral votes in Congress in January, 2001, multiple members of the Democratic delegation attempted to protest the count, which didn't go anywhere.* In 2004, Bush won re-election.  Some Democrats were convinced, with no real evidence, that the voting machines in Ohio were compromised and that he stole the election there despite a victory of well over 100,000 votes.  Multiple Democrats in Congress again protested the electoral college count in January 2005, and it again went nowhere.* Barack Obama won in 2008, and won reelection in 2012. Neither of these victories resulted in challenges to the electoral college count by Republicans.* Donald Trump had his surprise win in 2016.  Nevertheless, in January 2017, multiple members of Congress attempted to challenge the count, it once again went nowhere.That leads us to 2021, where Trump took his effort much, much further than Gore, Kerry, or Hillary Clinton did.  While Gore filed some lawsuits, they were at least grounded in reality and had to do more with process than with outcome.  Trump's conspiracy theorizing was unlike anything we've seen from electoral politics in at least 70 years and probably longer.  While there's no evidence to support the idea that Trump helped organize the actual entry into the capitol, he definitely seemed indifferent to it at best and excited about it at worst - his crime, in the context of your question, was in his providing the kindling that allowed others to set the fire.The question you should ask yourself is what degree \\"subvert democracy\\" entails.  Kamala Harris was not involved in the 2017 protest, so she has that going for her, but she also doesn't appear to be using such involvement as a litmus test, nor am I aware of anyone asking her how she felt about 2001 and 2005.  The Democratic Party doesn't seem to care, for what it's worth, but I'd argue that we may collectively be looking at January 6 with greater significance due to the violence (and rightfully so!) and ignoring that the \\"threat to democracy\\" vis a vis trying to change the results of a legal and legitimate election happening far too often as of late period.  The fact that we will see another protest to the count this coming January regardless of the victor speaks to that.So I believe your framework (\\" it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does\\") is false.  Both sides, in the grand scheme of things, adhere to democratic values more often than not.  Both sides, as well, have utterly failed to meet the \\"adherence\\" standard over the last two decades and no one should be favoring one side over the other on this particular issue.For me?  Trump disqualified himself in 2015, not 2020/2021.  He's unfit for office, and his behavior following his loss shouldn't be rewarded with a do-over.  I also see how well our institutions held up in the face of a significant attack on their legitimacy, and have no doubt that our institutions will continue to do so for this election and for the future, regardless of who wins.","title":"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy."},{"text":"Depends on what sub groups you're talking about.I'm AA.
