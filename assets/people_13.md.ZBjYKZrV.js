Never seen that. Most liberals are for hunting as long as it's done with conservation in mind. We don't think there should be a billion deer, but we believe in the quota system we have in the US, typically. The oil and the war seems to go hand in hand. I'd argue it's more about limiting their oil production and making the world more reliant on our oil production. I don't think the right is all about buying foreign oil, more about making ours cheaper by drilling more. Drill, baby, drill is the common Republican saying. Not big more from the middle east. If I remember correctly our number one importer of oil is in south America. Not the middle east. Yeah economics is a complicated issue, I don't really think  anyone can change your mind on that. However the president can do a blanket 15% Tarrif on all foods for 150 days through executive order. So while complex that kind of order has an impact no matter what else you do. Liberals on guns...I don't think any liberals are trying to take guns, but they are trying to regulate them. From my perspective, the only thing citizens would have in America were the government to come for them or  civil war to start would be guerilla tactics. No politician is advocating for homeowners to have military drones. Assault weapon ban, yes, that's a thing, but in Iraq and Afghanistan they had full auto AK47s everywhere, they may have \\"won\\" in the end, but had we stayed and forced the issue with no rules of engagement, we'd have killed them all. Bringing a gun to a drone fight is not a winning strategy. Liberals on the freedom of speech. I think this gets twisted a lot... Biden has been president for 4 years, yet if I log in to Twitter today I can find users waving the Nazi flag and saying insane things. They haven't been censored. They were censored by a company before Musk took over, but not by the government. There are fringes of the left that advocate for censorship, sure, but popular Dems in political positions are really not doing that. (Republicans are banning books and talking about taking broadcasters licenses, but that's another topic).Republicans on small government. They do want to be less involved in the world. More isolationist. Also less regulation. And less social things, cuts to DOE, Medicare, social security, etc. Those are the smaller government items. But they few security as paramount, so increase military, police, DHS, TSA things like that. I don't view it as contradictory, I do disagree with it.

Honestly, it mostly seems like the concern is for how much effort MtF trans individuals put into \\"passing\\"Before the Republicans made a huge issue of this, MtF trans individuals used the bathroom of *there appearance* and *nobody cared*.  In fact, most people would have been more upset if a passing MtF trans woman used the men's restroom.The backlash seems to be the idea that men who simply declare themselves Trans, but are not doing anything to pass or live as women would enter women's spaces, because again, *passing* trans MtF women have been in women's spaces *since the 1950s*.Sports also seems to be an area where the impacts have not been thought about.  If MtF trans individuals, who are  doing hormone treatments to have a body that expresses  as female are supposed to play in  men's sports, that would mean *FtM trans men would be playing in women's sports.*  This seems to be the exact opposite of what the concerns about men in women's sports wants to have happen.  A FtM trans individual will have the chemical biological advantage that people claim a MtF trans individual would have meanwhile estrogen therapy results in muscle loss and reduced bone density.  I am not saying your opinion is wrong, but sex reassignment has been a thing since the 1950s.  It was *not an issue* that trans women used women's spacesz played in women's sports and participated in society as women.What *changed* is Republicans made a big deal about it and made it seem like individuals who were either *not passing* or *not ready to fully live as their preferred gender* were the most typical versions of Trans individuals.","title":"2 Democrats speak out against transgender athletes after Trump win"},{"text":"Yeah but we know who his owners are - why would he lower prices and impact corporate profits?","title":"Jim Jordan: Trump, Musk, RFK, Gabbard Came Together Because Of Free Speech Issue"},{"text":"I'm right there with ya, friend.

The amount of deaths will skyrocket and infectious diseases will run rampant.  Parasites and diseases we thought eradicated will reappear in the US. Preventable deaths from childbirth and complications from pregnancy will skyrocket.  Since the hormone implants that double as birth control will probably be banned I expect epilepsy deaths and deaths or injury from other conditions managed by hormone treatment via the hormone implants will spike to inhumane levels.  The Nexplanon implant in particular is very commonly used as a long-term treatment to keep various normally deadly or debilitating health conditions in check or in controlled remission.  So pretty much everybody that doesnt get it traded out before the next administration takes power is probably going to relapse and potentially die horribly.\\nThe likely reversal or complete removal of the ACA will result in many people losing health insurance and thus being unable to pay for treatment.\\nOh, and lets not forget that Covid wasnt actually the [worst thing pandemic wise](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-says-coronavirus-pandemic-is-not-the-big-one-the-world-needs-to-brace-for-2020-12-29) that is expected to occur in the next few years.  \\nThere is this thing called The big one, aka Disease X.  Its a placeholder name for what is likely to be the single worst pandemic since the bubonic plague.  It is such a major concern that the WHO has been actively trying to find where it is going to appear.  In case youre wondering why so much money is going into disease tracking and research its because of Disease X.Nobody knows where its going to appear, nobody knows what virus, bacteria, or other pathogen it will evolve from.  All that is known is that based on viral outbreak patterns across human history we are overdue for one and it is going to be extremely bad.The scariest part about it though relates to the glaciers melting. See there is a chance the big one could originate from still viable bacteria and viruses that are frozen in glacier ice that is melting into our ocean and our rivers.  You see besides frozen mammoths the glaciers also happened to have a whole bunch bacteria, viruses and other pathogens frozen in time within them.  Due to scientists deciding to [test to see if they are alive](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/03/08/world/permafrost-virus-risk-climate-scn) we now know that some of them are still viable.  Which means that if they survive being unfrozen from the glaciers, they could spread within our environment and that could potentially be plague level bad.\\nIf this ends up being the source for this super pandemic, that would mean there is an extremely high chance that modern humanity has absolutely zero immunity to the big one.  What this means is that without a proper health department, disease readiness and response, and research with resources to fund trying to find a treatment to Disease X; incalculably high numbers of people will die.Considering how much RFK JR, or really any other appointee of the incoming administration, will be crippling the health department; if Disease X appears in the US they will likely be completely incapable of dealing with it.  In fact, we may not even realize that its even here until its too late because the health department is also responsible for tracking potential outbreaks, and I guarantee you that branch of the department will be cut.\\nIsnt that neat?","title":"What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care?"},{"text":"Sure, but it would have all happened pretty much the same way no matter who was president the last 4 years.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"He cab be impeached but the senate probably won't convict him since it requires a 2/3 vote.

It was established the same time abortion was being criminalized. In 73 ruled that abortion was a liberty and discriminatory against women. That's what was overturned under the argument that it isn't deeply rooted in american history or tradition.The same amendment that gave formerly enslaved people citizenship and stopped payment to slave owners is being used over 100 years later under the premise that it is some right to privacy or personal liberty for women to have abortions. It's a gross misuse I don't understand why it took so long to overturn if you look at the context or intent of the constitution. The same amendment that was floated to bar Trump from holding elected office for insurrection... all those discriminated demographics showed more support for him lol wtf.The overwhelming pressure being felt on the 1st amendment, not even to speak of the huge 2nd issue, The whole intent is to restrict the government and we are certainly seeing them bend every single freedom to restrict citizens in my short adult lifetime.

That's generally going to be true across the board, no matter what side you fall on.  Even the \\"I can't afford my food!\\" is emotive reasoning because they most likely don't understand why they can't afford their food.  Most people simply don't understand how the economy works and what affects the price of different foods.And yes, voting for Brexit had a lot of support from people who *wanted* it for some reasons.  Even those that understood it *completely* could have voted in favor of Brexit on account of some form of emotive reasoning.An example is the gun debate.  There is *practically speaking*, no reason why people would spend so much energy and emotions on that particular debate when their arguments are *primarily* school's getting shot up.  However, when you actually consider the number of people who die to gun related incidents in their entirety and compare it to other things that cause death, people *tend* to ignore everything else in favor of being angry that children died in a mass shooting at a school.  Those other areas of concern don't seem to bother people nearly as much.Guns, outside of being considered \\"accidents,\\" don't make the top 10.  And the reality is if you limit the availability of alcohol, force people to get a specific \\"alcohol\\" ID card, remove access to alcohol for alcoholics, and other things that are *already* part of gun control laws or at the very least have had a lot of support, you'd be saving *a lot more people* than by banning all guns.  Which one saves more lives?  Putting increasing limitations on alcohol sales and alcohol consumption, and increasing the punishments for breaking the law in regards to alcohol.  Which one gets more people talking?  Guns.  I am more scared of driving at night in a city in account of drunk driving and speeding than I am of seeing a gun on someone's hip at a supermarket.  I know which one kills more, and I know that if one were to be the death of me *it would be the idiot in the car high or drunk and speeding*.And that's a statistical fact.

Which is heavily influenced by a foreign cartel that is interested in maintaining its own profits, vs giving you a break on your fuel purchases. And while we're on the subject of gas prices, the economic effects of COVID (which you may remember started during the administration of the incoming guy, who disbanded emergency planning resources before the epidemic hit) were huge. On top of shortages of manufactured goods (largely produced in China, which shut down many factories to control the spread of the virus, and switched others to producing medical supplies), fuel prices went crazy, especially diesel fuel. Global and regional shipping of almost all goods depends heavily on diesel fuel. Shortages of goods and huge increases in transportation costs leads to increases of prices across all goods. So, it is more accurate to say that the Biden administration's handling of the post-COVID inflationary era, along with an independent Federal Reserve board, got our economy through very rough times in about the best way it could have been done. So we elect the incoming president based upon the simplistic observation that \\"Prices were better under\\" what's his name, rather than looking at the big picture. This is stupefyingly ignorant. That doesn't even take into account that number 45's reluctant initial response to the pandemic, his resistance to doing what experts recommended, and his interference with the response through disinformation, worsened its economic impact.

While it is true that, technically, their vote actively strips away your rights, they probably werent even thinking about that when they voted for Trump. Many Trump voters that I know were really struggling financially under Biden, and they truly believed that Trump would improve the economy. Lots of them were socially liberal and didnt agree with the Republican Party at all on issues relating to gay marriage/abortion. Unfortunately, many of them felt pushed to vote red due to skyrocketing inflation and weak borders. Its sad that there is no party to represent the libertarians of the world, but such is the country we live in. I tend to be more economically conservative, myself, but Im a single issue voter on abortion, so I voted blue. My vote for Kamala doesnt reflect my beliefs on economic policy, its just that my bodily autonomy is more important to me than the amount of money in my pocket. If I were really struggling financially, however, it might be a different story.What Im trying to say is that a vote for Trump doesnt necessarily mean someone is wholeheartedly against your union or that they support policies to disenfranchise you. They may, like all (flawed) humans, be putting themselves first, and might have forgotten you in the process. Its sad, but again, in the current two-party system, youre inevitably sacrificing some of your beliefs by choosing sides.As a side note, if your mother, grandmother, etc, are all planning on coming to your wedding, they clearly care about you and your partner and want to support you. Like all things in life, we should focus on what we do have, not what we dont.

Right, because he's well known as a man of discipline dedicated to learning. They're already repeating the same mistake of delayed/poor transition.

His underlings don't have the authority to speak for anyone but themselves.The biggest risk here (outside of another coup, which could unleash something far worse than just Trump if the military steps in) is brain drain in the executive branch. He definitely has the power and people to do damage there.While I hear you regarding swing states, those Congressmen have to survive a primary firstEven primary voters lack the patience for a PowerPoint on how Joe Schmoe (R-ETC) slow walked a bill through committee while at the same time going on Fox to rant about trans people like a loyal soldier.

They care about other stuff: the economy, prices, healthcare, jobs, etc. However, if the Trump administration is perceived as too brutal against migrants this time around, I think Latinos might get radicalized against Trump again. Imagine you're a Latino citizen in Miami or Los Angeles and suddenly feds are going door to door asking people to show their papers.

Those won't just be an abstract thing they've heard of, those relationships will now be a thing they have personal experience with, and in a supportive and loving context.  This will make gay rights more **salient**, meaning they'll be more likely to think of it as an issue when considering political positions.  \\n * Second, it will **personalize** gay relationships.  Despite whatever hateful rhetoric they've heard from right-wing sources, you will have given them a *powerful* counter-narrative -- gay relationships can no longer just be \\"weirdos in SanFran\\", they'll forever be \\"Abe and Bob, who looked so *happy* at their wedding\\".  This will make gay rights more **positive**, meaning they'll be more likely to be in favor of them when they come to mind.  \\nTaken together, *this experience will nudge dozens of conservative voters in the direction of gay rights.*\\n \\nBy contrast, if you say \\"anyone who voted for a Republican is not invited\\", you reinforce the idea that gay people are the enemies of Republicans; as a result, you would likely nudge dozens of conservative voters *against* gay rights.To advance the cause of gay rights, inviting them is easily the logical choice.**However**, emotions matter -- how we feel about things is important, *especially* for something as meaningful as your wedding.  You're clearly unhappy about this idea, and that may be enough to make it worth culling the invite list.Two things to consider:  \\n * First, your fiance has made it clear that this plan will cause quite a lot of trouble for them down the road.  That may be the lesser of two evils, but keep in mind that every time that avoidable family drama afflicts your partner in the future, there's a real risk of them feeling a flash of (justified) resentment that you wouldn't let them avoid it.  Starting your marriage with that future conflict may not be ideal.  \\n * Second, you can perhaps talk with your fiance about more targeted non-invitations.  As an example, you mentioned that one or more individuals had posted hateful rhetoric about gay people online; perhaps not inviting them in particular due to that specific behavior is something your partner could be on board with?Finally, two things:  \\n * First, it fundamentally comes down to whatever you and your fiance talk over and agree on.  The right answer is *your* right answer, for you as a couple.  \\n * Second, congratulations!!  I hope your wedding is amazing, and your marriage even better!","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"They should have ate him alive his first term from a normal political standpoint, but here we are.

Consider the Iran-Iraq War in 1988. Iran blockade the Persian Gulf and began sinking civilian oil tankers. This drove gas prices up in the United States, which led to the US sending the Navy to ensure shipping lanes went unmolested. Iran mined the waters, badly damaged a USN vessel, starting Operation Praying Mantis, which saw the United States demolish Iran's navy. This normalized the gas prices as oil shipments resumed.When people launch a war over resource acquisition, they seek to reduce costs by seizing control of the resource. Now you don't need to bargain for it. But this isn't what the United States typically does. Instead, the US most often supports a sympathetic government regime in these regions, toppling the old hostile regime, which allows the US to buy oil from them at very low prices. The hostile regime was selling oil at ludicrous prices, making intervention profitable.This is why war can be both disruptive to oil markets, and also beneficial to a nation to engage in conflict.","title":"CMV: Liberals and Conservatives are all contradictory."},{"text":"Non Christian churches .. yes","title":"House Fast Tracks Bill That Would Give Trump Power to Target Nonprofits"},{"text":"Mother fucking General Q himself.","title":"Extreme rhetoric from Mike Flynn retruthed by Trump today"},{"text":"Im kind of like, more happy than upset, Mario Alvarez said.

Just because the democrats joined in on the game out of desperation post-Raegan, it doesnt mean it comes from liberals or is a Democratic thing. Its fucking globalism and free-market. Thats neoliberalism. Free Market has been the republicans calling card since forever before Trump flipped the table. Neoconservatism is invading Panama and Iraq its unilateral decision-making by the US that is then forced on other countries. Neoliberals set the economic policy, and neoconservatives started the wars that reminded everyone that even tho trade was free, the US was going to define what free looks like. As a reminder, Bill Clinton was extremely popular. The people complaining about neoliberalism now are likely the same people that were cheering it on post-Reagan. I dont blame the anger tho Reagan lied to them, they all lied to us afterward, and Trump is also selling them even more outrageous lies. The truth is, when prices stayed the same and the US was adamantly #1 with no challengers, the majority was super was cool with it. The truth of the matter now is that if the US pulls back from the world, China will fill the void, and prices will go up. That doesnt mean we shouldnt tone done both of the *rightwing inventions* of neoliberalism and neoconservatism, but it is also ridiculously stupid for Trump to fuck up all our alliances across the world.

As a veteran, it makes me literally sick to my stomach.You're not hearing the point I'm making about Afghanistan.  Have you listened to Gen. Milley or many of the other DOD officials that spoke up about it?  Oh wait, Milley's probably deep state because Trump wanted him fired for \\"insubordination\\" (so ridiculous you'd think this shit was made up, we're talking about the chairman of JCS).  Mistakes were **absolutely** made, 100%, as they often do in such pullouts historically, but they were **greatly** exacerbated by Trump's inane actions working with the Taliban.  He should have never made that deal and he should have done what the US historically has the precedent for doing--work closely with an incoming administration.

Whereas the US handling of inflation has been objectively better than the rest of the world, Out COVID results were much worse.  I know people that died because he said that masks were ineffective and people should use horse dewormer (and light in the veins, and bleach).  You must also blame Trump for the Turkish incursion into Syria on his watch.  And it should bother you that Russia was found to be interfering in our democracy, yet Trump said he believed Putin over his **own country's intelligence apparatus**.  He didn't just let it happen, he urged it on...then said he sides with one doing the interference.You seem to have heard nothing I said and that's so typical, unfortunately, today.

This affects and scares ever single parent ?who isn't far left as parents do not want their kids being able to do things to their bodies without their permission.So if a kid is transgender and they have far-right conservative parents who have made hateful statements concerning LGBT, what are the kid supposed to do? Just suffer in silence? Not be allowed to get information about what's \\"wrong\\" with them? Not every kid has a loving, understanding parent.This is the same debate concerning homosexual youths too. And even today, a lot of gay teens are terrified of their parents. And they have nowhere to turn now. So they hide it the best they can until they get outed by someone. And now the conservatives are making laws that force the schools to out the kids. Teachers and counselors are now not allowed to even discuss it anymore. Books are being banned from the schools. Conservatives want to bankrupt companies like Disney because they want to make a movie with a gay character.The conservatives are going to get children killed. The suicide rates are already going up. The crisis hotlines for LGBT youths are already flooded. This is now a major social problem. And it's not going to fade away. Its going to get worse with the laws that Republicans plan to pass in a few months.","title":"The Trump Ads That Pushed Transgender Rights to Center Stage\\n"},{"text":"Most of the military is comprised of poorly educated people from deep red states.They all voted for trump.Those are the enlisted grunts. They did not, actually, all vote for Trump. First of all, turnout rates in the military are far lower (? to ?) than the civilian average. Those that do vote appear to do so roughly inline with their civilian counterparts.Regardless, enlisted don't issue orders. They're tasked with executing orders. Officers issue orders. Officers run the military. Officers are college educated. It is extremely hard to poll the officer corps, but they appear to more or less mirror the leanings of educated civilians. Which is to say, they probably have a Democratic lean, but there are still many Republicans too. But it's also a group that has been deeply instilled with the notion of staying in their lane. Country over party. Civilian control over military. Follow orders, but not mindlessly. If they do nothing after a coup, it's not because the rank and file have a partisan lean. It's because they're following their tradition of following orders and not involving the military in domestic politics. If the generals instead choose to overthow a coup, it isn't necessarily because they don't like Trump's policies. It's because they're sworn to uphold the Constitution. The military is its own little world. It is intentionally so. Bringing the military into our politics is a danger for everyone, including Trump.","title":"Many in government are worried about Trumps return.

I voted for Harris, like a good little boy. Comments like this make me feel more duped than ever and is an example of some of the nastiest racism i've seen on this platform, or any for that matter. I cannot count how many times ostensibly \\"liberal\\" people have only listened to me after I list off my education and who I voted for. Given that I am educated in the conventional sense you'd look at exclusively, and that I voted for (and would happily provide evidence of having voted for) your candidate, I will speak for myself. You will not speak for me, or anyone of my ilk. Since you choose to adopt a condescending tone and apparently have a crystal ball regarding my fate and those who share some aspects of my heritage, I'll try to match it as much as I can. The former is no problem, the latter, I must confess, requires clairvoyance that I do not possess. So, take a seat and open your ears. Don't speak: We have our own agency. We know what we are doing, we know whats been done, and to the best of information available, have a concept of what is coming. Your infantile, monolithic attitude regarding \\"latinos\\" is ignorant, white centered and devoid of any of the cultural diversity and or empathy you most certainly are attempting to portray yourself as possessing. Saying such rancid things, such demeaning, patronizing rubbish is going to drive more and more of us away until you don't know any of us to talk down to anymore. Despite no affinity for gambling, I'd wager that you are a white American who has no idea what our values are, who we are, nor the fact that we are of a large amount of different nationalities with different dialects different values different histories and different legal statuses. It would behoove you to learn if you truly seek to endear yourself to Latino's and what we think. Perhaps you're missing the fact that Donald Trump's strongest demographic was white people. So, having checked all the boxes you demand we adhere to, educated, latino, english being my second language, Democrat being my vote and registration, how in the blue fuck do you think this comes off to us? You'll ignore this completely or ignore the following advice but I'll do you the service anyway, since thats all you want out of us as it is: Reflect, learn and then comment about a group of people different than you. It is pretty clear you yourself lack any sort of credentials to tell us what to do, and no amount of manipulated, mangled buzzwords like \\"bad faith\\" will mask your inherently racist viewpoint. I would advise you to fix that if you really care about our community. With all the disrespect and disgust I can muster on a text based social platform, I say this: Fuck you, and fuck off until you can speak like an educated adult. So far, there is no evidence of such a thing, but hope exists for all. You're lucky I'm one of the good ones as they (and you likely privately) say, because if you learned about our culture, you'd understand we don't take kindly to this sort of thing.","title":"Young Black and Latino men say they chose Trump because of the economy and jobs.

Yes, but that's so they can control the oil.I see both sides blame the other for the state of the economy when that is a much more complex matter than executive orders.Yes, but that's not contradictory. Liberals clame to be about freedom yet they do not stand for the freedom to bear arms or freedom of speech.There is no \\"freedom to bear arms\\" there's a second amendment right to bear arms for the purposes of a well-regulated militia. There's no absolute right to own assault rifles, grenade launchers or tomahawk missiles. Liberals advocate for regulating guns not abolishing them. And who knows what you're talking about with free speech. Is this because liberals advocate against hate speech? Be more specific. In any case there has never been an absolute right to say anything anywhere. You can go to jail, for example, for disrupting court proceedings with your speech. Liberals are very much pro free speech meaning allowing the press to report on government and having full transparency in government. Conservatives, Trump specifically, has said the exact opposite and has repeatedly said that the press who disagrees with him or says unfavorable things should lose their jobs or go to prison.Conservatives are supposed to be for smaller government and less present in global affairs yet their political affiliates they live so much do the opposite.Yes. This is contradictory. You got me on this one. Conservatives want to regulate what you can do sexually, who you can marry, what drugs you can put in your body, etc. They're for big government on almost every social issue and many desire a police state. This is very backwards from their small government stance. They are for small government when it comes to regulating businesses.","title":"CMV: Liberals and Conservatives are all contradictory."},{"text":"They are incredibly dependent on Trump being on the top of the ticket to pull out low propensity voters.

If you do, provide a source so i can check the same on your information.In Donald Trumps immigration plan, \\"denaturalization\\" specifically targets revoking citizenship for immigrants who obtained naturalization through fraud, forgery, or involvement in illegal activities before or during the citizenship process. Trump aims to prioritize denaturalization cases that would primarily include:1. Individuals who committed fraud during the naturalization process: This includes cases where applicants concealed relevant information, such as criminal records, or submitted false documents.\\n2. Members of criminal or terrorist organizations: Trump has expressed an intention to use laws such as the Alien Enemies Act to revoke citizenship for individuals associated with organized crime, such as gangs and drug cartels, or those with terrorist ties. The goal is to withdraw citizenship from those who pose a national security threat to the United States.

As far as the regular everyday American who's on the left, I think it's a mental illness to be quite honest with you. I mean these people are losing their minds now. And they're letting the events of the election, rule their lives. That's textbook mental illness. And you ask them why they hate Trump, and not one of them can give you a legitimate answer. They will give you an answer, but every single answer is something that was propaganda from legacy media and is not necessarily true.So if you see how all these people are reacting, literally losing their minds over this election. And you factor in the two men that try to assassinate him, it's pretty easy to surmise that there is a mental illness going on with these people. Because check it out. These people become so enraged, that they become a public spectacle, or do something unforgivable. Unforgivable. These are reactions to a man being elected. But the actual things that are happening around them that the current administration is doing that makes their lives harder, like inflation, illegal immigration, and so on, they don't react to that at all. In fact, a lot of these people are reacting so intentionally to the things that Trump could possibly do down the road, like it's the end of the world. They're behaving just like children when you take away their iPad. Furthermore. The abortion debate has been around for how long? Why all the sudden people are reacting this intensely to it? It's just because it's Trump. A man that before he ever ran for public office, was not necessarily adored by the public, but nobody hated them. Oprah Winfrey had him on her show back in the day, but then she's on a stage a week ago hating the man. Howard Stern is another one. Remember, in this day and age everything is asked backwards. The people doing the wrong things are rewarded while those who do the right things are punished. And with that in mind, to be woke these days is really to be asleep.

Powell told then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he would fight his removal if sought by the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump was upset the Fed was raising interest rates against his wishes. For Powell, the unsavory prospect of a legal showdownone he might have to pay for out of his own pocketwas imperative to preserve the ability of future Fed chairs to serve without the threat of being removed over a policy dispute.  Six years later, Trump is heading back to the White House and the dormant drama of his fraught relationship with Powell is back on display.

Sure, they fuck shit up and throw some cash at us every few years, but that's only a short term fix to a problem they created.

If youre old, you get the typical Fox cycle of old people scared about whatever shit. And the numbers for that side of it this election were nothing special. But its the young ones they took for granted, and didnt have the empathy to understand why they were in danger.If youre 22, youve seen 3 elections since you were 10, and Obama was president. Youve seen a profoundly broken system, and two major candidates in that time who stood for real systemic change. You saw the Republican party empower their candidate to fuck up the system, and you saw the Democratic Party fight tooth and nail to keep anyone from really trying to reform the system, Bernie being chief among them. For all the talk about saving democracy, the Democratic Party hasnt had a legit primary since 2008 where they werent trying to push a specific candidate over all others, and its pretty obvious to young people why that is.So if youre young, your future looks like shit, and you have the most corporate, down the middle politician possible going against a huge fuck you to the system. The appeal makes way more sense than the DNC thought it would, and the Republicans understood that.The DNC tried to strong arm progressives into voting for a candidate because they wanted to resist change. But the change was inevitable, and they got a much less palatable brand of it now. You may quote Covid as an excuse, but part of governing is listening to your constituents when its not an election cycle, and people havent been shy about sharing their opinions about how fucked things have been since well before Covid.

No! I was hoping that the DNC ticket could pull it off.Was Jill Stein a good idea?  Not from my perspective, and photos of her dining with Putin in Russia didnt help her case.So, IMO most Americans - especially those making &lt; $50k annually - are getting left behind, and even though you seemed to imply that youll be okay until 2028, you arent liking whats been happening over the last several years either.

I use this information to keep friends and family properly informed, at a high level, that is digestible, when they need to know.

And minimum wage income instantly goes back into keeping the economy running, which CEO level bonuses sits in savings accounts, or makes even more money in the stock market accounts, but not the economy.When they repeat that high cost of Medicare for All, I remind them that the current system costs more than that currently, so it would actually save money, while covering more people.When they bring up close the USPS because of the cost and slowdowns at the post office, I boil it down to that under Bush, all new USPS jobs need to have the pension fully funded up front, that Trump installed DeJoy, who has some financial interest in other shipping companies, and destroyed mail sorting machines before the 2020 election, and that I'm disappointed Obama nor Biden reversed these actions.I don't tell them any rumors, like that a few people are saying there are some weird voting number patterns, that a recount in just a few counties, would easily end any questions.

Isis rose to significance in 2014. It would be naive for me to cast blame on anyone, or any political party, or president for its creation. But what is true is ISIS rose to power and conducted horrific atrocities in multiple countries under Obamas administration. In 2014 they created their self proclaimed caliphate in Raqqa and seized control of vast parts of Syria and northern Iraqi. They captured Mosul with a population of over 1 million people. Im sure you already know all of this ??. Among the many horrific attacks by them was in Paris in Nov. of 2015. Not to mention also those barbaric videos they released. It wasnt until July 17th, 2017 that Iraqi with the help of American troops regained Mosul. Almost two years after Obama left office. In 2018 the USA dropped the mother of all bombs on ISIS in Afghanistan. It took time to bring ISIS to their knees in that region. But none of the progress was made under Obamas leadership. The Trump administration wasnt perfect dont get me wrong. But what he did do was create the strongest team possible to solve a problem. I think his greatest quality is building teams.

I work in healthcare and anecdotally we had healthcare worker who actually couldnt get back in the country at one point because of visiting family when the Muslim country ban happened. I assumed his hardline policies would turn off people from even coming here. As you noted we already have a shortages in healthcare and access is still a major issue. I have had discussions with Trump supporters about his restrictive immigration policies including legal immigration. They are all for stricter visa process and of course the hardline undocumented immigration approach.

MAGA love to say that having the Obese Orange Octogenarian in office is somehow scary to Russia and China and it makes us safer. Obviously this is false. They love the guy because hes easy to goad and manipulate. 1) Trump will negotiate peace in Ukraine by basically giving Russia what it wants. Russia will be rewarded for the invasion, and the remainder of Ukraine will remain vulnerable to attack in 2-3 years after the Russian military has time to rebuild and regroup. This will be seen as a sign of US and European weakness.2) Trump has little respect for NATO. Hes even encouraged Russia to attack NATO members who he believes arent paying their fair share in the alliance. I believe a Russian attack on a smaller, less significant member of NATO will occur. If that were to happen, the US is obligated to assist - but I doubt that Trump would - this fracturing the entire alliance. 3) US military generals in the Pacific are very concerned about a Chinese attack on Taiwan as early as 2025. While I have no idea when such an attack will happen, Trumps tariffs and trade war and his general reluctance to helping allies around the world unless he feels hes benefitting I believe will increase the odds of an attack.4) Trump has basically said hell allow Israel to do whatever it wants in regard to the Palestinians. His victory will embolden them to potentially take Gaza. I also expect Iran to increase hostility with Israel and vice versa.I know sone dont like it, but the US has been the cornerstone of international stability since the end of WW2 and with Trumps reelection has decided to abdicate that role. That increases the likelihood of bad actors and war in several fronts. While Trump projects an image of toughness, all it will take is a Putin or Xi or Ayatollah to call his bluff. Will the US be there to help its allies or abandon them? If we abandon them, the entire global security blanket tears apart.","title":"Opinion: America is gonna burn under trumps governance"},{"text":"This is Breitbart, so it automatically doesnt pass the bullshit test.","title":"Exit Polling: 40 Percent of Women Under 30 Dumped Harris for Trump"},{"text":"Person 1: *explains long economic plan on how to make the lives of everyday people better*Reaction: \\"Wha, you think you're better than me?\\"Person 2: \\"EVERYONE GETS A PONY\\"Reaction: \\"YEAH!\\"","title":"Trumps victory reveals secret Republicans: Joe Rogan-obsessed Gen Z men"},{"text":"The best things any other country can do about the USA is to say: \\"It's dead Jim\\", move on and do not look back.

The fact that such family members would even want to attend a same sex marriage speaks volumes, and makes me wonder if you're not telling us everything, painting a very biased picture of them.\\n2. The political spectrum is so polarized now that it's designed to tear people apart - family, friends, neighbors. The entire nation. Feeding into that feels wrong, especially when there's such huge, nuanced subjects that deserve a lot more discussion and grey areas than these blanket black and white polarized sides allow, both of those sides exacerbated by deeply restrictive echochambers people simply don't want to step out of because they're so comfortable and convenient.\\n3. I really think you should pick your family members' brains more. What would compel them to think differently than you on certain subjects? Did they weigh out the pros and cons of their vote, choosing what they saw as the lesser evil? Considering how you described them, they don't seem simply vindictive.\\n4. Even if you take the absolute worse approach to this and come to find these family members do in fact hate homosexuality, voting to destroy gay rights, and are very vindictive - this is a prime opportunity to prove them wrong by showing them compassion and love.\\n5. Moving past your family into your overarching ideology, keep in mind that Trump won by a larger margin for a reason. You don't have to agree with anything Trump, trump supporters, conservatives, or anyone else thinks, but I highly suggest attempting to at least understand where they're coming from and finding a way to coexist with them, because as the election results show, they constitute at least half the nation.All that said, you do you.

Bad economy, can't find jobs, high prices. But understand this all started with Covid. Businesses were devastated. People were fired. This happened during Trump 1.0. And he got punished, he lost to Biden. To fix the economy takes time. The Fed lowered the interest rate, the government pushed aid to businesses.As the economy collapsed so did the supply system. The so-called Covid pocket money to the masses began to kick in as the government started to stop Covid from spreading more. People go to buy groceries but short supply and big demand made prices expensive. Who do they blame? The government. Who benefits from high prices? Walmart and Krueger. High prices mean high inflation. And who don't want high inflation? Not only you American consumers but the Federal Reserve. To combat this it raises interest rate. Again Americans paying for houses and cars will be pissed off cuz they will pay more. Who will they blane? The government. Not the Federal Reserve who is independent ( though Trump indicated he want to control it). All the three highs- Inflation, unemployment, interest rate) take time to come down. And it did just in October 2024. Bad for Harris but perfect for Trump.And as a person interested in politics I know Republican administration will fuck up the economy for the next Democratic administration to clean it up. It happened during Clinton and Obama administration. And Biden too.  I know many shit on Biden now but he did brings down the 3 highs.Only for Trump to enjoy the benefits. Ohh..give or take a year or two..Trump will fuck up the economy..their greed for money is too much. Trump has to repay his billionaire friends especially Elon. You can bet Tesla and Space X will be rewarded. Dow Jones and NASDAQ will surely go up. Then there also the tech bros (especially the Bitcoin crowd) - Peter Thiel came into mind. The former CEO of Paypal hit the jackpot with JD Vance. He also invested in Polymarket where people can bet on the presidential election.

You have effectively let them know you're doing it anyway, rubbed it in, and they still don't get to share in your happiness. What if they do show up, and they have to play nice and watch while you live as proof that their ideals are wrong? What if they try to start something and have to be asked to leave. Yeah that kinda sucks, but it makes and their beliefs look crazy in front of a crowd. And what if they're the type of person who will actually move over to a better belief if they have more exposure to the minority they hate.

When people can say \\"I went to see my lesbian cousin get married, it was a lovely ceremony, and I'm happy for them\\" to their friends, family, congregation, or elected officials, it helps our cause.I don't think this has to be black and white. Your friends you haven't seen in years who vote for anti-queer politicians? Probably not a big deal to not invite them. Your partner's grandmother? That seems over the top if she has otherwise been a loving and supportive person in their life. This doesn't have to be all or nothing unless you make it that way.Finally, I believe that while the folks getting married should call the shots in a wedding, I also believe in being hospitable.  If you choose not to invite people for one reason or another, that's one thing. A message telling everyone who is invited not to come if they voted for a particular political party comes across as abrasive and unwelcoming. Either invite someone or don't, but don't provide a conditional invitation.","title":"CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding."},{"text":"Guess there might be some crazy stuff happening soon.

The country was in chaos. The US talking about who they would like to be in charge does not mean that they helped overthrow the country. Even if they did help the guy eventually get in charge.\\n?It does, and I've already provided enough evidence for it.??\\nWe didn't orchestrate a coop though. Ukrainians did. Against a Russian puppet. And they are free to put spy bases on their land.\\nDepends on when they changed their constitution. It's interesting to note that Kuchma, one of Ukraines previous leaders said no to NATO and was subsequently overthrown during the Orange revolution.??\\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa?\\n?Ah, it was 2019.

I was just explaining what was going on and made it quite clear that I did not support that. I want to give Ukraine more weapons to convince Russia to btfo. Instead of the slow meat grinder the US government is prioritizing.?\\nUkraine doesn't just have a weapons problem. They have a man power problem. They've been attrited, as evidenced by their front line collapses in the donbas region and how they keep having to mobilize hundreds of thousands of men. How many rounds of mobilization has Ukraine done? Supposedly, they have a military of 1.3 million active duty with 2.5 million reservists. If they have to continually mobilize men, it means they've burned through their active duty soldiers and reservists. They've been attrited. Sending more weapons will just get more Ukrainians killed. Once you've been sufficiently attrited, no amount of weapons or mobilization can save you. You simply can't train soldiers fast enough, so you end up only training them for a few weeks before sending them to the front line where they inevitably die because of the lack of training.??\\nThat was Republicans my friend. Kind of funny how the Russiblicans are for every war except the one that's a pain in the side of big daddy Putin. Makes you think.?\\nThat was people like Dick Cheney, who endorsed Kamala. That is/was the deep state. It's the same people, no matter which party they pretend to align with.?\\nAnyways, I've provided lots of information with links proving my point. You've done absolutely none of that.
