It's him, Vance, and what ever local people running for office in those areas. Compare to Harris-Walz, where both of their spouses are doing events. Both Obamas and Biden will do campaigning for them.Plus this taints all the previous events they did together. Trump hasn't pulled his endorsement, so some amount of his voters may be turned off by this. Some people who aren't huge fans of Trump may have gone to vote for the R governor and while there marked Trump for President who will now stay home.It may not have a huge effect on turnout, but Trump only won NC in 2020 by 1.2% so it might not take a huge effect to flip it.","title":"Mark Robinsons campaign implosion could be a Carolina miracle for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I hope one of the billboards involves Gob and Lindsay Bluth.","title":"DNC calls Trump chicken for not accepting second debate in billboard campaign"},{"text":"Da, comrade","title":"We chaired the Maine Republican Party.

If Josh Shapiro was selected, then I believe the Democrats would lock in PA immediately. That would probably swing the election. The problem is selecting Shapiro is impossible because he's way more skilled, popular and \\"Presidential\\" than Harris. It's only a reminder that there was no real primary. IMHO the selection of Walz is the DNC waving a white flag. 2) The greatest consistent \\"campaign\\" for Trump right now is the gas station, grocery store and people having to write rent checks. Nothing Harris and the DNC can do to stop the anger and rage from working class Americans being asked to fund 15 million plus illegal immigrants with hotel rooms, goodie bags and cell phones, while many are struggling to put food on the table for their children. 3) The COVID19 lockdowns of public schools hit \\"Blue\\" areas the hardest. IMHO, that's just going to be a place of no return for too many voters. There's a lot the DNC can do and still get \\"Vote Blue No Matter Who\\", but not once you mess with people's kids. The more hypocrisy and clear incompetence around the pandemic \\"response\\", the more many working class parents are going to be furious. 4) The Democratic Party is going to lose a ton of working class minority voters period. Sure college educated younger voters still will tend to trend voting Democrat, but many will vote Stein or sit out the election this time around compared to 2020. There's a lot of hate about the GOP, but the DNC has simply found a way to create the conditions where many working class people will hate Democrats just a little bit more.","title":"Reminder Harris is polling worse against Trump than Biden did in 2020 and Clinton in 2016 today"},{"text":"How about \\"that fucking idiot\\"?","title":"Just Trump calling for a man who's been dead for nearly 20 years to return to hosting.

If you wouldn't say it to someones face, don't type it. Didn't your parents raise you to be decent?Aside from your rude tone, you mention a couple decent points. Here are a couple proposals to consider.1. Rural vote deserves more (electoral college) because there is such a thing as tyranny of the majority. It's the old addage, \\"two wolves and one sheep vote on what's for dinner.\\" Who loses that scenario? This is exactly why we do not have a parliamentary system in the USA. Electoral college makes it so a presidential candidate has to appeal to both rural and western voters, similar to our bicameral legislature (house is population, senate is not population based), by making the rural motor matter more. These systems prevent tyranny of the majority. In order for the fed government to do something, almost everyone has to agree to it. You get into some dicey territory when the minority group has less voting power than the majority (Nazi Germany, Communist Russia, Maoist China, etc.).\\n2. And to your point that the urban would crush the rural votor's for taxpayers, you may be correct in that. I am not trying to predetermine outcomes like both democrats and republicans, I am trying to make things fair. If you want to vote you need to put into the system in some way. That is a class blind, color blind, sex blind, age blind standard. You need stake in the game and I believe its one of the fundamental problems with our failing culture and country.\\n3. As to your final point of how it would be determined, each state would still have two senators, house would be determined based on the population of alive and registered votors in this new system (first responders, vets, landowners, net taxpayers, etc.) Electoral college would reflect these new numbers. (State electors = #reps +#senators still). It's not so much different from what we currently have.All these are are criteria for a citizen to be able to register to vote, one or more of these being met. This along with campaign finance reform would fix a lot. ;)","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"That is understandable and true.

They do have a 1-seat pensioners' party though which I think is cool and which a higher threshold like the one you're advocating for would eliminate.3. It's important for political stability and faith in government that people have representation at the national level. I think it's corrosive for a democracy for many people to feel they don't have that. Obviously we have to set a threshold somewhere but a lower threshold means more people have a stake in the system.4.

They didn't fact check minor details in general, fairly for both. They did fact check all the truly unhinged insane claims, fairly for both. Harris just didn't make any. e.g. there are soldiers on active duty in hostile territoriesThis is a good example of an extremely minor detail, yes. All soldiers are in advisory and training roles, not combat roles, and it is a minor turn of wording, while the spirit of the statement remains intact (that there is almost no significant danger to US troops currently, outside of freak cases). Unlike for example eating dogs and cats, where there is no spirit of correctness whatsoever, not a single grain of truth, just pure racism and conspiracy theory nonsense mongering.An example of something Trump was NOT fact checked on that was vastly more wrong than your Harris example: \\"Millions of immigrants are pouring in from prisons and mental asylums\\" -- in 2024, there have been 15,000 immigrants with known criminal records, out of which most would not have come from prison since that includes records years in the past.

By expanding the debt and allocating that new capital to the stewardship of the people and productive corporate entities, Donald Trump tilted the scale.Inflation is a tax on capital. And when you inflate and give to productive members of the economy, you're pulling against the leeches and the deep state.The debt added during the covid crisis was absolutely necessary as described by legendary investor Bill Ackman. He rose to fame when he shorted MBIA during the 2007 financial crisis and made 1.1 billion dollars off of 60 - 100 million dollar short after reading over 1 million pages of documents.

Board members shouldnt be able to make profits from stock buybacks. All of this is corporate greed and contributes to bottom line prices we pay for any goods. As an example, Hulu is an app I subscribe to and I have been paying $11.99 for a few years. I would be fine if they increased the price using similar increases to employee raises, 1-2%. I logged in yesterday and got notice that next month Ill be paying $18.99. This is a nearly 63% increase. Greed. Now I have to decide if its worth having. Do you truly believe that if I cancel my subscription that I have had since Hulu existed, that they will ever reduce prices, regardless of how many subscribers they lose? They will not, they will create a cheaper package, which is still more than you pay now but they will remove features, add advertising, etc. Regardless of the economy, prices never really return to normal after an increase. If they are decreased, purportedly, the size will be smaller, features removed, more advertising added. Greed. Even gas. Prices go up, up, up and then ah, relief they came down, but did they reduce to what they were before? Not in my lifetime so far. (38 years of driving). Should they go back? Yeah, but with inflation increases, again similar to what kind of raises the general employee gets annually, 1-2%.  Instead we are talking about reducing it to a new value that is 50%+ higher than before the increase. Greed. My entire life I have purchased sugar in 5lb bags at the supermarket. Did you know that during the pandemic the prices increased tremendously. I am sure there were a lot of non greed reasons for that. What were the non greed reasons for also reducing it to 4lbs for the same tremendously increased price?All of my points are to suggest that you may be giving corporations a pass in attempting to say they are only doing what the market will pay and isnt that was capitalism is.

Jill Biden made the announcement at this years Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York, moments before the organization honored President Joe Biden with the 2024 Clinton Global Citizen Award. Hes provided a playbook for getting things done, former President Bill Clinton, said as he presented the award. We honor him today, not just for what hes accomplished, but for the way he has done it. President Biden, standing next to his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton, joked, This is what you call being trapped. In his short remarks, he then called Jill Bidens announcement one of the most substantial of his administration. The additional government spending will mainly come from the Department of Defense, which provides medical care to more than 230,000 active duty military women and nearly 2 million military retirees, as well as their family members. The research will focus on why these women experience endocrine, hematological and other immunity-related disorders twice as often as men. Women are really hungry for this kind of information, Jill Biden said. We dont have the answers. Another change will take effect next week, with a new policy that includes womens health at every step of the research funded by Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funded 751 grants last year to study Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, orthopedic and musculoskeletal injuries, and various cancers. The commitment was among the largest of the more than 100 expected at the two-day meeting of political, business and philanthropic leaders gathering to address some of the worlds most pressing issues. The Clintons have set this years theme as Whats Working, a way to look for potential solutions and effective programs in tumultuous times. An example of that strategy came from the announcement that a wide-ranging group of 15 nonprofits, humanitarian aid organizations and other funders will join forces to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan following more than a year of conflict. The Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan C which includes The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Giving, Global Fund for Women, and The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee  will donate at least $2 million to mutual aid groups in the country by the end of the year. It also pledged to raise another $4.5 million for those groups within the next two years. World Food Program director Cindy McCain said earlier this month that  Sudans nearly a forgotten crisis  and that 25 million people there already face acute hunger. Last week, the top United Nations humanitarian official said fighting is escalating in the conflict that began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between Sudans military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions. The U.N. says more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. With ongoing impediments to a large-scale international aid response, Sudanese community groups have become the primary frontline responders and are currently the most effective means of reaching millions on the brink of starvation, Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said in a prepared statement on behalf of the coalition. With so many lives on the line, the imperative to support local aid efforts in Sudan has never been more urgent.","title":"Jill Biden reveals $500 million plan that focuses on women's health at Clinton Global Initiative"},{"text":"I lost friends because of maga.

Quite frankly I'm getting so sick and fucking tired of the \\"BoTh SiDeS aRe BaD\\" crowd. I get that Dems aren't perfect and they definitely aren't as left as I wish they were, but right now are options are between a wannabe dictator who wants to eradicate the LGBTQ+ community and the candidate that isn't bothered by our existence and vows to preserve our democracy. It just seems a little hypocritical of her to say that she is supporting trans rights and women's rights but absolutely refuses to endorse the one single candidate that is making an effort to give us those rights. Given the circumstances of this election, I have very little patience for the people who still insist that both sides are equally the same when that simply isn't true.I know that Chappell is a pro-Palestine activist and I know she has had problems with the Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war. I have also been critical of how the administration has been handling the war. But the choice is very clear this election on who is the far better candidate for the Palestinians, and that candidate is Kamala Harris. At least that side is trying to start a ceasefire and a two-state solution. The other candidate has personally shaken hands with Netanyahu and has vowed to \\"finish the job\\" if he's elected. Trmp would be much, MUCH worse and it isn't even close.I had a lot to say, but this take just pisses me off so much. I know that she's an artist first and foremost and she doesn't owe anybody an endorsement, but claiming that both sides are equally bad does absolutely nothing to help the causes she cares so much about, and only hurts them even more. And considering that most of Chappell's fanbase is apart of the LGBTQ+ community, it's a little disheartening to see her refuse to endorse the candidate who will protect a large number of her fanbase over the candidate who wishes people like her never existed.","title":"Chappell Roan explains why she hasnt endorsed Kamala Harris.

There were other professions that  were barred as well.The US should not have the identical standards as the Roman Republic, but there should be some additional national limitations on being to get on the ballot for Senate, the House, and the Presidency, besides the age and citizenship requirements that are all there is right now.A person should be barred from appearing on the ballot for Senate, House, or President/VP if they have - A conviction for murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, or fraud, civil or criminal, or being an officer in a company that has such a conviction.\\n - Any person who owns a stake or stock in a hotel, resort, casino, bar, or restaurant must divest completely before their name can appear on a ballot for national office.\\n - Every person who appears on a ballot for national office must release at least 10 years of tax returns, if they have that many. Applying to appear on the ballot automatically makes their tax returns public documents, which anyone can get from the IRS, for a small per-page fee.\\n - While having a security clearance should not be a requirement to run for the Senate, House, or Pres/VP, the National Security system should have some way to weigh in on the issue. I don't know, but perhaps a warning label, like \\"This candidate's first wife was a known Soviet agent, and his present wife is suspected of similar ties. During the campaign he has hired known foreign agents to assist him, and he has ignored warnings from the FBI as to their security risks.\\" In the most extreme cases, such as if there is an indictment for national security violations being prosecuted at the time, or a conviction, such a person should be able to be barred from the ballot by the FBI.Note that such persons are not barred completely from holding office.

Disengagement, not even educating yourself on matters you care about.

This election will be decided by motivating their respective voters, rather than winning new voters.A bigger risk for Harris' campaign is that in the event of a second debate Trump actually prepares and treats it seriously.

Deposing Noriega was good. Stopping ISIS and al Qaeda in various countries was good. I would also argue that ending Saddam's regime was good, since it was responsible for the genocide of 250,000 people.In fact, what's most remarkable about this list is looking at the *red* column, and assessing what happened in the countries where intervention failed. Genocide in Cambodia was bad, leaving Lebanon to Syria was bad, letting Cuba oppress its own people was bad, Somalia is still a mess of pirates and genocide, Yemen is regularly attacking civilian ships, Iraq is being slowly taken over by Iranian proxies, Boko Haram and ISIS are running the show in Niger, and Afghanistan is still being hit with terrorist attacks but now has no rights for its women.The only places better off after we lost are Vietnam (who now like us more than any other Asian country) and Laos.","title":"What does r/neoliberal really think about the Iraq War?"},{"text":"It's not an agenda being pushed, it's intelligent people observing how horrifying reality is.","title":"Trump and media"},{"text":"Rob has made lots of conservative statements over the years so this isnt surprising.","title":"Rob Schneider calls Kamala Harris a 'Marxist,' urges Americans to protect free speech"},{"text":"Of Trump owning and working the register of his private business for bowling!","title":"Trump branded 'unfit' as 700 security officials back Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Or it's a win-win situation?

Recently the right parties came more to power resulting again in centre-right ruling parties working together with a bit more right leaning parties, this is not because they have better economic plans but drive on anti-immigration promises which they will never actually fulfill because of the reasons above and EU wide laws and plans to have a continental regulation and better dispersion.","title":"Why doesn't anybody on the left see the simple solution?"},{"text":"Plus maybe when a whole political party dumps on your chosen field like the Arts I sure wouldnt want to be a member.

These are 1. Alleged connections between the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, 2. The purchase of yellow cake uranium from Africa by Saddam, and 3. The purchase of aluminum tubes which could be used for the production of WMD's.These pieces of evidence have been pointed to as examples of how the Bush administration 'lied' to the American public in justifying the Iraq war. The reason I say 'lied' is because it's a bit of a stretch to say the Bush administration outright lied regarding this evidence, when the more accurate picture was that they were uncompelling pieces of evidence without substantial backing which should not have been brought forth. They weren't outright false, but they didn't have the necessary credibility to be used as justification for the invasion of Iraq.Now, here's the extra little bit of complication: we would have gone to war even if we never had the three uncredible pieces of evidence I mentioned prior. Everything surrounding direct evidence of Iraqi WMD's pre-1998 when UN inspectors were kicked out of the country, Saddam's bluffing that he had WMD's to posture against the Iranians, the post-9/11 security environment in which the US IC was urged to 'imagine the next threat before it happened', and international consensus surrounding the need to get inspectors back into the country ultimately led to our invasion of Iraq. Those other little pieces of evidence were more so political props the Bush administration could use as a vivid picture of the WMD threat they believe Iraq posed. You could argue they were willfully dishonest in bringing those pieces of evidence to the public, and thus, they lied, but I think a more fair interpretation of events considering everything else that ultimately led to the Iraq War, along with statements made by Bush admin officials, was that they were willing to push aside concerns about the evidence's credibility themselves because they figured it was better to be 'safe than sorry' regarding this issue. I mean, look at the counterfactual, right. Say it was true that Saddam bought uranium from Africa despite the dodginess of the evidence, and detonated a dirty bomb in Chicago. All the while you had reason to believe that we was purchasing materials for WMD's. It would have been an unmitigated disaster. And so you had administration and IC officials willing to believe things which weren't up to par because they just wanted to do whatever they could to prevent the next security threat. I really, truly hate the discourse surrounding the Iraq war (at least the justification of it, and how we actually ended up in Iraq). It keeps being painted as a moral failure of the Bush administration, when the reality is it was much more a strategic and intelligence failure than anything. There's a fantastic book on the subject by Frank P. Harvey which goes into the topic way more than I ever could, if you're interested.","title":"What does r/neoliberal really think about the Iraq War?"},{"text":"30 years later, Clarence Thomas is finally undone by a black woman.","title":"NBC News Flags Historic Gains By Kamala Harris In New Poll: A 'Reshaped' Race"},{"text":"Even if I didn't agree politically with him, he's a good man.","title":"Rob Schneider calls Kamala Harris a 'Marxist,' urges Americans to protect free speech"},{"text":"No they don't, the first amendment applies to everyone whether you agree with their opinion or not, saying that they should go to jail is an incredibly trump-like statement","title":"Young Dems more likely to despise the Republican party?"},{"text":"Even if I didn't agree politically with him, he's a good man","title":"Rob Schneider calls Kamala Harris a 'Marxist,' urges Americans to protect free speech"},{"text":"Someone told me that Ted Cruz pisses his pants because he likes the warm wet feeling down his legs","title":"Ted Cruz, Colin Allred virtually tied in race for U.S. Senate, according to new poll"},{"text":"No they don't the first amendment applies to everyone not just the people you like","title":"Young Dems more likely to despise the Republican party?"},{"text":"It's tough because he has also violently hated women since he was just a child.

They are different things. Capitalism is a system where the profits from an enterprise go to the people who put up the capital to fund it. That has nothing to do with the status of the market. The ideal situation for a capitalist is to control a monopoly, which gives them profits unaffected by competition and which will be much higher than in a competitive market. The concentration of power in a small number of companies gives them tremendous power over the market, and they can and did use that power to raise prices well above costs. The extra profits went to the owners of the company, so that's in line with capitalism.Capitalism covers all kinds of markets, not just free markets. There are certain necessary conditions for a market to be free, among them are free information about prices, and enough buyers and sellers to provide for liquidity and competition. The current world economy has been becoming less free as market power concentrates into fewer hands. Your analysis assumes free market dynamics, which don't apply to a market where a handful of companies control most of the market.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"Thats what they did in Rocky 2","title":"Democrats to dub Trump a 'chicken' to pressure him to debate Harris"},{"text":"And when I vote in November I will be trying to stop her FIL from getting a job.

Their lawyer told them that if they didn't file those electoral votes, even if Trump won his cases later, he would be unable to be declared president because no votes had been cast for him in Georgia.

Not sure why this post is getting down-voted.  \\nSince Trump took office and became the most known quantity on the planet, his party hasnt prevailed in even one national election. And although the weird 2020 election is remembered as being impossibly close, largely because of the way the results were reported, it really wasnt. Biden beat Trump by 7 million votes and 74 votes in the electoral college. Sure, the slight margin in several states meant that the election could have broken either way, and that will be true this time, too. But its possible  likely, really  that weve already seen Trumps ceiling of support and that theres really nothing he can do to build on it.And Harris has an advantage Biden didnt: the tectonic shift on reproductive rights. (Id use the more limited term [abortion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/abortion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24), but Republicans, in a stroke of genius, somehow decided to broaden their crusade to include access to fertility treatments to repel millions more families who actually *want* to have children.)Republican have lost every ballot measure on abortion  seven in all  since the Supreme Court struck down *Roe v. Wade* in 2022. Harris is already running close to where Hillary Clinton and Biden did among women overall, more than 10 points ahead of Trump in some polls, and lately she seems to be gaining [specifically among White women](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/02/gender-gap-voters-harris-trump-2024-election) (while also losing more White men). If theres one issue thats likely to galvanize new voters and tip close states, this is it.So, no, maybe vibes by themselves dont win elections, and maybe Harris isnt some wildly underestimated political talent. Maybe shes less like Obama than she is like Clinton, with a more affable public persona and without all the scandal and entitlement.This time, that might just be enough.","title":"The Democratic freakout has begun.

I don't want to take up too much time so I want to keep it brief.You are right. I don't think the present situation is very good, especially within practices of companies. On a broader scale it looks ever direr, with threats to our planet building. However, I see a way out within capitalism.The Earth has limited resources. That is true. But I think you've missed a key point.When I mine silicon, I can make a wafer. That wafer is maybe worth $10. Then, I can send that wafer to get doped. It gets processed and becomes treated. The value of all the materials used in that treatment may be worth $10. But now the plank is worth $50. Take the same wafer and run it through a lithography machine. It is now worth $250. Take that wafer and break it up into 100 chips and the total worth may be $1000. Put the chip into a phone and sell those, and the chips are contributing to a $100,000 worth of value.We can increase the value of something by consuming proportionally less resources. That is how we have progressed. It used to take an absurd amount of resources to raise a large stone 10 meters. It would take a farm worth of crops and a hundred slaves. Now we can do it entirely on the sun using highly efficient linear motors. When companies increase value, they can do it by making things more efficient. Think about it, which costs more, a nuclear submarine or a gas one? One requires less resources in total, but requires more processing and careful engineering to make. But it has thus seen an increase in value. A company that switches from making gas turbines to nuclear ones will decrease lifetime resource use while getting wealthier through it.This is how companies can increase their profits forever without increasing resource exploitation. The amount of harm you would need to cause to get a million dollars through mining ore is much more than the harm caused by refining much less ore into a supercomputer.So, it is possible. I think we can figure it out, don't lose hope.

And to be fair, up until somewhat recently I didn't really disagree. That's how badly it fucked our foreign policy, for decades and decades.It basically convinced everyone under 45 or so that America cannot really do good in the world, and that even if we tried again it would probably crash and burn, cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars that probably coulda put us all through college/bought a lotta healthcare, but instead was wasted on munitions to hunt down cave-dwelling peasants.And then there's the torture stuff. I think of all the aspects of it that really broke my belief in American exceptionalism was that. We knew it was wrong. We knew it wouldn't work. It was illegal and unconstitutional always and no stupid memos changed that, despite what the fucking administration lawyer who name's not worth remembering thinks.We TO THIS DAY still can't get these 9/11 fuckers put in prison properly because the CIA tortured them so fucking much that no court will convict them now.

I think that people are individually irrational. On average however, I think people are rational at a macroscopic level.I don't see why they would be, to be honest. Advertisements are primarily resisted by those who would already not interface with your product, your core target group can very much be manipulated through it.I mean, think about it: if it didn't work, why do companies do it? It clearly generates a net positive effect on revenue.In terms of essential products, I disagree.(Un-)fortunately, what you and I think is or isn't an \\"essential product\\" doesn't matter. That is what I mean with it being an individual decision: the weight people put on different things is very subjective. There are definitely people who save more on food (which you would generally consider \\"essential\\") in favour of other things.For instance, I can play video games instead of Netflix.I mean... *you* can, but do you want to? There's plenty of people who *don't* consider that an option. The choice for them is between Netflix and other streaming services - and if something they really want is only on one of them, their choice gets irrationally impacted yet again.Sure, a few people will not be able to, but on a societal level, this holds true.So... what do your replace make-up with? You can pick between make-up brands, but there isn't really something that fullfills the same role but is a different market.In terms of your point about hard times increasing prices, companies don't raise prices for no reason.I mean, of course - but they can surely increase it without **good** reason. They raise prices because they foresee demand falling and adjust pricing to match that. If nothing bad happens, they will decrease their prices, because they make more money at the lower price point and with increased demand than with higher prices and lower demand.That is a very *basic* way to look at it. There is no reason to lower prices arbitrarily - if you sit at the perfect cost/demand point for your product and all costs increase, you have nothing but benefits from it.Additionally, what you say, again, works in a vacuum. In the real world, every company knows that it is better for all companies if the prices stay high - or are only marginally lowered again. There is absolutely no reason to return to your initial price, because you will at best provoke a return to the situation before the price increase, which was a lower price.It's like balancing a scale. Not really, no... when **everything** (in your segment of the market) becomes more expensive, there is no change significant in demand for essential goods, at least not in the short term, while people can still make do in some way. You reach a tipping point, of course, when people can no longer consistently afford your goods, but that is generally when the government steps in. Also, don't hard times cause a fall in prices generally?Not if the market has anything to say about it, usually. At the very least, that is coupled with a devaluation of the currency, so the \\"effective loss\\" is less or nil. Generally though, prices only go up unless the government intervenes - in most cases, they do not, ever, have a reason to be lowered. All of the cost/demand calculations are done before a product is released, usually.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"My dad's not a mumbling conspiracy laden narcissist and is perfect at everything he does, so when he ate dogshit on the debate stage, that could only mean Harris cheated because she did t eat dogshit live on TV!Go figure someone 20 years younger than your senile rapist criminal shitheel Dad can string a coherent sentence together when it fuckin matters.

Corporations are now the norm and they dominate or lie economic system and do lots of very real has as a result. ?So to argue this is all natural and how its always been is incorrect. ?Factually and historically.Meanwhile, Google illusion of choice and see what image comes up. ?We now live in a reality where consumers have no real choice anymore. ?Greed as eliminated most competition while preserving the illusion of choice. ?Roughly 10 companies own basically every/any product you want to buy. ?You may go to the grocery store and see 100 different brands but they are all owned by basically two or three companies. ?You mentioned McDonalds. ?McDonalds makes most of their profits these days off real estate. ?Franchising. ?And most franchises arent profitable and McDonalds is able to hide much of that information. ?Or, if a franchise is profitable, they are legally allowed to open another store they franchise to someone else a block away from you, draining your business. ?And they keep getting new people because its McDonalds and everyone always goes to McDonalds. ?Its a massive company!Then you have companies like Amazon that absolutely harm competition and engage in all kinds of arguable illegal, but definitely sketchy practices, and have never made money ever, yet somehow are worth billions of dollars but never pay taxes? ??None of this is normal or how its always been . ?Thats the myth youve bought into. ?It certainly isnt good for anyone but the wealthy (who own 80% of all investments btw). ?Where I disagree is that just because they can, doesnt mean its good or they should. ?Especially when the can part is only possible because they have warped economics AND discourse about economics, to their favor. ?So being competitive no longer means the best product/service for the best priceit means making as much money as humanly possible in as short a period of time as possible. ?Thats not normal or natural but something new weve created and just allowed because we put profits before people. ?Which comes back to the whole eroding democracy point earlier.I think your views, while common, are based on ignorance and an oversimplified to the point of corrupted perspective of what economics is, means and how it works in reality. ?If it truly is a push and pull, then consumers have been losing this tug of war for decades. ?And weve been doing so because rich businesses have been able to buy political ears and have the laws written in their favor. ?Again, something relatively new, and not normal or just normal economic theory. ?Its corruption by definition. ?Its anti-democracy.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"What's all the confusion about?Death Panels are the ultimate choice for perimeter security!","title":"JD Vance just gave Kamala Harris another huge opportunity"},{"text":"It's good we removed Saddam, the half hearted attempts at nation building not so much","title":"What does r/neoliberal really think about the Iraq War?"},{"text":"Hindsight 20-20.Many people believe that liberal state-building is possible, and cite post-war Germany and post-war Japan as examples.

We meet in markets to get the most for what we have made and to spend as less as possible for what we want. That is greed. If a company wants to maximize its profits, it will price in such a way that their consumers' greed for lower prices is satisfied while its own greed for higher revenue is satisfied. In all cases, pushing for higher prices doesn't matter. There is a price where if a company prices it lower, demand does not increase enough to offset the decrease. Likewise, if it sets it higher, then demand will drop off faster than the price increase. Thus, there is a \\"natural price\\". And if a company wants to maximize revenue, it will balance it so that the price is right. Through the pull and push of the two parties wanting different things, an equilibrium is established. Nothing can change that, which is why I say greed is irrelevant.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"Lol.

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\\"- 1914 translation by H.

In their view, economic status, though naturally hierarchical, is itself not natural. The hierarchy can be traversed through work (hard work moving you up the ladder and being lazy moving down). And so programs to adjust the hierarchy (make poor people less poor) are not seen as legislating against the natural order of things. The racial hierarchy, though, is natural and so segregation laws are not seen as unnaturally propping up whites, but corralling the true nature of racial categories. In that sense, conservatives can live with removing segregation laws because they believe the natural racial hierarchy will sort itself out. But they cant live with social programs to help non-whites because that is upsetting the natural order of things. This is the grievance that Trump tapped into. Obama broke conservatives brains because his election mean that the Democrats crusade in upsetting the natural racial hierarchy through policies helping non-whites was successful. A majority of Americans were okay with electing a black man to the highest office in the land. Twice. And I dont think the grievance was so much just electing Obama, but that people liked him and he was largely seen as a very good president. Thats why he received attacks for the stupidest little things (I will never forget the tan suit). Conservatives needed him to fail to prove that the Democrats post-segregation efforts were ultimately futile. I think this is where you get Obama-Trump voters. Bush (and the associated neocon policies) were seen as failures, so I think there was a contingent of voters that said fine, well elect your black guy just to watch him fail to prove that its not just conservatives that are failures. People knew what kind of economy they were handing Obama. But when he didnt fail, they had to vote for Trump for retribution. The idea is not just that we need to elect a white guy, but one of the worst potential ones as punishment. As a white guy, Trump would be fine and help them, but he would punish non-whites and whites that support them.Trump being a failure himself is what sealed the deal for the cult and is why the GOP will never take one of the endless off-ramps from Trump. If Trump is a failure, it means the racial hierarchies and economic hierarchies are myths and the reality is that they are being exploited by the very rich they have supported and given power. It means theyre bad people for shitting on non-whites and suckers for voting for their own exploitation. Thats a pretty brutal one-two punch to the self-image and the fortunate thing is that they dont have to make it thanks to the billion dollar conservative propaganda machine. Its a testament to its effectiveness, but also the effort required, that it can keep a demented old convicted felon rapist traitor polling as well as he is.","title":"Is Trumpism a Supply or Demand Problem?

In other words, it's on the same spectrum as incel and redpill ideas, and those come directly from stereotypes about women that are perpetuated by conservative sexism. Here's the throughline: women must be cherished and protected and provided for, and stay in the home where fathers and/or husbands provide for them. If they *don't* do that and decide to be independent, not get married, get a job etc, they're disrespecting their families. If they have recreational/premarital sex, they're sluts who are going to hell. And that's the key: women are only respected and protected in conservative thought as long as they obey their mandate. Stepping outside the bounds of their assigned role means that they're sullied and impure. And *those* women are free game for abuse and ostracization. The fact that most modern women are part of that category is exactly what gives rise to the redpill movement, and Tate derives directly from those toxic ideas. So in a way, you're right that Tate represents an inversion of classical conservative patriarchy. The only problem is the reversal in question is that most women don't behave \\"correctly\\" anymore, according to that conservative patriarchy. Therefore they're no longer worthy of its protection, and Tate is perfectly allowed to do what he does.","title":"CMV: Andrew Tate is Overrated in the Conservative Community"},{"text":"Thats the thing though.

More than 70 percent of the projects include transit-oriented development (TOD) and downtown redevelopment initiatives, including projects that support the Biden-Harris Administrations efforts to boost housing supply and lower costs.  \\n...  \\nThe program makes $100 million available over five years to help public entities scan existing assets to unlock value from them and explore innovative financing and delivery opportunities through, e.g., the Build America Bureaus Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) low-cost loan program.  Awards can be up to $2 million, with no match required for the first million dollars.  \\n...  \\nThe technical assistance grant recipients will use the funding to enhance their organizational capacity and advance a portfolio of assets by conducting pre-construction tasks, such as asset scans, market studies, delivery option analyses, financial modeling, and other activities considering innovative finance and delivery, including asset concessions. The expert services grant recipients will use the funding to hire advisors to analyze a specific existing asset for innovative financing and delivery opportunities, including public-private partnerships. Todays [September 17th] IFACGP awards are the latest action by the Biden-Harris Administration to explore innovative finance and delivery options for public entities, create more housing to lower costs for Americans, and support communities with technical assistance. In addition to todays announcement: * Last month, DOTs Build America Bureau released new guidance to help potential borrowers access TOD financing, including FAQs and recorded webinars. \\n* Earlier this year, DOT announced funding for 112 under-resourced communities to receive hands-on assistance to secure federal infrastructure funding and then deliver on those projects. \\n* Last fall, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to support the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings to residential use through new financing and technical assistance. The new IFACGP program joins the Rural and Tribal Assistance Pilot Program, Regional Infrastructure Accelerators Program, Thriving Communities Program, and other technical assistance opportunities at DOT that seek to ensure communities have the tools they need to access federal funding and financing for transformative infrastructure projects.  \\n...An example list of recipients and projects is included in the press release, an interactive map with full list and additional details is included preceding that example list.

The grants were announcing today will allow communities to partner with the private sector, develop and deliver transit-oriented projects on public assets, and get more housing and other public benefits and services completed more quickly.Statement from Acting Undersecretary of Transportation for Policy Christopher Coes:Todays announcement is what the Investing in America Agenda is all about, said Acting Undersecretary of Transportation for Policy Christopher Coes. Not only will this funding lead to greater access, opportunity, and economic growth through good transportation infrastructure, but it will catalyze the development of safe, affordable housing in communities across the country.\\"Statement from Build America Bureau Executive Director Morteza Farajian:This is a transformative program that is focused on unlocking value from underutilized assets, said Build America Bureau Executive Director Morteza Farajian.

That is very similar.I am aware that humans are not rational individually, but I think societies are rational on average macroscopically. There are certainly markets where the future is unpredictable or something immaterial contributes to wonky pricing. I'm kind of focusing on the more small scale purchases from the department store and so on.But I feel like transactions nowadays have less friction than they have ever had before. There are apps on my phone where I can look at the prices of fast food before I order them, Amazon to compare the prices of millions of different items, and many other innovations. Furthermore, I want to restrict my argument to non-essentials, so things which have no substitute or one cannot go without, like gas, are a bit out of scope for my argument.I am not arguing that it is easy to compete, it is not. But markets are self correcting in the sense that, should prices get out of control, it becomes easier and easier for newer entrants to succeed as they have more and more margin to work within. Actually, another commenter provided an example where they said that McDonalds and other fast food chains have started seeing profits drop. I think this shows that the markets are working as intended: the companies priced a product higher than what the consumers were willing to pay and thus saw total revenue drop. Now they will reduce prices in order to increase total revenue","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"Voters had 4 years of the idea of another Biden run combined with massive amounts of right-wing misinformation everywhere, including huge amounts on social media.

They no longer operate *within* a market, but *become* the market? And once you are the market, you can control what can be sold, at what price, etc.Corporations are not competing within the market anymore, in many cases, but are becoming the market. You're here, arguing about capitalism, while they're moving on from competing with capital to competing for rents, squeezing you from both ends, paying you as little as possible while also charging you as much as possible.

Essential products are classes of good that there is no replacement for without risk to health or safety. These are traditionally food, water, shelter, and healthcare. None of these can be replaced with another market. In comparison, Netflix and makeup can be replaced by different markets. For instance, I can play video games instead of Netflix. Sure, a few people will not be able to, but on a societal level, this holds true. In terms of your point about hard times increasing prices, companies don't raise prices for no reason. They raise prices because they foresee demand falling and adjust pricing to match that. If nothing bad happens, they will decrease their prices, because they make more money at the lower price point and with increased demand than with higher prices and lower demand.

You can have non-essential markets that you can completely disengage from. For instance, I can decide not to watch movies anymore and instead go to a concert. But I cannot disengage myself from the food market.

If I, as the seller, decide I want to not give up my product for a lower price, less people will buy my product and I will make less money. Thus my greed has failed.This recognizes that pricing products high (relative to the market) is an act of greed. The substantial flaw here is that you're assuming a perfectly efficient market (meaning every transaction takes place in perfect equilibrium with the market). No economist believes the market is perfectly efficient for every transaction. A simple example is a gas station. You could set your price at $20 a gallon in the morning and most people driving by will skip it because they have a 1/4 tank left and will pass another station before they have to buy gas. You'll have a handful of people who will be rolling in on empty expecting a reasonably fair rate and are shocked to find out you're charging $20 a gallon. Some of them will buy the gas because they effectively have no choice. In those individual transactions, the customer has been impacted by your greed even though, in aggregate, the station has made less money.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"Who has he debated 3 times already?","title":"Dems plan to troll Trump with billboards calling him a chicken for refusing to debate Harris again"},{"text":"exactly? i love it","title":"Reddit is a liberal cesspool"},{"text":"Was I supposed to upvote this?

The man being the master of the house and the provider sounds great in theory, the wife can stay home and rear the kids and support the husband. In reality, that means women are trapped in their marriage, because how exactly are they going to survive if they divorce, without an education of job experience? So if the man is abusive, well, that's all part of being a dutiful wife. Let's not act like a woman outing her husband as abusive goes particularly well for her in conservative communities.Traditional patriarchy treats women as subservient, second-class citizens who have no business participating in public life or having any meaningful freedoms. It's cloaked in a lot of language talking about purity and providing and so on, but the bottom line is that until pretty recently, women couldn't vote, couldn't own a bank account without a man's approval, and were not considered to be raped if their husbands did it to them. No, seriously, marital rape was legal in every state until 1976, and it wasn't until fucking 1993 that it became illegal in every state. Look it up.So to say that Tate with his virulent sexism is completely separate from conservative value is, to me, a significant rewriting of history. The conservative/religious mindset towards women has always been that they were two steps above property, better seen and not heard, and need to *know their place*. Husbands happily profit from their wife's labor in the home, but offer no long-term security in exchange. Women are \\"revered\\" but not believed if they say their husbands hurt them, and when they are most of the time they're told it's their fault. Going from there to someone like Tate dispensing with the pretense altogether is not as big a leap as you think.","title":"CMV: Andrew Tate is Overrated in the Conservative Community"},{"text":"It's almost like he says whatever thing he thinks will help him, with no consistency from one moment to the next.","title":"Dems plan to troll Trump with billboards calling him a chicken for refusing to debate Harris again"},{"text":"Truth should not be a complete defense in journalism.

The reason I bring up essentialness of products is because a consumer has a choice. They have a choice whether to buy a product at its current price or not. Food, water, and shelter are things that have no alternative. I need a house, I need water, and I need food. I can't take something as a substitute for those. This is what is defined as essential. Same goes for healthcare. Things which have no substitute or can't be gone without without dying or injury are essential. You have alternatives to concerts. There are alternative entertainment industries, and other ways to listen to music if you are looking for experiences related to that. And through those choices, you can decide to not buy a ticket. And these companies, if they want your business so that they can maximize their revenue, must take the price where enough people like you will want to pay, while keeping it at a price they are satisfied with. It essentially follows an upside down parabola. Dropping the price absolutely can make them more money if more people decide to buy products because of it. But in any case, I don't want to fixate on a particular industry. Market failures and monopolies can happen, and that is why we have agencies that break those up. Admittedly, you may be right that monopolistic behaviors have broken the balanced exchange between consumer and producer. But my argument is more macroscopic than one particular industry.

Greed, as I am using it, is a technical term. When we conduct an exchange, we settle on a price which fulfills both of our desires. If I, as the seller, decide I want to not give up my product for a lower price, less people will buy my product and I will make less money. Thus my greed has failed. If I do not want to lose money, I will give my nonessential product to the buyers at a level that maximizes the amount of buyers who buy what I sell and the price they buy it at. Thus, I cannot make up any price. I must take the price set by the market in order to maximize my revenue.

But in all these cases, the macroscopic view is that companies always take the price that enough people are willing to pay. If Lamborghini reducedd the price of a Huracan, they would make less money, because people would not see it as rare. If it increased the price, then they would price it out of its target market and the company would make less money. Even if some see it as too much, they only need enough people to think it is not overpriced to make more money than if they priced it cheaper.

We have long lists of irrational behavior in humans and entire fields of study have sprung up to try to explain why humans make choices that are sub-optimal. The very existence of advertising as a major industry should provide all the proof we need that humans are irrational.  \\n-Transactions have friction.

The thing that I cant shake is, as you say, not only are there some really major enthusiasm indicators that suggest Dems are more energized than we have been since the Obama era.but these indicators appeared naturally, almost overnight, all of two months ago.Polling models for the last decade have proven to struggle with accounting for how turnout and enthusiasm shapes a race, and have proven to be slow to be corrected properly for sudden changes in a race. Out of absolutely nowhere, the 2020 rematch that we all saw coming and planned for imploded and an entirely new race took its place.  I really, really am struggling to see how pollsters adjusted their methodologies and models for this in such a short period of time.  This is something that hasnt happened in modern political history, and its very easy to imagine how these polls are suddenly woefully overcorrecting for Trump and missing important voting blocs that were non-factors or net negatives for Biden. Of course, theres also the very real possibility of Trump over performing polls himself as he has in the past, though frankly I think in 2020 the root of the problem was underestimating his incumbency advantage in the middle of a crisis.  He had zero business losing that year and would have won in a blow out if he just let Fauci do his work.  And certainly Trump is not the political blank canvas and outsider he was in 2016.I think turnout and polling accuracy is a big question that will have to be answered on Election Night, and I dont think well know the true shape of this race until tallies start coming in.

Sensationalism often beats accuracy, leaving us with polls that are mostly noise.**Missing the Intensity**  \\nIssue polls, like those after the 2022 Supreme Court abortion ruling, missed the mark. They underestimated how much that ruling would drive turnout, especially among women. Emotional, charged issues can mobilize voters in ways regular polls dont capture. This leads to the next problem: **Unpredictability**.**Politics Are Wildly Unpredictable**  \\nRandom eventslike the FBI reopening the Clinton email investigation in 2016can change everything at the last minute. Plus, voter behavior is more volatileObamas new voters in 2008 and Trumps surprise support in 2016 caught pollsters off guard. With supercharged issues like abortion rights, Im guessing women will show up in greater numbers this time and give us another shock.**The Bradley Effect**  \\nThis phenomenon happens when voters mislead pollsters, often due to social desirability bias, particularly in sensitive elections. In 1982, Tom Bradley, an African American candidate, was predicted to win Californias governor race but lost. The blame went to white voters who claimed they supported him but voted otherwise. It's worth reconsidering this effect in a highly partisan election where appearances (again, intensity + unpredictability) matter.So undercounting? Maybe. But there are far bigger issues with political polling that will make this election a nail-biter. Personally, I think it'll go to Harris. The surprise will be to what degree and how her candidacy affects down-ticket candidates.","title":"Democrats fear pollsters are undercounting Trump"},{"text":"Disrespectful and shameful!

There are many points at which this idea simply doesn't work.Take advertising. For a \\"homo economicus\\", advertising only fullfills the role of informing them of the potential product and price. I think it's a given that real advertisements do more than that: they attempt to *influence* people into buying the product, i.e. making a decision that is not *strictly rational*. Additionally, the question of what *is* and *isn't* an \\"essential product\\" is an individual decision in this context. If someone, for example,  believes they *need* a media subscription like Netflix, then this becomes an essential product to them. Now, how do you believe people decide what is and isn't something they *need*? Aside from the basics, a lot of that is due to outside influence - advertisement (including desinformation like \\"you NEED these vitamin supplements!\\"), peer pressure (e.g. make-up for many women), addiction or any other number of things.Point is: humans aren't rational beings and can be influenced by a number of things. Advertising creates demand, which allows an increase in prices. Similarly, what you say is only true in circumstances where there is a truly \\"free\\" market in the first place. There are many events in which \\"the market\\" acts almost as one, even without any intent. If hard times are expected to be ahead, **everyone** will likely increase their prices, which means a net increase without an increase in demand or even costs. Of course, it would seem that if this fear turns out to be wrong, companies could lower their prices again, but... why would they? They know that increasing the base level of the price is beneficial to pretty much everyone, so noone needs to lower their prices - and if someone does, an ad campaign is run to make people less aware of it and thus cushion any benefit that is gained.The \\"Free Market\\" in the way that economical models predict it doesn't exist, because humans are not nearly as rational as such a model requires. And I believe that is the core problem with your view.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"ALL IN FOR DEM BOYZSigned,A Giants Fan","title":"Ted Cruz, Colin Allred virtually tied in race for U.S. Senate, according to new poll"},{"text":"That fundamentally isn't greed, if people bought it.

You are clearly showing your lack of research and understanding about the realities of capitalism by making statement such as \\"monopolies can't exist because then people wouldn't buy their stuff.\\" All it takes to prove this is false is looking at the situation with Ticketmaster/LiveNation. Two already massive entities merged into a single vertically integrated monopoly with a stranglehold on almost every single viable live venue and ticket purchasing avenue in the US. It is functionally impossible to avoid using them to see live music and for artists to avoid playing their venues because of this merger and you are trying argue that it just doesn't exist because if it did, people wouldn't pay for it? It's backwards. It exists specifically because people continue to pay for it because the idea of life without live music  is miserable and there's quite literally nothing individuals can do about it. Also, there's nothing so simply black and white about this as you make it seem - it's not \\"buy it or don't\\", for poor people it's often \\"buy it or starve\\" or find some way to scrounge the money for things they can no longer afford.Capitalism and corporations don't give one solitary shit about affordability, or quality of life, or poor people.

But from what I understand, there is no way this is true. Pricing according to classical economics is a constant tug of war between the wishes of consumers who want a price as low as possible and suppliers who want a price as high as possible. Through the market, prices are set at the point where there is a middle ground. It results in the most profit for the suppliers, and a price that consumers are satisfied by. If the price was higher, less people would buy the product and it would make less money. If the price was lower, the extra people who bought it would not be enough to make up for the money lost through the cheaper price.In many markets there are only a few major players, leading to \\"oligopoly\\" behavior. In such markets, companies have an incentive to avoid price wars, because they would reduce profitability for everyone. Instead of lowering prices to undercut a competitor, those firms will tacitly agree (without explicit collusion) to keep prices high. Also, in markets with higher barriers to entry, there is often a dominant company that acts as a price leader. When they raise their prices, others just follow suit because they assume the market will accept the increase.There are probably more factors, like brand loyalty, and markets with bad pricing transparency.","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"Agree, hes a fascist and an existential threat to the United States of America.","title":"Calling Trump a Fascist Threat to Democracy is Not Inciting ViolenceIt's the Truth.

Thus if all inflation was merely cost-driven, then prices going up would mean corporate profits go down since they're moving a lower volume of items but still making the same margin.The fact that prices went up and McDonalds still posted record profits suggests that the inflation in their prices was not due to costs going up significantly, but rather due to costs staying low and profit margins going up significantly. This is what people refer to as corporate greed, or \\"greedflation\\" - inflation driven by corporate profit margins rather than necessity or costs going up.---As far as I can tell, your argument is that \\"if people are happy to pay that price and McDonalds is still profitable, then corporate greed doesn't exist\\". I feel the issue at hand is that you agree with every point in my argument, you just have slightly redefined corporate greed such that it is impossible for a corporation to be greedy unless they are outright failing. I can't think of a single corporation which could possibly be greedy under your definition except possibly a corporation that is in the red and going bankrupt.If I am a bank and I am foreclosing on a couple with a young child who missed their mortgage payment by 1 day off the final deadline, I am not greedy, I am simply serving the market. If I am an insurance company and I deny life-saving treatment to Grandma Jones so my executives can party in the Bahamas on company dime, I am not being greedy, I am merely competing in the market and you are welcome to find Grandma Jones some other insurance company if you don't like it,I question your definition, I feel you could use it to justify virtually any heinous activity as long as both sides make a transaction - selling your kidneys to feed your children isn't exploitation, it's just free market working as intended!","title":"CMV: Corporate greed in terms of pricing of nonessential products is fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and doesn't exist"},{"text":"According to this, it isn't unusual at all.https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/info/presse/mitteilungen/bundestagswahl-2021/53_21_briefwahlbeteiligung.html","title":"Warnock: Georgia hand-counted ballot rule is effort to turn the democracy on its head"},{"text":"I don't think this is accurate, because people are treating this like some sort of new thing.

The classic economics models of supply and demand work well for things that you don't HAVE to buy, because if it is too expensive, you just won't buy it. But for things like food and housing, that demand is inelastic, you need a place to live, and you need at least some form of food. They key point to prove that there is/was price gouging going on is that there are huge marketing efforts being made to promote lower prices now that people are struggling.

We all feel the importance of these pages being uncut. Theyre untorn. Mmkay, So what that means is that they are not actually torn, its a very important distinction made by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the significance cannot be overlooked. What it means is that the books of the pages are uncut, and specifically I want to make it widely known that Donald Trump supports the wrong side of this issue. He has a plan for this, its called Project 2025. He will sign a national abortion ban, he will raise the price of everything everywhere, and we are not going back.?So therefore we hear you America, we feel you on this issue, and its a really important one, mmkay?

And it isn't necessarily a political divide, because think of the number of Republicans appalled by DeSantis' attempt to destroy natural lands and preserves, the number of Republicans who see the politicization of higher education as a fascist mistake.\\nThe hard part though is that the state Democratic Party has long ignored younger demographics in favor of focusing on the transplant retirees. These days transplants are *mostly* residents and it's taken a massive shift in the party to focus on Floridians. But where they have made the shift, it's worked. The Duval County Dems did it and get a Democratic mayor elected.
