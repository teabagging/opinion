These are both based on adaptive mechanisms and are inherent to humanity, and a lot of what you're describing results from a number of heuristics.Conserving mental energy is necessary to be able to achieve anything. Important messages in the brain are processed more quickly, since evolutionarily \\"older\\" parts of the brain were the ones most necessary for survival. Feelings of fear are processed more quickly and efficiently in the brain than, e.g., feelings of affection. In the modern world, the preference for simple messaging can be leveraged to perpetuate dangerous ideas. Candidates who use simpler language are more likely to be elected; simple messaging is more likely to spread quickly on social media, etc. The same is true of messaging that evokes survival-essential emotions like fear.Similarly important to survival, humans love to group and categorize themselves and others. Grouping/categorizing in general is good for reasoning and systematic understanding of things in the world. People also like to have social groups with which they identify. This helps them feel connected to those in their groups, and makes them likely to engage in collectivist things that don't necessarily directly benefit them. Having an in-group necessitates having an out-group, and adopting simplified understandings of people not in your group is also easier to process.Social media magnifies and broadcasts these tendencies in humans, since they are detached from the real-life people who are implicated by their statements, and users are incentivized to adopt more incendiary/provocative messaging, since that gets more engagement.Basically, there are a couple misunderstandings:* most people do not fully believe the monolith descriptions you provide, but rather say and repeat them because of the engagement they get\\n* the level of mental energy required to understand each person as an individual is not possible with humans' brains as they currently work. \\n   * Seeing a group as a monolith (especially if you are relatively detached from that group or see them as an enemy in some way) is very difficult to avoid\\n   * When under stress, brains typically conserve mental energy for complex things like this even more, and it reduces people's capacities to understand the complexities of others' identities.

Let me use two examples in Point (1) and Point (2) below.(1A) For example, with regards to, \\"Secondly, often when I extend sympathy I am treated with disrespect. I wouldn't get it because I don't have periods, because I'm not black, because I'm not a woman, etc.\\" -- this is a perspective that not all people who make generalizations about others have and is actually one of the fundamental dividing lines between Post-Structuralists and Enlightenment-Style philosophy. The Post-Structuralist argues that because no experience is complete and is fractured, the nature of one's fracture necessarily makes it impossible for someone else to properly render the same conceptual image, making any communication between two people who are substantially different to be lossy -- e.g. the ideas will lose resolution. Even language, in their view is an imperfect transmission tool because words have different meanings to different people based on how people learned those words. Therefore, no complete communication can take place and, therefore, no person who is substantially different from another person can truly relate to the experience of another. (You have identified the end-result of this from people who believe this premise when they say that as an X you cannot understand the suffering of a Y.) The Enlightenment-Style thinker argues that reality is determinable in objective scientific norms and since such an objectivity exists there is a commonality of experience sufficient enough to permit different people to understand each other if a resort is made to explanations that can be universalizable using words and concepts with as-close-to-objective-as-possible meanings. This is the fundamental idea behind long-term communication as a process and scientific literature as a concept. People can transmit ideas through communication however imperfectly and still reach a concordant understanding. (This is the opposite saying that people CAN understand each other if they allow the other to communicate.)(1B) All of this said, my personal intuition is that the extension of sympathy to a Post-Structuralist does not usually get the reply of \\"s an X you cannot understand the suffering of a Y\\" because that reply usually comes from an attempt to discredit, minimalize, or recontextualize the suffering of a Post-Structuralist. A potential conversation may be along the lines of:WOMAN: Dating Apps are so hard, I have to read through 50 messages a day to see if any of them are remotely interested.MAN: At least you get matches, you could go out with any of them; you just need to read the messages.WOMAN: As an man you cannot understand the suffering of a woman in this situation.Notice that while the man in this dialogue may believe he is extending sympathy by implicitly saying, \\"It's hard for all of us and we are suffering also, just differently\\" what the woman in this dialogue is hearing is, \\"I wish I had your condition because my condition is worse\\". This is a minimalization of her experience (because if his is worse, hers must be less bad) and a discrediting of her experience (because she is claiming that reading all of these messages is difficult and he is telling her that this is easy). A way to actually extend sympathy would be to ask open questions -- questions that are not driven to a yes/no answer -- like, \\"Can you tell me what it feels like to read 50 messages a day?\\" \\"What is the particular pain point of this process for you?\\" etc. because these do not discredit, minimalize, or recontextualize her experience but allow her to reinforce and clarify her experience in a way that may make it more relatable and do so without inherent judgment.(2) For example, with regards to, \\"Thirdly, we see people pigeonholed based on their uncontrollable identity.\\" -- this is a perspective that not all people who make generalizations about others have and is actually one of the fundamental dividing lines between several different ideologies where those in the current political center tend to be less inclined to do this than those at either end of spectrum (for vastly different reasons). If we are talking strictly about the Left, then the rationale is that immutable characteristics make a meaningful impact on our lived experiences because of the ways people are treated differently based on those characteristics -- and to some extent this is true. It's also true that our experiences aren't only determined by our immutable characteristics but by other characteristics that are contingent like wealth, personal networks, behavior, education, stylishness, etc. The clearest evidence that even someone on the Left who claims that immutable characteristics hold in an intersectional discriminatory framework actually does not believe in the pure effect of these immutable characteristics is how \\"race traitors\\" or \\"gender traitors\\" sit outside this hierarchy like Candace Owens. She is a Black woman but will be considered, for the most part, outside of the intersectional location where other Black women sit because she is seen as a \\"race traitor\\" and a \\"gender traitor\\". So, if even they don't truly believe the point you claim that they have, is it proper to say that this is how they are truly analyzing the world?","title":"CMV: Society unjustly treats demographics too much like a monolith and leads to negative effects"},{"text":"I am Getting Concerned, I feel like its getting close now.

Without considering anything other than geography and current technology, solar would be the best solution. I would guess, however, that your government is pushing nuclear because Australia has the largest reserves of uranium in the world. Going with Nuclear will create more jobs, and makes them look better by keeping money in Australia, rather than buying millions of Chinese solar panels.I would also argue that in Australias case, Nuclear is a more ethical option. The heavy metals needed to produce solar panels have very questionable ethics in their supply chains. Nuclear lets you guys do everything in-country, which is huge. Also doesn't require innovating on power storage solutions required for a full-solar grid, which is in its infancy as a technology. Despite what you wrote in your post, one of the main advantages of nuclear is that the power supply can be increased or lowered depending on the demand. Solar produces at maximum during the day and not at all at night. Storing the daytime energy surge so that it can be used at night is a huge challenge.","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"What would you suggest Biden do?

I don't see how this makes sense.And solar is the same btw, once you put a panel up it's pretty much making power for free.  I think oil vs nuclear is a reasonable argument but that solar and nuclear should be used in tandem with solar producing as much as it can. This is a terrible idea.Nuclear as you imply is mostly capital costs -- you take a loan for billions of dollars, then pay it off over many years.Now trouble is that solar can be produced cheaper. Which means that if you estimate that pay off your plant in 20 years you need to sell power at $1, while I'm content to sell my solar power at $0.5 while the sun is shining, that means any time there is sun, a rational person would never buy nuclear if there's any solar available.The end result is that half the day I'd make your plant idle, which doubles your payoff time. But a plant is still a big complex thing that ages, so it's actually possible it'll never make money before having to shut down for one reason or another. Even if not, who wants to wait decades to make money with significant risk? They could invest in me instead, I profit faster.A mixed nuclear/solar grid is a terrible thing, because solar kills the business model of nuclear. The only hope for nuclear to profit is that storage won't become cheap and plentiful enough, but few people would bet billions on that over decades we're not going to come up with storage at least somewhat cheaper than nuclear. but it won't reach the output that nuclear can produce.This is true but completely irrelevant.

The anti-incumbency narrative has been broken in Romania where a stranger has won the first round of voting. Hes not from one of the opposition parties. Luckily, the Romanian Constitutional court has declared his win as invalid, and Romanian security services have said that Calin Georgescus TikTok campaign was partially funded by a foreign government. And the security services have also said that TikTok treats him differently than other candidates.?Furthermore, to me, the anti-incumbency theory is a behavioral science theory with applied game theory to it. The way I have broken it down is that voters had three choices. First option, pick the incumbent, which suggests they are happy with the economic response by the incumbent. Second option, pick an opposition party, which suggests they dont approve of the economic response by the incumbent. The third option is a nonstandard and arbitrary candidate. This suggests that voters are confident with a random choice.Now, allow me to draw a scenario in your head. We already know that the economy has dramatically slowed down, and that has caused an economic crisis, so we can say the anti-incumbent theory is propped up by the bad economic recovery post-COVID . So I am proposed 3 options: I perceive option A (the incumbent) will give me $50. But I also believe that option B will give me $100. Finally, option C is a completely random reward and it is unknown to me. Its something new and I dont know how things will work out.?So, the way I see it, the anti-incumbent theory has fallen completely flat. In other words, the anti-incumbent theory suggests buyers remorse. But reality is far detached from that. Its no longer just about economic conditions, its about perceived risks posed by established political parties and something out there is using these sentiments to bring new leaders who favor authoritarianism.?","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"LOL, windows about as dangerous as loaded rifles in Russia.","title":"Biden Sees Moment of Opportunity and Risk on Assads Ouster"},{"text":"If Karl Marx could read that last tweet his mind would explode.?That said, at the same time Bernie Sanders seems to be the most well liked left wing politician among the Working Class.

All forms of energy generation have a base load capacity. I'm not saying renwables don't; I'm saying is much lower than both fossil fuel and nuclear generation (i think it's lower than hydro and geothermal too, but I despise hydro and geothermal is very location dependent, so I haven't looked into their base load capacity too much.)Which, for Australia, is extremely easy to do. There are many countries where your argument works and I would support it, but not in Australia. We are one of the least densely populated countries on the planet and have among the highest, if not the highest, renewable energy potential.Having the space to build it is one thing. The Outback is incredibly empty and perfect for it, I agree. The issue is that, and I may just be very mistaken about this, the overwhelming majority of Australia lives in the five or six major cities. You have to get the power generated from these massive renewable farms, which aren't exactly suitable to be built right outside the suburbs of Melbourne or Canberra, into those population centers. Solar panels and wind turbines also require pretty regular maintenance, so you can't just really build them in the middle of BFE, slap the lines up, and call it a day. You'd have to have a pretty decently-sized workforce located nearby to maintain them (to clarify, I'm not saying nuclear doesn't require  maintenance, but those plants can be built much closer to the population centers since they take up very little land compared to their production.)We also don't have to, and no one is suggesting, that we'd rely exclusively on solar and wind. There are multiple forms of renewable energy we can and should use. Hydro and geothermal are the only other two I'd consider renewable (and maybe tidal, but that is a very weird form of generation that's its own can of worms.) Geothermal is very situational, requiring access to geothermal vents. Hydro power generation may not generate CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, but it's absolutely not environmentally friendly. Hydro dams destroy ecosystems in the area they're built. Yeah I don't think you really understand just how cheap solar is.Those numbers I used were from looking up the cost to build 1MW of production for each. Coal is around $2.3 million per MW and solar is around $1 million, so just a bit under half as much in cost.  It's cost also consistently falls over time, more than most other forms of energy generation. The price of rare earth metals, many of which are required in the production of solar panels, has been going up consistently for a while now, so I'd be weary of relying on that trend. There's also not really a comparison there with nuclear in Australia, since I just found out it's apparently banned by law in the whole country. An industry that is actively in production is going to be seeking ways to be more efficient, which in turn causes costs to be cheaper per unit produced. Nuclear power doesn't have anyone in Australia working to make it more efficient, because there can't be anyone working in the industry at all.Again, there are forms of baseload renewable energy. Also, baseload power isn't particularly important for the Australian energy market. Baseload power is important for any energy grid. If a city uses 10GWs of power during the day and 5 GWs at night, you need to be able to at least have a baseload capacity of 10GW production via some forms of power generation, and that's risky to only have exactly what you need, as energy demands can fluctuate. If you go lower, you can store it. If you go higher, you have brown and blackouts.It doesn't. Solar gets much cheaper the more of it you buildThis is generally the case with most things. Economies of scale tend to be more efficient than small-scale production.","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"And this is supposed to be our opposition party standing up to the destruction of democracy? ??","title":"Clyburn says hed support Biden pardoning Trump"},{"text":"Lol people did listen to him and that's why we lost.

Their definition of rich donor is anyone who donates $200, because that represents less than 1% of campaign contributions in a given cycle.

Random congressional Democrats aren't getting a constant stream of small dollars through ActBlue.

It's often out of date and made by people who apparently have never seen a campaign before. For campaign finance purposes, $200 is still considered small dollar. That's a very normal amount to donate and some campaigns don't even consider those donors particularly valuable. The threshold may be $1000 or $2000 or previous max contributors to other campaigns.

Nuclear is a base load. The reactor starts up and stays running consistently unless it's taken offline for an outage cycle for maintenance, repositioning rods, and cycling out fuel. In the US, that is about an 18-month cycle18 months of constant power output from a reactor with little variance.  You don't really \\"turn solar on and off\\" as needed. You do for maintenance, but you're not just saying, \\"Hey, I only need four hours of extra demand; let me turn this field off later.\\"  You're turning down power from other more fluid systems like NG until the field efficiency diminishes, then you spin up different forms. As far as lifetime, solar fields usually go for 25 - 30 years before needing a significant overhaul. A nuclear reactor in the US could run 80 years with the right license extensions. The other thing you're somewhat overlooking is the amount of land needed for GWh of power. Let's assume, for the sake of discussion, you have one reactor that puts out one GW of sustained power. We have a solar field with a panel efficiency of about 28% which is better than average. It takes about 2 square miles to site a reactor, containment, turbine housing, fuel building, spent fuel ponds, dry cask storage, cooling towers, cooling ponds, control building, ancillary buildings, security perimeters, parking lots, switch yards, etc. A solar field that outputs the equivalent power amount takes nearly 20 square miles.  10 times the size the amount of land needed. Another issue with solar is the hotter it gets, the less efficient it becomes, so now the output fluctuates as you get above 25 C. Don't get me wrong, solar is great, but if you want a diversified grid with constant clean power running at 90% efficiency over the 18 months of operation, Nuclear will be the pants off wind and solar every day of the week. The capital costs of nuclear is coming down and I don't know what the permitting process is like in Australia, but in the US, but depending on the state, the permitting process alone is between 10% and 20% of the cost to bring a reactor online, and depending on the inevitible lawsuits, that can be anywhere between 5 and 15% of the cost. Let's assume we're in the middle of those; that's 1/4th the cost of bringing that plant online is from permitting and lawsuits.","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"Yes, I'm aware the elements degrade containers, only the inner of which is metal, btw.

Most households can get their energy from rooftop solar which significantly reduces the amount of space needed for large-scale solar.  You need to build three. One nuclear plant can produce, currently, 3.5% of the current production (on the assumption a 1GW plant runs 24/7, cant be bothered to come up with an accurate downtime.) Its a crazy increase, and it gets easier with every one of them you build. And in fifty years, when you need more power, you build another one. You just gonna build hundreds of acres of solar farms?We don't need to build any. By the time we could build 3 nuclear plants, we'd have most of the renewable energy we'd need. The generous estimate for the time needed to build just 1 plant is 15 years. We'd also either need to import the skilled workers required (which, good luck when pretty much every western country with nuclear power is struggling to build their own in a timely manner) or spend years training enough workers (and we'd still need to import people to teach them).  And, again, why would a nuclear plant spend any time turned on? It's more expensive than renewables and it gets even more expensive the higher the penetration of renewables. Virtually zero retailers would bother making any bids for nuclear energy. It'd need significant government subsidies for anyone to come close to bothering which would just be a complete waste of taxpayer money.  You just gonna build hundreds of acres of solar farms?Yes? I don't know how often I need to say this, but it is both faster and cheaper for us to do exactly that. And, again, the sheer amount of rooftop solar significantly reduces the space needed, because they're placed in dead space that otherwise wouldn't see any use.  Also, while I know the topic of the post is largely around solar power, there are multiple renewable energy sources that we have in abundance to make use of.

OP is comparing new leading edge renewable power generation to century old nuclear technology.  Thats right, the current nuclear technology generally used and discussed in political theatres is from the Second World War time frame.  Now, if you upgrade the discussion to modern nuclear technology, the discussion changes.  China is bringing on-line the first Thorium/molten salt reactor in 2026.  This new technology is any order of magnitude better than old US technology in all metrics.  If this new technology were used in a small modular reactor, many of OPs negative metrics would be significantly reduced as would the cost  per kW of the power generated. While the above is true, Australia is in a unique position.  The high levels of sun and wind make renewable energy easily within Australias reach.  Considering that local installations and town grids can be set up, the need for long distance transmission could be eliminated. Proper incentives and regulation by federal, state and municipal governments will overcome the mental bias society has for fossil fuels.

But what the hell are you going to use for pumped hydro in Australia? Seriously, let me know if you guys have any enormous high altitude reservoirs I don't know about. But simply building dams on top of pathetic hills to hold water artificially and then pumping up a pathetic altitude before pumping down again, is gonna require a disproportionately large up front investment just to have a big, fat, horribly inefficient battery that can't even store charge because it's gonna bloody well boil away in the sun.Countries like the US or NZ that have easy, natural hydro power right there for the taking would be crazy not to use it. Hydro is one of the fastest and most responsive primary power supplies and its gigantic reservoir capacity means that it can balance out even the most erratic power production from wind or solar farms. But you can't put hydro everywhere.Australia would be strictly better off solving its energy storage needs using batteries compared to pumped hydro - but then, you would be even betterer off to just build a base load power plant instead of building erratic power plants and shittons of storage.

I think people would rather watch the country burn than elect a black women who would be good for the country. Obama was special. He was black, but he had to be over and beyond an amazing politician. He was also a man, and he was traditional as well. He appeared to be \\"the man of the house\\" as well as somewhat religious and had two kids of his own.  People like to say they're not sexist or racist, but if that was really the case then we would've long passed policies that would've increase opportunities in black, low income communities, until the incarceration rates weren't so heavily skewed to black people. Instead, we kept the status quo, and continue to let it happen. Harris was a women, and she was black. She doesn't fall under the traditional role. She doesn't have her own blood related children. Which I personally don't care, but god knows half this country takes it very seriously. People judge based on this shit. So the whole \\"I can't put my finger on it but there isn't something quite right with her\\" is bullshit based on emotional feelings rather than logic. THIS is what sexism and racism looks like. It defies logic, and acts on emotions. I'll give them the fact that she didn't win the primaries, because I doubt she would've anyways. Why? Again, she's a black women who doesn't even follow the normal traditional family vibe. We had so many great politicians to choose from, and we elected the old white man. What did we end up doing again this time around? Elect the old white man, even if he was senile.I hope this turns out to be a valuable  lesson for all the people who couldn't vote for her.

First of all, there are several definitions of freedom because there are several schools that define it. Socialist freedom is not the same as Anarquists or Conservatives but they all have their OWN definition of what freedom is. Even inside libertarianism exist different definitions of freedom.For libertarians is socially and economically freedom where coercion is not allowed. You said that we are a mix of liberals / conservative thats because I want to believe you took the freedom ideas from both sides, right? (Social freedom from the liberals and economic freedom from conservatives) But the truth is that what we value the most is freedom.Your freedom ends were the others begin. This is a very common saying by the libertarians which implies that you cannot step on other in other to achieve your goals. Have you seen the yellow flag with a snake (snek) that say Dont treat on me? Well what that implies is that you cannot coerce nobody TO DO or THINK in the way you want, which means that, we value individualism over collectivism. The contrary of liberals (Left liberals or progressists outside the USA) or socialist, who value the collectivism more over individualism.That doesnt mean, careful, that we separate the individual from the collective because, that is impossible; we cannot separate the individual from the collective or the collective from the individual but we PRIME the individual over the collective, why? Because is the individual who have goals, is the individual who have ideas, is the individual who have dreams, NOT the collective.When you go to college, when you work, when you start a business: for who you do that? For you or for everybody else? Yes, it is true that everything you do have an impact in society but primarily, for who you do these things? Like Friedman said: We are individuals pursuing our dreams.About the feminism / women rights. Libertarians defend freedom and equal rights for everybody, therefore, they defend the freedom to choose (depending on the subranch of libertarians in the case of abortion for example) and the rights of everybody. NOT exclusively the rights of women but everybody to be equal by law. For example, and this is my hot take. I am against giving more rights to women, why? Because in the moment you give more rights to a determinate group you are saying that that group have MORE freedoms than the rest, therefore, that group CAN MANDATE OVER others. (Just like in Spain. The government eliminated the presumption of innocence for men. If a woman makes a claim that you (as a man) raped / hurt her, the police will take you directly to jail. If its vice versa, nothing happens)We must be equal by law and only by law because that is the only place where we can. No man or woman is (economically or physically) equal to other and cannot be. Even the man / woman you were yesterday is not the same man / woman you are TODAY.I want to add something very important. If you try to find books of social libertarians ideas you will realize that most of the books are economic books, that is because the major exponents of libertarianism are economists such as Hayek, Mises, Hazlitt, Friedman. Libertarians tend to recommend Walter blocks book Defending the undefendable because, like the books name said, he will defend things that will shock you.Here is video of professor Juan Rallo giving the 10 points of liberalism (or libertarianism) for more information. Its in Spanish but you can activate the auto translation (its quite accurate): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRHoW\\\\_4eQ4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRHoW_4eQ4o)I want to finalize telling you that libertarianism is quite minimalistic; this means it can blend with almost any other ideology like yours or the conservatives so I think you might save some fights with your BF jaja.","title":"Stupid question.

This means that if you need a 1GW base load, for example, that building solar panels that have a max output of 1GW isn't really guaranteed to produce that reliably, so you'd have to overbuild in order to ensure you hit or at least are much closer to the base load demand.

The original title of the essay was Resistance to Civil Government.Thoreau used the motto to argue for the abolition of government, not just a smaller government. He believed that government is at best an expedient, but most governments are usually inexpedient, and all governments are sometimes inexpedient. He also believed that the government is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\\n_______________\\nAlso, here is a Google AI overview :Henry David Thoreau is often credited with the phrase that government is best which governs least from his 1849 work Civil Disobedience. However, Thoreau was actually using an existing phrase to argue for the complete abolition of government, not just a smaller one.Thoreau believed that government was at best an expedient, and that most governments were usually, and all governments were sometimes, inexpedient. He argued that people should be men first, and subjects afterward, and that they should cultivate respect for the right, not just the law. He also believed that people should not wait for an opportunity to vote for justice, but instead should be just themselves. The phrase has also been associated with Thomas Jefferson and John Locke, but it doesnt appear in their writings. The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print was in 1837, and the earliest known appearance attributed to Jefferson was in 1853..Ill add one more reference you may find interesting:\\nThe Difference Between Classical Liberalism and LibertarianismHow the appropriation of an old term is being used to obscure unpalatable political positionshttps://danielmiessler.com/p/the-difference-between-classical-liberalism-and-libertarianism/","title":"Stupid question.

Grain of salt here, I can't source all of this. I've worked in the naval nuclear space as a chemist and have done personal research including research for a BS of nuclear science technology. So also, probably biased. However,1. Nuclear's capacity factor is unmatched by any legacy or renewable energy source, resting in the low 90%. Coal and gas are around 50%, solar and wind are around 20-30%, and geo is upper 70%, if I'm recalling correctly. Capacity factor is a measure of how often a generator is producing rated power over a period of time. A year for instance, would have solar producing its max output only 20-30% of the time, while nuclear would be at max output 92% of the time. This is the 'baseload' discussion, that nuclear can stay on all the time and provide the majority of the minimum continuous power demand. If your grid usage drops to 60% at night, nuclear can provide most of the energy for that demand, while during the day, other energy can be turned on as needed. 2. Land usage. Nuclear has one of, if not the lowest, life time land usage requirements of all energy sources. Per unit of power (KW, MW, GW) nuclear needs less land than others to provide it. That includes land considerations for mining, waste disposal, and operations not just the actual power plants. This allows for easier placement in optimal locations as it won't interfere as heavily with adjacent land. Yes, the adjacent land would fall under different emergency measures in the case of radioactive release, but this a very, and I mean, incredibly small, risk. Land adjacent can still be used, and because it produces zero carbon during operation, the surrounding area is very clean minus the roads to get in.3. Cost reduction by direct replacement. Nuclear capacity factor means it directly competes with thermal, hydro, and fossil fuels, and does it better, it's just expensive. It is expensive, and there's many reasons why that I'm not sure Australia shares with the U.S. Our primary issue, that you WILL face, is lack of experience in construction. The Vogtle nuclear stations were massively over budget and behind schedule, however, this is the second and third reactor finished in the U.S. (outside military) since 1990. They are also new designs, which caused some issues. Basically, the construction company assigned had very little practical experience with building the things, and this causes mistakes, and cost creep. Westinghouse, the designer of the plants, also declared bankruptcy during construction and caused a whole wealth of problems. Cost is still high, but it doesn't have to be nearly as bad, and can even be cost competitive with at least fossil if not even some more expensive renewables. The high capacity factor, coupled with its small physical plant footprint, permits nuclear to directly replace fossil fuel installations at a 1-1 or 1-2 ratio. A lot of cost is in land and that land ready for a power station, additional funds from surrounding infrastructure also boost prices. If nuclear were to directly replace just retired fossil fuel power stations, or even active ones, you can use a lot of the preexisting infrastructure. More importantly, you don't have to spend massive amounts on land and land development. Because of the small footprint, each fossil fuel power station may be capable of more than 1 nuclear reactor. This is pretty important, as building multiple reactors in one location *generally* will cost less than building 2 at 2 different locations.---\\nThe ability to directly replace can reduce costs, some (definitely biased) people claim as high as 60% reductions. I'm skeptical, but even a 25% reduction would be significant. Other methods such as plant standardization can reduce costs. Specifically for part to part usage, and more importantly reactor certification. Many reactors are *based* on a design, but are all custom built to some extent. This requires custom certification of each power station, which cost overhead in creation and execution. Leaving them on longer also reduces costs. This is also why I think direct replacement has such potential. When you refuel and Overhaul a reactor to double its life span, the refueling process is a fraction of the cost of initial construction. All of the existing infrastructure is there and the land is made specifically for that plant. This already exists and has been done multiple times, and it's always cheaper than initial construction and spreads the cost out across more years. A 21 billion cost 30 yr plant is 700 mil/yr, but if you refuel that reactor at th 30 yr mark for only 9, 12, or even 14 billion, your yearly cost is 500, 550, or 583 million per year. These aren't accurate, just examples, some will be higher some have been significantly lower. Direct replacement could have a similar effect to reduce costs.Other reasons: Australia will soon have a nuclear submarine force. Australia will spend *a lot* of money just training operators how to operate. These individuals, upon exiting will have no plants to take their experience to, and will probably shift careers or work at conventional power stations. The difference in cost in training someone for nuclear vs conventional, adds up. No idea what specific figures would be, but for my training it (allegedly) cost around 200k, and Google AI says 'several hundreds of thousands'.In addition to the operators, the cost of regulatory bodies for military nuclear can be spread across civil sector as well.The submarines will require extensive maintenance under radiological conditions. Specialized civil workforce, same as operator argument.Renewables will also require significant battery capacity, which does help with capacity factor, but will be expensive. Batteries don't last, and continuously recycling and procuring more will be expensive long term. This will potentially also constitutes worse waste production than nuclear, as the toxicity is high for many battery types. Battery creation, is also very environmentally damaging (for some types). Examples would be the lithium extraction fields in Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Generally, it requires a lot of water that can't be used again for other things.Lastly, time. We need to rapidly change energy *now*. That seems counter to nuclear, as it takes so long to build, however, if we start soon, we can get significant portions of national grids supplied by 2050 which would directly replace active carbon emitters. We are already at 1.5C as of this year, energy demand is increasing and we are using *more* fossil fuels as it does. We need all hands on deck, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, etc. need to be built fast to mitigate CC. Renewables simply cannot do it fast enough, Australia could help by building nuclear *and* renewables.","title":"CMV: Nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Australia"},{"text":"was it the one that got pooped on by a bat","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"One of my friends just got married at 19Malarkey level &lt;= 3 they stay marriedMalarkey level  3 they divorced after 7 - malarkey level years","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"No, I'm not.

All large-scale electric grids today demand the literal physical momentum from large spinning rotors found inside alternators.The only way you can get away without the rotational momentum of thousands of tons of rotating iron is with many, *many* large-scale synchronous condensers to stabilize frequency/voltage and many grid-level controls to tell solar inverters how much power to \\"let out\\"Additionally, as you increase the share of solar in your electric grid, you also have to contend with the problem that all grid-tied solar today is set to \\"grid follow\\", which means the inverters (the things that transform the DC output of the solar to the AC the grid runs on) watch the utility frequency and phase match to it. If you get too much solar and not enough spinning iron, a large (or local, or both) disruption to the frequency on the grid can cause a rolling, destabilizing effect on the grid's frequency, as all the inverters follow a crashing frequency that can't be maintained by the existing spinning iron. Instead, these inverters will need to be set to \\"grid leading\\", which may not be possible and will require retrofitting at every offending inverter.They're many, many problems with relying heavily on solar.

Absorbs it? Are they just using people like straw in the fire and replacing the people who are extinguished? With so much external support, how has Ukraine been unable to secure its borders if Russia is as weak and outdated as they seem to be? Secondly, could it have been an attempt by Russia to reduce their true targets' military stockpiles through requiring aid for Ukraine? If a country is sending any of their own resources elsewhere it would technically reduce their own capacity, right? So could they be trying to drain stockpiles so there is less to work with when they do attack their real targets?

Just have a look at Ben Shapiro [1] and Matt Walsh [2] videos on the assassination, and read the comment section.

Then act now to strengthen democracy"},{"text":"TLDR?","title":"The real culprits behind the Jersey drones"},{"text":"Here are my attempts at a CMV, not based on the topic but on the rationality.  \\n(1) - The US Economy is better than its peers, but it is far from \\"good\\". In July labor released their yearly report on wages-versus inflation. From Jan 20 2021 to Q1 2024, the average American only has had wage-gains of .7% against inflation. This means in-essence the average American is monetarily doing worse than four-years ago. That yes 30% have likely seen significant gains against inflation, 30% have equally seen similar loses. Its hard to call an economy \\"good\\" when the average person is doing the same. If you compare this to the Trump years, the average American gained 16.5% against inflation. Then you have the choirous of people chanting how the economy is not bad, for people who are in the bottom 50% of wage gains you are going to make them more angry.(2) - Kamala Harris was horrendously unpopular. There was a massive campaign to cover up her misgivings. She would not take interviews, Nate Cohn removed any \\"Trump Favoring\\" polls as being inaccurate (then made an entire op-ed talking about after removing them it didn't change the average), and the media clearly did not act independent (i.e. justifiably calling out Trump for tips being tax-free, but acting like its an amazing policy when Kamala brought it up). Nearly every person had a red-line that Kamala Harris crossed as a promise either during the Joe Biden presidency or her horrendous presidential primary campaign, she never showed people how she changed. If you disliked the rise of crime, Kamala was the person who moved to make theft a misdemeanor. Then her actions nearing the end of the campaign was horrendous from calling husband's wife-beaters if they voted for her or calling anyone voting trump as voting for fascism; its hard to look at Trump and Kamala and say how either rhetoric is actually worse (for me the wife-beating thing was a bridge way too far). (3) - The reason Democrats had more behind them in 2016, was because they had a realistic platform that the majority of the American public is behind. If you look at Pew or Gallup nearly every Progressive policy that the Democratic now puppets is disliked by a super-majority of the population. The only time to fund a resistance is if the majority of Americans is behind you, if they don't it just makes the people against the policy more entrenched. (4) - The movement of Men under the age of 30 is because of the economy. They see what was possible 10-years back and see how it is impossible for them now. You graduate from college, many white-collar jobs are not hiring, and those hiring are generally underemploying people. People want enjoyable careers that they believe are at their level, if they need to buy houses/cars or get careers below what they deserve, they will be unhappy.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Im confused here reading your replies to ither comments.

Civil Rights, While yes it was a Democratic President that signed the bill is was a liberal GOP congress that voted to pass it.I highly suggest looking up the  quote attributed to LBJ as he signed the right to vote into law. It is an eye opener.Shortly after this the DNC slowly stopped being as conservative and began becoming much more liberal while it  also moved away from the rural south and embracing mainstream media, urban centers, and cooperate (cough cough) campaign donations. The DNC and  the GOP are going no where because they have convinced the sheeple that these are your only options.

We can view it in the more neutral perspective but I'm wondering where &amp; who those entities might be that trick you to the light.If we take some of the new age spirituality ideas, we can reinterpret:If we take for example, our life is a game, and there's no time as a reference, the higher self has been playing us, a character / ID in the 3D earth game with specific missions. They may also be playing other IDs. So if to complete the game, the mission is to be complete at 100%, let's say the missions include remembrance (awakening), clearing of past trauma, reducing the creation of karma, etc. If we don't complete the mission, the higher self deems we have failed and will return as another character / ID. However, in the game, due to the mental manipulation of other consciousness / characters / ID, other forces are created, those may include hell or other mass consciousness created realities. Other mental masses of certain characteristics, such as deities, may also exist to skew the game.I think it's hard to know for sure what is going on but the minimum we can do is to make life easier. I find that awakening or remembrance is the basic thing that we can do, which is what i think is happening, as external forces seems to be causing more people to awaken.Assuming we take our own lives, the mission fails, also depending on certain beliefs, we make go to a mass consciousness created reality such as hell to make up for some of the mission percentages before moving on. This is what I've heard one of the mediums mentioned.Assuming ascension is real, the timelines will be split and there will be a few versions of earth. Those whose higher self choose to continue the 3D mission will stay in 3D earth, those that have completed a part of the mission may more towards 4D then 5D. The higher self is the one that gives you the intuition to look for spiritual things anyway. If it's in the plan for your character to have the remembrance, you will choose to believe and be guided. If not, some people may choose not to believe.","title":"Looking for compelling arguments against the soul-trap theory"},{"text":"Medicare for all doesn't outlaw private insurance plans.","title":"Rep.

Id also say it's so much more complicated than just saying one president did good and another bad. No president comes in with a clean slate and lots of things happen that are not even under the control of the man in change anyway. For example, it's totally disingenuous for Dems to blame Trump for how the economy wasn't great over covid. Nobody knew what to do and the circumstances were both crazy and far reaching. They can judge how well they think he handled it but to come off like Trump just ruined the economy when covid was doing the ruining is not fair. But these kinds of complications are usually ignored by both sides when they are trying to explain how easy it is to come to the conclusion that they know what they're doing and the other guy doesn't.","title":"Trump: I Won't Go After Biden, My 'Retribution Will Be Through Success' ??"},{"text":"Agreed.","title":"I say to the Democrats \\"do everything you can to make his presidency a failed one and miserable to the American people!\\""},{"text":"Hell NO.

I don't understand how we lost this time around.At the risk of sounding a bit stereotypical, the resentment against \\"coastal elites\\" is definitely a thing. And in some ways, it's pretty warranted. I grew up in a part of the Bay Area that's highly wealthy, liberal, and educated. Many people I grew up around have never left and never really spent time in different parts of the country where people think differently. A lot of my family who still live there are pretty clueless to the struggles of average Americans, let alone the working class (regardless of political affiliation). I'm not necessarily saying that's the case for you, IMO silicon valley is far more elitist than NYC. But I think a big factor is a working class who feel like the system isn't working for them and Democrats represent that system. I don't think Trump is going to help them either, but they at least think he hears them.I also think a decade of being told cops are evil and then proudly saying vote for a cop couldn't have helped Harris among liberals. I saw Harris as a less controversial but also less accomplished version of Hillary. She wasn't very liked in the 2020 primary, so for the party to just assume there'd be a lot of turnout for her I think was a misstep.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Yes, extremely violent.

The party coalitions are fluid and can shift in any direction. A lot can change in four years.The underlying political framework of 2020 through 2024 was highly unique, deeply affected by multiple events and situations that are unlikely to ever occur again this century. Democrats will not nominate someone in their 70s again, who becomes too old to serve a second term. The incumbent president is unlikely to drop out of the race three months before the election. Democrats will likely not nominate another woman, person of color, or LGBTQ person until after Republicans have already done so.The first woman president will be a Republican. Democrats will fret over electability in future primaries and the next few candidates will be straight white men.With that in mind, its possible that just nominating a straight white man under 60, who has a credible blue collar background, is enough to scramble the coalitions again even if the party changes absolutely nothing about their platform. And dont write off new media entirely. The way we communicate online is constantly changing.

The other issue is that since you say it should only be like 10 minutes a day, that means regular teachers have to teach it. We don't know how to teach meditation, and I don't think a 4 hour training is going to help. On top of that, a lot of teachers (and probably parents and students) will feel like meditation is uncomfortably close to religious instruction. I'm not religious and have some trauma from my religious upbringing. I would not be comfortable with teaching students something that is part of many religious practices. I bet a lot of more conservative religious teachers would see it as conflicting with their religious beliefs.

There is a huge distinction between those two. Equality for all means that all are treated equally and we should strive to give everyone the same opportunities regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc... Equity for all is when you have a powerful force, like the state, that is tipping the scales in favor of one group over another. A good example of this is affirmative action in college applications where a thumb is placed down on the scale to accept less white or asian students over black or latino students. Libertarians are generally opposed to this as this scale tipping is inherently unequal as it treats people as a collective rather than individuals.Advocating for equity, aka, fighting for \\"women's rights\\" or \\"minority rights\\" sounds good in theory, but is ultimately pointless because people are not equal. I'll never be able to throw a football as well as Tom Brady, sing as well as Beyonce, be as smart as Nikola Tesla, or be as charismatic as Barack Obama was when he was president.

Newsflash; The midwest union vote was *never* culturally progressive, but they still voted left because if you give them big enough populist enough economic stuff  and demonize rich people enough, they will pick their economic resentment over their cultural resentment. The left needs to run and do some retarded left economic populism stuff to gain anti-establishment credibility. As the right falls further into conspiracy nativism the only thing the left has with the juice to fight back is conspiracy class warfare. Like the right does for immigrants the left needs to lock in on a small slice of the population, rich people,  and blame all the nations problems on them. I think it might be too far for politicians, but look at how people are reacting to the United Healthcare CEO getting murdered. There is a real market for class resentment.

They are profitable. They generate substantial amounts of cash beyond their needs for operations or capital investment; the bulk is returned to shareholders so they can invest it elsewhere. They generate total returns to shareholders well in excess of what one might expect given their relative low risk to investors. Bankruptcies or other signs of financial distress are exceptionally rare. Strong financial performance was maintained even during periods of market turmoil.  \\n  \\n The performance of the industry, in aggregate, has improved over the past 20 years. Operating margins (profit as a percent of revenues) for the Defense companies in our analysis have increased from a range of 7% to 9% to a range of 11% to 13%. This is driven more by an improvement at the bottom than by higher returns for companies already operating at the top. Returns on net assets at the corporate level have more than doubled over this period, as have cash-flow returns on net assets. Returns on the market value of equity have improved. Investor risk has declined even as total returns to shareholders have increased.     While it is difficult to find direct commercial peers to defense companies, the Defense companies in our database in recent years outperformed Commercial companies with similar operational profiles. While operating margins in Defense are lower, that gap is more than offset by lower asset and investment requirements, so that returns on assets in Defense exceed those of the Commercial analogs. Returns on the market value of shareholder equity are substantially higher in Defense than the Commercial analogs. Defense companies have higher total returns to shareholders compared to their Commercial analogs, or when compared to broad equity market indices such as the S&amp;P 500. Finally, Defense companies have lower volatility (risk) in those returns to shareholders.  https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/pcf/docs/finance-study/DoD%20Study%20Appendix%20A%20-%20E.pdf","title":"Sanders Explains Why He's Voting Against the New $850 Billion Pentagon Budget | \\n\\"We do not need to spend almost a trillion dollars on the military, while half a million Americans are homeless and children go hungry,\\" Sen.

Dems do talk a big game in these ways but the party has also allowed and continued to give huge tax breaks to billionaires. Even Trump said he was taking advantage of that stuff. Dems have some hugely \\"progressive\\" standpoints. Their liberal views on immigration has largely been abandoned by the left, centre and centre right across Europe.Imo the most fitting comparison with Democrats is fine gael in Ireland. Neoliberals, they love tax breaks and on economically centre right. They are also pretty socially progressive these days.  The likes of bernie are on the left sure but not significantly and then you have the Clintons and Obama and in comparison to sanders they are quite a bit to the right.Social democrats are a small proportion of the democrats and a more standard political climate would have something along the lines of a Labour party for the likes of bernie but no way in hell would Obama or the Clintons be involved with a party like that.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"The only thing stopping him will be his own incompetence.","title":"Threatened With Jail, Cheney Condemns Trumps Assault on the Rule of Law"},{"text":"Why would a racist want to support the DEI?

The result has been the decay of our infrastructure, the reduction in protections for our banking system, for workers and for consumers and a general hollowing-out of the middle class and a shifting of economic returns from working people into the pockets of billionaires. I disagree with this premise. One of the major factors in the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis was the fact Congress, led by the DNC, incentivized giving our more mortgages based on the idea of social good. This is merely one example. The problem with assuming the 'liberal' policies were all good is that you are using hindsight and survivorship bias. Generally, nobody rememebers the proposals that never were implemented nor do they remember the policies that were tried and failed. It is just looking back at the successes and assuming everything was a success.Moving toward the center, which is actually pretty far-right, will not be a winning strategy for the Democratic party, and it will certainly be a disaster for the American people.This is actually a far more complicated problem than you present. If the Democrats want to win, they need to look to what it takes to win that 50%+1 in the places they need to win. If you look at the presidency, that means creating a roadmap to get there and tailoring your capaign/platform to those critical states to get there.There is not a magical combination here and simplistic answers really don't capture this need.  I will also state external factors play a huge role - either helping or hurting the incumbent. That has to be factored into the roadmap as well.be a disaster for the American peopleThis is political opinion, not a fact. There are quite a lot of people who believe the opposite.

The caller was a woman who had previously suffered from domestic violence, who worked in a domestic violence support center. She was voting for Trump because she liked that Trump didn't hide what his opinions were, whereas she felt Kamala wasn't forthright enough with her positions. Was she worried that Trump had bragged about sexually assaulting women and found guilty of the same? Yes, she didn't like that aspect about him. Was she concerned over the fact Trump had encouraged the events of Jan 6 and claimed for 4 years that the election was stolen from him without any evidence? Yes she strongly condemned what happened on Jan 6th and felt it was a horrible moment in our history. Was she concerned that women would lose the right to abortion, including when they needed one to save their own lives, and that women had already died due to Trump's supreme court overturning RvW? She was conflicted, she didn't like the idea of abortion but thought it should be between a woman and her doctor, with maybe requiring counseling to make sure the woman was really sure she wanted an abortion, but she certainly didn't think women should have to die to protect a fetus.For all of this and more, the caller didn't really like Trump's position and had reservations about him. But she was heading to the ballot box to vote for Trump anyway because there was just something about Kamala she didn't trust and didn't like. I think she mentioned specifically not liking the way she was appointed late to the nomination. She even said a couple of times \\"Maybe I'm making a mistake and I'll regret it, but I'm just doing what I think is best right now.\\"IMO Kamala was just deeply unpopular with too much of the country, which shouldn't have come as surprising after her terrible VP approval ratings and poor performance in the '20 primaries. My mother, who absolutely loathes Trump, stayed home because she just thought Kamala was \\"too liberal\\", despite not being able to explain what exactly was so distastefully-liberal about her - it was just a bad gut feeling. The anti-Kamala sentiment got masked after what seemed to be positive reaction from the Democrat Convention and positive press coverage, but turns out that was all coming from the 25% of the country that was voting for Biden or Kamala or whoever the Democrats put up (myself included), who were feeling relief after finding an alternative after the dreadful Biden debate.I do think a better, less-unlikeable candidate could have beat Trump. So, I have some hope that we could see a swing back in '28. However, I'm damn-near terrified that Trump's targeted hunt-down and firing/replacement of anyone who isn't a MAGA loyalist throughout the government, him getting another SC justice or two, and other Project 2025 initiatives may indeed cement GOP into power with no real way out. It makes my stomach turn when I stop to think about it.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":" anyone who tells you otherwise is delusional or full of it Nuanced discussions about how people process the world always start with a line like this","title":"Outgoing DNC chair Jaime Harrison pushes back against critics of identity politics"},{"text":"The moment when senators both DNC and RNC make it OK to get insider information about stocks and making sure its legal is enough to prove theyre a f.

Some staffer complained there was no ad strategy to make a clear narrative and they were just putting up whatever tested best without thinking of the substance.So when that didnt land because of the conflicting directions, they backed off economic messaging as time went on to the point that Trump was speaking about the high cost of living more than twice as often as Harris.There were a bunch of other mistakes too, like turning community organizers into telemarketers, waiting a month to do interviews with Harris and then waiting until around the VP debate to use Walz more, trying to make a coalition of both moderate Republicans and Democratic black voters in swing areas, and moreListen to the Harris campaign interview with Pod Save America.

Instead of arbitrarily fighting against it, definitely look to put checks and balances in, but use it to your advantage. Make some program up like: \\"The defense food-shortage preparation act\\" that forces the military to innovate and stockpile 90 day supply of healthier MRE options in case of combat, put a maximum time-limit on MRE storage - say 90 days, and note that all MRE's should be donated to food banks after 90 days...

Speculation is marked with \\"likely\\". I would encourage you to watch the trial, it is a matter of public record and was actually fairly entertaining.Rittenhouse shot an arsonist that was at that moment trying to set fire to a gas station with people in/near it. IIRC, had he succeeded he would likely have killed/injured dozens of people given how many people were nearby. Rittenhouse didn't start by shooting him, he started by taking a fire extinguisher and extinguishing the fire. The arsonist then tried to kill Rittenhouse and Rittenhouse only fired after he fell to the ground and the arsonist was reaching for Rittenhouse's gun.Rittenhouse then ran in the direction of a police baricade yelling for police. Several people saw someone running with a gun calling for police and began shouting that he was a shooter. If you watch the trial, the prosecution was unable to find anyone that would testify under oath that Rittenhouse was aiming or shooting at anyone that was not actively attacking him. Additionally, the videos recorded that night also support this claim.A few people then attacked Rittenhouse thinking he was a shooter based on the shouts given from the mob. Again, Rittenhouse attempted to flee his attackers and then used/attempted to use lethal force at two individuals who were attempting to take his gun. One of them survived and testified under oath that his intention was to take Rittenhouse's gun and kill Rittenhouse with it.  \\nEverything above this line are facts taken from the court case. The rest of this post is speculation and conclusions of the facts presented in the court.Had the arsonist not attempted to set fire to a gas station or attacked Rittenhouse after he extinguished the arsonist's fire source it is likely no one would have died that night. Had the mob not falsly shouted that Rittenhouse was a mass shooter then it is likely only the arsonist would have died. Had the men that attacked Rittenhouse not attacked a kid that was running for police calling for help and not pointing the gun at anyone (something that is perfectly legal to do) then it is likely no one other then the arsonist would have died that night. Had the state of Wisconsin allowed Rittenhouse to have a pistol instead of a rifle it is likely the only person that would have been shot was again the arsonist. Had the state of Wisconson not allowed Rittenhouse to have any firearms it is likely that Rittenhouse would be dead and the arsonist would have set fire to the building and killed/injured dozens of people.Had Rittenhouse not stopped the arsonist it is likely that a few dozen people killed/injured that night.Rittenhouse is a POS and an idiot. However the courts did not set precident saying you can kill protesters. The courts upheld the state's self defense and gun possession laws.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Do you like have an opinion?

Likewise, I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, and certainly can't be the conclusion of a single 50%-48% election result against the Dems.\\nNever in the history of a democratic country has a two-party or multi-party system transitioned to a stable one-party system due to voter behaviour. Politicians being in power generate backlash to themselves and their ideas (see Obama, Trump, Biden). If the Republicans win in 2028 it will consequently be harder for them to hang on in 2032 and so on, as problems will always develop and voters will eventually turf them out.\\nThe truth is Harris had a pretty *difficult* set of circumstances; the 2020 result was super close in the EC, and so even a small (and expected) backlash against the Dems would be enough to risk a loss. Add to that the unfortunate set of events that lead to her candidacy, and it's not that shocking she lost. Indeed, it's almost shocking she did so well if you think about where things were when Biden stepped back.\\nFinally, on the issue of voter suppression, studies have shown in the past that increased voting restrictions have a negligible or positive impact (due to the backlash) on democratic-leaning demographics voting. Indeed, voter turnout has trended up this century, and the Democratic vote share has not trended down, but remained around 50%. In any case the Republican base is shifting away from high-propensity voters so increasing restrictions more likely won't help them in future.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"For that particular event I have to rely on my memory, at this time I cannot recall.Taking away the 5th is not the silver bullet you think it is.","title":"Alina Habba should be worried about Biden handing out pardons like Tic Tacs"},{"text":"Bernie isn't even a Democrat lol","title":"DNC official defends Hegseth: I actually think hes a pretty good guy"},{"text":"This is Reddit we dont RTFA sir","title":"Biden says Assads fall in Syria is a fundamental act of justice, but a moment of risk"},{"text":"I watched that too.

One of the main motivating factors people said about the election is that the economy was something that influenced their vote. And unless Trump is blowing a bunch of hot air with what he is saying about tariffs and all that, it is very unlikely in my opinion that the economy will continue to be something that pushes people to vote republican in 2-4 years time. But on a broader scale, people blame the people in power when things go bad, regardless of if those people were actually responsible or not. So by having a majority, there is a high likelihood that if anything goes wrong in the coming years, the Republican party is liable to take the massive brunt of the blame. Sure, hopefully, nothing devastating is going to happen in the near future, but people aren't expecting the status quo. A lot of people want prices to go back to prepandemic levels, and that just isn't likely to happen without a recession. So already the Republican party has set itself up to fail by promising something that, in my humble opinion, is impossible to achieve without having people then be angry at them for causing a recession.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"Is there a way to out this in the DOGE suggestion box.?","title":"Sanders Explains Why He's Voting Against the New $850 Billion Pentagon Budget | \\n\\"We do not need to spend almost a trillion dollars on the military, while half a million Americans are homeless and children go hungry,\\" Sen.

That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. **Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.**https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdf","title":"The damage Biden has done"},{"text":"\\"We all do better when we all do better.\\"\\n-- Paul Wellstone","title":"Sanders Explains Why He's Voting Against the New $850 Billion Pentagon Budget | \\n\\"We do not need to spend almost a trillion dollars on the military, while half a million Americans are homeless and children go hungry,\\" Sen.

(The Democrat version was this country is becoming less and less White and since Non-Whites generally vote Democratic, Republicans will never win. Your version is, The rural population is forever cut off from the Left and their position in smaller states effectively makes them a politically untouchable lynchpin.) In either case, it makes a fatally untrue statement about the future being pre-determined by the past. Roughly 10% of voters genuinely will vote for whatever party sways them, which means that vote pre-determination is going to be incorrect for the last 10% that flips elections.?What most people inside of a Left-wing or Right-wing bubble fail to understand is that this election was NOT a vote of confidence in Trumps policies. This vote was a moratorium on Biden. Kamala positioned herself as a status quo candidate saying that she would maintain Bidens policies. Trump made clear that he would abandon Bidens policies. These swing voters were disillusioned with Bidens policies (based on inflation) and chose the change candidate. I expect that if Trump does even 20% of his stated plans that these swing voters will flip back to the Democrats like whiplash because they will want a new change candidate.I expect that you have two main questions: (1) Didnt these 10% voters understand that Biden handled the inflation better than in other countries?  No. They dont understand this; they do not know anybody living abroad who can relate this to them and are not so attuned to political news that they would have heard about it. (2) Didnt these 10% voters understand that Trumps policies would be bad for achieving the goal that they aspire to, cheaper costs for goods?  No. People who are suffering are less likely to scrutinize changes and just accept them because when you are suffering, you find it difficult to believe that a change could be anything other than an improvement.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"He had the gull to bash business owners and say \\"you didn't build that\\"","title":"Falling Out of Love with Obama: What changed?"},{"text":" Joe Biden is very much responsible for Trump's return to officeNope.

You can take this all the way back to Reagan, but it probably goes even further than that. Lets walk through it.Reagan beats Carter due to gas prices and a stagnant economy. Its a complete sweep, and the US has great short term growth in those 4 years. He wins again, and everyone thought that Dems were doomed. They got one term of Big Bush beforeAnother economic downturn. The party in charge always gets the blame, warranted or not. So Clinton gets elected. He gets to govern over a booming economy due to a variety of factors, including Global dominance (USSR just collapsed, less money for defense needed) more women entering the workforce creating a larger tax base, and most importantly, the burgeoning dot com boom. Basically lots of work became more efficient.These good times almost got Gore elected, but the 2000 election was razor thin, with fuckery in Florida, so it almost doesnt count. He was also very boring, and Bush had charisma and Karl Rove. If you go back and see what the biggest issues in 2000 were, it was stupid stuff like stem cell research. 9/11 happens and Bush wins reelection handily because we were at war.The democrats were thought to never be able to win another election again. They were soft on crime and terrorism. Conservative economic policies seemed to be working. Regulation was cut, the economy was growing, people got tax cuts. UntilThe Great Recession. Under republicans, with banking regulations cut, the global economy collapsed. Obama was a generational politician, sure, but any Democrats would have won that election because the recession was blamed on the republicans.He won re-election handily, with Romney only really being able to say that Sure, the economy is better, but it was too slow which didnt cut the mustard with the electorate. Republicans were projected to never win another election, especially with the demographics is destiny idea of Latinos voting blue.Then 2016. A population that was doing well decided not to bother voting. Voter turnout was low, and both sides ran unpopular candidates. Many leftists protested the election due to the treatment of Bernie. The polls showed a Clinton landslide. We know what happened. Trump won, and was gifted a great economy. He probably would have won reelectionExcept for the pandemic and brief recession. Its always the economy. Biden was saddled with the blame for post Covid inflation. Incumbents lost elections across the globe.This is a long read, but the point is that good times happen, and the incumbent party wins reelection. Bad times happen and the other side wins. Its a 2 party system the electorate wont just vote one way in perpetuity. Bad times will happen again, and the democrats will win.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"The left hate Democrats.They're a center-right neoliberal party that keeps Republicans in power by offering only milquetoast Republican policies as an alternative to hard Republican policies.Democrat's literally just rehash the policies of last-years republicans.

I'd also point out that these astoundingly successful liberal policies, both foreign and domestic, were opposed by conservatives at the time, just as they'd fought the New Deal and tried to keep the US from supporting our allies, while they themselves supported fascism and imperialism, before December 7th. I'd also point out that since 1968 when conservatives  came back into power in the US and conservatism infested the Democratic party, there has been a wholesale dismantling of those liberal policies. The result has been the decay of our infrastructure, the reduction in protections for our banking system, for workers and for consumers and a general hollowing-out of the middle class and a shifting of economic returns from working people into the pockets of billionaires.

Yet he carried out a very difficult attack in the center of a city that considers itself the greatest in the world.Second, this victim is widely hated and has come to represent the evils of the health insurance industry.

In reality, Harris and Biden dropped healthcare reform through the public option when that was the moderate position in 2020. Harris backed M4A in 2017. This time she promised she wouldnt push for a single payer system as president and didnt even discuss the public option. Biden backing down on the minimum wage because of an unelected Parliamentarian was also a let-down, as many Democrats had publicly urged him to challenge it. Republicans would never let something like that get in their way. Increasing housing wasnt really a clear part of the campaigns messaging either. There was a 25k one-time tax credit for first time homebuyers and plans to deregulate construction to increase supply, but otherwise building more affordable housing wasnt a clear pillar. The proposed increase for an innovation fund to catalyze construction financing didnt mean anything to people. Its not enough to just propose policies that policy experts say provides net benefits. People need to believe and feel that their politicians can actually change the government to work for them if theyre going to give them tax dollars and power.

But thats not true - he's a unique and talented politician who easily fended off challenges from legtimate politicians in his own party.Your second problem is that you seem to think that for some reason a year in which the Democratic incumbent president had sub-40% approvals was somehow a layup for Democrats. But in fact, in general incumbent approval is a very good predictor of the outcome of the election. If anything Harris overperformed a bit, certainly versus what Biden would have done. Any other Dem likely would have done just as bad because ultiately its hard to seperate yourself from your parties incumbent without admitting that your party has done trash.Sure - Democrats seem demoralized - thats what happens when your incumbent is wildly unpopular.Democrats will likely bounce back easily in 2026, taking back the House, and if Trump's previous term is any indication of where his approval ratings will end up, likely the White House and Senate in 2028 (Collins isnt unbeatable, might not even run anyway, and NC is mostly elusive in the Senate because of timing).Sure, Dems need to work on appealing to working class people. Specifically, the party needs to figure out how to reach people that don't get their news from traditional sources. Thats a group Trump did really well with.  \\n  \\nThe good news on that front is - Donald Trump is unique in GOP politics. There's no one else in the party that has his kind of personal magnetism and appeal to outsiders. JD Vance will, when he wins the nomination in 2028, come across as a crasser Mitt Romney type rather than a new Trump. But even then, Dems need to craft a message that appeals to people who see themselves as outside of the mainstream. The good news is that its easier to do that when the other guy is in charge. Probably in 2028 it would help to run someone who isnt seen as being part of the party mainstream, but we are a long way from all that anyway.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"They mean when white Christian nationalists cry about identity politics.","title":"Outgoing DNC chair Jaime Harrison pushes back against critics of identity politics"},{"text":"Ok racist.?","title":"The damage Biden has done"},{"text":"Also get struck down.

One way to do this is simply to show up, and it does help your vote total in a statewide race if you can increase your margins in every county. The case study Id use here is John Fettermans campaign in 2022. He showed up to every county in Pennsylvania multiple times and spent more time in rural areas than in Philadelphia (where he spent almost no time campaigning). This helped him to have a better margin in every rural county in PA than Joe Biden did 2 years earlier. He still lost most of these counties, but he lost them by smaller margins than Biden did, and ultimately won the statewide race. So did Biden, but Fettermans victory was a larger margin. Democrats have failed largely in rural areas because the DNC gave up on them and have been giving rural areas the finger rhetorically for decades. Just showing up and actually campaigning and trying to earn peoples votes again is the first step in this process. It will still take many years to rebuild what theyve given up, but its possible, and the best example we have is how the Republican Party basically started from scratch in many areas and just kept building support gradually until they were able to win. The GOP doesnt look at any county in the US as a lost cause, and it would benefit democrats to start doing the same, even if they have to start from scratch in thousands of counties.

Take this excerpt for example: \\n The last 24 hours saw, roughly, a piddling 660,000 transactions in Bitcoin, and something like 70 percent of Bitcoins have not moved in at least a year. That is made worse by how expensive and slow Bitcoin transactions are. By way of comparison, Amazon, which has a similar market capitalization, has seen about 40 million daily trades of its stock over the last few days.\\nThere's a few things wrong with this. First of all, 40 million is about AMZN's average daily trading volume, meaning the number of shares that have traded, not number of individual trades. I assume he's also referring to the number of bitcoins traded in the 660k figure, because the 24hr volume of Bitcoin is about $40B. But you can't really compare average daily volume considering there are about 19 million bitcoins in circulation and 10.5 billion AMZN shares outstanding. Plus, given one bitcoin is worth about $100k and one AMZN share is worth about $227, obviously more shares of AMZN will trade than individual bitcoins. \\nThe whole premise of the article seems off too. Like I mentioned the trailing 24 hour volume of Bitcoin is $40 billion. The article is claiming bitcoin whales need more volume to dump their coins all at once because otherwise it would crash the market, but that makes no sense. Because of the nature of the blockchain, you can see how long someone has held a bitcoin when it gets sold. If whales who have held for years started dumping all at once, it would cause a panic no matter how much demand there is. That goes for regular stocks as well. No holder of bitcoin is going to sell of their investment all at once if they are at all sane, and I think the article is pearl clutching over this possibility. \\nLoomis did introduce a bill to build a Bitcoin reserve by selling some of the government's gold reserve. Even if this bill were to pass as-is, we wouldn't come close to depleting the gold reserve to build this bitcoin reserve. Plus, the bill has no co-sponsors, and while some crypto-friendly Senators got elected, I don't see this bill getting enough support among the Republican old guard (especially those who love gold) still in Congress.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 8, 2024"},{"text":"I'm sorry but some of Biden's actions, especially regarding Ukraine and the southern border are about as close to gross influence peddling if not outright treason as I've ever been aware of a president committing.There should be an investigation, the facts of that investigation need to be released and if those facts show a likelihood that he committed those crimes then he should be charged.

They only pay attention to the fear and the bad things. The Harris campaign should have been in full on attack mode slinging shit all over Trump at every possible moment.

So yes, I wouldnt expect news folks to go as hardcore as 8 years ago. \\nAlso, the most delusional person on here is whomever called Rachel Maddow a conservative.

As for that mysterious 4 million I think some have pointed out her numbers were down in blue states so you could probably take half of those missing 4 million to that and then we all have to be honest about just how shady 2020 was as an election.  Its not a conspiracy to point out that our system is designed to count votes if they are casted.  If you figure out a way to get pass the current safeguards there is almost no recourse to undoing the damage.  Most states have election fraud departments in name only, and what is considered fraud by most states is laughable at best.  And then even if you point out something that violated the law you have a system in place that basically says too bad the vote was cast.  Just look at PA where even after a judges order you had local officials saying too bad we are counting those votes.  \\nso I think it is fair to say that in 2020 there could have been 2 million votes that shouldnt have been counted in a fair election.","title":"Would like to have a serious discussion about the missing votes for Kamala vs Biden in 2020"},{"text":"Biden attempted broad student loan forgiveness 3 times and it was struck down by the courts.The president also doesnt have the power to totally remake the healthcare system with an executive action.","title":"Biden administration announces almost $1 billion in additional weapons support for Ukraine"},{"text":"No offense but you're in a bubble. I agree with what you said but the problem is that when people say \\"economy\\" they usually mean \\"stock market\\".

Not to mention that inflation is crazy right now, and guess who is getting hurt the most by rising prices?I also think most of Reddit overestimated how much the average American follows politics. People are quite frankly busy and overworked, they are trying to raise families and take care of aging parents. They don't read Politico or look at FRED graphs, they don't read major newspapers. All they know is a lot of things are continuing to get shittier and more expensive: healthcare, housing, childcare, etc.And besides economics, the mood in the US has gotten WAY worse in the US over the past several years. People are angry and polarized, rich people are continuing to get richer, to me it feels like the last 7-10 years have seen a massively accelerated breakdown of the post-WWII social contract and a return to the  gilded age, only it's techbro assholes instead of robber barons this time. Neither political party has shown any interest in changing this, because God forbid they offend their rich fundraisers.In summary, people are unhappy. And when people are unhappy, they either vote for a leadership change or don't vote at all.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"puts pitchfork away","title":"It disgusts me that our society doesnt condemn murder"},{"text":"Given that it wasn't something brought up by the Dem campaign this time and it was still used as an attack angle, seems like you may as well keep bringing it up and push back on GOP nonsense about the matter.
