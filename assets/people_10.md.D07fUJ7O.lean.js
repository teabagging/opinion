Her unwillingness, or inability, to give coherent interview answerswhich led to her staff keeping her in bubble wrap until the final monthled to some embarrassing moments, such as her strange decision to refuse to distance herself from Biden on The View and elsewhere. Though the campaign released a series of policy proposals about the care economy, Harris never developed an economic vision that registered with a sufficient number of Americans. Its hard to think of a Democratic Presidential campaign in the postwar era that felt more constrained in its messaging, or more reactionary in its focus on the (admittedly myriad) flaws of its opponent. When the subject turned to foreign policywhether in Ukraine or GazaHarris could do little better than mumble platitudes.Imagine, then, Kamala Harris in a contested primary: someone who is not good in interview settings, who has few well-communicated policy ideas (something that appears to matter more these days to Democratic primary voters than to the general electorate), and who is unlikely to be seen as electable because she is tethered toindeed part ofan unpopular incumbent Administration. Harris would have had certain advantages in terms of name recognition, and perhaps fund-raising, but very little of what we saw during these past few months should make anyone think a primary campaign would have gone better for her than it did in 2020, when she flamed out months before the first primary votes were even cast.I wonder when it will become apparent that most of the funding, Democratic support and media adulation Harris received was only because she was the alternate to Trump, and not on her own merits as a candidate.

He saw the COVID vaccines being developed and made available to people so quickly as a huge achievement he should have been praised for by both sides but he got no credit from the pro-vaccine liberals or MAGA Republicans, and was very uncomfortable with that.I don't think he'll be happy unless he's doing things that make his base praise him and make liberals have the meltdowns that his base loves to feast  on, and it's rare for liberals to melt down over truly progressive positions that MAGA might support besides foreign policy issues.

An average wage at about this time was $65 a year in the 1790s, with food and lodging perhaps, which works out to a bit more than $2000 today; so a press cost a few years' wages, comparable to buying a house. In other words, the publisher was a small businessman, requiring a large capital investment to get started, but one within the reach of many average people.Furthermore, a paper seldom reached readers far beyond the limits of the town or city it was based in.

Kennedy remarked, after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and defeat is an orphan. The failure of the Democratic Party to prevent Donald Trumps re?lection is a catastrophe of yet to be known proportions, and Kennedys remark is a reminder that everyone involved will try to shirk the blame when confronted with the wreckage. Morally, that blame must of course begin with the estimated eighty million people who voted for Trump. They have chosen to return to office a man who has already tried to throw out the votes of their fellow-citizens once, and who would surely have tried to throw them out again if he had lost on Tuesday. Kamala Harris must take a certain amount of responsibility for her truncated, insufficient campaign. But, among Democrats, the blame for Trumps victory overwhelmingly lies with one person: Joe Biden. Indeed, Trumps triumph will be Bidens real Presidential legacy. Little of the rest of what he accomplished is likely to survive another Trump term.The single biggest reason this defeat should fall on Bidens shoulders is that his stubbornness in refusing to step aside as the Democratic nominee until July short-circuited the possibility of staging a primary, and left Harris as the only real choice to replace him. Enough has been written about Biden wheezing through campaign appearances before eventually dragging out his farewell for weeks after the calamitous summer debate. But Bidens arrogance remains astonishing to behold: well before 2024, he was quite simply too old to ask people, in good faith, to keep him in office through 2028. He did so anyway, insuring that his age became the biggest political story of the first half of the year. The result depressed Democrats across the country and allowed the Trump campaign to attack its opponent in a manner it hadnt been able to since 2016.Harris began her campaign with a burst of excitementshe raised almost half a billion dollars in the first monthwhich suggested that Democratic voters were desperate for any candidate who was not Biden, or perhaps just any candidate born after D Day. As her race against Trump got under way, Harris had some fine moments, such as her debate performance. She evinced an ability to feed off the energy at large, boisterous rallies, and she spoke about the best two issues the Democrats had this cycleabortion and January 6thwith real passion.Still, this was far from a perfectly executed campaign, and she was far from an ideal candidate. Her unwillingness, or inability, to give coherent interview answerswhich led to her staff keeping her in bubble wrap until the final monthled to some embarrassing moments, such as her strange decision to refuse to distance herself from Biden on The View and elsewhere. Though the campaign released a series of policy proposals about the care economy, Harris never developed an economic vision that registered with a sufficient number of Americans. Its hard to think of a Democratic Presidential campaign in the postwar era that felt more constrained in its messaging, or more reactionary in its focus on the (admittedly myriad) flaws of its opponent. When the subject turned to foreign policywhether in Ukraine or GazaHarris could do little better than mumble platitudes.Imagine, then, Kamala Harris in a contested primary: someone who is not good in interview settings, who has few well-communicated policy ideas (something that appears to matter more these days to Democratic primary voters than to the general electorate), and who is unlikely to be seen as electable because she is tethered toindeed part ofan unpopular incumbent Administration. Harris would have had certain advantages in terms of name recognition, and perhaps fund-raising, but very little of what we saw during these past few months should make anyone think a primary campaign would have gone better for her than it did in 2020, when she flamed out months before the first primary votes were even cast.One could argue that a bruising primary this year might have left the Democrats with a nominee even weaker than Harris. That was always possible, but the Party is relatively stacked with popular swing-state governors and senators, many of whom ran ahead of Harris last night. (Why Harris did not choose one of them as her Vice-Presidential running mate is another question.) At the very least, a non-Harris nominee would likely have been someone without her baggage from the 2020 primaryher brief support for Medicare for All and for looser immigration restrictions were a centerpiece of the Trump campaigns attack adsand someone who had shown an ability to win an election in a battleground state.But the most crucial attribute that another candidate would have had? Not being the sitting Vice-President of the most unpopular Administration since George W. Bushs second term. Its perfectly reasonable to argue that the Democrats central weakness was having presided over a worldwide inflationary period that has already wounded incumbent political parties of varying ideologies, from the United Kingdom to Japanin a word, that this was the Republicans election to win, no matter the candidates. Yet this should have been another reason to pick a nominee with at least some distance from the current Administration.Meanwhile, the entirely unhelpful role that Biden played after Harris became the nominee, with his fumbles and missteps on the stump, only served to remind people how much they disliked the incumbent. (The most infamous of these was Biden seeming to call Trump supporters garbage, recalling Hilary Clintons deplorables comments from 2016.) We may never know why Harris did not break more fully with Biden, and why, in the course of multiple interviews, she declined to throw him under the metaphorical bus, but given the Presidents touchiness and self-regard its possible that at a personal level this was a hard thing for Harris to do. Perhaps this is a point in her favor as a colleague and as a friend, but it certainly hurt her campaign.Many of Bidens defenders will argue that, however gruesome these months have beencapped off by this weeks disasterhe leaves behind a legacy of policy achievements that rivals Lyndon Johnsons and Franklin Roosevelts. Biden oversaw an economic recovery that was remarkable by international standards, and passed an enormous climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. He embarked on a new era of antitrust enforcement and closeness to the labor movement, and started the process of bringing important manufacturing sectors back to the United States. He has made numerous strong appointments, from the federal judiciary to the Federal Reserve. And he has helped to keep Ukraine from being fully annexed by Russia.But Trump is expected to try to roll back or repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, and to overturn all of the Biden Administrations actions to regulate climate change. There is no reason to think he will have trouble doing so, especially with Republicans confident about holding the House after already capturing the Senate. As for Ukraine, and whether it will even exist in several months or a year, the less said the better. The one area of continuityother than aspects of China policy, the wisdom of which remains to be seenis probably going to be with regard to Israel and Gaza, where Bidens policies have been alternately inert and disgraceful. The legacy Biden leaves behind, then, is now quite likely to be paltry.Perhaps its best to judge Biden by the standard he set for himself. Five years ago, he announced that the impetus for his 2020 campaign was to defeat Donald Trump, and all that he represented, which in Bidens mind was (understandably) captured by Trumps handling of the 2017 white-supremacist march in Charlottesville. In that moment, Biden said, in the video that kicked off his campaign, referencing Trumps infamous both sides remark, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any Id ever seen in my lifetime. He continued by insisting that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation, and that, if Trump could be kept to only four years in office, history would look back on those years as aberrant. But, Biden continued, if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Its in no small measure thanks to Joe Biden that all we can do now is hope he was wrong. ?","title":"Donald Trumps Second Term Is Joe Bidens Real Legacy"},{"text":"All ya have to say is watch Springfield Ohio no doubt workplace raids will start there.","title":"Donald Trump has promised a closed border and mass deportations.

An honest answer depends entirely on the status quo, how it would change, and what your assumptions are. There's also a difference between tariffs that target a particular good as a political favor to a union or a politically connected investor, and an across the board level tariff to cover the externalities of importing goods (classic example is to pay for the Navy to protect oceanic trade).Taxes discourage economic activity wherever they occur. Even leftists remember this when they support cigarette taxes, even as they forget it when they support income taxes. A problem with NOT using tariffs is that the general income tax is used to pay for costs so that import businesses get to skirt the expense. This is a market distortion, and also unjust.Overuse of tariffs, is also a market distortion that causes the inefficiencies described above.

While Europes help is needed and appreciated, it is the US that is the driving force for Ukraines defence against Russia. It is a key pillar that Ukraine hopes will not crumble.Yet new president Donald Trump has been clear that he believes the US is spending too much on non-American interests. While support will continue until January at least, when Trump takes office in the White House, Kyiv will be fearful of that source of money being halted, given the brutal state of the front line in many areas of Ukraine C and with Russia making slow but steady advances in the eastern region of Donetsk.There are a few billion dollars left in the funds Joe Biden can call upon under presidential drawdown authority to help Ukraine C drawing weapons from US stocks C and he may seek to deplete that source before he leaves office. But then it will be down to Trump, and a Congress that his Republican Party is likely to control, to sign off on support for Kyiv.Pressure would quickly be piled on Ukraines outmanned and outgunned troops on the front line C and an increase in casualties would follow. Europe has been ramping up artillery production, while Ukraine is putting as much effort as it can into increasing its own weapons manufacturing C but the loss of US funding, or even a drop in it, would leave a massive hole.There was a months-long hold-up in Congress over tens of billions of dollars of funding, which lasted from October 2023 to March 2024, with Trump-supporting legislators at the heart of the dispute. Kyiv was forced into using more of its wartime budget to try to keep its troops supplied.Soldiers on the front line spoke of shortages, particularly of artillery, and pleaded for US help. Others made clear how many of their fellow troops were dying under heavy fire from Vladimir Putins forces. Given the increased pressure Ukraines forces are currently under, as Moscow seeks to press home its advances in recent months C with thousands of North Korean soldiers also bolstering Russian ranks C another such delay would have serious consequences.I hope that the quantity of weapons, the quantity of guns for our victory will increase, a commander of an artillery unit in eastern Ukraine, who goes by the name Mozart, told reporters in the hours before Trumps win was confirmed. We dont care who is the president, as long as they dont cut us off from help, because we need it.Trump has described Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as the greatest salesman on Earth for securing US aid, and recently blamed both the Ukrainian leader and Biden for letting the war start C despite Putin being the one to invade. Trump has often touted his good relationship with Putin, calling him pretty smart and streetwise for going into Ukraine.Zelensky knows that constant pleas for help wont work with Trump. He has to be pragmatic and play to the president elects vanity. I appreciate President Trumps commitment to the peace through strength approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together, he wrote in a message on the social platform X, formerly Twitter. Trump has said repeatedly that he would have a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia within a day if elected, although he has not said how.The fear in Kyiv will be that a rush to get a peace deal in place would mean Ukraine being forced into giving up territory currently occupied by Russia C something Zelensky has consistently said his nation will not accept. Zelensky will know he needs to keep in Trumps ear, so expect the X posts to continue, alongside the work in the background.The Kremlin has been cautious in its response to Trumps win so far. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the president elect had made some important statements during his campaign about wanting to end the Ukraine war, but only time would tell if they would lead to action. Let us not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state, Peskov told reporters. Although Putin will no doubt be happier with Trump in the White House than if Kamala Harris had won.But Trumps push for a quick end to the war might not be the gift the Kremlin will want it to be. Putins railing against the West has framed the US and its allies as an existential threat to Russia, and one that cannot be resolved. There is a risk, in coming to the table, of undermining that. It is also clear, given that Putin aimed at Kyiv at the beginning of the war, that he wants the whole of Ukraine C and he will not want a deal while Russia is edging forwards, or if he thinks US support for Kyiv is likely to slip.The primary trade of both Putin and Trump is bombastic rhetoric. It is obvious what Trump gains from brokering an end to the war in Ukraine C but will he actually have the will to try and see it through? For Zelensky, it is about the survival of his nation. The end of military aid from Washington will see a high price paid, in both soldiers and (probably) territory. It is something he and the world can ill afford.Ukraines president, and his European allies, will have to convince Trump of the same.","title":"A Trump presidency wont necessarily be the gift for Putin that Moscow thinks it is..."},{"text":"I mean, I did recently donate to AP.

Facts dont matter to the average voter, if anything, the average voter is horrifically uninformed or outright misinformed and votes based on vibes over substance: voters distrusted Harriss campaign as much as Trumps even though Trump is known to blatantly lie about everything and theres no substantive reason to distrust Harris. She just seemed fake to people. On Election Day, there was a spike in Google search results for questions like who is Kamala Harris and Did Biden drop out and How to vote for Joe Biden and even Kamala Harris policies and Donald Trump policies. There are vast swathes of the electorate who are so politically unengaged or uninformed that they didnt even realize Biden dropped out months ago or bother doing basic research on candidates until Election Day.Many voters are also entirely misinformed and vote based on Republican propaganda, whether about Gaza or the economy or any number of issues. Look at the vote spread of people who think theres a horde of illegal immigrants streaming into the country even though most of them are immediately deported after CBP encounters or awaiting court hearings, the people who think inflation is at record highs because they dont understand inflation isnt just their groceries going up, the people who think were giving billions in cash to Ukraine as aid when almost all of it is surplus military equipment, the people who blame Biden for tax raises signed by Trump, etc.An Ipsos poll from October found that people who think violent crime is at record highs, who dont know inflation has dropped to historic averages, who think the stock market is down, who dont realize illegal immigration is down, all lean R by overwhelming margins: R+26, R+19, R+9, R+27. People who werent misinformed polled at D+65, D+53, D+20, D+59.Arab Americans flipped to Trump or refused to vote over Gaza. Theyre complete idiots because Trump will be 100x worse: its a kneejerk emotional reaction without any understanding of the actual consequences or out of a desire for revenge on Biden/Harris.Same thing with voters at large: try explaining to your average American how Trumps economic policies+his disastrous handling of COVID crashed the economy, how Biden and the Fed had to pull the US out and higher inflation is common after quantitative easing, how the US is actually doing pretty well compared to other countries and inflation is down now without a recession, how deflation is actually bad for the economy, etc. and you get blank stares and cries about groceries being cheaper under Trump with zero understanding of basic macroeconomics or monetary policy.Meanwhile the guy who just got elected is promising tariffs on all imports and higher tariffs on China, which will absolutely ruin the economy that the US has spent the past 4 years finally stabilizing after COVID, but the average American has no idea about his plans or has no idea what tariffs are. See the screenshots going around of Trump voters freaking out once they learn what tariffs are and that theyll have to pay for it.I saw an article posted basically arguing that people want more/expanded emergency social programs like 2020/2021 that made their lives better and expired under Biden. The logical answer to being better off with expanded emergency social safety nets in 2020/2021 is to vote for the party promising more social safety nets, not the one that consistently opposes them. Trump will not restore those programs and will actively make life worse for the vast majority of this country.Trumps previous tariffs forced the government to bail out farmers who lost their Chinese market forever: those people went to Brazilian farmers instead, and stayed there even after Trumps tariffs were lifted. His steel tariffs led to layoffs and rising prices, same with lumber and other raw materials. The housing price boom is partially because his tariffs made building new houses economically unviable and drove up demand for existing houses.","title":"AOC Directly Addresses People Who Voted For Both Her And Trump"},{"text":"This actually made me scared.

Eichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth, and nothing would have been farther from his mind than to determine with Richard III to prove a villain. Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing It was sheer thoughtlessnesssomething by no means identical with stupiditythat predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period. And if this is banal and even funny, if with the best will in the world one cannot extract any diabolical or demonic profundity from Eichmann, this is still far from calling it commonplace That such remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together which, perhaps, are inherent in manThere is no great mystery or conspiracy theory behind this victory. I wish democrats, specifically white ones can come to accept that. This is what the people want.

I'd give the China question a much much higher impact on the 2028 election as by that point the US and China are likely to be in a cold war state by then.At any rate this shif was a referendum on the economy more than anything and I suspect it will be even more so given that Republicans are likely to mess up badly given how much of their policy is ideologically driven rather than fact based.Worse still this wasn't a major victory for the Republicans as they barely one. You look at the swing districts and there are now roughly 70 Republicans house members sitting in what is now swing districts where as the number of democrats on swing districts has fallen to about 30. In swing states there are now 20 Republican senators that could lose there seats if they crash the economy.All in all the Republicans are in a worse position for victory then they have been since at least the Reagan administration and that doesn't bode well for them leading into the critical 2030 redistricting period after the census. Quite frankly the only thing worse for the Republicans than Donald Trump losing the election would be Donald Trump winning because now the Republicans are going to be in charge and responsible for the economic performance of the country at a time when the party is quite frankly full of dunderheads and zealots which historically has never ended well for sound and prudent policy.Reality is that Republicans don't have a mandate for radical change like they seem to think they do and will likely pay a steep price if and likely when they screw up. Likely we will see a period of liberal growth in the US over the next decade that will be increasingly difficult for the Republicans to counter as they recover from Trumps second term. Republicans are on a very short leash and if they start yank on that cord to chase after there ideology squirrel whilst they fail the economic aspirations of the American voter the price the GOP pays will be decades of lost power.","title":"I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump.

Like, 4 years ago, I got a raise that put me making 33% more than Ive ever made in my life and actually started getting ahead a little bit, but after they printed a whole lot more money, and EVERYTHING started costing 30% more, Im basically right back to where I was before the raise. And I got LUCKY to have such a drastic pay increase to be back to even. A more typical story for most people is that their yearly cost of living increases havent even come close to keeping up with inflation. I dont believe its an accident that the system seems to keep most of us grinding in the same spot forever with only incremental improvements over time. Its a system of control. Its an open air prison that the money-printers have convinced everyone is freedom.","title":"Never stop being a conspiracy theorist"},{"text":"Wait for the stupid look on Trump voters faces when groceries skyrocket because there are no workers to harvest and produce them","title":"Trumps border tsar vows to override states who block mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Something I heard on NPR - it was offered as conjecture, but, we'll see as new data are released - and I think it was by Tamara - was that the presence of so many ballot initiatives concerning abortion may have made conservative-leaning women think they could protect abortion rights through these methods while voting for Trump to \\"fix the economy\\"","title":"AOC Directly Addresses People Who Voted For Both Her And Trump"},{"text":"Insta lives","title":"AOC asked her followers who split their ballots either for Trump/her or Trump/downballot Dem to explain why and posted the replies.

One could win by just being fucking real for a change, I am certain a majority of america would take to such an individual like gravity.How about Bernie himself? He was ironically highly favored by even the maga voters, his town hall received louder applause than trumps own... there were small amateur radio stations out in the boonies that were praising him, he had tangible momentum across the board.  How about Sean Fain? A powerful,  but not power hungry individual of the working class, with a record that puts any Dem/Repub to shame.  How about any of the progressive dems, they win by massive margins in their districts and have defeated legacy, powerful, establishment Dems every time - with magnitudes less in funding.  A grass roots candidate at the top to truly represent the voices from the bottom. A separate party bc the DNC has fucked over this effort 3 times in a row, they have cracked teams in the kitchen to plan out everything they do to ensure that theirs is positioned out front.","title":"CMV: Democrats' now need to campaign on wage increase first and foremost"},{"text":"When have they not looked stupid for the last decade or so?","title":"But Trump had never even heard of Project 2025.

If we attribute the mass waves of unionization and social organization across the country in recent years to Trumps disastrous first term, and the complete economic meltdown were expecting in his second term actually does happen, then I think populist systems could emerge out of necessity. People dont want to have to worry about basic necessities, and the way to make that happen is by taking control of the means to produce those necessities. Our ability to get those necessities through the means we currently do is likely going to collapse. Its definitely an optimistic approach in a way. It relies on the suffering of hundreds of millions of people, and a resulting solidarity among those people. A result of division and hate is possibly more likely, itll be up to those of us that actually understand leftist ideology to spread solidarity in our communities.","title":"A wrecking ball: experts warn Trumps win sets back global climate action"},{"text":"Also Elon Musk is an alienating asshole and Trump's type from the 1970-80's cocaine disco era are dead.","title":"Elon Musk weighing in on Trump staffing decisions: Sources | Musk has been with Trump nearly every day since the election, sources say."},{"text":"I dont know why no one acknowledges that Putin was planning on invading Ukraine in 2019.

However, you'll notice that they're *not* talking about expanding the number of judges and other officials necessary to take someone who has been arrested and actually release them in another country.This is a problem, because while Trump may be able to convince the average US racist that any brown skinned Spanish speaker is \\"Mexican\\", the nation of Mexico isn't going to accept millions of people unless the US can actually prove they are Mexican citizens and follow at least some processes for moving them. And unless the Mexican government cooperates to at least some extent,  anyone Trump deports can just come back. So there would have to be some mutually acceptable practice to do this -- you simply can't deport millions of people to a country that isn't willing to accept them.So people waiting to be deported are going to pile up much faster than people actually end up getting deported. Which will lead to prisons, camps, and people who spend long but indeterminate amounts of time in a state where they haven't really been \\"convicted\\" of anything, but aren't free to go anywhere.So in practice, I think this \\"deportation\\" plan is mostly going to be an \\"expansion of permanent mass incarceration\\" plan...which appears to be what private prison companies are figuring as well, considering how happy they are.And the US already uses prison labor for all kinds of things -- manufacturing, call centers, fighting fires, etc.Also, Trump is talking about establishing crippling tariffs, so companies won't want to import stuff made via cheap slave labor overseas.So how about if they just create a pool of cheap slave labor right here in the US?And *that* is where I'm afraid this is going. This isn't going to actually lead to mass deportation so much as the functional enslavement of millions more people as prison laborers, who will then continue to do the jobs undocumented immigrants have been doing but for even *less*.Think about it -- a company currently employing undocumented immigrants for a small amount of money can simply turn them in to the Trump administration, earn a Presidential attaboy, and then simply rent the laborer of the immigrants they turned in for even *less* than they were paying them before. It's win-win for everyone except the immigrants, who become slaves.And that is going to become the absolute worst kind of problem: a constant stream of horrors inflicted on people by a powerful and organized system incentived to keep inflicting and worsening those horrors.And the worst part is that this isn't some new thing -- it is merely a continuation of what has been happening for our entire lives, except they are adding some more people to the list. This system can easily be expanded and adjusted in incremental, organized ways by regular people who don't agree with it but whose career success involves doing it well enough to earn a bonus and promotion.Fascism has been described as \\"colonialism brought home\\", and that is exactly what this is: the US is colonizing itself (or rather, continuing to colonize itself, because once again: none of this stuff is actually new, so much as just a continuation and expansion of existing horrors we grew used to).","title":"Trumps border tsar vows to override states who block mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Yup.

Grassroots wont forget this.However, Mr Scott is seen as a long-shot candidate to succeed Mr McConnell and attempts to browbeat senators appear to be backfiring.The campaign is ping off senators whose votes Rick needs, a Republican Senate aide told Politico. Senators do not take kindly to having an army of social media trolls attack them.Nevertheless, Mr Cornyn and Mr Thune have been at pains not to isolate the Trump-aligned wing of the party, particularly in the?[wake of his election victory](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-us-election-white-house-kamala-harris/).None of the candidates have pushed back against Mr Trumps recent appeal for powers to make administration appointments without seeking Senate confirmation.Any Republican senator seeking the coveted leadership position in the United States Senate must agree to recess appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner, the president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled immediately!**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/trump-loyalists-face-battle-senators-rick-scott/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/trump-loyalists-face-battle-senators-rick-scott/)","title":"Trump loyalists face battle to win over ped off Republican senators"},{"text":"People who voted for Trump regardless of race deserve whats coming and I hope they are the ones that they come for first","title":"Trump Announces Tom Homan as His Pick for U.S. Border Czar"},{"text":"The US has absolutely deported US citizens wrongly in the past, so expect it again.","title":"Trump border czar says administration will conduct workplace immigration raids"},{"text":"They were being sarcastic.

And make sure you visibly take credit for them (put your name on the checks!) then people will give you credit.The issue is that these policies may be extremely popular with the public (polling on caps on credit card interest and mandating employer coverage are big winners) but are extremely unpopular with economists and educated media types, so you'd take a big hit with massively negative media coverage.

I don't think Miller is gonna do that. Miller is gonna go full-on military mass deportations. It's going to be terrible and cause a lot of human misery.

The factory was simply a few slaughtering plants, rendering plants, feed plants, and in the surrounding area, chicken houses.  These chicken houses were owned by chicken farmers, and they were paid by the chicken company to raise the birds.  Around 1978, the chicken producer was having trouble finding workers to work in the plants.  The plants were staffed with mostly black workers, the white force left in the 50's for better jobs.  The same thing was being repeated in the 1970's with the black workers leaving and finding better jobs.The chicken producer/company then went to the state capitol and actuality handed out cash to the legislature as \\"gifts\\" (was in all the papers at the time) and wouldn't you know it, he/they were able to import some workers from Mexico.The first arrivals were soon followed by undocumented workers as word spread about jobs.  The local people didn't like it.  Old run-down motels became apartment houses with several families living together.  Several trailer parks were put south and west of town to help absorb the new population.  You began hearing made-up stories about these people, accused of all kinds of things.  The pet eating thing is not new folks.   The raids started after the first couple of years.  Two, maybe three times a year.  They would round up 40-50 people each time and take them back to Mexico.  A week or two later, the workers would be back.  The revolving cost was their burden, and it ate into any savings they had.As time went on, these people had children.  Those children are U.S. citizens.  Those children grew up and had more children.  Our area started being called \\"Little Mexico\\".But something started changing for our area.  The county next to us lost a major industry and has never recovered.  This happened in the 1980's.  Another bordering county was an agriculture-based economy with a great number of dairy's.  Today, 95% of those dairies are gone.  Each county that surrounds us is almost like it was 40 years ago.Not ours.  In 1975, there was one Mexican restaurant in the city.  Today, I can't count them all, there's so many.  Along with that, from one end to the other of town, there are countless businesses.  All around us is decay and slow growth, but not here.  Why?I know why.  You still hear people go on about the Latino population in our area, but they're the reason our area is doing so well. As far as who they supported in the election, our county was the only one in the area that no one won.  Every county around us was red.  We were grey because the non-voters number was higher than the number of votes that any candidate got.  I've heard from several sources that tensions are high in the Latino community and people are worried.  They've seen it before.","title":"Trump border czar says administration will conduct workplace immigration raids"},{"text":"Perfectly fine. Jan 6th hasn't rolled around just yet.

We can break this down further with the illuminati, perhaps reptilians, perhaps Satan and the return of christ, revelations. But not to be dogmatic, and to keep the conversation grounded, Because some of that can get deep and it branches a thousand different ways,  we'll talk about the nwo.It's easy to see how the the great depression lead to the banking system we have today.  That influence got all over our politics and media, we can see this by who owns what.  Intelligence agencies got developed, and these were used for nefarious purposes and sometimes this got exposed.  Thus leading to Jfk, 911, and other conspiracies resulting in a lack of trust for the people with alphabet corps. So it's obvious to some the gop and dnc, the big ol oil and rare earth, sometimes drugs, war machine America is has an obvious selfish evil financial agenda, propagated by the banks, who want to consolidate that power into a one world government.  Depopulation, censorship, and classism are some of the largest concerns, and they have the money and power to support and create terrorism and propaganda. So in support of trump being the opposition to this nwo, he's current cabinet and rhetoric is anti-establishment.  Rfk is cleaning up the fda, musk is protecting free speech. \\nMusk also doesn't want a one world government, it will derail getting to Mars, and that's really all he wants to do, so hes personal reason is enough for me to trust he's not in cahoots with the gates types.All three of these guys have also been villianized by the media with a lot at stake, that could be seen as double agency, but I think at a core people are selfish and dont want to be destroyed, which a lot of scandals are being unraveled because of all this, it seems.  They're class traitors, abandoned by the left they once were in support of.  For us, the serfs, we don't have much say in it all, but we need people like trump, musk, Bernie, that either want to fuck the system, fight for their freedom, or fight for our prosperity.  They have the money, they're in the position to do something about it, we know atleast of the dnc alternative.Keep an open mind, find your God, have a laugh.

It worked. Clinton was extremely  popular and elected twice in spite of impeachment. Of course he then gave us NAFTA, Republicans wouldn't fund the services to help decimated communities, and the great discontent began.  (To  be fair -  Clinton also raised taxes and gave us a surplus  , which Bush ~~spent~~ pissed away on hunting for nonexistent WMD.) The great discontent brought us Trump. And it can be said that trump was elected by a majority not because Harris wasn't focused on the working class enough, but because she wasn't right wing anti immigrant working class enough. This, along with being tough on crime , was the type of policy that gave Clinton the Whitehouse - Everyone remembers that in 1986, President Ronald Reagan passed an amnesty law. But what most people dont know is that in 1996  fresh off the heels of signing welfare reform, and two years after signing the crime bill  President Bill Clinton signed a bill that overhauled immigration enforcement in the US and laid the groundwork for the massive deportation machine that exists today.Both welfare reform and the crime bills Clinton signed have been relitigated during a contentious Democratic primary, but the 1996 immigration bill  the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act  hasnt.There was no single provision of the 1996 law that was as dramatic as the 1986 amnesty law, signed by President Reagan, which is why he gets credit for the last major immigration reform. But the 96 law essentially invented immigration enforcement as we know it today  where deportation is a constant and plausible threat to millions of immigrants.It got easier to deport people.?Immigrants convicted of crimes werent the only ones stripped of the ability to argue their case before a judge before getting deported. So did anyone apprehended within 100 miles of the border. And IIRIRA required the government to hold more immigrants in detention before deporting them  making it substantially harder for them to get lawyers.The change to the law was so drastic that after a high-profile deportation of an immigrant over a minor crime led to public outcry, Republican members of Congress  including the lead author of IIRIRA  wrote the Clinton administration asking them to back down.https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11515132/iirira-clinton-immigration","title":"Donald Trump has promised a closed border and mass deportations.

So in aggregate, you'd get outcomes for candidates where they swept like 60% of the vote, because they'd pull their half from those emotional coin-flippers for a baseline 30%, but make an excellent case to the informed, for another 30%.Nowadays, you're talking about 90-ish% of the voting population being driven by emotion, with smaller and smaller numbers of informed voters taking part, so all of these appeals to reason, logic, policy, etc. fall completely flat, and you've now got to raise the odds of getting those emotional voters on your side, and we've seen a lot more political race results coming to 49:51 as compared to the past.So, from that perspective this whole 'polarization' problem comes down to the fact that there are far fewer informed voters able to swing these races heavily in one direction or another, leaving us with hordes of people who will switch political positions on a dime, based on the latest, most emotionally charged thing they heard about that week.","title":"AOC Directly Addresses People Who Voted For Both Her And Trump"},{"text":"Harris/Trump is as close as you get to Good/Evil in politics.

Theyre going to make it hard for us, Mr Homan told Fox News on Monday.A suggestion: if youre not going to help us, get the hell out of the way for were going to do it.So, if we cant get assistance from New York City, we may have to double the number of agents we send to New York City because were going to do the job. Were going to do the job without you or with you.Mr Homan, the architect of Mr Trumps controversial policy of separating migrant children from their families, suggested that local police should help with deportations. Law enforcement should work with law enforcement, he said.It comes after NBC News reported last month that Mr Trump was considering pressuring local law enforcement to join in immigration raids by threatening to withhold grants.Mr Homan said the administration would maintain asylum seekers rights to see a judge but the courts final decision needed to be enforced.If the judges order doesnt mean anything, then shut down immigration court, take the Border Patrol off the border if theres no consequences violating the laws of this country, he said.It came as Mr Trump, the president-elect, also named his long-time adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.Mr Miller was a senior adviser in Mr Trumps first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Mr Trumps move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018.Mr Miller has also helped craft many of Mr Trumps hard-line speeches, and was often the public face of those policies during Mr Trumps first term in office and during his campaigns.Since leaving the White House, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organisation of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.Read more from The Telegraph: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/donald-trump-appoints-tom-homan-border-czar/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/11/donald-trump-appoints-tom-homan-border-czar/)","title":"Trumps border tsar vows to override states who block mass deportation plans"},{"text":"Youre saying its a bad idea to take my illegal family to a country that regularly deport illegals?

And even though all three GOP senators seeking to become majority leader quickly entertained Trumps terms, they would likely find those limitations to be risky in practice.The biggest hurdle to Trumps hopes: Taking the recesses that are required to even make a recess appointment. For years now, senators in both parties have scheduled short pro forma legislative sessions every few days in order to block presidents from making recess appointments. The Supreme Court found in 2014 that the Senate must be out of session for 10 days for a president to make recess appointments.So if Republicans wanted to scrap the short sessions or recess as soon as Trump takes office in January and open the door to recess appointments, they would have to accept a 10-plus-day delay to any progress on Trumps first-100-days agenda.Not to mention that there are several pitfalls involved in even trying to recess the Senate for an appointment to avoid the confirmation process. While it takes only a simple majority vote to recess, Democrats could offer amendments to any recess resolution, effectively creating an indefinite delay. Republicans could stop that, but theyd need 60 votes C meaning more than a half-dozen Democratic supporters.Republicans could also try to shut down Democrats objections by changing precedent for Senate recesses, a smaller-scale version of the nuclear option that both parties have employed to weaken the filibuster in the past. That would almost certainly invite Democrats to exploit any changes the GOP makes next year as soon as they manage to retake power.Trump has another unprecedented option if he wants to rely on recess appointments: He could try to use his constitutional power to force an adjournment. He threatened to do just that in 2020 during the pandemic, as the Senate stayed away from Washington for weeks, but ultimately begged off. That approach would likely invite legal challenges.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/11/2024/why-trumps-bid-to-muscle-his-picks-through-a-republican-senate-could-backfire?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Why Trumps bid to muscle his picks through a Republican Senate could backfire"},{"text":"Honestly, what a weird name for a podcast too...Like, are they telling me I should call her (my) daddy?

Maybe it's too late now but it seems so obvious to me and our Democratic party won't ever let us try having a truly populist and progressive candidate. The big donors and polished centrists are the problem. It doesn't matter what Kamala is actually saying she will do, it's about how it feels.

Gotta defund those swamp monsters and downsize their budget while we're at it. Small government is better.Result: govt departments are under-funded, make up their budget deficits with funding from private interests and commercial partnerships. More corruption and inefficiency ensues as the likes of Pfizer and Moderna basically \\"regulate\\" themselves through their \\"partnerships\\" with the likes of the FDA.Blue team says: oh no, corruption and greed is rampaging through unregulated markets.

More regulation and bigger government is either a good or a necessary evil.

More money gets spent but you get even less for it. Meanwhile small and innovative new businesses can't compete against the established giants who have the govt contracts all sewn up.

In terms of direct funding for the running of NATO, [the US provides 15%](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm#direct), the exact same amount as Germany. If you mean the US spends a bigger part of its GDP on its own military than everyone else, that's also wrong. The US spends 3.37%, whereas Poland spends 4.12% and Estonia 3.43%, with the overwhelming majority of member countries spending above the agreed 2% goal. I suppose you mean the US spends more in *absolute numbers* on its military than all the other NATO members combined. While that's true, all of that is money that the US government spends *within the United States* on American-produced weaponry and equipment as well as *its own* active personnel and veterans. None of that money goes to other countries, and crucially, only a tiny, *tiny* fraction of that is earmarked for the defence of Europe and Canada. In 2023, the budget allocated to the European Deterrence Initiative that funds the US European Command was 4 billion dollars, less than half a percent of your trillion dollar heavy defence budget. If you want to reduce your military spending, that's completely up to you guys. Good luck with that, but not standing by your European allies won't even make a dent. The military-industrial complex in the US is a major part of the economy and provides jobs across the country, often in areas that don't otherwise have much industry going, very often in deep red states that will fight tooth and nail if you close down those factories. Every billion dollars that you take away from your defence budget is a billion dollars missing from the American GDP and ultimately, American workers. Secondly, I appreciate that your view of our 75-year-old defensive alliance is entirely transactional and you don't care about soppy concepts such as loyalty, integrity or honour, but there are good transactional reasons not to throw your toys out of the cot as well. See, nobody is forcing you to spend that much money if you don't want (again, you're spending it on yourself, not anyone else), but if you reduce your global footprint that also means the rest of us will have to look to alternative means to finance our security needs and we'll obviously not buy American weapons systems in that case. That means we'll have to divert larger proportions of our GDPs towards our domestic arms industry than now, which is money that could have otherwise been spent on all kinds of American goods and services. And frankly, if we do end up as the victim of Russian aggression because the US unilaterally decides to pull out of NATO that will also have an effect on your export industry. Europe buys half a trillion dollars worth of goods from the US every year. That won't be happening if we're kind of busy dodging Russian bombs. Nobody, absolutely nobody, says that America shouldn't look after its citizens and veterans. The world famously already pities you for not having a decent social net for your citizens. And it'd be great if you finally diverted some money from your armed forces to a decent universal healthcare system or care for your sick or elderly or to alleviate childhood poverty. Frankly, that should have happened well before you bought shit like your *11th aircraft carrier*. You don't need those and never did - the rest of the world combined only has 9. But it doesn't need to be a black-or-white affair, nor does it have to happen in one go while we're in the middle of a shooting war. Any sensible country would sit down with the rest of us and would work out a transition plan. You'd think that being the only country that ever invoked Article 5 would mean something to the United States, or the thousands of NATO personnel that fought and died alongside American servicemen and women through the last 8 decades. But even if none of that matters, pulling out of NATO (or more worryingly. making your commitment dependent on how your President feels on any given day) is irresponsible and ultimately counterproductive for the United States as well.","title":"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer plots to thwart Donald Trump on Ukraine"},{"text":"Oh, so Putin isnt scared of Trump as Ive been hearing for nearly 4 years now?

Here's an example:We have a Fictional county called PORTLANDIA. PORTLANDIA has 100 registered voters. There's a presidential election between NIXON and JFK. I'm a operative paid to help JFK win. I know that usually turnout is about 50%, and the county is evenly split between NIXON supporters and JFK supporters. At FULL turnout it *should* look like this:NIXON: 50 Votes (potentially)  \\nJFK: 50 Votes (potentially)So what I do is I prepare 50 JFK ballots. When the votes are counted election night, as long as the total is below 100, I add my JFK ballots to hit (not exceed, which would look suspicious) that 100 total. So if after polls close the total looks like this:NIXON: 27 Votes  \\nJFK: 23 Votes   \\nTOTAL: 50 VotesThen I dump 40-50 JFK ballots into the mix, thus helping him win the county and inflating his overall vote totals.  This is, btw, the strategy used in deep Blue counties to this day, which is why they push so hard to register everyone. Not everyone *will* show up, but it gives you a higher number to dump ballots into.But let's say NIXON is extremely popular this year, and not only does he win his base, but he swings some JFK voters. JFK's voters aren't as energized, so they're going to come out but in average numbers:NIXON: 72 Votes  \\nJFK: 23 Votes  \\nTOTAL: 95 VotesThis is a high turnout election! It gives me, the sneaky Democrat operative, only 5 ballots to play with. I can put them in, of course, but it doesn't really dent NIXON's number and he still wins the county.

There wasn't anything fancy, we got married in a library, filed the paperwork, and then went to go get lunch at a german restaurant. I personally think that you don't NEED justification to want/not want people at your wedding.However I do see a couple issues with your justification of not wanting to invite these people:1. You are potentially inviting these people but telling them not to show up depending on how they voted. You're putting the action on them not to show up instead of yourself to not invite them. That seems very dirty and most people are going to see it as that. You have no way to enforce this so it just seems preformative. Anyone who wants to go but voted red can just show up anyways. Are you going to lead a witchhunt?2. You are also setting a standard that you may have issue with in the future. Uncle Bob having a cookout? Well sorry but y'all aren't invited due to potentially voting blue. Turns out he's a firm believer in the 2nd amendment and you voted for the party that platforms on taking away those rights. Are you ready for them to play the same game with you?3. Your fiance has stated that this will cause him a lot of drama. If you both were on the same page this would be easy but you're not. It really depends on what you're willing to put him through vs what you're willing to put yourself through. It sucks sure, but that's life. If this is that important that you absolutely need to stand your ground then he should understand, but at the same time you should understand that this can cause him social, emotional, and family drama that can for quite a while. Also depending on how close he is to his family, that drama may be doubled by how much it hurts him to do something like that.\\n \\nDespite my earlier statement, I'm on your fiance's side. It's easy to make this decision when you're not the one paying the higher price, especially if he is super close with his family. It seems to me like he would be paying for your decision with a lifetime of drama and hurt family feelings while you would be paying for one night where if you were actually excited to get married you really wouldn't think about anything else.But hey, if it really is that rough y'all can always elope.

You have as many conservatives running around killing Americans invisibly while cities also burn.Everything was fucked.","title":"I want to break stuff: Rage room bookings increase after Trump wins election"},{"text":"I am atheist. I am female. I am white. According to these three factors combined, Im a shoo-in for the Democrats. This is insulting. I live in the Midwest. Most of my family are blue collar. I dont have a college degree. I have worked in retail and service and done the shitty jobs that most everyday folks do at some point in their lives. I think we need to take a strict line at the border and stop the flow of illegal immigration immediately. I am pro-choice and pro-union. I consider myself more libertarian than anything else, but I agree with conservatives on a fair amount of things. Like most other folks in the United States, I cannot be slotted neatly into one demographic or another.?For the last decade or so I have heard sweeping generalizations made about folks who live in flyover country, folks who pray, folks who arent college educated, folks who work with their hands, folks who are concerned about unchecked immigration, and on and on. These people have been called everything under the sun, from racist to ignorant to garbage to Nazis. Are some of them racist? Sure. Ignorant? Sure. Those exist in every demographic. Just as many of them are *not* racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. This vast swath of Americans of every background has been summed up and dismissed perfunctorily by a group who champion themselves as the definition of tolerance. Accurate or not, and aided and abetted by the media, this divide has been sharply painted as between urban and rural, coastal cities and middle America, educated and non-educated (whatever that might mean).?As I live in middle America, naturally I would identify as someone from there. But then I hear that, since I am a woman, I absolutely must identify with any female candidate, no matter what I think of them as a person. The assumption that I will vote a certain way, by virtue of having a vagina, is grossly insulting. It reduces me to my reproductive parts (ironically, something that conservatives are accused of doing all the time in the endless abortion debate). Further, I hear that any non-Christian would be out of their minds to vote for someone who wants to install a theocracy day one and send women back to the kitchen, perpetually barefoot and pregnant, without a voice and without a vote. What Where is the evidence for this? Did this happen last time Trump was in office? Yes, Roe v. Wade was overturned. *And the issue was returned back to the states.* I am pro-choice; I believe it should be between a woman and her doctor. I believe life begins at conception. I dont think I could ever personally get an abortion, even if I were raped. But I dont believe I have any right to interfere in another womans right to that decision, right or wrong. But, I also understand the pro-life contigents assertion that it is murder, and they have a valid right to that opinion. I dont think the abortion debate will ever be settled. But I also dont see any evidence that Trump plans to take any further action on abortion. Returning it to the states was, I feel, a valid compromise on something that is highly contentious and divisive.?Most of all, though, I have taken extreme umbrage at the constant assault in the news and on social media against this mythical image of the racist, hateful, sexist, homophobic, ignorant, everyday American. Sometimes they throw in buzzwords like *redneck, hillbilly, trailer, farmer, flag-waving, boomer, uneducated, simple,* and more. Again, whether its accurate or not, this generalization comes down from on high from academia, Hollywood, the Beltway, hell, even liberal talk shows, from folks who dont live in this world and dont know anyone out here. Theres an underlying smugness in their discourse that makes my skin crawl. I realize this is media-driven, and I admit in real life many of the folks in my circle who vote liberal and Democrat are kind, open-minded people who have no more in common with this elitist minority than I do. No doubt this holds true for most Americans.?I lived in a trailer as a child. I wave the flag proudly. My parents were boomers who in many ways fit the boomer stereotype and, in just as many ways, defied it. I dont pretend to know the first thing about economics. I am also atheist and have very little in common with my avidly religious neighbors and several of my friends. I try to convince friends and acquaintances through reasoned discussion to see why gay and trans folks must have equal rights and protections under the law, understanding that this change does not occur overnight. From my outsider view in the religious sense, I pity the innocents in Gaza but support Israel in its survival quest to root out Hamas.?Where does Trump come in? I dont worship the guy. Hes not a god. Hes not the best candidate to ever have lived. Of course not. But I saw how he acted on the world stage in his first term. Leaders may not have liked him, but they respected him (or what he could do). In this time of global unrest, we *must* have a strong, confident leader at the helm to protect our civilians. I listened to Harris talk, and could not imagine her holding her own among intelligent and devious leaders around the globe. I am convinced had Harris won, we would be embroiled in WW3 within a year. She simply did not have the respect or the backbone to back up what she said.?TL;DR:? Harris was unacceptable as a candidate for leader of a superpower. Trump is not perfect, but I have no reason to believe he is all that they say in the liberal media. But most of all, I am sick and tired of my vote being assumed because of my demographics and reproductive parts.

And it could have worked, at least for us in the US, *if our social safety net had been expanded at the same time*. That was always supposed to be the other half of the Globalization coin. Its what happen in basically all other wealthy western nations. But Republicans fought tooth and nail to prevent any meaningful social contract. So it didnt happen. And what we got was end stage Capitalism, or as I like to call it, Crony Capitalism. And thats exactly what MAGA supports. They not only dont want any expansion of the social safety net, they want to dismantle it entirely. The only thing they will keep is the military industrial complex. MAGA is the essence of neoliberalism. They are going to privatize *everything*-schools, the prison system that isnt already privatized, water, energy, and anything else you can think of that is controlled by the State or Feds.

Worse still many of those promises will undermine Republicans and Centrist districts more then they will harm liberal districts.So now this is the last Presidential term before we lead into the ever important redistricting period in 2030 which will be incredibly difficult for Republicans to control the process if the lose the swing states and impossible to control if the economy tanks and they open up even more swing states and districts.In reality Republicans barely won the election with a very slim majority in about 80 house seats and if we are looking at the senate about 20 of the current Senate seats could be lost by 2032. There is always another election and Republicans have been seeing a general downward trend line of support for decades now. They really can't afford another economic fuck up like 2008 and yet Trumps policy agenda is likely to cause just that and likely before midterm elections.Worse still for Republicans is that Trump has sucked all the oxygen out of the party leaving very little in terms of rising stars for the next Presidential election. This is bad news given that in all likelihood Trump is going to face a Financial crisis and banking crisis, a social crisis, a political crisis, a constitutional crisis and a geopolitical crisis in his term most of it of Trumps own making. So Republicans will have an awful lot of explaining to do and all those swing voters that move towards the GOP they are going to swing back to the Democrats come mid terms and beyond depending on how badly Trump fucks everything up and with the ambitious goals Trump has the fuck is likely to be monumental.Reality is the GOP if they don't grow a pair and learn to tell Trump to fuck right off they will see their party collapse especially if we end up in another 1930s style depression.

They won in 2020, the GOP massively underperformed in 2022, and democrats saved almost every senate swing senate seat outside of PA. How on earth is the US government so almost evenly divided despite democrats horrible positions? How did the GOP go from have 25 trifectas vs 7 trifectas for the democrats in 2016, to the democrats getting 17 trifectas? Its because, despite having terrible policies, they are running against a very unpopular GOP.The issue in 2028 isnt if Dems go full Bernie or not. Because if they do, the GOP will continue to win regardless of whos on the ticket. The issue is will democrats go back to what made Obama/Clinton won? Tough on crime, border, and policies that dont lead to inflation. If Democrats go with Andy Beshear, Wes Moore, Josh Shapiro, or Ned Lemomt, while the GOP continues MAGA with someone like Vivek, Doug Mastriano, Kari Lake, or even Don Jr., theyll get crushed.I get that real wages are stagnant and the current millennials/Gen Z are the first generation that might be worse off than their parents. I get that the average age of a first time home-owner is now 8-10 years higher and that many people feel the need to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. I get that guys in particular are feeling that they are being left behind in an economy that no longer values traditional masculinity (which are overwhelmingly good values). I dont know the answers to those issues, but I dont believe that Trump is the answer to them.The answer is less immigration and less wokeness.

The entire global monetary order is based on the premise that the US plays the role of a consumer with an unlimited credit card who guarantees that the rest of the world always has someone to sell to. This arrangement is largely responsible for the huge demand for US dollars globally, which is what allows the US to run such huge deficits. If you unwind this, if the US suddenly decides it would rather stop acting like the ultimate consumer and start acting like a seller instead, which is the goal of the tariffs, demand for dollars will collapse, and it seems unlikely that the already fragile banking system, which for half a century has designed itself around the assumption of the current paradigm, can handle said transition.On top of that, we are undergoing a massive period of change into a post-AI world that promises to have profound implications for the very nature of 21st-century economics. With all of this uncertainty, crypto effectively moves from the high-risk asset it would be in a certain world, to a hedge in an uncertain world. It only makes sense that as we transition into the digital age that one would want to hold some digital assets, and that as we transition from the US world order to one in which US dominance is in doubt, one would want to hold at least some assets that are borderless and global in nature.Add a cherry on top of a pro-crypto administration, which would represent a dramatic pivot from the anti-crypto policies of the previous administration. It is a bit of a no-brainer.","title":"Bitcoin jumps to record as Trumps election turbocharges cryptocurrencies"},{"text":"I expect that West Texas billionaire Tim Dunn will be pleased.ProPublica - [A Pair of Billionaire Preachers Built the Most Powerful Political Machine in Texas.
