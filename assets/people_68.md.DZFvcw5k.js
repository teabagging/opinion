Fascists always need a victim from whom to take away rights in order to normalize removing rights. Then they move on to removing rights from other groups. If they successfully take over the government, they suspend civil rights for everyone. Taking away womens' rights is merely a means to an end.The psychiatrists who examined the 22 or so Nazis on trial at Nuremberg asked them why they targeted the Jews. Twenty of them said it was  a way to achieve the goal of taking over the government. They actual thought the Jews were no different than anyone else. A lot of them had Jewish friends, (at least until the Nazis started targeting Jews). *They said if targeting the Jews had not worked, they would have targeted some other group.* Only 2 of the Nazis firmly believed their own anti-Jewish propaganda. The point is that Trump, MAGA and the GOP are just your common garden variety fascists, doing what fascists do in an attempt to overthrow democracy. According to Jason Stanley's book, How Fascism Works, fascists always behave the exact same way no matter what country they are in or what decade they are in. They are almost comically predictable, as if there is some universal fascist to do list out there on how to turn a democracy into a fascist dictatorship.

Cuba took some refugees, but the other countries said no; one Canadian official was reportedly asked how many Jewish refugees would be too much, and he replied \\"none is too many.\\" In the end, the vast majority were forced to return to Europe, and a significant number were murdered in the hholocaust.

It was found that these methods (particularly the firing squads) were too personal, and it was very demoralizing for most participants.

Then I read something on my homepage from Bucks County saying how they can be the deciding factor to the election and it was a lib saying they need to protect womens bodies. Then I saw a link with Trumps campaign filing a lawsuit against Bucks County for all the mail-in ballots.Hmmm maybe I should get off Reddit for a couple days? We know this is TDS Central that will ban you if you say one nice thing about Trump or one bad thing about Kamala to accuse you of hate speech. I was on the NY Post which is pro-Trump and its stating Trump is leading in all the swing states. Im completely confused whats going on? Is he winning in Pennsylvania or losing in it?I checked my Bovada to see whats Trumps odds to win. A few days ago, I remember it was -200. Yesterday, its at -180. Today, its -130. Something is up. Now if he does lose Pennsylvania, he can still get to 270 by winning Georgia (16), Arizona (11), and either Michigan (16) or Wisconsin (10) if he wins all the states he won in 2020. He doesnt need to win Nevada if he can win 3 of the 4 states aforementioned.In 2020, Trump got 232 electoral votes. But since the changes to the number of votes in 14 states this year, he would have 235 if he won all the states he won in 2020. The magic number to flip a blue state to red is getting 35.Pennsylvania (19) + Georgia (16) = 35Georgia (16) + Arizona (11) + Michigan (15) = 42Georgia (16) + Arizona (11) + Wisconsin (10) = 37If Trump loses all three in PA, MI, and WIGeorgia (16) + Arizona (11) + Nevada (6) = 33Then must flip a blue district red in Nebraska or Maine to at least get it into a tie at 269-269. Those districts in those two states can make all the difference. Trump did win all 5 electoral votes in Nebraska in 2016 but then lost 1 electoral vote in 2020 because Omaha voted blue. Even 1 electoral vote can make the biggest difference in this election.What Im hoping on Tuesday is the Republicans who support Trump can create the scene in Avengers: Endgame. Instead of on your left, its on your right. Everyone starts showing up. I know the actors for those movies are all endorsing Kamala but we need to be like that. Lines and lines of Trump supporters start showing up.We got lives, remember? Jobs. Careers. Families to feed. Most of the early voters are from unemployed liberal losers living off welfare who have plenty of spare time to post on Reddit. Let all the garbage people show up. Police officers, firemen, military, priests, let them all show up supporting Trump.Heres a great comment from the NY Post. Its not really an election between two candidates..Lets be real - this election does not involve people voting for Trump or voting for Harris. Its people voting for Trump and people voting against Trump. Hes effectively the only candidate. No one is voting FOR Harris.Exactly. Nobody is voting FOR Kamala. When overpaid entertainers like LeDiddy Blames says hes endorsing Kamala, its more like saying NO to Trump. Its basically a Yes or No survey if you want Trump to be President again or not. Kamala is not a real candidate to anyone on both sides.[https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/donald-trump-erases-deficit-against-kamala-harris-in-final-pre-election-post-poll/](https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/donald-trump-erases-deficit-against-kamala-harris-in-final-pre-election-post-poll/)![gif](giphy|6aPBWbCwAOv9krAUTZ)","title":"Is Trump gonna win or what"},{"text":"It has to do with the timing:because it came just two days before election day, within the seven-day window the FCC gives campaigns to request equal time.","title":"NBC Gives Donald Trump Equal Time for Kamala Harris SNL Sketch"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],j={key:0},F={key:1};function R(t,a,e,c,r,n){const m=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=s("div",{class:"top-banner"},[s("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[s("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),s("div",D,[(i(!0),o(b,null,v(n.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(i(),k(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,L)):T("",!0)])}const B=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-fd47b761"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/68.md","filePath":"people/68.md"}'),G={name:"people/68.md"},K=Object.assign(G,{setup(t){return(a,e)=>(i(),o("div",null,[u(B)]))}});export{E as __pageData,K as default};
