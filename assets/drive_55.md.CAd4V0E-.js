He campaigned as someone who believed there was no red or blue America, no black and white America, but that we were one. As a half black person who was raised by white and Asian parents and grandparents he was a good spokesman for that perspective. There was huge hope that his election was a chance to put race behind us.Yet when race stuff happened during his presidency, Gates, Gray, Martin, Brown etc , his rhetoric and reaction was not to tamp down the outrage and calm people down. Instead he took them as an opportunity to lecture about racism. People blame Obama for throwing away a time when there was hope for less divisiveness around race.\\nSecondly neither Obama nor his conservative opponents divided the country. America was already divided. George W Bush ran on being a uniter and not a divider after the acrimony of the Clinton years. George H W Bush promised a kinder and gentler country after the controversial terms of Reagan , Carter promised a return to decency after Nixon.

And she was up against a well known competitor called Joe Biden, whom made the Democratic party come together with his more moderate and collaborative platform. She was a newbie, so most people didn't really know her, and she was overshadowed by Biden.But the last 3+ years she's been a stable VP and hasn't had too many controversies. This put her on the national spotlight, people got to know her more and got comfortable with her. She became more of a \\"household name\\", and she also got all of the accolades of Biden attached to her, as she is in the Administration. Just the same as how Biden got all the accolades of being attached to Obama during his administration.Next, it is clear Biden is cooked. He is old as fuck and clearly showing obvious signs of sunsetting and dementia... The left tried to hide it because he was in charge and they didn't want to rock the boat... but Biden did the correct thing and stepped down from the candidacy for the upcoming election. This meant the left had to SCRAMBLE for a Biden replacement... and who was there literally attached to Biden, but younger and coherent and ambitious and wanted the candidacy? Yep, Kamala Harris was right there. So she is basically \\"I'll be like Biden but with actual mental capacity\\" and that instantly won over the left who was already rolling with Biden and his platform.Finally, look at her opponent. Many people are \\"rah rah\\" for Harris not because she's great... she really isn't... But she isn't as bad as Trump. For many people, that's enough to go rah rah for her. She doesn't need to be great, she just needs to be better than Trump.

As a western-Pennsylvanian, I can tell you most people in my community are staunchly against socialized healthcare if only because they've been told to be. No amount of explaining simple economics works, they simply do not care. polling suggests that a near super majority of voters, 63%, in fact, want it.And what have we learned about major elections in the United States? The simple majority is meaningless because realistically that's not how an election is decided once you account for gerrymandering and the Electoral College. We also know many people responding to polls and surveys probably won't actually vote. When will we stop chasing donor dollars and start doing what is right for the majority of American's who desire it?Probably when elections are publicly-funded, because the Americans who desire things aren't able or willing to fund national campaigns. Also, when the fairness in media doctrines are reinstated, because the Americans who *need* things are conditioned to oppose them, let alone desire them. How do we force change without some form of direct democracy where we get past the representative layer that fights for campaign dollars versus the will of the people?Little by little, and by starting with compromise to build a position of strength. I mean, look at the Republican playbook, they played the long-game and chipped away at America's culture and societal norms until they had enough of a foothold that the party could just start imposing its will. Luckily (hopefully) it appears they've played their hand a little too early and they're getting some pushback, but it will take a long time to swing the pendulum back the other way.Look, this kind of opinion bubbles up every election cycle. It shouldn't be a surprise when a politician has to dial back their platform to appeal to a broader audience. It happens all the time, and it has to happen to get your foot in the door.I wouldn't even call this \\"flip-flopping\\" either. It's a good thing when a politician can change their views on a subject after they've had a chance to review facts/research and talk to the public about it. While this particular move might not be in the direction us progressives like, it's pretty clearly being done to help guarantee a victory.You making this post in bad faith by implying she is trying to bait-and-switch voters just hurts her chances, and by extension, the chances of ever getting M4A or anything like it. The fact of the matter is, what 63% of people say in a poll or survey is very irrelevant because those people aren't all voting and those people aren't being represented through the lens of political districts and Electoral College proportions. If you want M4A, you should probably stop poisoning the well and increasing the odds of Trump being elected, because there's no better way to kill the chances of M4A than getting Trump elected again.","title":"Kristen Welker / Bernie Sanders Interview: Kamala has flipped her stance on Universal Healthcare"},{"text":"SHREK??

I understand I have never been even around someone who had to get it, its crazy stressful being pregnant and abortion was the answer. I think Trumps view of leaving it to the states is fine. Because I think the broader point is there shouldnt be unwanted pregnancies that need abortions in the first place. Maybe we focus on stopping the rapes and incest etc etc, the main reasons people feel abortions should just be purely legal and even a right. I couldnt even argue you know the fringe cases of late term elective, obviously it doesnt happen often at all, but at some point, that fetus is a life. I dont like thinking the kids life is automatically gonna suck or whatever in either foster care, or such. If anything, more reasons for places that have tighter abortion bans to at least offer better foster services that can be well managed and even subsidized. Like having waiting families ready after the delivery.My friend was on the side of no, its just a right, your body your choice but ooof the air was heated after that. Took us a bit to come down from it.Theres no real reason to blame anyone specifically, its just broadly rhetoric. I dont think this way specifically because of any Republican talking points, felt this way since I ever first discussing the topic. It is a life, and it deserves some level of protection. I dont like how the counter arguments just deny the life, often it feels like using fetus or its not a life because it wasnt born are just coping. At least admit you are indeed killing something.

People dont go to her rallies. Theres no reason to go. And the people that do go, shes busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she cant talk about that. People dont leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. Thats because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. Were a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, whats going on here, youre going to end up in World War 3, just to go into another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at whats happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns dont want to talk  not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns dont want to talk about it because theyre so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, theyre eating the dogs. The people that came in. Theyre eating the cats. Theyre eating  theyre eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is whats happening in our country. And its a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far  the reason they go is they like what I say. They want to bring our country back. They want to make America great again. Its a very simple phrase. Make America great again. Shes destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesnt have a chance of success. Not only success.

That though has to be the biggest lie that was spoken by the republicans' mouths. We all know that Obama never really divided the country in the first place because he delivered America out of the recession in 2008 and turned the economy that was messed up by Bush into a haven for the country. Obama was in charge when we exited the Great Recession, yes.  Was he the reason?  Hard to say.  His stimulus package spent a lot of money and [didn't meet its own projections] (http://static8.businessinsider.com/image/4e91f51feab8ea606f00000d/unemployment-rate-obama-stimulus.jpg), and his explosion in spending was only halted by House Republicans.  For as much as the Republicans are blamed for not being cooperative, much of the tone was set [by Obama] (https://www.politico.com/story/2009/01/obama-to-gop-i-won-017862): President Obama listened to Republican gripes about his stimulus package during a meeting with congressional leaders Friday morning - but he also left no doubt about whos in charge of these negotiations. I won, Obama noted matter-of-factly, according to sources familiar with the conversation. The exchange arose as top House and Senate Republicans expressed concern to the president about the amount of spending in the package. They also raised red flags about a refundable tax credit that returns money to those who dont pay income taxes, the sources said. You can like Obama, and you can think he was a good president.  That doesn't allow for space to come up with wild theories regarding Republican motivations or incorrect assertions about economic or political outcomes.\\n The motive for the conservatives was that they were ticked off by the fact that an intelligent African-American that had a squeaky-clean record had dare to won the presidency twice back in 2008 and 2012 and that drove them into a rage. What is your evidence for this claim?  That would go a long way toward refuting you. Obama was a remarkable president that have served our country with the love and respect that he gave to the American peopleMany would argue that Obama was an overrated president who talked down to the people he governed and became wholly ineffectual the moment he had to make an effort to compromise with the other side of the aisle.  You don't need to be a racist to believe it. he was unfairly demonized by the racist conservative republicans who wanted to regress America back to the Jim Crow eraIf anything, Obama got off easy relative to his job performance.  The idea that there are \\"racist conservative republicans who wanted to regress America back to the Jim Crow era\\" is unsupported and untrue, but there were enough negatives in his tenure as president to make it so one doesn't need to be an unrepentant racist to point them out.The alleged divisions in the United States long pre-date Obama.  We could point to the Democratic House in 2005, we could point to the Republican efforts to impeach Bill Clinton, we could point to the treatment of Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork during their SCOTUS confirmation hearings.  We could go all the way back to the 1960s and JFK/RFK's use of regulatory enforcement measures against their political opponents.  There's no one answer, and, more importantly, there's no evidence to support the idea that Obama received some sort of outsized amount of criticism nor that the criticism was at all driven by racial animus.","title":"CMV: Obama didnt divided America, it was the racist conservative republicans that divided the country."},{"text":"I'm amazed that James Comer isn't announcing a criminal investigation into David Muir and Linsey Davis yet.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 11, 2024 - 55 days until election day!"},{"text":"Has any media outlet mentioned they kept letting Trump have the last word on almost every topic?","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 7 (Post-Debate Thread)"},{"text":"No wonder bots are trying to take this down..","title":"Kamala Harris is clearly wearing Nova H1 earrings during the Trump debate.

One of the main drivers is a spat between President Masisi and former President Ian Khama, son of Seretse Khama. I don't know enough about Botswana to comment. I made this thread in hopes that some Batswana will be attracted here to give us their perspective.Here is a comment from a few days ago by someone from Botswana, u/[AbrocomaChemical8693](https://www.reddit.com/user/AbrocomaChemical8693/):The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is performing poorly in governance. Often, discussions within this subreddit and broader conversations about Botswana tend to present an overly optimistic view of the country's reality, which can be frustrating. However, this perception is understandable, as things might appear positive on the surface.Regarding Seretse Khama, there exists a prevailing narrative that Botswana transitioned from being one of the poorest countries in the world to having one of the highest GDP per capita on the continent. However, this narrative obscures the deeper issues of high unemployment and income inequality that reveal a much bleaker picture behind this fa?ade of success. While it is true that Botswana has made significant progress since gaining independence in 1966, this success has been overwhelmingly concentrated in a single sector of the economy.The mining sector, despite accounting for?[86% of the countrys exports](https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/bwa/all/show/2022), only employs?[2% of the total workforce](https://www.sundaystandard.info/botswana-mining-sector-struggles-to-exceed-5-employment/?amp=). This, coupled with the fact that the government is by far the largest employer, followed by a weak private sector, has left Botswana with a high unemployment rate of 28%, a youth unemployment rate of 38%, and a staggering 41% of young people classified as \\"Not in Education, Employment, or Training\\" (NEET). These indicators have shown increasing trends year-to-date, according to?[recent statistics](https://www.statsbots.org.bw/sites/default/files/Quarterly%20Multi%20-Topic%20Survey%20Labour%20Force%20Module%20Quarter%201%202024.pdf). The core issue in Botswana is the extreme concentration of wealth, which explains the country's Gini coefficient of?[53.3, one of the highest in the world](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/botswana/overview). This wealth is predominantly controlled by individuals of foreign descent, mainly of Indian origin. In fact, in a country where 96% of the population is of African descent, only one individual makes it to the?[Top 15 list of the richest people owning stocks on the Botswana Stock Exchange](https://thepatriot.co.bw/the-15-richest-people-on-the-bse-in-2023/amp/)?(ranked at #9).Moreover, two of the wealthiest individuals are key financial supporters of the BDP, providing the party with substantial financial resources, whereas the opposition is left to rely on personal contributions and member donations, leading to an uneven political playing field. In the context of democracy, the 2024 V-Dem Democracy Indices indicate that Botswana has experienced significant democratic backsliding over the past decade, reaching its lowest scores to date. The indices now classify Botswana as an electoral democracy existing in a 'grey zone' between electoral democracy and electoral autocracy. Additionally, Botswana lost its status as a \\"liberal democracy\\" in 2021, with significant declines in its liberal, participatory, and deliberative democratic components ([V-Dem Democracy Report 2024, p. 14, 16, 21, 28](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/44/v-dem_dr2024_highres.pdf)).The outgoing parliament is on the verge of passing a draconian bill that will further consolidate what political scientists term an \\"executive dictatorship,\\" in which the executive branch stifles dissent within the parliamentary party, rendering parliament effectively irrelevanta situation that has long been the case in Botswana. The legendary Kenneth Good previously described Botswana as an authoritarian liberal state?[(Good, Kenneth (1996-01)](https://doi.org/10.1080/02589009608729580), but this new legislation exacerbates the issue by increasing the number of specially-elected Members of Parliament from 6 to 10, effectively giving the BDP an additional 10 seats beyond those it would have won in general elections. This move has been widely criticized by civil society and various sectors of society, yet it is sadly expected to proceed before the dissolution of parliament, anticipated next Friday.So yeah, pretty bleak, if you have any questions please feel free to ask ?.","title":"What You Need To Know About Botswanas Elections Expected To Take Place In October This Year"},{"text":"In the post that you are responding to it says there are no reports of people eating pets in springfield, and then further states:\\"In a case that some were confusing with Springfield, police in Canton, Ohio, 175 miles northeast of Springfield, recently charged a woman with cruelty to companion animals for allegedly killing and eating a cat in a neighborhood in front of multiple people, according to USA Today.\\"It sounds like your tweet is the one in Canton.","title":"ABC is a disgrace to news reporting"},{"text":"But it will impact your wallet","title":"ABC is a disgrace to news reporting"},{"text":"They literally did a horrible job of fact-checking him and allowed him to get the last word throughout the entire debate.

Non-stop videos trying to create a misleading image to push a story is constantly happening. All we know is JD Vance (who started this story) said its likely false and the fact that journalists would love to cover the story if there was actual evidence of it happening. Ultimately, we have a presidential candidate and VP candidate that sees something on social media/TV and/or hear second hand news from non-credible people and believe it.

IMO this is (one of) the biggest factors that opened the door to Trump being able to win in 2016.It took a full eight years for unemployment to drop to 2007 levels, and it was only until 2016 that real median household incomes recovered. And those are country-wide stats. Many places (which then voted for Trump) have never recovered.Now, I'm not saying this is all Obama's fault. Clinton signed NAFTA, and lax banking policy is the fault of multiple administrations. But that being said, there are many people whose lives did not improve during Obama's term. These material conditions opened the door for conservatives to use their culture war issues as a wedge.Also, how do you account that many states that voted for Obama in '08 are now very red, such as Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and almost Missouri? Did a bunch of previously non-racist people suddenly become racist? Were they racist all along but just didn't like John McCain?**I'm not saying racism doesn't play a factor in the division in the US.** It plays a huge factor.

The chart's line showed a healthy and steady climb, and Trump supporters were asked to point to on the map when they thought Trump took office.  Most pointed to the bottom of the graph at the beginning of the steady economic climb. However, that particular point on the graph was when Obama took office after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  The point where Trump took office was nearly at the very top of the line's apex. The exercise showed that Trump's supporters only watch Fox News and don't read beyond the headlines and that Trump is no economic genius but rather someone who took over a very healthy and growing economy then distorted the facts to his followers and took credit for the red hot economy.","title":"Kamala Harris Killed It.

Removing roughly 5% of our workforce and most of our ag workers would not only result in massive productivity and tax revenue losses, we would also see massive price increases from grocery items based in the US due to the labor shock.I wish Harris had more robust policy proposals but let's make it clear - Trump **WILL** ruin the economy for the average American.","title":"Kamala Harris Just Destroyed Donald Trump in the Debate"},{"text":"Pinged AFRICA ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20AFRICA&amp;message=subscribe%20AFRICA) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20AFRICA&amp;message=unsubscribe%20AFRICA) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=AFRICA&amp;count=5))Pinged ELECTIONS ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20ELECTIONS&amp;message=subscribe%20ELECTIONS) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20ELECTIONS&amp;message=unsubscribe%20ELECTIONS) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=ELECTIONS&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"What You Need To Know About Botswanas Elections Expected To Take Place In October This Year"},{"text":"I think its over.

If you can do mail in then do it as soon as possible and then follow up to insure that your vote was received and most important accepted/certified. In the meantime talk to that mother, father, aunt, uncle, bil, etc and show them what Trump will do to their lives. Put together a coherent written list of trump lies and deceptions that trump has used in his speeches and show your loved ones the deceptions along with the sources.

All of these policies are there to directly help the people that are struggling to buy food. I also feel like our 'terrible economy' is a manufactured scare tactic. There are houses selling in my area for double and triple what they were ten years ago when I purchased. I don't understand how we have such a horrible economy when people are willingly spending the money on over inflated housing and vehicle prices. Realistically people need to look at their own finances and live within their means. If that means shopping at the discount grocery store instead of Whole Foods, so be it.

Having said that, there are celebrities in every generation who have enough of a fervent fan base that their endorsement can be a potential scale tipper, and this generation's celebrity that likely fits that bill is Swift. Her endorsement might actually push tens of thousands, maybe over a hundred thousand people who otherwise were not going to vote or were undecided/voting third party to instead vote for Harris.

Game over."},{"text":"Unless these people stop consuming massive amounts of right wing propaganda theres very little that can  be done to address them via mental health services. Source, Im a mental health and addiction therapist. Ive had a lot of maga clients and theres very little to nothing than can be done to help them mentally and emotionally until they live in reality all issues cant accurately and clinically be identified, treated, or diagnosed. I could go on for hours about the major obstacles maga clients cause in therapy. I try to start small with just learning about identifying emotions (primary &amp; secondary) and processing them to build regulation skills. However, its impossible to gain any traction in sessions when they live in an alternate universe they created from all the disinformation they consume and spread. Also critical to do this as most maga people are very angry and dont realize that theres a lot of emotions that lead to that anger. Anger is a secondary emotion and if they can be open to learning and processing more about the anger iceberg activity then they can make real progress but sadly they are the most challenging clients to have ngl. Sometimes it presents as though theyre having a psychotic episode and we have to screen for hallucinations/delusions etc but as you may imagine thats tricky when the entire maga mentality is rooted in delusions, distortions, and mistruths that they will never budge on. \\nI can much more easily work with and have productive sessions with a client who has schizophrenia or  having a psychotic episode. However, The total rigidity and rejection of any critical thinking or processing within the maga delusions is staggering and makes it impossible to \\n make meaningful progress. This is ofc not the case for all of my maga clients  but sadly it is for many. Sorry for the rant. People always mention mental health and I feel it may be worth sharing my experience irl with maga in therapy.","title":"I escaped the MAGA cult. My family still support Trump.

Current nonfunctional immigration:* Common sense says if a malefactor is not in the country the crime will not be committed. It's like if you keep the ice off your sidewalk no one will slip and fall on it.\\n* Background checks are not thorough. They can lie about their identities which is nearly impossible for Immigration to check with some countries and some countries refuse to participate at all (and that is used by some to gain entry). E.G. government DNA testing found 30% of immigrants identifying as family units were fake. Piles of discarded passports have been found at the border. If they say they are from an uncooperative country what does Immigration do? There is little to no tracking once they enter the country. We have no idea of who they are or where they really come from. How many lies need to be layered on before you become suspicious?\\n* Sponsors are not properly vetted, meaning immigrants can be brought in for illegal purposes, expanding the networks of criminal activity.\\n*  There are hundreds of thousands of got-aways who cross without any challenge. When someone walks across the desert because they might be stopped at a border crossing and turned back what are the odds you don't want them in your neighborhood?\\n* At Administration direction 'questionable' immigrants are allowed to enter. E.G. the 31 on the terrorist watch-list  who have been either granted bond or asylum by immigration judges.   Simple fix? Rather than letting millions in then sorting out over 5-10-20 years who is entitled to stay, stop the flow at the border, Use the standards for legal immigration: thorough vetting and proof of credible fear or satisfy basic the criteria in the law.

But one thing that caught my attention, among other things, is that you don't like religion. Jesus didn't either. His word was not meant to be traditionalized and trivialized by legalism. (Being extremely strict on what you can or can't do) Jesus spoke against his own religion and called out their hypocritical practices. There is strong evidence that Jesus did exist and plenty of evidence of what he actually said. There is no evidence of alien teachings or even a shred of proof that said evidence is being hidden. A big reason for me personally is that I know Jesus. You can too, he is the only God in any religion that comes down to meet you now and dwells in you on earth. Because of that, I know he wouldn't allow anyone to alter his message to us. No alien or hidden teachings, even the gnostic gospels are another trick from Satan.Another thing to consider, if you wont seek the truth of Jesus directly, seek our enemy. If you wont believe in Jesus, find the evidence of Satan because he is much easier to find. Satan has become so bold nowadays it's literally impossible NOT to see him working. In the Bible it says, in the last days, Good will become evil, and evil good. Being a Christian or even Muslim or Jew, you get labeled brainwashed, or too dumb to understand science. You get called a loser for not having sex before marriage or even not having sex before 21. Smoking weed or popping Xanax is highly accepted, as is being gay or doing abortion. We celebrate today what would be called evil back then. And with the new age movement, we encourage people to engage in witchcraft by doing astral projection, manifestation rituals, making moon water, using crystals for protection/healing etc. All that stuff is used by high ranking warlocks that astral project to go cast curses on people they don't like. Ask yourself why so many people on power and the famous celebrities all leave hints that they worship Satan. There's a million pictures of celebrities throwing up 666 hand sign or are covering one eye. The symbolism to Satan is everywhere.","title":"The conspiracy of god"},{"text":"I mean.

Don't let the name confuse you!US liberalism is the view in favor of civil rights and equality for everyone, organized labor to give a voice to working people, and support for small business and a free press. It usually lives on the left for obvious reasons, and coexists fairly compatibly with progressivism (the pursuit of social justice).Neoliberalism uses the older sense of the word \\"liberal\\" referring to free markets, and is a corporatist economic doctrine which pursues deregulation, market oligopolies and monopolies, and wealth redistribution to the rich. The goal is to allow people with money to do anything they want with their money with very little government regulation or taxation to slow them down. Neoliberal doctrine says that letting the rich get richer will also cause everyone else to become better off due to trickle-down economics, i.e. rich people putting more money into the economy through business ventures.The US Republican Party is entirely neoliberal. The US Democratic Party was neoliberal from the late 1980s through the mid 2010s, and has since been steadily moving away from neoliberalism due to its obvious failures.Only the Democratic Party is regular old liberal (civil rights, equality, free press, etc.).

Its honestly great and I think its clever to expand on it. I think everyone should have access to it. I  also didnt understand all the fuss over private pay insurance alongside it if someone chose that because wouldnt that still be an option just as it is with regular Medicare? Just As is picking your plan and what you want to pay out of pocket (like if you want to pay more for a PPO vs HMO) just like any other plan but much, much more affordable. I also get a small over the counter pharmacy allowance which would solve the issue of helping pay for things like pads, tampons vitamins, hygiene products and condoms for low income folks. I think its fantastic personally but I dont know if the average younger person would know all this, sadly. But I think calling it MCFA also debunks the myths that it would be like the universal health care in certain other countries where wait times to be seen by a doctor are extremely long because we are already set up for a large amount of Medicare patients here. So another good point there on calling it MCFA.I am disappointed Kamala backed away from supporting it and instead wants to expand on the marketplace insurance subsidies as I do not believe insurance should be tired to our employer and people who get insurance through work are usually not eligible.  People making above a certain amount are also not eligible and that amount isnt much these days, especially if you have no dependents. Its also expensive and the insurance companies are profiting off of it.

All of that is predicated on the implicit nature of a social contract. The Constitution is explicit.When going off of the philosophy or reus's social contract the, what gives the gov. The authority to make a constitution and govern is the implicit acceptance of the social contract by the gov and governed, no?Evidence?The supreme court did not see cases which challenged Roe v Wade until there was a conservative majority/super majority on the supreme court. The supreme court is given positions in a partisan way (which is relatively new ik but regardless it is the state of afairs.) The court is highly politicized these days from gaining a justice seat to ruling on a case.Why? You have presented no legal argument about that. How, specifically, was Dobbs incorrect as a matter of law? OP is discussing law, not policy.Law is the cousin of policy, they are so close that most states would ban a marriage.No one is talking about revoking the Commerce Clause. To the extent that people are talking about enforcing it as written/intended, you present only policy justifications. You appear to admit that your position is legally baseless. There is legal basis. Which is why it was fought over in court and eventually made. There is legal basis because the supreme court made it so. The supreme court made it so because it is their constitutional power, just as going back on it is. Stripping the argument to purely legal bleaches it and leads to this. Legal systems are NOTHING without policy. Nothing is more useless than a legal system with no policy basis, because it cannot exist. Even monarchs have policy which allows them to create legal systems. The US legal system allows the court to interpret, they did on Roe v Wade, and then they went back on it. There is the discussion without policy being part of the conversation. I cannot give you a college lecture on why such a complex case is valid or invalid and if I could OP (and me right now for that matter) could literally never ever comprehend it without a professor listening to us read it aloud. Calling anything I said \\"complex\\" is an own-goal.I was talking in the future tense, not past tense.I'm not passionate; I'm bored. You seem pressed, which is fine, but I'm not interested in a debate with emotional investmentI am not implying passion in a strictly emotional getting into an argument sense. I am saying passion in that you have a passion for constitutional law and enjoy/like/prefer to use legal terms which you may assume I am unfamiliar with.","title":"CMV: It actually makes more sense, from a Constitutional point of view, for abortion to be up to the states (as a pro-choice person)."},{"text":"Not rape anyone?","title":"What has Kamala Harris done in the past 4 years to make you all so excited to see her as the next president?"},{"text":"Spot on.","title":"What has Kamala Harris done in the past 4 years to make you all so excited to see her as the next president?"},{"text":"Beyond not being Trump, theres nothing exciting about her.","title":"What has Kamala Harris done in the past 4 years to make you all so excited to see her as the next president?"},{"text":"Wait, this is the Financial Times writing this??Whoof that's gotta sting for ol' Donnie","title":"Kamala Harris has the measure of Donald Trump: The vice-president won the debate and shut down lingering fears of her inadequacy for the fight ahead"},{"text":"Shes been a prosecutor, State Ag and senator and VP.
