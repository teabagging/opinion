The government supports and invests in thousands of private-sector projects that need qualified workers and labourers. Taking a sledgehammer to infrastructure and maintenance projects means fewer jobs for people working in construction, engineering, and manufacturing, as well as any working-class jobs downstream of those such as in catering, cleaning, retail, healthcare and hospitality. Tens of millions of people are directly or indirectly reliant on the continuing functioning of those governmental structures whether they work directly for the government or not. Neither Musk nor Ramaswamy have the necessary background to be put in charge of that.

You can't just go around randomly pulling out bricks and expect that the entire Jenga tower won't collapse on you. If you \\"break things\\" in Silicon Valley you at worst have a few hundred software developers directly affected who will have to look elsewhere, probably locally. If you break things on a national scale, those people don't have anywhere to go. You can't expect a junior plumber in Alabama to move across half the country to get a job in North Dakota, especially not if there are North Dakotan plumbers streaming in the other direction because there are also no jobs up there. I know Musk has already said that Americans should prepare themselves for hardship (that on its own, coming from an oligarch who is entirely shielded from the fallout, should be a massive red flag), but I don't think people appreciate how hard the hardship will be for them personally if Musk gets it wrong, and obviously judging by how he's handled Twitter, signs aren't great that he's got any idea what he's doing.

This is the most shameful fucking thing to ever happen to this country in the modern era.**EDIT**: I want to just clarify, and ammend my language here. When I say \\"enemy,\\" what I mean is they are considered our geopolitical opposition. What that means is, China's goals, like taking over Taiwan, are antithetical or in conflict with America's goals, which is preventing Taiwan from being annexed. We are talking general policy. It doesn't mean we will inevitably end up in conflict with them. This is what diplomacy is for - continually negotiating policy agendas for nations in ways that don't lead to conflict or harm or loss of life.I make this change because I got a fairly low effort comment: China my enemy lol while everything you wear a d buy is Chinese hahahhahaha get a lifeNow, it's simply a matter of fact that both the US and China consider themselves in opposition to one another on many issues. They are considered a geopolitical rival to the US. But this doesn't mean \\"china is my enemy.\\" I do not think like that, and my wording was wrong.

Neither the networks or that man deserve my time.There are good commentators, certainly, but somehow, some way, the keepers of the keys for political broadcasts have got to understand that Trump was re-elected in part because of their non-stop years-long toadying coverage portraying him as a normal Republican candidate in a normal political horserace and holding him and Harris to entirely different standards. While there was some recent increased coverage of his mental decline and unfitness for the office, it was far too little, far too late.When everything is breaking news, eventually nothing ends up being breaking news.  Every outrage covered in exhaustive detail, on repeat for days. Attempts at accountability were weak and timid and scarce. It all contributed to the non stop firehose of crazy to which weve all become inured, and again, if everything is an outrage, eventually nothing is an outrage. WHICH. WAS. HIS. PLAN. I can only hope viewership continues to decline across the board until the oligarch class feels it in their wallets, since thats clearly all they care about or are motivated by.  Im sure the right wing establishment and their gullible consumers are currently in full-on gloating mode. Uncaring or unaware that Trump wants nothing more than to dismantle democracy, enrich himself, and avoid legal accountability until he runs out the clock on his dark, vile, small, selfish, unrepentant, unredeemable life.The only bright lining that I can see going forward is that he will not be able to restrain his darkest impulses, so the fallout will be swift and should be rightly laid entirely at his feet.  His lapdogs will spend the next four years trying to explain away disastrous policies, events and the consequences of his increasingly addled behavior. I wish them all the luck they deserve.As for his supporters, may every policy they promote with the intention of hurting others be turned back upon them.  Any policy good enough to punish people they hate should be equally applied to them and the people they love. I will remain informed via a variety of non-profit print and media entities.

This would be an optimal time for both profit and potential damage. He didnt release it during the 2020 election. Why would he not want to kill Trumps chances of re-election? Did he have a crystal ball that told him Trump would run again in the future? The obvious answer is he did not have this tape until AI became available. Why is it audio only?

And it's American tax payer funded bombs being dropped on me, by my own government. I don't make enough to pay taxes but my family and loved ones stateside do lol.\\nI hold out hope that one day we'll appropriately value human life.And yet, so do I. Even in the middle of this. So do I. To me, it's really simple. Nothing is more precious than protecting people, and hel-ping them flourish and live out their best possible lives.Carl Sagan put it a bit better though I think:Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. I voted for Harris-Walz becausea) I have learned to not fall for the regular disinformation it seems many Trump voters fall forb) more importantly, I fucking care about democracy independent of where I happen to bec) how actually absurd is our timeline that the people getting bombs dropped on them (i.e.,, people like me) and those like us (arab muslims,  lebanese americans,  some black people, some hispanic people) thought that the most racist spiteful childish selfish hateful grifting treasonous American in our generation is actually better for them? lol. I swear, it feels like I am losing my mind living here, nad the war doesn't, um, help. I no longer expect to be here when we reach that day though.Oh yeah, no way you and I are here when we as humans get there. But we will get there.I personally have to believe so in order to act so, and also one way to make sure we never get there is to never act. So, to me, again, it's simple. If I survive this war here in Lebanon, I'll keep fighting for democratic ideals (democratic change, here in Lebanon, that's a way's away)  here in Lebanon and definitely stateside.I\\\\m just so very disappointed in citizens of both my nations. For decades we had so much power, but we just let bad people take over and do bad things.I'm also so very sad for them too, because I also understand  politics is no where that simple and the republicans spend decades getting us to this point (and so did the billionaire class).It's just so crazy to be part of one nation where my vote literally never mattered for anything (I'm late age millennial, and I got to vote in Lebanon *twice* in my life lol. They just either don't hold elections, or postpone them unilaterally defying the constitution lol).If MAGA wants to do that to the U.S. of A. then let them have at it. Because I know many of us aren't going anywhere, and *we* won't stop our fight.The work has just begun, because right now it's states and the American people that are the last line of defense in protection of democracy.I am not being hyperbolic.I am from, also, a place where there is no democracy but only promises of one that quickly turned into essentially warlord-rule/oligarchy/feudalism or whatever the fuck term may be most applicable lol.Here's a toast to Americans who believe in our inalienable rights  that applies to all the peoples that just happen to be on American soil, but more importantly, for these ideals that extend way beyond our tiny little country in the grand scheme of our species' history. Like iI said, I  too hope one day we''lll value human life -  all human life, everywhere.","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.

Hegseths affiliation with the group raised alarms among veterans groups when Trump, in his first term, was weighing whether to nominate Hegseth for Veterans Affairs secretary.During the first Trump administration, Hegseth played a pivotal role in several episodes in which Trump inserted himself in the military justice system in order to grant clemency to troops convicted of war crimes.Hegseth?helped capture Trumps attention on a military case?that led, in 2019, to?full pardons?for former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance and Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, both convicted of war crimes.

Maybe youre right, but just because somethings in the constitution doesnt mean itll protect us from SCOTUS.Im not particularly well-educated on any of this, but I was thinking about it earlier today and heres a likely scenario if Trump decides to run for a third term. Hed wait until after the midterms to announce to avoid tanking the GOP with the news. Then, he addresses the nation and declares his historic, very powerful, candidacy for a third term. Immediately, all oxygen is sucked out of cable news for months while everyone on both sides of the aisle wrings their hands about legal minutia and why he cant do that. Meanwhile, nobody actually does anything meaningful to stop him. The Right will fall in line behind dear leader and the Left will do what they (we) always do, get overconfident in the power of norms and laws to protect us. Democrats run another milquetoast corporatist to oppose, because Trump cant actually run again, so in their minds running an eligible candidate is just a formality. Eventually, likely after it would be too late for Republicans to find a new nominee (an intentional choice by the DNC), someone files a legal challenge to the candidacy, and SCOTUS is forced to rule on it. They find some obscure law from the Salem witch trials that allows them to conveniently redefine the text of the constitution. All the while, Trump has been campaigning relentlessly and democrats have been ignoring it. The third run becomes legal in a 6-3 decision along party lines and Trump wins the election. Again.","title":"Transcript: Trumps Angry New Threats Hint Darkly at Whats Coming"},{"text":"How are they going to slash the budget and put forth their war on immigration which is to cost billions?

Other trades simply found loopholes or clauses to get out of supporting them.  Now, at a company with several unions, a number of them have the company clearance to furlough their own members without notice/pay to make it cheaper and more impactful to try and bust another union in the company.  \\n  \\nAnd plenty of unions have \\"that guy\\", the one who thinks his particular role and seniority is the just right mix and he is actually superior to his brothers and is upset that get to benefit from the union just as he does.  \\"That guy\\" also loathes *other* unions and their workers.

But the article is creating their own narrative from those numbers. Seeing the number of upvotes and people believing this, it worked.Google stopped revealing the exact number of searches a search query gets since people were abusing it for SEO spam. The second best alternative is to look at Google Trends which gives you a snapshot on how popular a search term is. If you look at the trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=How%20To%20Change%20My%20Vote&amp;hl=en), people have been searching this term somewhat regularly for whatever reason over the last 12 months. Realistically, that number is very, very small. So when a larger (although still small) number of people search the same term, a 700% increase sounds like a lot more than it is.This is similar to the articles saying how people were searching 'Did Joe Biden Drop Out' on election day. The charts that went viral on Reddit were from a 7 days snapshot. If you look at the same search on a 12 month snapshot (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=did%20joe%20biden%20drop%20out&amp;hl=en), it technically increased, but not as high as Reddit would have you believe.Take things shared on social media with a grain of salt.","title":"Wait...

Its more of a two-way door as opposed one door as you described - so Ill describe the other half. I wouldnt say there are worthless degrees either; the person pursuing the degree is a primary factor in this consideration. When discussing education with my daughters I tell them hey, I can show you and teach the ins-and-outs of a car, ride along with you on your first drive, but ultimately youre going to be handed the keys and will need to drive. There is a difference between learning and doing enough to pass a class (or even pursue a degree). Ive interacted with a lot of folks that arent interested in learning. I use to tutor back in the day when I was in school - even engineers (Physics was one of my degrees). I distinctly remember two students one semester. They needed help with Intro to Physics with Calc. The upcoming quiz was concerning elevators and describing/calculating forces. One of the students wanted to learn. They understood when I took the exercise down a pathway of envisioning yourself in a moving elevator and what do you feel - turning those thoughts into calculations. They were critically thinking about it. The other student, just wanted me to tell them exactly what they needed to know to pass the quiz. I can show them how to think critically (as professors and many classes do in college), but the students need to want to learn it. Im Gen X, so I grew up in the need to go to college if you want to have any chance messaging. So, yes, a lot of folks tried college - and the costs kept going up and up. But I wouldnt blame the professors for kids not wanting to learn, a lot of kids (not all and for years) just saw and see college as a path to a supposed bigger paycheck as opposed to learning. Plus its not the professors setting rhetoric standards. Ive interacted with a lot of professors that were frustrated with lower standards so to speak.

On tariffs, Epstein writes, \\"Trumps official position is that sellers from foreign nations would happily pay the entrance free to lucrative American markets, but he assumes that as the price of business goes up, the volume of business wont go down. The actual consequences will prove to be far more dangerous. Imports will dwindle, resulting in higher prices and consumer losses. The tariff will be incorporated into the price of goods, so that foreign importers will pass some portion of the tax forward to American consumers. American producers will have to pay extra to buy imports that are essential to fabricating their own exports, whose prices go up and whose quality goes down. Other nations will rise to the bait, so that retaliation will infect multiple markets, which could lead to worldwide losses from which everyone loses.\\"Epstein also shares his position on how the Trump administration can restore an important norm for the rule of law in the administration of federal Boards of Visitors, by not firing Biden appointees to those bodies.","title":"Dangers of the Trump Transition"},{"text":"The apprentice: white house edition.","title":"Trump taps Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary"},{"text":"For the sake of our troops, I sure fucking hope so...","title":"Trump picks Pete Hegseth to serve as Secretary of Defense"},{"text":"Absolutely Expected,Absolutely Ridiculous.

In agriculture, itd mean fewer hands to pick crops, causing higher grocery prices and even potential shortages in stores. But it wouldnt stop there, construction and housing costs would spike as well since a big part of that workforce is undocumented, and were already in a housing crunch.Economically, removing so many workers could be like another recession, impacting spending, retail, and restaurant jobs nationwide. A large scale deportation would remove a critical workforce segment, causing GDP to fall, potentially comparable to the 2008 Great Recession. As undocumented workers leave, consumer spending would decrease, and millions of other jobs linked to these sectors could vanish, especially in areas like hospitality, manufacturing, and retail.Socially, deporting millions would affect about 4.4 million American kids who could lose one or both parents, overwhelming foster care and social services. Also, fewer undocumented workers would be around to report workplace abuses, likely giving rise to unsafe conditions in labor-intensive sectors like meatpacking.

But Netanyahu is the one who insists on the war as it keeps him in power.?Israel is tiny. Despite forcing everyone to do serve two years in the IDF, they still dont have the numbers. Palestine/Hamas gets help from all over the Middle East.?Now I know Netanyahu can stop the war, or at least reduce it, but everything right now has been accelerating and all the agreements and talks have failed. Even Kushner tried to help but he failed. Kushner also did not get a seat in Trumps administration. That should be concerning for Israel as its expected that Trump will side with Saudi Arabia on the issue. (Fun fact,Saudi Arabia funded 9/11)Then you have to look at the big picture. Trump has historically said he wants to help Israel. But his actions have provoked this entire war to begin with. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem which is right on the border of Palestine and Israel. Its also a holy city to all three major religions so its bound to cause controversy. He also killed an Iranian general. Obama made leaps in progress with Iran and Trump undid that in a minute.

Why do I say this? Purely based on [historical data](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-donald-trumps-net-worth-2014-2024/)2014 - 2016: His net worth increased $600 million.2016 - 2019 (pre pandemic): His networth plunged by $1.5 billion2020: Hit net worth plunges another billion (feel free to attribute this to covid)2023: His network is still down by $1.5 billion and heis no longer in Forbes 400 list.Only reason he has shot up now was due to the TMTG ($DJT) shares. You can argue that launching TMTG is a \\"grift\\" and while its easy to dismantle that argument if you look into the definition of grift and how much people like Obama, Pelosi etc have enriched themselves during office, we don't even need to argue about this because even after his election victory the shares bounced up a little but settled down into the same range as before. BTW, lot of us, including myself, made insane money on $DJT because of its constant up and down cycles, by buying under $10 and selling about $20. So if \\"grifting\\" is supposed to enrich the people he is grifting, please, let him grift even more !As for all the other things you call \\"grifts\\" - I assume NFTs and what not, they are just like adding pennies to his net worth, and no those wont make a difference to him whether he is in politics or not. he MAGA base wont be happy with it, but thats the nuclear optionIf you think anyone around him will survive after this \\"nuclear option\\" you greatly under-estimate MAGA.

The demographics that vote change. But it has more to do with who moves where. Trump hit his peak during his presidency. A lot of people saw through Trump and maybe there's a tiny amount of people that changed their minds but party voters are usually very partisan. I believe this election was more partisan than it was full of different types of voters. But I do think that the economy and the genocide is what did it for Harris because look at all the swing states that basically voted blue down ballot. I think that as long as the national democrats don't put forth even the bare minimum of a centrist them they wont be able to consistently win elections. But it is a fact that younger populations are voting less red. I don't exactly praise that because ofc I'm a Marxist but it only makes sense that younger voters want less regressive social policies and well the democrats basically offer mildly leftist social policies but economically they are not that different in outcomes from the republicans. Regulations are good but I mean look at all the other rest of the terrible things that have happened under Biden. We've seen record numbers of mega mergers. The same happened under Trump but we've seen a peak of capitalist consolidating under Biden because people are too busy pretending like its the other side rather than just capitalism and the two capitalist parties.","title":"Exist polls show voters think Kamala is too left wing compare to trump."},{"text":"This is what I said about her after she endorsed Bernie and the years thereafter and I was met with pretty rough backlash even though now it's plain to see for everyone:I liked her coming out for Bernie and all, but I wouldn't want her as the nominee. If you look at her history she isn't consistently progressive and she has a *whole* lot of dirt..Before being elected to Congress, she [led the opposition to gay marriage equality](http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Feb/20/ln/ln09a.html) in the state legislature to the point of actually holding signs and protesting.Progressive Punch has a progressive score based on Crucial Votes, basically a \\"where were you when we needed you\\" vote, for instance all roll call votes where the margin between yes votes and no votes was narrow and could have been changed by a small group of Democrats voting differently. *Tulsi Gabbard scores an F.* Now if you're thinking \\"Hey wait a minute, back in school an F was pretty bad...\\" You're right. An F is very bad. In fact, she ranks at at 143 out of 188 Democrats. What's more, out of all the Democrats with F scores only one has a bluer district. Her opponent Angela Aulani Kaaihue took only 18.9% of the vote and didn't report raising or spending any money at all. In comparison Tulsi spent $1,068,459 of the $2,060,649 she raised. So it's not like she has to vote with right-wingers because her constituents are so right-wing. She has one of the most liberal districts in the country. She has no electoral excuse for voting with the GOP so much - and she does.She clashed with Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the DNC, quit in a big public row and endorsed Bernie, even though their records are not remotely similar. Democrats in Hawaii laughed when Berniebots, grateful for her support but ignorant of her politics, started promoting her as a progressive.She was actually one of Fox's go-to Congresswomen guests for bashing President Obama using GOP talking points. I can't really think of any other so-called progressive doing something like that. She's really friendly with a Republican billionaire named Sheldon Adelson too. But that barely scratches the surface of her sketchy friends. Remember when she was on the news awhile back supposedly for a job interview in the Trump administration? Her pal Steve Bannon arranged for her to meet with Trump. He reached out to her, not vice versa. He loves Tulsi Gabbard and wants to work with her on everything. Bannon was drawn to her when she began publicly excoriating the Obama administration over its plan to defeat ISIL.Tulsi was raised in a politically powerful household. Her father, Mike Gabbard, is a well-known firebrand in Hawaiian politics - his most beloved issue is a virulent rejection of homosexuality and gay rights. Like I mentioned earlier, the younger Gabbard protested against a bill advocating civil unions during her tenure in the Hawaii Congress, holding up signs decrying the proposition. The bill eventually stalled.Gabbard replied to a request for comment on her fathers connections with cult leader Chris Butler (more below) in 2004 with an oddly worded email accusing Honolulu Magazine of a homosexual conspiratorial attempt to discredit her father: I smell a skunk, [Gabbard] wrote. Its clear to me that youre acting as a conduit for the Honolulu Weekly and other homosexual extremist supporters of Ed Case.This political position held until 2012, when she made an about face and declared she supported gay rights-- just in time for the election for Hawaiis 2nd District. And that wasnt the first time she had shed a piece of her past in order to make herself more palatable to voters.Gabbards first marriage, to a man named Eduardo Tamayo, lasted from 2002 to 2006. Tamayo and Gabbard were both involved with a man named Chris Butler, the leader of a Hare Krishna spinoff called the Science of Identity Foundation that is located in Honolulu County.The Hawaii Free Press notes that a number of Butler-connected Hawaiians have contributed to Gabbard and that her involvement with the cult is still an open question.Gabbard has scrubbed all mention of her past with Butlers cult, and with Tamayo, from the internet. The only evidence that is publicly available that Tamayo and Gabbard even know each other-- excepting her Wikipedia page-- is from anti-cult site Flashlight on Roaches. Its grainy, but it does show the two together. Its also the only known photo of Tamayo that is publicly available.Today, Gabbard would prefer not to be known for her Butler-cult related past. The only way to find it is to dig deep into Hawaiian-centric newsletters and publications. But for those in Hawaii, its an omnipresent part of her political and social history. As the Honolulu Civil Beat reported on March 16, 2015: The Gabbard familys ties to Butler still hound her-- in the hallways of the Hawaii State Capitol, on blogs of political observers, on pages of online discussion forums, and in commentary sections of various news sites, including Civil Beats. Now, the mysterious world thats been swirling around Gabbard all her life is coming under closer scrutiny as the 33-year-old congresswomans stature on the national stage steadily rises, and her views on national and international issues-- whether shes standing up for veterans or challenging President Barack Obama over his stance on the Islamic State-- continue to draw the media spotlight.By now, Gabbard has left any ambiguity about her religious beliefs behind. She identifies as a member of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism Sect of the Hindu faith.Its a faith she shares with Indias leader, Narendra Modi. But they share more than that-- they share a hard-right political philosophy that is at odds with Gabbards perceived role as a liberal touchstone in the Democratic Party.Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, is well known in India for his hardline right wing politics. He was the governor of the state of Gujarat during riots in 2002 that killed over 2,000 Muslims. Modi has always skirted around his level of responsibility for the violence; on the one hand he can appeal to moderates by claiming ignorance, on the other his claims of ignorance are delivered with winks to the countrys more extremist right-wing elements.Modi relies on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, for political backing. The BJP and RSSs actions have been repressive and violent and involve a complete distortion of historical and material reality in order to maintain their control of the state.The RSS-BJP alliance also uses the fears and prejudices of the majority Hindu Indian population against Muslims to ensure its hold on power. And those views are views that Gabbard shares with them-- despite her framing of herself as a peaceful warrior....Gabbards relationship with Modi is well documented in Indian publications. Her admiration of the authoritarian leader is the subject of multiple interviews, where she consistently affirms her support of the Prime Minister and his hardline party. In a three-week visit to India on the invitation of Modi himself, she was treated as a state guest and held private meetings with the Prime Minister and members of his party.And Gabbard has protected Modis interests in the US. She fought against a November, 2015, Congressional bill mentioning his role in the Gujarat massacres, decried the USs refusal to issue a visa for the controversial leader before 2014, and supported efforts to rewrite Indian history from a Hindu-supremacist viewpoint in US textbooks.She has worked to relax restrictions on Indian immigration to the US even as she joins with Trumps rhetoric in attempts to refuse allowing Syrian refugees into the country. And her views on Islam mirror those of Modis-- both insist that identifying the faith of Islamists is of paramount importance in fighting extremism (not of Hindu extremism, of course).","title":"Im old enough to remember when Tulsi pretended to be a Democrat"},{"text":"insert Peter Griffin skin tone chart meme here","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.
