The way it appears to me, a fairly intelligent (PhD in philosophy with a focus on the more analytic logical side of philosophy, teacher of critical thinking) person who keeps up with the Two Nates, is that in general, pollsters were getting strong results for Harris, believed that isn't right, and so arbitrarily weighted their data to get better results for Trump. They believed the strong Harris result wasn't right, because they've been seeing strong dem results followed by trump wins in the past two cycles. I say 'arbitrarily' because they adjusted their weighting in order to produce a particular result rather than because they had good independent reasons to think those were the right weights. The evidence for this is the fact that the number of outliers in the published data was too low. That means either we have discovered methods with incredibly low margins of error (implausible), or we got really lucky (not a point in favor of a method), or pollsters were doing what I described above. If that's the case, then what they did this year doesn't generalize. It's not a reliable method for measuring any population of voters. It will not track changes in that populations behavior next cycle for example, because the method (arbitrarily' weighting to get a less pro Dem result) isn't responsive to the population but instead is responsive to pollster expectation. Exactly what you don't want in a poll. I've tried to explain this in the best way I can as an outsider to the field who has to rely on reasoning about what is said in popular venues by people who do know what they're talking about.

Trumps stunning announcement that he intends to select Florida congressman Matt Gaetz as his Attorney General lends credence to this rumor, as it is extremely unlikely that the Senate would confirm Gaetz.The plan would require the complicity of the Speaker of the House in eviscerating the Senates advice-and-consent role.Heres a sketch of what I understand to be the plan, but I could easily be wrong on some of the details:The Constitution provides that [n]either House [of Congress], during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days. (Article I, Section 5, clause 4.) Article II, section 3 provides that in Case of Disagreement between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, [the president] may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.Step 1: The House adopts a concurrent resolution that provides for the adjournment of both the House and the Senate. (The House rules expressly state that a concurrent resolution may provide for the adjournment of  both Houses.)Step 2: The Senate either adopts the concurrent resolution, in which case it adjourns (jump to Step 4), or it rejects the concurrent resolution (proceed to Step 3).Step 3: Trump adjourns both the House and the Senate for at least ten days (and perhaps for much longer).Step 4: Trump recess-appoints his Cabinet officers.For the reasons I have previously given, I think that this plan is an outrageous attack on the Senates core duty to approve or reject the presidents nominations of his top officials.If Speaker Mike Johnson is aware of such a plan, he needs to repudiate it forthwith.","title":"Will Trump Pursue Bonkers Plan to Adjourn Both Houses of Congress?"},{"text":"Need her and her peers to actually fucking do something besides posting on social media about it.","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"Time for Pence to step up and file civil lawsuits against the Jan 6 rioters.","title":"Mike Pence is literally praying that Trump doesnt pardon the Jan 6 rioters | The Independent"},{"text":"All these fuckin' neocons are to blame.

Those cases included?[his so-called Muslim ban](https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/timeline-muslim-ban)? the first version of which was blocked in less than a week ?[efforts to restrict asylum](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/01/federal-judge-strikes-down-trump-asylum-rule-targeting-central-america/), and his?[much-criticized family separations](https://apnews.com/article/border-separated-families-trump-biden-settlement-2720c59c1873a9c3fc53da1aad4d1a80). Courts also prevented a Trump administration?[attempt to roll back school nutrition standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/trump-school-nutrition-rule.html), blocked attempts to?[weaken climate protections](https://apnews.com/article/clean-air-act-climate-district-of-columbia-air-pollution-environment-2f8a7d53108add01872c121c68f2c0fb), and reprimanded the Department of Education for?[delaying protections of student borrowers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/court-rules-against-education-secretary-betsy-devos-in-for-profit-college-case/).In some cases, judges dinged his administration for violating the law or the Constitution, but in many others, the Trump administration lost in court for skipping important procedural steps or otherwise poorly crafting policy.This time, friends and foes of his policies anticipate his administration will be more skilled, potentially writing policies in a way that will be harder to stop in court.The incoming Trump team is ready for legal challenges, according to one person familiar with Trumps agenda who was not authorized to speak on the record. That?person said the Trump team has a deep bench of lawyers who share the president-elects vision and are prepared to defend it, arguing that early in Trumps first administration, career civil servants and appointees who did not share Trumps ideology were a stumbling block.But outside groups that oppose Trumps ideas have been preparing for a second Trump administration for months, poring over what he and his allies have pledged and the Project 2025 plan put together by the conservative Heritage Foundation as a suggested Trump agenda (though he has distanced himself from Project 2025). Theyve been coming up with ideas to challenge those policies, working out strategies to divide the load by expertise and to conserve resources, and have been building their networks to coordinate their work. Immigration, environmental law, and civil liberties are likely to be hot topics once more.Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy organization, has been convening a project theyve dubbed Democracy 2025  a coalition of outside groups across policy areas that have been working to plan to fight the new Trump administration policies.Theyve also been strategizing what the legal battles might look like in a changed court system.Trump and President Biden each appointed more than 200 judges to federal benches, with Trump responsible for more than one in four judges currently serving,?[according](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/can-biden-top-trumps-number-of-judicial-appointments/)?to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. Trump also dramatically reshaped the Supreme Court, appointing three justices behind its current 6-3 conservative majority that made such momentous rulings as overturning Roe v. Wade. Many of the challenges to Trumps policies in his first term were filed in California, where judges on the Ninth Circuit tended to be more liberal; since then?[Trump appointed a number of conservatives to that circuit](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-22/trump-conservative-judges-9th-circuit).I think hell have a much higher win rate in the end, predicted John Yoo, a professor at the University of California Berkeley who served in the George W. Bush administration and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. I think he will because the law has changed much more in favor of the government and because of the three Trump appointments to the Supreme Court.","title":"Courts blocked a lot in Trumps first term.

He was days away from having the details of his widely known 'party' coming out in glorious details, hence he immediately resigned. If anyone in Congress was a 'frequent flyer' to their old buddy Eipstein's island, it would be Gaetz. That means he very likely has details on others - including Trump. 'If he goes down, he won't go alone'. So Trump gives him cover. He appoints him to the AG spot, which is bound to go over like a lead balloon (as we're seeing). Meanwhile, a \\"close friend\\" has already come out demanding that ALL court records of that instance be \\"destroyed\\". Not sealed. Destroyed. So we'll get some political backroom deals going. They agree to destroy the records and Gaetz steps back from the AG spot. Instead, as suggested, Gaetz is put in to replace Rubio. He remains in government, keeps his cushy benefits and power and everyone is happy. Meanwhile his drama provides cover for some of the OTHER disasters that were nominated so they can 'maybe' slip through during the outrage. End result? Gaetz is in the Senate as another loyalist, some of the other \\"questionable\\" nominees may slip through in the meantime and whatever Gaetz has to hang over the heads of others is kept quiet.

It was clearly a joke.The New York Times reported that representative Dan Goldman of New York, a Democrat, has plans to introduce a resolution on Thursday, affirming that the 22nd Amendment will bar Mr Trump from a third term.He called on legislators from both parties to stand by the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and confirm the Congress commitment to this principle.The resolution would make clear that the 22nd Amendment applies to two terms in the aggregate, even if they are non-consecutive, such as Mr Trumps.

Been on my mind since the moment we lost and keep in mind I'm a former rural Republican, so I get how these people tick better than most.Yes, you're right. We can accept that the media landscape isn't in our favor and just bend over and take it, or we can try to do something about it. If we know media silos are the problem and that the bottom fell out with non-college working class voters, then it seems the best place to start is (1) not a run a 2008 campaign where you just jump from national news to national news and spam rallies preaching to the choir, and instead utilize your assets such as your billion dollars raised and Tim Walz who can speak to guns and sports and go into the smaller media silos and places like Joe Rogan. Additionally, (2) You take that billion dollars and start *educating* the electorate and influencing where they are. I've been saying it for years, but if you have a growing education problem in America, the only solution is more teachers. The vast majority of money would be better spent using ad-buys and talk-show time re-teaching Americans the fundamentals of civics, dispelling myths, teaching pieces of critical-thinking and showing examples of fallacies one piece at a time. Lies told often enough become true; but telling the truth often enough *also* becomes true. Not saying it's perfect, but it's the only option we've got unless we keep letting the blind lead the blind. So activism in the off-season is key. But look, ultimately I don't blame the Harris campaign too much. If they had more than 3 months, maybe they would've done this. The blame for this loss falls much more on Biden for not committing to stepping down sooner; as well as the DNC who did not see the writing on the wall when both pre and post-2024 primaries, 2/3 of Democrats and the majority of Independents wanted someone else. What I know doesn't work is playing into the hand of Republican narratives that only further shifts what is defined as \\"center\\" in the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) as more rightward. That's a losing game.Democrats need to actually stand up for something because they'll otherwise always just be perceived as a weaker, less authentic version of Republicans. As a result, their own base of supporters will sit out, be unenthused, while Republicans will attract people because they are at least committed to a vision.Edit: I'm generally not an accelerationist, but we just lost everything running your playbook against one of what senior Democrats once perceived as the weakest Republican candidate. If there isn't much more to lose, then this is the best time to build ourselves from the ground up and create a vision and theme that is our own and that attracts others through conviction.","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"Genuinely curious, where do you try to get your news/political sources from?","title":"Elizabeth Warren sounds the alarm on potential Trump corruption"},{"text":"I'm ok with going after Dems *when appropriate*, but he needs to be ready to go after *anyone* where it's warranted.

From [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_reforms_of_Sulla)In the decades before Sulla had become dictator, Roman politics became increasingly violent.[1] Shortly before Sullas first consulship, the Romans fought the bloody Social War against their Italian allies, victorious mostly due to their immediate concession on the Italians war goal of gaining Roman citizenship.[2] Sullas dictatorship followed more domestic unrest after the war and was a culmination in this trend for violence, with his leading an army on Rome for the second time in a decade and purging his opponents from the body politic in bloody proscriptions.[3]In the aftermath of Sullas civil war and a decade of internecine conflict following the Social War, the republic had collapsed.[4] Sulla attempted to resolve this crisis by embarking on a large reform programme inaugurating what he saw as a new republic empowering magistrates while holding them accountable to law enforced by permanent courts (with a larger senate to provide juries for those courts).[5][6]His constitution would be mostly rescinded by two of his former lieutenants, Pompey and Crassus, less than ten years after his death. The mechanisms for accountability inherent to his reforms proved unworkable. Sullas marches on Rome also had proved that accountability was impossible to impose on a general with a sufficiently large army. Romans were, moreover, unable to accept as legitimate a set of reforms given by a self-appointed lawgiver under the threat of violence.Additionally, another structural issue in Rome: soldiers were basically paid by and loyal to their General by this point in Rome. This meant you could personally command them to do things like cross the Rubicon much more easily than with modern military structures. It also makes civil war far more likely.","title":"Republicans Win Control of House, Cementing a G.O.P.

They act like he's pragmatic and functional, ruminating over decisions carefully.  Hardly.  He suffers from a mental disorder.  Narcissistic Personality Disorder is highlighted by cyclical behavior that can't be changed.  Every day is incoherence, dysfunction, lies, insanity and a poor memory.  He doesn't recall half of what he's done, which is ironic because of what Republicans said about Biden.Trump and Republicans are Machiavellian.  They're myopic.  They do not care about the future and planning.  Their goal is erode the solvency of the country to enrich their families, then let Democrats try to fix the mess while telling the public that Democrats caused it in the first place.  The public thinks Republicans handle the economy better.  Hilarious but that's because most Americans are scumbags with no education.  Did you know Trump weakened the dollar's value overall, increased the national debt, increased the national deficit, increased the national trade deficit, manufacturing reached a 10-year low, farmers needed to be subsidized with 30 billion dollars for a failed trade war, his tariffs caused permanent price increases and he increased the size of the U.S. Government by adding 2 million jobs?  Everything he did was wrong and caused inflation.To sum everything up, Trump and Republicans are willing for the next 5 decades to fucking suck for everyone, if the next 4 years are prosperous for them.

It was a genuine question  I think Trump is a cancer and I am not sympathetic!! But I also try to be objective.  If people want the Democratic Party, as I do, to win back popular support in this country, I think Democrats should focus their objections on things that are not just poor policy choices but on things that will truly hurt our Democracy and do irrevocable damage long term. Think about it. If Democrats denounce and stand in the way of everything Trump tries to do thats just bad policy, he may fail and be a horrible president but shift the focus and blame to liberal hysteria. Theres an old saying that says dont interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake. But there are some things that we should absolutely resist because they would irrevocably harm our country. So if I were the head of the Democratic Party Id say let him make his bad policy choices like tariffs and deportations  and let him take all the blame when those choices fail. Stop him when he tries to expand executive power and erode checks and balances. When he makes ridiculous cabinet appointment picks those are depressing and concerning but we should focus on the really consequential problems. A big deal has been made about Hegseth not washing his hands. I really dont think thats where we need to focus our energy.  Likewise, if Tulsi really is a Russian asset and theres credible evidence for that, we should bring attention to that evidence.

Sounds an awful lot like what Michelle Obama was trying to do, banning certain foods from schools. My oldest kid eats healthy (younger kids arent having school lunch yet), no reason he cant have pizza day to look forward to. Its his favorite lunch day at school, but he loves his fruits and veggies too because we treated them like a delicious snack when he was little and didnt force him to eat them. Frankly, I think removing most junk foods from the eligibility list for government assistance would probably help a lot. Just my observations but I rarely see carts full of fruits and veggies and healthy meats when someone wipes a government assistance card, its almost always microwave meals and shitty ground beef and chips and soda and snacks and shit like that.I could be wrong, but I feel like well-off people arent the obese ones, its the poor people who cant afford health foods and/or dont have time to cook meals because theyre working too much, and buy prepackaged garbage. Understand that Im not disparaging poor people - I know how hard it is to eat healthy on a budget. I dont have that problem anymore, but I understand it fully. $8 for a sack of grapes, or $5 for a bag of Pizza Rolls? Which one is going to make me feel more full? As far as fast food, spend $30 on groceries and spend an hour preparing a meal, or spend $30 on McDonalds and eat right away? We have to figure out a way to lower costs at the grocery store so that cooking at home is a preferable option to McDonalds maybe somebody can kick off a trend of restaurants that cook regular home meals not coated in fattening grease or butter, and sell them for reasonable prices? We should cast a wider qualification net for food assistance programs but only for fruits, veggies and other healthy foods. Fruit is fucking expensive, middle class families that can get by on their own but still have tight budgets arent as likely to buy expensive healthy foods. Maybe they dont qualify for full assistance but could benefit from prices on healthy foods being cut down a bit so theyre more likely to buy them.","title":"Doctor tapped by Trump for key health role reveals radical plan to end disease that kills more than cancer"},{"text":"I mean they've wanted to own the libs for as long as I've been able to vote.It's the fact they act all shocked Pikachu when we tell them we're done with the bullshit that pisses me off the most though.","title":"America needs to stop electing clowns, Trump is gonna make the White House a circus now"},{"text":"If theyre officially released Ill be shocked.

We would be incredibly fucked.Then there is the issue of having to throw our own military industrial complex under the bus and start over from scratch.  A little tidbit: we cant actually afford our own weapons without the ability to sell enough of them to all of our NATO allies.

Neither does it require close coordination, or merging of groups.This whole thing sounds a lot like what some neoliberal Destructocrat *imagines* how such a scenario would go down and that it would occur purely around social issues.At least you hope it will.If you think neocons are greasy, slicked-back and smiling used car salesmen that try to trick you into acting against your own best interests, then you haven't seen shit, because neolibs are FAR more dangerous to the cause in that regard.You're doing it right now in fact, with this effort to poison the well of potential cooperation, by attempting to sow discord and distrust among your enemies, for whom trust is not necessary to operate as loose, erstwhile allies in concert against you.It's funny how you touched on those mutual interests briefly as a way to blow right past them to talk about the divisions and \\"how can you trust them?!\\" pearl-clutching that is designed to prevent any such cooperation.Those \\"kitchen table issues\\", as you so quaintly refer to them are exclusively about improving the material conditions of workers lives, which is *the* driving concern of the actual left and literally what being on the left is all about.So yeah.

The Destructocrats fear that so much, they created and sustained Trumplestiltskin just to prevent it from happening.But if it is trust you require, that's no problem at all.

The overarching goal given the \\"team Trump\\" is really to allow Russia to continue to try to intimidate or occupy former Soviet bloc countries. Some like Hungary are supportive of this , that is until they have that old Soviet style sucking feeling as wealth and resources get repatriated to Russia, but other countries.Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, have prospered under western capitalism so want nothing to do with Mr. Putin or his New Soviet idea. Finland is a special case since there's an abiding independent streak that kept Finland both neutral and largely free of Soviet influence so this would likely be one of the major spots where there is ALREADY asymmetric warfare where Mr. Putin sends waves of \\"refugees\\" to the border and it's taken the entirety of the EU to deal with those border concerns. I think what Mr.. Putin is likely to discover is that he could slide into an Article 5 situation and find himself at war with Europe without much trouble at all; of course this puts pressure on the United States if we had Germany, France and England screaming for help; to say nothing of Poland, which is very fucking serious about their military deployments and training, Moscow could easily find Poland is no pushover and might find in fact his forces in dire straights given that he's lost a good number of his own competent armed forces and even his officer corps are drawn down.

The confirmation hearings will happen after Inauguration Day which is also after the new senate is confirmed, right? Hell have to appoint someone before then. Side note: my gut tells me that DeSantis might nominate himself for Senate. That will allow his lieutenant governor to take over now and then still win two more elections so she would be able to serve 10 years. Shes a Cuban American very similar to Rubio, and shes already represented Miami Dade county. So I feel as though she would not have any trouble with elections. Then, that gives DeSantis a job after his term limits are up and continues a job for him if he doesnt win the presidency in 2028. And to your question about Gaetz specifically. Lets assume for these purposes he didnt sex traffic anyone, use drugs, or share inappropriate images on the House floor all like he was accused of. I personally would like my representative to not be accused of that many different issues, but I understand sometimes accusations happen whether they are true or not.He pledged to serve three terms because he said he believes in term limits and even co-sponsored a resolution to the House about 3 terms for House representatives. Yet, he was just elected to his fifth term. Did he decide that he actually did not want term limits? Did he decide that three years was not enough for a House representative? We will never know because he never comes down here unless its to campaign for himself or someone else.He has never debated anyone running against him\\nIn the primaries or general election. Why? Great question. Id love to know the answer to. Again, could be arrogance because he knows hes going to get reelected in our area? Possibly. Other people in our area deserve to hear from him, hear his views compared to somebody else, and why hes the best choice for the role. Especially in the primaries. What separates himself from the other Republican candidates?The whole ouster of Kevin McCarthy didnt sit right with me. He single handily made House Republicans look like idiots. If you do not agree with committeeships or House rules, have discussions. Try to come up with agreements. And if nothing comes of it, you only have to wait two years before the speaker can change and then you can make your voice heard and known before he is granted the role. My theory? He just wanted to say that he has been the only person to help oust the house speaker. Again, contributes to his arrogance. am I wrong? Possibly. But again, he never comes down here to talk to the people for us to know what exactly his process was. Wouldve loved to hear that in a debate format.On December 19, 2017, Gaetz was the ONLY representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act. The vote was 418-1. Hes the 1. He also voted against the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in 2018. The vote count was 388C25. In 2022, he also voted against Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed 401C20. Which I understand if you have firm belief that these are not good bills, you have a right as a representative to vote against them. But if you have sex trafficking allegations against you, voting against all these measures is not a good look.I have three pretty strong Republican friends that I talk to on a daily basis about politics. Two of which are pretty MAGA heavy. Even they both agree that they dont like Gaetz as a person, but they keep voting for him because they like his politics. Wow thats a very small sample size of our area, I feel like thats probably how much Republicans think. Nobody in this area really likes him. They just keep voting for him because we want to ensure that our area stays red.","title":"Trump picks Rubio, Gaetz and Gabbard for top jobs in blitz of nominations"},{"text":"Currently sitting at over 96K upvotes, with the top comment having only about 500 upvotes.

It's also funny how you conveniently  ignore the role Western economic policies in post Soviet economies that severely limited their agency and made them reliant on subsidies instead. Penalizing countries for nuanced foreign relations is another example of the western superiority mindset, and undersores the need for global multi-polarity.

Trump has shown that an incompetent figurehead is essentially a hack to have people forgive/discount/infantilize everything you do.

Sure, the stock market is up, but that really only helps the top 20% or so. Unemployment is low, but are most of those jobs paying living wages or even quality jobs? The inflation rate is under control, but the high inflation prices are still here. Trump isn't going to make it better, and will probably make it worse before it evens out (if it evens out). With mass deportation, some areas may see a decrease in housing cost, but that will come with the probability of local economic downturn. Other things like groceries will go up, and any money saved on rent will go there. Smaller companies will close, furthering the collapse of small business. The bigger companies will weather the storm and potentially come out stronger, then hire those people that lost their jobs except it will be at diminished wages, no benefits, or high workloads. All in all, a net loss of wealth for everyone, but the top 20% will still have more and the wealth inequality will grow even wider.

Its something that cuts deepera feeling that the West, in Russias eyes, hasnt lived up to its own standards of democracy, respect, and collaboration. Back when the Soviet Union first dissolved, leaders like Gorbachev and Yeltsin were hoping for a partnership with the West. They didnt see NATO as a rival then; they envisioned Russia as a partner, included in Europes security framework and supported in rebuilding its economy and stability.Russia acted on this vision. It joined NATOs Partnership for Peace and even supported NATOs intervention in Bosniaan unusual act of trust. But over time, as NATO took in more Eastern European countries, Russia felt the door was closing. The message they saw was unmistakable: NATO was expanding, and Russias security worries were pushed aside. Moscow read this as a shift from cooperation to containment.Another tension surfaced over the treatment of ethnic Russians in countries now aligning with the West, like the Baltic states and Ukraine. Many Russian speakers felt pushed to the side, as policies favored local cultures. From Moscows point of view, this appeared to contradict the Wests ideals of inclusiondemocracy seemed to apply, but not to ethnic Russians. This inconsistency left Moscow questioning the Wests motives: were they defending democracy, or using it selectively?Now, how has this betrayal played out across Eastern Europe? With increased U.S.-Russia rivalry, Eastern Europe became a focal point in a tug-of-war. The West, in its efforts, pulled these nations into its orbit, strengthening its influence but leaving other costs. Many of these countries, once strong in Soviet-era industries, have struggled to gain economic independence and rely on EU aid or money sent from citizens working abroad. The economic revival once promised has often fallen short.Western Europe, too, has seen fallout. Once a leader in innovation, Europe now finds itself lagging in sectors like AI, clean energy, and tech infrastructure. Dependence on American technology and military hardware has undercut Europes self-reliance, binding it closer to U.S. interests, particularly in energy, as Europe replaces Russian gas with American liquefied natural gas .Culturally, American influence is reshaping the European mindset. U.S. media and values have led to greater polarization, sparking heated debates on social issues that feel out of place in Europes tradition of compromise. To Moscow, this shift is yet another sign of the Wests overreach, leaving Europe economically constrained, divided, and increasingly entangled in American priorities over its own.","title":"CMV:  The promise to Gorbachev has no value."},{"text":"I didnt bother to check.

The public are getting exactly what they asked for.","title":"Who are Trumps cabinet picks so far and who is in the running?"},{"text":"Did you know about recess appointments? Because Id wager 99% of Americans dont. And thats the secret backdoor Trump and the Republicans have already lined up to install Matt Gaetz without any confirmation process.Recess appointments are a loophole, a constitutional relic meant to keep government running smoothly when the Senate wasnt in session. It allows a president to bypass the Senate and unilaterally install someone to a cabinet position or other high office. Sure, its temporary on paper, but that means they serve until the end of the next legislative sessionat least a year. And heres the kicker: that temporary label is meaningless when the Senate and House refuse to enforce any limits. This tool, once intended to prevent gridlock, is now a weapon in the hands of someone whos shown no respect for checks and balances.Trump is poised to abuse recess appointments in a way weve never seen before. Hell use it to stack the DOJ, the FBI, and whatever else he can with pure loyalists. The goal? Purge anyone whos dared to prosecute him or his allies, and replace them with sycophants wholl do his bidding.Are we really surprised by this? A man willing to illegally overturn an election is, of course, going to test every limit of power. Its not a leap to imagine what comes next. If you think this is the worst of it, just waitits only the beginning.Trump has been crystal clear about his demands. He doesnt just want the Senate Majority Leader to keep things running; he wants someone who will immediately throw the Senate into recess so he can use this loophole. And John Thune? Hes already agreed to it. So what happens? Gaetz gets in. Tulsi Gabbard gets in. Anyone Trump wants, gets in. There are no checks. There are no balances. If you were clinging to hope that some process or institution would stop this, let it go.And the next phase? Watch for January 20. Christopher Wray, current head of the FBI, will be fired. Hes supposed to serve a ten-year term, but that wont stop Trump. Why? Because without a firing, Trump wouldnt get to handpick his replacement. Its glaringly obvious to anyone paying attention that this is the plan: fire Wray, replace him with a loyalist, and turn the DOJ and FBI into weapons for targeting Trumps enemies.Sure, this might sound far-fetched to some Democrats. People keep telling themselves Trump wouldnt go this far, as if his track record hasnt been one endless march toward authoritarianism. But let me spell it out: Show me the man, and I will show you the crime. That Soviet-era phrase sums it up perfectly. A regime can always find something on its enemies, because nobody is spotless. Target 1,000 people, and youll find dirt on a few dozen. Target 10,000, and youll uncover serious crimes.\\nSee: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_me_the_man_and_I_will_give_you_the_case_against_him#:~:text=The%20expression%20means%20literally%20what,in%20particular%2C%20communist)%20regimes.Now imagine this scenario in 2026: Matt Gaetz runs the DOJ. Some other yes-man heads the FBI. Thousands of federal employees are purged and replaced with Trump loyalists. This is all outlined in Project 2025, by the waygo look it up. Dissenters are scared into silence. Meanwhile, Trumps team uncovers dozens of real crimes. And heres the catch: all those crimes will conveniently belong to Trumps political enemies. Democrats, journalists, anyone who ever stood in his way.And who will argue with it? The crimes they bring forward will be real enough. Thats the brillianceand the horrorof it. If you target a large enough group, youll find criminals among them. Some of those crimes will be heinous, too. So when Trumps government starts parading these cases in front of the public, itll seem like justice. The swamp being drained. The deep state dismantled.There is a reason this plan is obvious to many of us. Its an old plan. This is the same playbook Hitler used. The same tactics Putin and Orbn used. Trumps inspirations are as plain as day. This isnt speculationits history repeating itself. The question is whether anyone will stop it. Because, like the sunrise, its all painfully predictable.Well see if it works.
