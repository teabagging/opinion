Too late for a primary, just in time for the donor class elite to make the decision for us (and her being the least successful candidate in the '20 primaries). In addition, Joe pissed me off during the pandemic when he tried to force anyone at a company with 100 employees to get the vaccine, and only the conservative supreme court stopped him. That shook my views considerably because while I am generally left-leaning and pro-science, this is America, and we should have bodily autonomy and freedom to choose what we inject in our bodies and not lose our job as a consequence.

I understand that you have been led to believe that you will all be sent to concentration camps... (well those of you who arent deported...JK) but the truth is a lot more boring.So, first of all, none of you are going to be arrested, fined, jailed, have your property confiscated or sold into slavery. I know your gender studies professor has been claiming otherwise since March, but the only people actually in danger of anything bad happening to them are those who actually break the law, and they will still get due process. Well them and the excess government bureaucrats who are about to lose their tax payer supported jobs,\\nbut even they will probably get a nice severance. You on the other hand will be able to pretty much continue life as normal.Censorship is no longer the currency of the realm, so feel free to continue melting down on Reddit without fear of retribution from the government. Youre free to hate Donald Trump, me, the founders, the color white, math, working out, guns your parents and everyone ignoring you on Tinder. You wont be censored, de platformed or have trumped up (pun intended) charges brought against you for disagreeing with the government. Also there will almost certainly be a lot more job opportunities and a much better environment to start a business. Which again...probably wont matter to you immediately, but you will appreciate the additional access to goods and services due to increased capital investment, which you no doubt dream about one day seizing just as soon as the Democratic Socialists of America figure out which pronouns to use on their call to arms.Also, if you do plan to step outside and touch grass, you will be significantly less likely to get mugged or step on a hypodermic needle. (Unless you live in San Francisco...well try to clean it up but the 10th amendment says theyre allowed to live in filth if they so choose.) If you have any questions, our number can be found on the back of any job application, so this may be the last time we will communicate.Thanks again, welcome back to America!","title":"This post to Reddit users about what's actually going to happen under a second Trump administration is ?"},{"text":"Numbers don't mean shit if people feel like the economy sucks. And the truth, the current economy doesn't *feel* as great as it was pre-COVID, even though we've been making a comeback. I also feel like there's some copium in your response, because it's undeniable that the price of rent and food have gone up. Only gas has really gone down somewhat. But rents these days are as high as mortgages and the price of food is triple to quadruple. I know this because when I go to restaurants I frequent, I notice that restaurants will often reduce portion sizes rather than actually reduce prices. They would only do that if things were getting more expensive. Sorry dude it's just the truth. And certain foods at the store have objectively gone up in price. People notice that shit.Trump sucks ass but let's please not pretend we're living in a great economy. Unemployment being low doesn't mean shit if the jobs barely pay and rent and groceries are high as fuck. My mortgage is $1300 and there's a buddy of mine from work who just rented a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment for the same fucking price tag a month. That same apartment a few years ago would have been $700 tops in the area I live in. And $1300 is a fucking bargain these days, I know people paying $1800 rent and this area I'm in is considered relatively cheap in Florida.","title":"Trump Allies Suddenly Feel Safe Touting Project 2025"},{"text":"lLatinos are descendants of explorers and conquistadors.

The problem isn't some boogeyman that hates progressive policies - it's that the entire democratic campaign relied on scare tactics - and you are continuing to spread scare tactics. It doesn't matter if your scare tactics are against some minority racists or the silicone valley elites.Any scare tactics campaign is terrible in my opinion, and personally I will never vote for anyone who uses those tactics. However, the left, unlike the right, will never win with scare tactics. Scare tactics generally work against the lower IQ population, and require utilizing some pre-existing, half legitimate fear. \\nIt's easy to dehumanize some imaginary illegal immigrants - most Americans don't know who are those illegals, they don't have voting rights, and anti immigrant polocies rarely backfired against the non-immigrant population. It's relatively easy to make a random minority into a boogeyman, especially when the minority is small enough that many voters never even interacted with a person from that minority (like how jew dehumazation is still very much alive). The left, this campaign, and during the Clinton campaign has been dehumanizing voters. Any republican voter has been painted as an evil, racist, woman hating white man. When the reality is far more complex. \\nSure, these scare tactics work to drive the already persuaded into mass hysteria and to increase their voting numbers, but it will always only alienate undecided voters, and reinforce the common right wing narrative that leftists are detached from reality and are idiots. (notice the difference between dehumanization and painting them as idiots). It is easy to persuade a person their loved ones are idiots (we are all idiots in the end) it's harder to persuade them they are evil. If the left wants to win, they have to start running on a positive campaign. Empathize with the very real concerns of right wing and undecided voters and address these issues.The left, not just in the US, is too caught up with being hysterical about the other candidate, that they forget that their job is to offer a suitable candidate with a convincing policy.Left wing leaders being incompetent is exactly why so many countries are becoming more and more radicalized - and it's terrible for everyone involved.

They had come to protest the securitisation of public swimming pools following a racist debate around incidents of young men getting into fights there.  Right-wing politicians and the media had used these incidents to promote racist narratives. By connecting them to increased migration since 2015 and speaking of the consequences of multicultural swimming they suggested that migrants, especially young Arab men, were a danger to German society. Their narrative was supported by the fact that the Prinzenbad is located in Kreuzberg, a district marked by Turkish and Arab migration and often referred to by police and the media as a crime hotspot.Dozens of people force the shutdown of public swimming pools because they have huge brawls at them, assault and intimidate guests and staff, and the ONLY thing the author cares to say about it is that the debate was 'racist'.The article they link about the 'racist debate' is just a DW report on the whole situation, with a brief paragraph about AfD's statements being the only thing that could even vaguely characterise the debate as 'racist'.This is emblematic of the left's unreason on public safety and law enforcement: leftists are so preoccupied with avoiding even the distant appearance of bigotry that they forget that basic governance is a public good too.","title":"Demonising migrants, fortifying borders: Germanys downward asylum spiral, Migrant communities in Berlin fight against racism and for the right to asylum."},{"text":"I think it was legit.

Heres the rationale behind these selections:1. Adherence to Journalistic Standards:Credible Sources: Outlets like the Associated Press, Reuters, and BBC News adhere strictly to journalistic standards, including rigorous fact-checking, sourcing transparency, and balanced reporting. These organizations often have codes of conduct and editorial guidelines to minimize bias.Less Credible Sources: Some sources like Infowars, Breitbart, and Natural News have reputations for prioritizing sensationalism over accuracy or balanced reporting. They have been repeatedly flagged for spreading misinformation, using unverified or misleading sources, or promoting conspiracy theories.2. Transparency and Accountability:Credible Sources: Reputable outlets often publish corrections, show clear distinctions between news and opinion, and maintain transparency about sourcing. This accountability builds trust, as readers can verify information.Less Credible Sources: Some sources lack transparency, obscure their funding or editorial policies, or mix factual reporting with unsubstantiated claims. This opacity reduces their reliability, as it's harder for readers to judge the accuracy of information.3. Funding and Ownership:Credible Sources: Established, transparent funding models (subscriptions, public funding, or advertising with clear boundaries) help ensure editorial independence. For instance, NPR and The Guardian disclose funding sources and adhere to publicly known guidelines to minimize conflicts of interest.Less Credible Sources: Outlets funded by political or ideologically driven organizations, such as RT (linked to the Russian government) or Epoch Times (linked to Falun Gong), are sometimes suspected of promoting narratives beneficial to those interests, which can affect editorial independence.4. Track Record and Fact-Checking History:Credible Sources: Outlets like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post have extensive records of reliable journalism. Their investigative work is often corroborated by independent fact-checkers.Less Credible Sources: Many of the less credible sources, such as The Gateway Pundit or WorldNetDaily, have been flagged by fact-checkers for spreading misinformation, including claims about health, politics, or world events that lack substantiation.5. Misinformation and Conspiracy Theory Promotion:Credible Sources: Reputable news organizations generally avoid promoting unfounded conspiracy theories or misinformation.

This is not a recent development in US politics.  It may have become more pronounced with the advent of social media, but this was a topic being discussed when I was a kid 30 some years ago.  A lot of Trump voters distrust of government and institutions is rooted more in a combination of grievances and a lack of good information as well as an unwillingness  to consider that they may not be right.   There are far too many people getting their news and information from dubious sources who seem to lack the skills/intellectual tools to distinguish between good and bad sources of information.  That coupled with an unwillingness to consider that they may be wrong, that they may have been led astray, and that they may be supporting someone unworthy of their support is a huge problemand it isnt limited only to Trump voters. Its just that Trump voters happen to be supporting someone who actively seeks to sow distrust and misinformation and who has no interest in maintaining the democratic norms of the republic if they dont suit his personal aims. Regarding continuously attacking Trump: what other choice is there? For the first time in history, an outgoing US president straight up tried to block the peaceful transition to a new president, first through dubious legal means, then through efforts at corruption, and finally through violence.  The man isnt Hitler but he literally tried to seize power away from the popular will of the people.  He tried to do the thing that dictators and despots get away with because their countries lack the legal means and democratic norms to stop it.  That is incredibly dangerous and in all honesty, the man should have never been allowed anywhere near an election ever again.  Failing to remind people of that reality would have been gross negligence on the part of his opponents (and his fellow republicans for that matter).  And his supporters simply refuse to believe it (see my first paragraph).","title":"CMV: democrats are the reason to blame for losing and they wont get better no until they can fix it"},{"text":"That's not inflation.

He ultimately deported less illegal immigrants than either of Obama's terms.I mean this lacks a lot of context. Yeah in total Obama deported more immigrants than Trump, But context matters. In Obama's second term 2013-16 he had 2.1 million deportations, while Trump from 2017-20 had 2 million deportations. So during those consecutive terms, the two presidents actually deported about the same rate. Now compare Obama full two terms total of about 5 million deportations to Bush 2's more than 10 million deportations, and in actuality Obama halved the amount of people getting deported from the previous administration. While Trump kept about the same pace as Obama. And in Trump's second term, it's safe to say he will likely surpass Obama's numbers.Also again context matters, both in Obama's full two terms and Trump's first term they had things impeding their deportations, trials, lawsuits, a more honest media coverage. In Trump's second term the conservative federal courts and the conservative Supreme Court are fully on board with increasing deportations and racist billionaires have bought up the media. In Trump's first term, they didn't have a plan already mapped out and hadn't fully tested the loyalty of staff. This time around Trump was given a plan already and all of his inner circle has been tested to be fully loyal.Like the guardrails that were in place during both Obama's terms and Trump's first term are no longer there. If Trump wants to increase deportations, he absolutely can. And because he's a racist fuck, he absolutely will.Also want to add, Obama's deportations at least tried to do it more humanely, focusing on those with criminal histories and the ones recently arrived (as those who arrived recently would have less ties and because deporting an undocumented immigrant that's been here 20 years was viewed as more damaging. Still sucks though). But Trump's deportations in his first term (and probably second term) didn't have a focus, his deportations didn't care if someone was a criminal or new immigrant or has been here a long time or even if they're children. We all saw this with the news reports of kids in detainment camps. Trump is going to deport people without caring about the situation and it will absolutely create a ton of chaos.","title":"Trump's mass deportation plan is 'so ugly and sick': Former Sen.

If guns had a direct correlation to murder, youd expect us to be the most dangerous country on the planet. But were not. Also as far as having armed personnel at schools, I dont see a problem with it. The reason they get shot up is because A.) people are sick in the head and B.) theyre easy targets. Little to no resistance. Why arent there ever any mass shootings in a gun store where the entire staff is armed?

Heres a closer look at why these types of sources are often considered less credible:1. Promotion of Misinformation or DisinformationSome outlets on the list, like Infowars or Natural News, have a history of publishing unverified or outright false information. For instance, Infowars, run by Alex Jones, became infamous for promoting baseless conspiracy theories, such as false claims about the Sandy Hook school shooting.These sources often prioritize traffic or ideological appeal over accuracy, which results in the spread of misleading information to large audiences.\\n2. Extreme Political BiasMany sources on this list, such as Breitbart News or The Daily Caller, are known for extreme partisan bias. While not inherently wrong, extreme bias can lead to selective reporting or twisting of facts to fit an agenda.This one-sided reporting can mislead audiences by presenting an unbalanced view of events, often omitting or de-emphasizing facts that contradict their ideological stance.\\n3. Use of Conspiracy TheoriesOutlets like The Gateway Pundit or Before Its News are known for promoting conspiracy theories, which often lack evidence and serve to sow distrust in mainstream information sources.Conspiracy theories can create a sense of fear or anger that isnt based on facts, manipulating public perception and leading people to believe in \\"hidden agendas\\" without concrete evidence.\\n4. Sensationalism and ClickbaitSources such as The Western Journal and YourNewsWire are often described as \\"clickbait\\" websites because they use sensationalized headlines and exaggerated reporting to attract attention.Sensationalism may draw clicks, but it sacrifices accuracy and context, which diminishes the credibility of the reporting.\\n5. Lack of Reliable Sourcing and VerificationOutlets like RT and Sputnik News have been criticized for their reliance on anonymous sources or failing to verify information thoroughly, which can lead to the spread of incorrect or incomplete stories.Reliable news organizations generally follow journalistic standards, like source verification and fact-checking. When these standards are absent, credibility suffers.\\n6. State-Controlled Media and PropagandaGovernment-funded outlets like RT (Russia Today) and Sputnik News are often seen as propaganda tools. For example, RT is funded by the Russian government and has been accused of promoting the Russian governments viewpoints, sometimes at the expense of factual accuracy.State-controlled media can lack editorial independence, which risks promoting the interests of the government rather than objective reporting.\\n7. Deceptive Editing or ManipulationGroups like Project Veritas have been criticized for deceptive editing practices in their undercover video operations, which can misrepresent what happened or was said.By altering context or selectively editing, these sources can mislead audiences about events, which undermines their trustworthiness.\\n8. Pseudoscience and Health MisinformationSources like Natural News frequently promote pseudoscientific information, particularly around health topics like vaccinations or alternative medicine. This misinformation can have harmful real-world effects, such as discouraging people from getting necessary medical treatment.Health misinformation is especially dangerous because it can directly impact people's health decisions, often relying on emotionally charged and scientifically unsupported claims.\\n9. Repeated Fact-Checking FailuresSome outlets on the list frequently appear in fact-checking databases for repeatedly publishing false information. For instance, Zero Hedge and The Epoch Times have been cited multiple times by fact-checkers for spreading unverified or debunked information.Consistent fact-checking failures reveal a pattern that diminishes the sources reliability over time.\\n10. Public Trust and SurveysPublic trust data often shows low trust in sources like OANN or Newsmax, particularly when compared to more established outlets. Surveys and media studies frequently rank these sources as less reliable or lower on transparency.Low trust ratings indicate that audiences are skeptical of these outlets ability to provide objective, fact-based reporting, often because of their history or editorial practices.\\nTogether, these issues highlight why certain sources are commonly labeled as less credible and serve as a reminder to approach news consumption critically, especially when sourcing from outlets with reputations for sensationalism, bias, or unverified reporting.","title":"Top 100 Least credible news sources according to Chat-GPT"},{"text":"Biden could literally assassinate Trump right now as an official act and the Supreme Court will have to mull out what exactly they meant by presidential immunity.

UNEP reiterates the call for an immediate ceasefire to protect lives and eventually help mitigate the conflicts environmental impacts.Not only are the people of Gaza dealing with untold suffering from the ongoing war, the significant and growing environmental damage in Gaza risks locking its people into a painful, long recovery. While many questions remain regarding the exact type and quantity of contaminants affecting the environment in Gaza, people are already living with the consequences of conflict-related damage to environmental management systems and pollution today. Water and sanitation have collapsed. Critical infrastructure continues to be decimated. Coastal areas, soil and ecosystems have been severely impacted. All of this is deeply harming people's health, food security and Gaza's resilience, said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director.We urgently need a ceasefire to save lives and restore the environment, to enable Palestinians to start to recover from the conflict and rebuild their lives and livelihoods in Gaza.For decades, Gazas environment was facing degradation and pressure on its ecosystems, the consequence of recurring conflicts, rapid urbanization, high population density, political conditions, and the [regions vulnerability](https://unfccc.int/news/mena-climate-week-2023-driving-regional-action-on-climate-change#:~:text=The%20entire%20MENA%20region%20is,more%20persistent%20and%20acute%20drought.)?to?climate change.The ?preliminary assessment finds:* **The conflict undoes recent, albeit limited progress on Gazas environmental management** systems, including development of water desalination and wastewater treatment facilities, a rapid growth in solar power, and investments in the restoration of the Wadi Gaza coastal wetland.\\n* **An estimated 39 million tonnes of debris have been generated by the conflict C** for each square metre in the Gaza Strip, there is now over 107 kg of debris. This is more than five times the quantity of debris generated from the 2017 conflict in Mosul, Iraq. Debris poses risks to human health and the environment, from dust and contamination with unexploded ordnance, asbestos, industrial and medical waste, and other hazardous substances. Human remains buried beneath the debris must be dealt with sensitively and appropriately. Clearing the debris will be a massive and complex task, which needs to start as soon as possible to enable other types of recovery and reconstruction to proceed.\\n* **The water, sanitation, and hygiene systems are almost entirely?defunct**.?Gazas five wastewater treatment plants have shut down, with sewage contaminating beaches, coastal waters, soil, and freshwater with a host of pathogens, nutrients, microplastics, and hazardous chemicals. This poses immediate and long-term threats to the health of Gazans, marine life, and arable lands.\\n* **The solid waste management system is severely damaged.** Five out of six solid waste management facilities in Gaza are damaged. By November 2023, 1,200 tonnes of rubbish were accumulating daily around camps and shelters. A shortage of cooking gas has forced families to burn wood, plastic and waste instead, endangering women and children in particular. This, coupled with fires and burning fuels, is likely to have sharply lowered Gazas air quality, though no open-source air quality data is available for Gaza.\\n* **Munitions containing heavy metals and explosive chemicals** have been deployed in Gazas densely populated areas, contaminating soil and water sources, and posing a risk to human health which will persist long after the cessation of hostilities. Unexploded ordnance poses especially serious risks to children.\\n* **Destruction of solar panels** is expected to leak lead and other heavy metals, causing a new kind of risk to Gazas soil and water.\\n* **Hamas tunnels system** **and Israels efforts to destroy them** may further contribute to environmental damage. Depending on the construction standards of the tunnels and the extent to which water is being pumped into them, the preliminary assessment warns of long-term risks to human health from groundwater contamination and to buildings constructed on potentially unstable land surfaces.","title":"Trumps lack of accomplishments guaranteed he would lose millions of votes."},{"text":"He doesnt have any more campaigns to run.","title":"Trump tells Palestinian president he wants to end Gaza war"},{"text":"But the US is not at war and was spending under 5% of US military budget in Ukraine aid","title":"Trumps lack of accomplishments guaranteed he would lose millions of votes."},{"text":"If you're actively casting your vote for the candidates being funded by billionaires you're explicitly endorsing your own exploitation.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"And yes!!

Is calling someone a sexist because they aren't voting how you want them to really a good card to play? Repeat these for *every* male demographic where messaging was intended to shame instead of uplift and ironically, though not surprising at this point, you'll see a transparently sexist narrative. All the messaging for female demographics was positive and empowering. All the messaging for male demographics was shame or fear based. That's just sexism with extra steps and that view of the world is both transparent and a massive contributor to why Kamala broke a bunch of records in the wrong direction. Men have been hearing those narratives for more than a decade at this point and now that there are actual repercussions for that kind of messaging, the appeal is to the \\"impossible\\" when their actions caused this outcome.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Fuck the CCP.

He has said things that fall into nearly every form of blank-ist/phobia in the book.He's not subtle about this stuff. And that's on top of being a convicted felon. And a lot of people voted for him anyway. And you can't vote for someone so aggressively like that without people assuming that you are all in on his ideology. If this were literally any other Republican candidate, I'd probably agree that maybe enough wasn't done to earn the win. But it wasn't. The fact that Trump's own behavior wasn't enough to tank his campaign says a lot more about the people that voted for him than about Trump himself.

People have already gotten comfortable with the new status quo of letting these laws be maintained by the states, and they will be even more comfortable with that in 4 years. This is not a pro-choice country, or a pro-life country. It's divided. And, therefore, there will not be any federal abortion laws for the foreseeable future.One of Trump's weakest gains was in Georgia, where the story of the woman who died of problems with a pregnancy happened. That is definitely something that needs to be handled. We can't have women dying because they were denied care. I don't believe any of these state laws deny an abortion when the mother's life is in danger. That kind of story is what led to Ireland liberalizing its abortion law.

Putins propaganda machine will always push rhetoric no matter the outcome, this wont change that fact, it will always align with what goals Putin has, so continuing the war, ending it soon, whatever wont change that aspect in relation to longer term aspirations. He can also justify all he wants but itll only really impact his supporters domestically, which wont sway anti-Putin anytime soon. Abroad such as China, NK, Iran are smart enough to see the cost of this conflict and know that this has woken up NATO, FVEY, and many Indo-Pacific nations to what this war can mean in other potential conflicts such as Taiwan. You absolutely can station troops in a foreign country without an alliance. All that is needed is a SOFA agreement to enact. The U.S. does this in Africa, Central and South America with countries we are peaceful with. The bases are usually called CSLs and are focused on COIN/CT, but the argument can be made and is possible in Ukraine. Yes, the commitment of stationing NATO forces in Ukraine consistently for 2 decades is an issue and currently it does look like it would be difficult to achieve. Thats an issue that Europe needs to solve if this were to be the solution taken, I dont know or have a solution for how that can be realistically solved besides European nations should take the next step for their own security instead of spit this we need help tune on repeat. Action over words is critical for them now more than ever and it has been this struggle that has allowed Putin the confidence to do what he is doing now in the first place, no sympathy on my part to them enabling. My consensus is Ukraine is bleeding at a ratio quicker than Russia at the moment, the next U.S. administration doesnt seem as keen to provide significant enough support to turn the tide so Ukraine can get more negotiating chips or accomplish total victory, Russia is getting its defense industry aligned for a drawn out conflict since that is where they will likely win, and Ukraine isnt getting the manpower it needs to rotate forces and change the ratio due to mobilization issues inside a fairly corrupt Ukrainian government. There are many other smaller factors but its a race against time for Ukraine to make a decision: continue the war and slowly receive less financial support thatll likely lead to more territorial losses which is an even worse outcome for Europe and the world (oh NATO couldnt stick it for the long term sings to China) or they seek peace when they have some ability to negotiate something that can in the long term get them out of the crosshairs of a future Russian invasion. Thats how I see this situation. I dont agree that peace now is the best solution for the west, but a necessary evil/sacrifice to look long term at the Russian problem set. Europe needs to do the hard thing and make these sacrifices now or risk even worse later, you cant have your cake and eat it too.","title":"Trump couldn't build a working wall in the US, so he'll try to build one in Ukraine.. 38th Parallel style..

We don't have anyone right now. The DNC elite likes to keep pushing through their ideal candidate. 2016 is pure example of that. If Hillary had picked Bernie for her VP, She may have squeezed out a win from the progressives. But she picked a unknown, Kamala fell into the same trap, She picked a unknown. She may have won PA if she picked Shapiro. But maybe even he knew it was a sinking ship.And We don't have anyone because the DNC is fucked up it failed to learn anything from Hillary or Biden from some degree. Trump is a populist, people who voted for him liked him. Can we really say the same for Biden? Even my vote for Biden back in 2020 was mostly due to my distaste of Trump and the mess he created, rather than me liking Biden or his polices . So even back in 2020? I really think most folk picked Biden just because the Alterative was Another four years of The Trump Dumpster fire at the time. Was Biden my first choice? nope, Was Kamala?                                                                                                                                                                                     Nope. Did i like either of them? nope. Would Kamala made a good president? probably. And I'll repeat this. Biden should have really dropped out before the Primary's maybe then we could have got somebody new and fresh voted in by the voters. Kamala was always going to be tied to Biden. And nobody picked her, because Biden took too long to drop out. But they were Gaslighting Biden the entire time. Dude is old and should have made it clear that he wasn't gonna seek a second term from the get go. But i still will say we needed Biden to bring normalcy back into politics.Obama was through and through a people person and it showed. People loved him. He held Gravitas. Kamala, again, it's just Hillary syndrome. Both would have made great presidents. (Hillary and Kamala) But i think their likability factor is what held both back, plus both were women. I have nothing against women. But i don't think this country is ready for a woman president just yet. And it showed i think both lost (Biden was the outliner and didn't technically lose to Trump) Democrats really need a super majority in both house and senate before they can push through a female candidate.You want somebody to win Against Maga? Then they need have the Gravitas of Obama, but the policy and adornment of Bernie.Picking Establishment Democrats backed by the elite ain't gonna win Democrats shit. This election has made me switch from Democrat to Independent, Until Democrats can get their shit together i aren't being associated with the damned party. This should have been an easy win.

Now, the argument against will be made that only Congress can declare war, but the War on Terror has really watered that argument down. Perhaps the \\"originalist\\" Supreme Court will rightly say that it must be a war declared by congress, but maybe not.Of course, it only takes a majority of Congress to get around the qualifier, but I would bet that declaring war on a country whose cooperation you need in order to deport their citizens back to them is counter-productive.","title":"Why Trumps threats of mass deportation appealed to some Latino voters"},{"text":"This is the 3rd time Bynum defeated DeRemer.

I am a lifelong Republican but I often study the left and try to understand what they actually believe. I watch Democracy Now, Kyle Kulinsky, the Young Turks, Jimmy Dore (before he became conservative), and other more radical leftists such as Second Thought and Hakim. They have a few good ideas such universal healthcare, living wages, and rants against the abuses of private equity firms. But other than that they are pretty delusional especially on what they believe the \\"the right\\" stands for. The right wing is not a bunch of fascists and racists. Right wingers mostly just want to be left alone. The P'nut the squirrel story is a recent example of what Republicans are anxious about. Government goons kicked in a man's door, invaded his home and killed his pets for dubious reasons because he didn't have the proper permits and paperwork to have a pet squirrel. This is why right wingers are obsessed with guns. We are not authoritarians. We deeply fear authoritarians and government over reach. We know things could have gone much worse. Ruby Ridge and the Waco Massacre are known tragedies to almost every right winger. Our government is capable of so much evil and has done horrendous things over the years. The conservatives were initially fooled by Bush and 9/11 but now most believe it was 9/11 was an inside job. Our own government did that or the intelligence agencies that have gone rogue did 9/11. The Republicans had to lose in 2008 to Obama to reinvent the party after we discovered the truth of our betrayal. We had to cast out the Bush wing of the party and that required losing elections. In the aftermath it led to the rise of the Tea-Party which then morphed into MAGA and the rise of Trump.Briefly in 2011 both the LEFT and the RIGHT saw eye to eye at Occupy Wall Street. This scared the wealthy ruling class so they created wedge issues along racial and gender line to divide us. Both sides were saying fuck the banks and fuck the bailouts. From the right wing perspective the bailout was a betrayal of Capitalism and the free market. The bailout was socialism for the rich and a total mockery of what conservatives believed in for the last century. So there was a 2nd casting out of devil from the Republican around this time. It manifested in the rejection of the Mitt Romney wing of the party in 2012. There was an awaking around Ron Paul and the desire to END the FED. This awakening led to the financial elite being kicked out of the Republican party. And afterwards they found refuge in the Democrats in the fallout after Mitt Romney's defeat. The Wall Street bankers were no longer welcome in the Republican party so they became Democrats as wolves in sheep's clothing. This why in 2016 Wall Street was bankrolling Hillary Clinton to defeat Bernie and the populist MAGA Republicans. We kicked them out of the party and rallied around Trump. The Republicans are a populist party now similar to how they once were under Teddy Roosevelt. History doesn't repeat but it often rhymes.","title":"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost"},{"text":"Your statement is based on a bunch of beliefs.

The billions of dollars in equipment has helped significantly to stem the tide since most pre-war Ukrainian stockpiles are all but dried up, so I agree that it would be a waste of money if Ukraine totally loses but the funding hasnt been enough to counter Russian gdp into defense ($145 billion annually as of September 2024, well above current roughly $180 billion total that Ukraine has received since the beginning of the war). Will it actually push the Russians back, no it wont until Ukraine gains a significant footing on the battlefield to do so and more soldiers to use that equipment. These supplies have given Ukraine the edge to survive and given themselves footing to potentially negotiate, at this point without the support, Id be willing to bet everything east of the Dnipro river would be Russian held if not. Ukraine is more threatening, but not threatening enough to accomplish total victory, a peace deal is though in the cards. Russia is already in Europe and on the border of multiple NATO nations and gaining 4 additional provinces in the only country left that can be easily exploited in Europe for military gain isnt going to threaten Europe more than it already is. NATO has a slightly different problem set this trump presidency since there is a war going on, Trumps argument that NATO needs to carry its fair share doesnt have as much bite anymore. Dont get me wrong, this is still an issue and there is still more to be done, but military rearmament and modernization has already been happening prior to the election. In 2023 only 10 countries were spending their required 2% GDP on defense, now its 23/32 in 2024 (July), so its improving and is likely to increase given that its not easy to shift economies that quickly from prior below 2% input, other members are catching up. What is best for Ukraine is best for Europe, that is the most obvious thing here. They want to regain their lost provinces and join NATO. If that happens, what else does Russia have to do in Europe militarily? Take more of land-locked Moldova through Transnistria? Not likely. So Im a bit confused on your argument, what do you propose? I will throw out that a very unlikely COA would be continued attrition at a greater rate of at least 7:1 would turn this conflict into Ukrainian hands, but theyre barely meeting 2:1 / 3:1.","title":"Trump couldn't build a working wall in the US, so he'll try to build one in Ukraine.. 38th Parallel style..

While \\"regular conversations\\" discussing anti-vaccines, horse de-wormer, climate change being a hoax, JFK coming back and a whole host of other conspiracy theories are highly interesting for a lot of the pleb folks, you can understand why the so called \\"liberal elitist snobs\\" don't care to participate or listen to these types of shows and obviously not hold them in high regard. Mumps, measles and rubella, stuff the US hasn't seen in 50 years, are now sprouting up across the US as a result of listening to this type of stuff. It's akin to watching ghost hunters or finding bigfoot shows. The conspiracy theories the left has are right in front of your face, trumps tariffs will actually cause more inflation, getting rid of 11 million undocumented workers will harm the agricultural segment thus causing higher prices, not to mention the exorbitant cost of doing so, trumps policies will have drastic negative effects on climate change and global warming. But these are boring and require thought. There isn't a left wing equivalent of Joe Rogan to make those things interesting to the plebs. Instead, what is interesting is to say those are all lies and hoaxes (in this case by scientists, doctors and economists aka \\"liberal elitist snobs\\" as you say) and that is the shit that sells. It's more interesting to not know shit and say it's not true than it is to not know shit and believe the experts. Simple as that. There isn't a left wing equivalent of Joe Rogan for just that reason. If there were anything close, it would be Jon Stewart or John Oliver or Steven Colbert.

If Biden ran again he likely wouldve lost too. The demographic shifts are interesting but its pointless to play the blame game and it comes across as if these voter groups are all monoliths who dont think for themselves. Republicans played to the plights of Americans better, albeit they lied a shit ton to achieve that.Even if you ran the most charismatic Democrat with the best interviews/rallies possible, the death knell for the election on the Democrat side was the economy.Republicans did an excellent job of propagandizing the economy, to put the entirety of the blame on the current administration. Is there some blame? Sure, but contextually the federal reserve as its own entity handles/tracks unemployment and inflation. Theres not exactly much Biden can do when youre coming right out of a global pandemic and supply chains are fucked.Conveniently, republicans will never admit that Trump handled COVID poorly, and suggest that the high unemployment and chaotic economic conditions at the time were his fault.The reality is, neither Trump nor Biden were responsible for the chaotic economic conditions that resulted from a global pandemic that shut the world down for almost 2 years.Anyway, the Dems really had only one shot to win the election imo. It wasnt catering to the I/P conflict or Ukraine, nor was it really about immigration/abortion.The economy trumped all, and the Dems didnt really address it that well. To be fair, its hard to address such an economic condition that isnt exactly your administrations fault, but the entire public thinks it is. There couldve at least been better interviews and discussions where Dems navigated the criticism better, but imo in hindsight this was an unwinnable election.Argue with me if you want but I truly think the economy was the hot button issue of this election. Most voters are emotive, in that they dont necessarily have some strong foundation for their beliefs thats rooted in objective analysis, but rather how theyre made to feel.Republicans have propagandized for 4 years blaming Biden for everything that resulted from COVID, which occurred under Trump, and now that things are settling Trump will be able to claim victory for an economy that he wasnt responsible for building back up. In 2029 the US will have seen a relatively uneventful economy for 4 years and the republicans will be seen as the heroes of the 20s. The cycle will continue.Truzp only lost in 2020 because of COVID, he wouldve won otherwise.I think going forward Dems need a new plan of attack. Hinging support based on abortion for the women vote clearly did not see nearly as many women voting as it has in the past. They need to account for this.","title":"Latinos may not be to blame for Trumps win, but they will surely bear the brunt of his bad policies"},{"text":"Was the democratic governor funded by AIPAC?","title":"AP Race Call: Donald Trump wins Nevada"},{"text":"Get over it, one thing we all know by now is that the ubber rich and the politicians are above any of our laws, its a fact of life.","title":"Trump voted, so is everyone good with convicted felons voting now?"},{"text":"Yes, he was born in a rural area.

Kennedy Jr. threw down several very big gauntlets after taking office.  He rattled things, Nationally and Globally.  He was elected to serve for 1158 days, and after pissing a whole bunch of establishments off, he was able to serve 733 of them before the abrupt ending of his term. By one, or more of those establishment's retort.Donald J. Trump got 1158 days already, and threw down some gauntlets during that time.Trump's back and throwing down bigger gauntlets against even bigger establishments and hasn't even reached day 1159 in the big chair.Throwing down any gauntlet is an idiom to denote the beginning of a challenge:[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/throw%20down%20the%20gauntlet](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/throw%20down%20the%20gauntlet)I'm not a praying person, typically, but the gauntlets he's tossing around would make much needed changes to the very core of establishments that have been bastardized, corrupted, captured, and made unrecognizable from their idealistic creations.  And behemoths don't like that.But, as each gauntlet is thrown, I find myself praying.  Because the nefarious capabilities of these ogres is almost limitless, and because we've allowed them to grow that dangerous.  And, I think there is some truth to the power of prayer, en-masse.This post is causing me to pray for the internet to just continue to exist, whether dead, or revived to their glorious days of the mid to late 1990's, the Wild West of information flow, as the challenged take the next steps after the gauntlet is thrown down.Trust me when I tell you, their gauntlet is bigger.  Much bigger.  And only by the internet of things,regardless of it being a decommissioned MILITARY SYSTEM, if it can be kept alive during the melee that follows this challenge, we will be able to try to do three critical things.1. If you agree, dig out your own itty-bitty gauntlet.  Polish it up and use it to be a prudent citizen journalist, or a voice of reason in activism towards restoring the ideal.  As I said, their gauntlet is way bigger, but, if a whole fuck-ton of us are pounding ours on their bunions, the giant can fall. And if and when it does, we can pound the skull in unison.\\n2. Monitor our world.  Time for the \\"alternate media sources\\" to get their comeuppance.  I'll use the example of AJ over at the Prison Planet.  He said the frogs are turning gay.  When I first heard that, I was convinced the dude was bat-shit crazy.  By digging deeper, searching wider, what have we found?  Ole AJ wasn't so far off, now, was he?  Use all available sources to verify or debunk what's being presented.  Please, and I really hate to say this, but, \\"Do your own research\\".  If you don't know how to research, or investigate the who, what, when, where, how, and the ever important why, you've got a couple of months to learn how.  Learn how.\\n3. Pray.  Pick the Creator(s) of your choosing, but, pray.  For anyone that believes in the resolution of an issue, we've got to try to get this man to 2316 total days in the big chair, unscathed.If we do these three things, I'm anxious to see what our world looks like afterward, or to ride my little piece of the smithereens off into the Ether when the whole thing blows up!Of the People.  By the People.  For the People.  Is that really a bad idea?","title":"FIERCE new rant from Trump on FREE SPEECH in his new administration..."},{"text":"Yup.Id be getting my daughter a really large well trained guard dog new best friend, though.\\nSome of these loons are going to take the joke too far.","title":"\\"Your body, MY choice\\": Emboldened far-right men taunt women on social media after Trump win | Women report receiving messages saying \\"we own your body now\\" and calling for them to be raped"},{"text":"Beverly Hills High...students celebrate Trump winJokes on them, they live in CA.","title":"No jumping.

I was shocked when he won and started really paying attention to the things he'd say vs. what media would say about him and started noticing that everything was totally blown out of proportion.

Felony Conviction in New York:  \\n   \\\\- Florida Residency: Since the individual is a resident of Florida, Florida's voting laws would apply to them, regardless of the fact that their conviction occurred in New York.  \\n   \\\\- Conviction Status: Florida law disqualifies individuals from voting once they are convicted of a felony, even if they have not yet been sentenced. So, even though the person has not yet been sentenced for the 20+ financial fraud felonies, the conviction itself disqualifies them from voting in Florida.  \\n  \\n2. Restoration of Voting Rights:  \\n   \\\\- Once the individual completes their sentence, including any prison time, probation, parole, and payment of fines, fees, or restitution, they may be eligible to have their voting rights restored under Floridas Amendment 4 (assuming the convictions are not for murder or felony sexual offenses).  \\n   \\\\- However, while they are awaiting sentencing, they are not eligible to vote in Florida.  \\n  \\nConclusion:  \\nBecause the individual has been convicted of multiple felonies in New York, they are disqualified from voting in Florida, even though they have not yet been sentenced. They would need to wait until they have completed their entire sentence (including financial obligations) to determine if they can restore their voting rights under Florida law.  \\n  \\nIf the person is unsure of their status, it is always a good idea to consult legal counsel or check with the Florida Division of Elections for clarification.","title":"Trump voted, so is everyone good with convicted felons voting now?"},{"text":"Your governor denied a call for aid due to the political party of the caller.

Ukraine doesnt have the manpower nor the weaponry sufficient enough to rid Russia of the Ukrainian provinces it occupies. In a traditional sense, the attacker should have a 3:1 ration of troops to successfully defeat the defender. So a Ukrainian counter-offensive is just not very feasible, one already failed, one is a bargaining chip (this is huge and should not be seen lightly), and the other one caught Russia by surprise which will likely not happen again or yield little gain. Ukraine just, in my opinion, wont win this war outright unless they do something drastic that would likely be suicidal for themselves. The unfortunate realistic plan here is to stop the bloodshed. Ukraine and Russia would need at least 5-10 years to recover losses of machinery and about 20-30 years to recoup manpower (depending on if people have babies or not, likely incentive programs will be enacted by the government). During this time, Ukraine would be foolish not to prepare their own deterrent through defenses and other means that isnt NATO membership. The next best thing besides NATO membership is force presence. NATO troops from varying nations would very likely establish joint bases in Ukraine, more likely at airfields, and sit in place to train and equip Ukrainian troops while acting as a deterrent at key locations that Ukraine would need to defend itself. Russia would have to be very calculated when they come for round two to not hit NATO troops. And in that 20 year lull of not being able to join NATO, Ukraine will just have to bide its time with the next best thing besides a military alliance, force presence from that alliance. So, thats my thought on this. While yes this isnt the most favorable end for Ukraine having to ceed a lot of its land but its the best solution to end the war in what looks like itll continue for at least the next 2ish years and probably continue to slowly shift more and more favorable for Russia. Just look at the Kursk offensive, Ukraine needed that to draw forces away from places they were losing and losing fast and they needed a bargaining chip for negotiations, Ukraine sees this is the best opportunity it has before more territory is taken. Russia will bleed and grind its troops for as long as necessary to win an inch of land per day, their cost-benefit analysis doesnt bode well for Ukraine realistically achieving its ultimate goal of total recovery of its lost territories. I watch this war intently with great hope Ukraine wins, but that optimism can only go so far based on the current events and feasible COAs available to Ukraine. I do hope they kick Russias ass back to the Stone Age though, SLAVA UKRAINI!!!","title":"Trump couldn't build a working wall in the US, so he'll try to build one in Ukraine.. 38th Parallel style..

While Russias historical invasions and national security concerns are understandable, its essential to recognize that NATOs expansion was not a covert threat to Russia but rather a response to the requests of Eastern European countries that, after years of Soviet dominance, sought the security NATO offers. For them, the NATO alliance was a guarantee against the type of coercive influence or military intervention Russia has shown in places like Georgia and Ukraine.NATO, while a military alliance, is defensive by nature, and its expansion wasnt aimed at threatening Russia but at ensuring stability in the region. Many former Soviet states joined NATO out of a desire to align with democratic, transparent governments, something Russia itself could have worked toward but chose not to. Putins Russia has instead leaned into authoritarianism, which many neighboring countries rightfully fear and wish to distance themselves from.The argument that Western hubris provoked Russia is complex but overlooks that these countries voluntarily sought closer ties with the West, not because of any Western hegemony push but because they saw it as a path to democratic governance and economic progress. Additionally, while the U.S. has made mistakes in its foreign policy, its misleading to suggest that supporting Ukraines sovereignty is on par with the more aggressive or unprovoked wars the U.S. has initiated in the past. Ukraines desire for independence and alignment with the West is grounded in its own historical experience, not solely a result of Western influence.Furthermore, while historical context provides perspective on Russias actions, it doesnt excuse them. Sovereign nations, regardless of proximity to Russia, have the right to self-determination without fear of invasion. The onus is on Putins regime to recognize that times have changed; territorial expansion and dominance are neither justifiable nor sustainable in todays interconnected world. Instead of viewing NATO as a threat, Russia could seek peaceful relations, which would benefit its economy and citizens far more than continual militarization and authoritarian control.its fair to critique Western foreign policy decisions, but suggesting they forced Russias hand is a stretch. The focus should remain on condemning unjust aggression and supporting nations in choosing their paths freely.","title":"Think you know how bad Trump unleashed will be?

Iran is known to be a longtime Russian ally. ?Iran also sells their oil to China, which is a nightmare scenario for Israelis hoping that Trump will ease their troubles because China might intervene on behalf of Iran. By now, we all know Trump is funded by Putin.?The Ukraine War has predictably lead to economic losses. But if you notice, long time allies Russia and Iran are both at war. Historically, the IDF has had no trouble defending itself. This time is different. Iran and its proxies have made the conflict un-winnable for Israel.?So, where is Iran getting all of its money to fight Israel?? Simple, China. Thats right, China is currently purchasing oil from Iran. Because Iran has been sanctioned, their oil is dirt cheap which allows China to undercut all the other exporters. China has the second highest energy consumption of the world and Iran currently supplies ~20% of that energy.?? ?Moving on, Trump has proposed to repeal the CHIPS ACT. This piece of legislation ensures that America, not China, is the global leader in computer chips. However, China seems to be doing everything imaginable to catch up, although still failing. But repealing the CHIPS ACT will likely mean that Russian missiles will now use American or Taiwanese computer chips for their complex missile guidance systems. On board these missiles are several hundred computer chips. Just imagine, Intels top of the line processor can cost $1000 dollars. Now imagine, that times a hundred and you start to realize why the CHIPS ACT was so essential to Ukraine and Israel. And you can now see why Russia has been cautious to use missiles. Likewise, Iran has also been cautious to use missiles. But with the CHIPS ACT repealed, you can bet China will exchange computer chips for cheap oil, thereby hurting Israel. Its possible Trump will save Israel but we are talking at the very end after Tel Aviv or Jerusalem are smothering in flames from a barrage of Iranian missiles. Even then, China might step up to protect Iran as a crucial oil supplier.? https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-axis-of-evasion-behind-chinas-oil-trade-with-iran-and-russia/","title":"What to know about Trumps history of support for Israel"},{"text":"I'm more concerned about Trump ordering atrocities here at home.

Obama and Hillary would run against each other with Hillary barely losing the Democratic primaries. Then Obama would have Hillary the Secretary of State. Then Hillary would run again in 2016 and the Dems thought they would have another 8 years of power. They were wrong.Trump threw a monkey wrench into their plan for 16 years of rule. hence, the libs were so mad and created a slander campaign at Trump out of their asses. Obama, Hillary, and Kamala are all diversity hires. I did not know who the f Obama was prior to 2007. I heard him in an episode of 30 Rock and that he was a Black guy and was a Senator repping Illinois. Then all the Facebook hoopla from Millennials to vote for Obama because he happens to be Black. Gee, we can see that. What else can he offer?I wouldnt go far to say Hillary was a diversity hire. She was the former First Lady, Senator for New York, and Secretary of State. But I think people wanted Trump to run because they knew he never stood a chance against Hillary. While Sarah Palin was a diversity hire for the GOP to counter the diversity hire of Obama in 2008. Then Kamala was a diversity hire for Biden after they debated in 2019 and Kamala called out Bidens connections to China and the KKK. Then they kissed and made up and became running mates.For about 80 years in Hollywood, we were already brainwashed to believe in the WHITE MALE hero. The WHITE MALE protagonist to always save the day. Superman, Batman, Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, and so on. The great white hope. For the last 8 years, Hollywood is now trying to vilify WHITE MALES by emasculating them. See Dial of Destiny or Daemon Targaryen in Season 2 of House of the Dragon going from masculine and war hero into a soy boy in Luigis Mansion.Hollywood now wants us to root for the female or the person of color while trying to make us hate white guys because being macho is mean. Being masculine is toxic. Being a man means misogynistic. It started with the #metoo movement in 2017 and then led to DEI WOKEness thanks to George Floyd and BLM. Its like, hey, please love Rey Skywalker! Shes cooler than Kylo Ren! Please love Galadriel in The Rings of Power! That Mary Sue and Karen? Please enjoy the repressed lesbianism between Alicent and Rhaenyra. And being queer is so cool! Accept and accept or we will call you whatever -ists or a homophobe!! ??And if we reject their woke nonsense, diversity hires like Moses Ingram and Amandla Stenberg will attack us and call us racists and sexists. We are tired of the Hollywood radicals from the Left telling us who to vote for and who to like. They will suppress or censor our opinions if we dont match theirs. They feel self-entitled if we dont approve what they offer which is mostly race-baiting and identity politics. Trump basically defeated two diversity hires from the Democrats. And the one time he supposedly lost, he lost to a white guy, the very thing Hollywood has tried to destroy during the last 8 years by vilifying them to make the female or POC look better.What adds even more irony is Trump increased his minority voters. Even the minorities and women got sick of Hollywoods bullshit.https://preview.redd.it/gbdc525kvtzd1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2087378632297f129cc1c06abd86cca7e727f9b","title":"Lost footage of Oprah in the 90s telling Trump he would make a great president??"},{"text":"waiting on his knees, ass up for trump's dong.","title":"Trump AG Prospect Warns Letitia James: 'We Will Put Your Fat Ass In Prison'"},{"text":"1 or 2 cases, is it? you know you're talking bollocks. if you don't, you're more clueless than i first thought.when laws change, there's no precedent. doctors are forced to work outside the law, these cases take time to get to court before the process can be examined/litigated and precedent set. in the meantime, medical staff work at risk, politicians utterly divorced from the front line pontificate, and women are left in limbo, getting so ill they have to reach the point of imminent death before treatment is deemed legal.before you tell others what they're hearing, you should start paying more attention to what's actually going on on the front line, rather than trying to push what others are or should be thinking, or who they should be blaming. as previously - quit being smug. women are dying, for perverse ideological reasons. good medicine, it is not, it's inhumane.","title":"Can anyone explain to me how any American citizen's rights are actually in reality in any way different based on the election results?"},{"text":"The constitution guarantees the Incoming President equal protection under the law.","title":"Trump AG Prospect Warns Letitia James: 'We Will Put Your Fat Ass In Prison'"},{"text":"I dont know why youre acting like a huge group of people massing on a public school campus isnt an issue.","title":"No jumping.

Truer words I've never seen, and it sucks this will be lost in the scrap heap the conspiracy sub has become. I've got a similar back story, in that my family was almost exclusively Dem and it was accepted that they were the party for the blue collar, with an anti-war, anti-big business, party \\"of the people\\". To put it it as succinctly as possible, the R and D roles have completely flipped from when I was younger (I'm 40). My parents still are lost in their Dem haze, and the reason is they, and I assume this is the cause for a lot of folks, have been unable to break free from the mainstream media programming (literally and figuratively). My family went to start with them fur a couple weeks, and MSNBC was on literally all day. 8 hours a day (they're retired). No fucking wonder they think the way they do. And it's not *entirely* their fault; the media is used as a propaganda tool now, which was made legal by Obama. Lastly, I want to echo your sentiments regarding Bernie, Tulsi, and RFK Jr; to any objective observer, watching what the Dem party did to their brightest stars should be a damning indictment as to the party's true goals and motivations. Anyone that was not 100% in step with the party was shunned (and this ousting of any dissent is copied down to their grassroots organizations currently). This will be their undoing, as without a complete overhaul, the DNC will be beaten for the next decade+.

It could have been much worse.# It was bad. I don't need to tell you that. Trump won the popular vote, all of the 7 swing states. All of the country (except Washington state) shifted right. The GOP will control the Senate 53-47 and the House too (by single digit margins). The obvious one, they will control the SCOTUS for decades. They also ended Democratic trifectas in MI and MN.It could have been worse. If Roe wasn't overturned, Dems would have had red tsunamis in 2022 and 2024. Democrats kept control of important Senate seats (AZ, GA, PA, NV in 2022 and AZ, NV, WI and MI in 2024). Democrats in most districts outperformed Harris (both in 22 and 24).Headwinds were against Dems. Only 28% of the country thought it was going in the right direction. This created apathy for Dems and non-voters, and ammunition for Republicans. Democrats messed up the politics of immigration (see [link 1](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/how-the-democrats-bungled-the-politics-of-immigration-0569acfc), [link 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-immigration-border.html); archive [link 1](https://archive.ph/jRLWF), [link 2](https://archive.ph/KI2iT)) Incumbents lost badly all over the world post pandemic. **Dobbs gave Dems a fighting chance.** Harris ran a good (but not great) campaign. She had real momentum. Swing states only shifted right by a margin of 3.6 percentage points whilst the country as a whole shifted 6.7 points. Biden dropping out was a good thing. His internal polling showed that he would have lost in a landslide (https://x.com/socdem\\\\_michael/status/1855032681224192140). Sadly he still ran for re-election, and his worsening condition was kept hidden. Harris was the unpopular VP, and she wouldn't distance herself from him, so she was facing the same anti-incumbency backlash.Trump won despite being a terrible candidate, not because voters like him. A more competent Republican would have won MN, VA, NH, ME statewide, NE-2 and NM (even NJ, NY, RI and CT). Backlash against him and his policies will be severe.Where are we now?

The Federal Reserve has a central governing board, the Board of Governors, which is an independent agency that guides the operations of the Federal Reserve. The Board of Governors is accountable to Congress.?* **Federal Reserve Banks**The Federal Reserve Banks are private corporations that are overseen by the Board of Governors. The Reserve Banks are not owned by the government, but they exist because of an act of Congress.?\\n* **Federal Reserve employees**Federal Reserve Bank employees are not civil service employees.?\\n* **Monetary policy**The Federal Reserve is responsible for setting monetary policy, which it does by controlling three tools: open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements.?I just checked on this: The Federal Reserves are NOT Civil Service Employees.

A bullet graze is distinctly different in nature from the trauma that causes cauliflower ear. Cauliflower ear, medically termed perichondrial hematoma, results from blunt trauma, where force compresses the ear tissue against the cartilage. This type of injury disrupts blood flow to the cartilage, causing a blood clot between the skin and cartilage, which can then lead to cartilage death and a fibrous tissue buildup, resulting in the characteristic lumpy, swollen appearance. In contrast, a bullet graze involves a high-velocity projectile that typically causes a superficial abrasion or laceration along the skin without the compressive force necessary to separate the skin and cartilage. This distinction is crucial because the high-velocity trauma from a bullet, especially a grazing impact, does not generate the conditions required to form cauliflower ear.Prompt medical intervention is another significant factor. Cauliflower ear generally develops when hematomasblood clots or pools between the skin and cartilagego untreated. By contrast, immediate medical care, such as drainage and compression, can prevent the tissue changes that lead to cauliflower ear, even if there were a risk. The treatment Trump received promptly after the injury would have effectively minimized any potential hematoma formation, further reducing the chance of cauliflower ear. The absence of cauliflower ear in this case aligns with both the nature of the injurybeing a bullet graze rather than blunt traumaand the immediate medical response provided.The claim that cauliflower ear should be expected as a result of Trumps injury does not align with the medical understanding of how such conditions develop. The injury type, a bullet graze, combined with rapid treatment, does not result in the blood accumulation or cartilage damage necessary for cauliflower ear. Consequently, the absence of cauliflower ear does not disprove the occurrence of the shooting incident, given the specific nature of the injury and the prompt medical care received.Hope this helps.","title":"Iranian Agents Plotted to Kill Donald Trump, Justice Department Says"},{"text":"I expect this as well.

Its unfortunate that mainstream media often plays a major role in fueling hate, polarization and distortion of reality. Social media thrives on outrage, and with the news industry primarily ad-funded, the pressure to capture attention is high in our noisy world. To stand out, news companies frequently resort to sensationalized, rage-bait headlines, exaggerated claims, and even outright falsehoods, intensifying divisions further.Many people tend to forget that mainstream news articles are written by individuals with their own political views and biases. Rather than striving for neutrality, some reporters openly use their platforms to promote personal agendaslike wielding the influence of a massive social media following.When people exclusively consume news and opinions from sources strongly skewed to one side of the political spectrum, they can become indoctrinated. With enough repetition, almost any idea can seem credible when its the only message being heard. Since these audiences often view traditional media as authoritative, theyre more likely to uncritically accept whatever theyre told while dismissing any contrary information that doesnt come from their preferred trusted sources.It's also good to be aware that in modern politics people are inventing new terminology all the time. They invent a new term or concept that sounds noble and positive. But then their actual definition of that term is twisted in a way that it helps them to drive their own political agenda. For example the term \\"positive discrimination\\" means that people can be treated unfairly based on their race, religion, color of their skin etc., primarily to the detriment of the group of people who represent the majority, which is basically racism. But for some people suddenly racism becomes \\"acceptable\\" or even desirable when we just redefine it as \\"positive discrimination\\".For a happier, healthier life, its often better to limit exposure to politics and the negativity-driven news cycle altogether. However, if one does follow news and politics, its essential to learn to separate fact from opinion, which is challenging for the reasons mentioned. It helps to consult diverse information sources and approach issues calmly, without letting emotions cloud judgment. The goal is to think critically about strategies and solutions that would genuinely benefit the country and its people.Unfortunately, most people dont take the time to question what theyre told; they simply accept it as truth.I'm glad you have found your way out of the biased echo chamber.","title":"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost"},{"text":"Literally found by a jury?

Your post was polite and seemed sincere (or had the semblance thereof) so I am trying very hard to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I have read it several times trying to understand your viewpoint, but I cant get past the fact that I feel as if there are some inconsistencies or things you are leaving out.  I was honestly half asleep when I came across your post, but it bugged me so much that I felt inclined to respond.  I am still quite tired so I wont drone on too long, but I am hoping that you will be kind enough to answer a few of the many things that stood out to me.1.  You mentioned seeing Bush as a corrupt war criminal, so I assume you are at least my age give or take few years (mid 40s).  I did as well.  Actually, the 2000 election and the Bush Presidency, War on Terror, and all associated propaganda is what led me to start questioning everything in the political arena.  That is when I began obsessively researching issues and candidates, their voting records and campaign funding, as well as viewing multiple news sources including international news.  Fox News became the dominant news network during this period, and everyone was talking about it - either because they thought it was great, or because they thought it was shocking and appalling.  It was truly a cultural phenomenon at the time, yet you never watched it?  Even once to see what the fuss was all about?  Similarly, you reference the 2 different news articles about Trump (your airport story).  How was this your first experience seeing a political figure portrayed in two starkly different lights?  Honestly, this feels a little disingenuous, as if you are implying that Trump is some sort of victim, the first political figure to ever be portrayed this way.  You were cognizant enough about politics to see Bush as a warmonger, you honestly never saw any news sources praising him?  How about Obama?  He was often portrayed as both a Savior and the Anti-Christ, depending on the magazine or news station.  2.  You are a Scientist but never did any political research until Trump?  This seems strange for someone whose career is literally based upon research.3.  170 or so days ago you were advocating for Trump to be arrested for war crimes, on this site.  What changed?4.  Could please elaborate on what you mean by the very fine people hoax, and the other hoaxes that you mention?I have so many more questions, but I have written way more than I intended.  If you are as sincere as you say, surely you wont mind elaborating on these.  There are many young people on this sub and I think it is important to be honest.","title":"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost"},{"text":"Trump is pretty close...","title":"Rogan pleads with Trump: Choose unity, not revenge"},{"text":"Are you making the claim that Trump is not a convicted felon?","title":"Trump voted, so is everyone good with convicted felons voting now?"},{"text":"There are enough left leaning or nearly called seats to get us around 214.

This is how all sitting presidents should act, and am sure Trump would do the same if they touched Biden.I also really dislike the US going to war with foreign countries, so I am not sure this should justify a war. He was tasked with hatching a plan on how to kill Trump, but it doesnt seem like Iran gave them the green light to follow through with the plan and we dont know how high up the perpetrators of this plan actually are in the Iranian regime. If they were just waiting for Trump to lose the election and the US has evidence the green light was actually going to be given, then boy did Iran bet on the wrong horse. If that is the case, they are basically giving the US to justification and green light and reciprocate the exact type of plans against Iranian leaders as they were planning to do against the  US. The only difference is the US is much more capable of actually successfully executing such a plan.

They sucked the blood right out of him.  Complete vampires.  And they mocked him and laughed at him while they did it. Practically do his face towards the end.Trump needs to learn that the way you control large scale administrative bureaucracies is to replace them.  Fire the fuckers.  If the agency isn't critical delete it entirely.  If it is critical then tear down the old one and replace it with a new one. Anything short of that they are going to do everything they can to fuck you. They will do anything to protect their positions and protect the status quo.   All change is bad change as far as they are concerned. They rose to the top of the current system and any other system they wouldn't qualify to be janitors.  They are willing to do anything, say anything.  They will sabotage everything you try to do.  They are the enemies within.  They need to be removed.

That is the only way you can do it.  Nothing they do is magical, difficult, valuable or useful.  They could be replaced by anybody off the street and accomplish about the same job with the same efficiency.  So that is what you need to do. I don't think that Trump understands that.  I don't think that anybody in the American government realizes that these big mighty agencies really are not that important and are not that sacred.  Not the department of transportation, not the Pentagon, the department of education, FBI, CIA, FCC, or any of other 400+ agencies.   They are replaceable, they are disposable.  Full of paper tigers and monuments of complacency. Right now they are sacred cows. Untouchable.  The media and half the country practically worships them.  These sacred cows need to be taken to the slaughter house, figuratively.  They are diseased. Almost nothing they do is important and what they do that is important is done poorly, if at all.The only thing that will get them to improve is for Trump to put the fear of god into them.

This goes for the Black vote, Arab American vote, Hispanic vote, Jewish vote, Asian American vote, working class vote, middle class vote, urban vote, suburban vote, youth vote, senior vote, etc. Despite the GOP's craziness, all of these demographics are still persuadable on *certain* issues, so we need to educate/inform where we can and focus the fight to issues where they'll see us as undeniably better for them.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 8, 2024"},{"text":"I thought it was college educated white males that shifted towards Harris.","title":"Bidens internal polling showed Trump getting 400 electoral votes"},{"text":"Yep.

Demographic analyses like this one are not looking to assign fault, although many people interpret it that way. The question this is suggesting is why trump won a greater percentage of support from demographic communities that he and the republicans have explicitly targeted. If you take a look at some of the cross section analyses, youll see that trump won majority support among lower and middle income people, who will bear the brunt of the P2025 changes. People making over $100k broke for Kamala. Young men 18-27 have been moving steadily to the right, and in one study I saw nationally broke for trump as well. Latino men broke strongly for trump, and he gained among Latinas as well. And yes, a surprising number of black men went for trump, especially given that this is the second (or third) time around. Its too late to do much about it now, and Im pretty sure the federal government is t going to be funding research into what happened in this election. My suspicion is that it was like an extreme version of the Brexit vote, where a significant number of voters were solely going off of the pro Brexit propaganda and had no idea what was actually on the table. There are a number of other factors as well, and they contributed to each other. Again, Im not assigning blame, but if working class white men had voted differently, even marginally, that would have changed the outcome. Trump is the person white people voted for, and a major plank in the republican platform is explicit white nationalism. The blame game is just shitty. What we need is a diagnosis and cure so that in twenty years or so the country can get better.","title":"Donald Trump Won More Black Voters Than Any Republican in 48 Years"},{"text":"Exactly. This highly complex issue isn't being comprehensively answered by one single factor that fits neat and tidy into a box. Of course, class/wealth plays a huge role, but so does race, so does gender, so does a whole host of factors. And they all overlap/intersect. Sticking just with race and class/wealth as was being discussed, a rich black person is going to likely do a lot better than a poor black person, but a rich white person is going to generally fare better than a similarly rich black person. In the Venn diagram overlap of all those factors, is gonna be what's most relevant to any given individual.It's class, but it's also race, but it's also both, and it's also gender, and it's sexuality, etc. Trying to reduce it to the one magic answer is vastly oversimplifying things (often so someone can push their preferred rhetoric)","title":"Bidens internal polling showed Trump getting 400 electoral votes"},{"text":"And Nancy Pelosi dancing nude in her living room with the blinds open on Friday nights.","title":"Congress could try barring Trump from office under 14th Amendment, but it likely wont"},{"text":"Its an exclusive genius.","title":"FEMA Official Ordered Relief Workers To Skip Houses With Trump Signs"},{"text":"The entire 2020 campaign, he said he was in for two terms","title":"Bidens internal polling showed Trump getting 400 electoral votes"},{"text":"Rogan challenged Trump by asking hard hitting questions like \\"what do you mean?\\"And when Trump couldn't answer that, Rogan knew he had been bested.","title":"Rogan pleads with Trump: Choose unity, not revenge"},{"text":"They aren't.

Medicare and social security? It would be an absolute blood bath at the polls. Seniors vote in force. Medicaid? Okay, that could happen but theres enough voters who depend on it that will have huge electoral consequences. Defense? The defense budget is bloated for sure but thats because its basically a de facto jobs program. We manufacture a ton of weapons and those jobs would just go poof.

As an underage asylum seeker also a young activist who came by planes was detained for much longer than illegal entrants who are open economic migrants. A lot of those entrants who are released arbitrary failed to appear immigration court. (The government admitted it quietly through statistics)2. Those who are Hispanics got extra care in the system. While other migrants like Asians and Indians are subject to discriminatory speeches and actions by staff.3. Most of the economic migrants have very low loyalty nor the will to Americanization, this can be easily told by English fluency and opposition to learning English.4. After I revealed that I am a political dissident and I am came by plane, an economic migrant who crossed the border illegally started leading bullying against me.5. After refusing to make sexual comments towards female staffs in the facilities and refused to participate in immoral sexual conduct claimed to be endorsed and supported by staff, I faced constant sexual harassments, rape threats and sexual abuses.6. Police report filed, California Department of Social Services sent an investigator (Hispanic) to my foster home to talk with me. His point is basically that if I complain about other migrants than that is unequal. (Very typical critical racial theoretical style of thinking). I also have been told repeatedly by workers in the system that \\"the reason why I came does not make me special\\" (I have presented how am I going to archieve legal residency once I arrived) and \\"you can't say that you are better than other migrants\\" (despite my grades in school can slap all of their faces, and I have never skipped school to work illegally like my \\"peers\\" do)7. My friend who is an activist, came as an adult to seek asylum (also in CA), he did a lot of work. One of his works is stopped an attack on US soil by translating the crime trailer by a CCP-supporter. 8. My friend came by plane, when he applied for bail from immigration jail. The judge rejected him because he did not crossed the border illegally, by law he is not an \\"illegal alien\\", therefore he has no jurisdiction. Later another judge set the bond to 15000 USD which is unusually high for criminals and illegal entrants.9. Chinese propaganda used his case against America, and claimed that there is no place for people who don't support the CCP, people with Chinese descent can only submit to the CCP, which is an easy way to connect Authoritarianism to \\"opposing racial oppression from Whites\\" and pushed more people to oppose the US and its values.10.

I'm the polar opposite of this thinking: I'm excited to soon earn my Masters degree, get a job that makes 4-5 times what I did, and actually be able to contribute to others' education/healthcare because we all live here together, and therefore we're all in this together.Some people can work their asses off to get through school - my hats off to you that you could, seriously. That's an immense amount of work and determination, and it shouldn't be downplayed. Not all of us can do that for whatever reason, though. Me, I'm in an accelerated program and there is literally not enough time for me to work and do school; the program warns you of this before applying, but I'll be done quicker and I only have to take out student loans for one school year instead of two. And some schools are so expensive that it doesn't matter how much you work - you're not going to make enough to live and pay for school.The doctors and surgeons that save peoples lives? That may save yours and somebody you love's life? They most likely have student debt, and a shit TON. Teachers? Debt. Lawyers? Debt. Social workers? Debt. Even those who go into trades have to pay for that training in some way, and if grants aren't enough, I'll give you one guess what will finance their education. If you said student loans, you win. All these people who contribute to society - and to your life, I bet, in some way - were only able to do this because they took out student loans. And most of them are mired down in that debt - even the doctors; only the highly specialized ones are well-off, and they usually came from money to begin with. My own doctor does okay for her family, but we've commiserated over student debt. My friend who majored in economics and mathematics has a good job but still has to share an apartment with his partner and his best friend. They cannot afford anything else, and student debt is a big reason why. The only friend I had who paid off her student debt by 30 was a therapist, and her parents are well off; like, they gave her a down payment for a home in a HCOL area. And student loans are seriously fucked up: another friend of mine is a teacher, but we live in a state and area that pays teachers pretty well. He's a Marine veteran and got some assistance with college from that, and got a BS in...not gonna lie, I can't remember but it's one of the sciences. He got his teaching credential, and has been a teacher for about 20 years. A while back he was telling me how he finally qualified for a certain amount of loan forgiveness. Because, you see, even after paying for 20 YEARS, he still hadn't paid it off. Technically, the principal itself only went down by $300 in that amount of time -he'd been paying off interest.And I'll point out...most degrees these days are $100k, and liberal arts degrees cover a lot of different subjects, including the natural sciences (biology, physics, etc). If you meant an art degree, I'll then point at that if you enjoy movies and TV with any amount of CGI, the people who have to create it usually have to go to school to learn those skills...and that costs money, which brings us back to student loans.So...if you're really against paying for others' student loans in any way, shape or form, I would never go to the doctor or any kind of healthcare provider including pharmacies; never see a lawyer if you need legal services; if you have children (or plan to have any) then definitely don't have them be taught by a teacher; don't watch any movies or TV ever again; and you should probably feel resentful or something about being paid because at least a few of the people involved in the accounting department (or whoever puts together your paycheck) probably has student debt. Basically, a good portion of people under 45 have student debt, and we are drowning. Many of my friends will never own a home. I chose not to have kids, and a big factor in that was because I could not afford it. My friend, we ARE suffering. We're just not suffering in the same way you did.","title":"Trump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies"},{"text":"I dont remember seeing it. He was just claiming it.
