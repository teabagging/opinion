But in the wake of 10/7 the antisemitic parts of the DNC are loudly demanding that Democrat politicians openly support them in their antisemitism.

The Supreme Court acted on it in the 1970s improperly. The way the case went, they effectively made a law, which they arent allowed to do (separation of powers). If Congress had made laws about it, then it wouldnt have been an issue. A few years back, SCOTUS overturned that ruling and effectively admitted that it was improper. (the real conspiracy being the timing in which it was dropped) This effectively turned it back over to the states to decide as there is no federal law on it. Immigration is a federal law (and the conspiracy is that one side doesnt really enforce it).

That means it is orders of magnitude more difficult if you don't live in a city that has an existing homeschooling support network.

I'd start by mentioning that there are a lot of ways to decrease the number of abortions- such as by providing more sex ed and contraception, which the GOP is against.

That GOP plans mean women, even those who want to carry the child to term, can't get the care they need, which puts mother and baby at risk. And after birth, the GOP's gutting social safety nets, making maternity leave harder, and otherwise making it hard to be a parent.Regarding the \\"doomed either way\\" mindset, I'd say that you don't just vote because you think it's in the bag.

Most reasonable people are open-minded enough to realize it's also okay for your views and opinions to evolve and change over time as well. Recognize that your current ideals and viewpoints are built from your experiences and surroundings so far. As you grow and experience new things, interact with different people from different places, different upbringings, and different cultures, who've lived different lives than you, these experiences should have some sort of effect on you and your perception.And as far as politicians go, their job is not to impose their personal beliefs and opinions on the masses. Their job is to put their personal opinions aside and listen to the wants and needs of the people, and represent those people by being the voice for those who chose them as their representative. If you can honestly say that you still maintain the exact same viewpoint and opinion you formed immediately when you were presented an idea or situation for the first time, I'd say you're either a liar or an unfortunate individual who's incapable of rationalization, adaptation and growth as a person.The world is endlessly evolving and changing. The world don't give a fuck about you or your feelings. It will continue to evolve and continue to change with or without you. You either keep up or get left behind.Especially in politics, if I see someone is relentlessly married to their personal ideals and unwilling to waver to some degree, they're running for office to satisfy their own need for power and personal enrichment. They're not running to influence change to better the lives of the people they represent. Politics within a democracy is an endless cycle of give and take. Knowing when to hold your ground and when to compromise.If you really are the same person you were 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and still holding the same opinions and beliefs about the world and society around you, then I feel bad for you for not ever experiencing something in life so far out of the norm for you that it truly impacts you and sticks with you.

However, I think public schooling is set up for the median. The kids on either end of the bell curve are either left behind and confused, but passed because of NCLB, or bored and unchallenged. Homeschooling offers the flexibility to better serve both of those subsections of students-- more time for students who are struggling with one-on-one attention and help, or fast tracking through concepts that are easy and moving on to more advanced study.Also, homeschooling offers the ability to do sit down, be quiet, pay attention schooling for far less than the 6+ hours that kids in public school are having to endure. Many students could benefit from two-three hours of hard study, and then more hands on, play-based, field trip style education that homeschool offers the flexibility for. As for the social component-- there are so many options for community extracurriculars now: sports, music, theater, playgroups, etc. These outside of school interactions are just as capable of offering them the social learning necessary to growing up and understanding other humans.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Yeah, but this is (D)ifferent.","title":"Barack Obama Tries Debunked Very Fine People Hoax in Closing Message"},{"text":"Theyll be back on the squirrel news.

Nate Silver, a fellow pollster, recently complained that his peers were hedging their bets by?[forecasting a close race](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/0/who-win-2024-us-election-expert-predictions-next-president/)?C the Registers prediction has burst through that consensus.If once the forecast might have been greeted with disbelief, Ms Selzers heavyweight credentials mean that it has to be taken seriously.One of her strengths is thought to be that she is based in Iowa, rather than Washington, DC or New York like other big-name pollsters, and knows how to reach regular Americans.While a long-time resident of the Hawkeye State, Ms Selzer was born a few states along, in Kansas.Even if she might have seemed destined for life as a pollster C conducting a survey of neighbourhood moms at the age of five, according to the Wall Street Journal C she undertook a pre-medical course at the University of Kansas before finding her heart lay in data.She took up a communications theory and research program at the University of Iowa, followed by an academic fellowship in Britain and a stint on Capitol Hill, then returned to the state permanently.While at the Des Moines Register in 1987, Ms Selzer dug through the newspapers polling data and questioned its conclusion that George H. W. Bush would beat Bob Dole in the Republican caucuses.I believe the Register is publishing that George Bush will win the caucus, and I dont think thats true, she told her editor. The Register changed its prediction to Dole C correctly C while Bush came in third.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/ann-selzer-poll-predicts-shock-win-kamala-harris-iowa/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/ann-selzer-poll-predicts-shock-win-kamala-harris-iowa/)","title":"Ann Selzer predicts a shock win for Kamala Harris in Iowa C heres why its a big deal"},{"text":"No man is an island...","title":"Bernie Sanders: 'When you hurt, when your children hurt, I hurt.'

There is no secret sauce beyond that, she insists.The approach took her to national acclaim when she accurately predicted that a first-senator by the name of?[Barack Obama](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/26/the-obamas-arent-saving-kamala-harris-theyre-exposing-just/)?would beat frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, in the Iowa caucuses in 2008.Her forecast sparked reactions ranging from scepticism to outright mockery when it was published.? A member of the Clinton campaign even called up to complain.\\\\[PBS anchor\\\\] Judy Woodruff was interviewing me that day and said, How did you assume this? Why did you assume this? Ms Selzer recalled to Politico.I go, I assumed nothing. My data told me this was what was going to happen.Ms Selzers latest poll has sent a shockwave through a race notably devoid of surprises. Nate Silver, a fellow pollster, recently complained that his peers were hedging their bets by?[forecasting a close race](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/0/who-win-2024-us-election-expert-predictions-next-president/)?C the Registers prediction has burst through that consensus.If once the forecast might have been greeted with disbelief, Ms Selzers heavyweight credentials mean that it has to be taken seriously.One of her strengths is thought to be that she is based in Iowa, rather than Washington, DC or New York like other big-name pollsters, and knows how to reach regular Americans.While a long-time resident of the Hawkeye State, Ms Selzer was born a few states along, in Kansas.Even if she might have seemed destined for life as a pollster C conducting a survey of neighbourhood moms at the age of five, according to the Wall Street Journal C she undertook a pre-medical course at the University of Kansas before finding her heart lay in data.She took up a communications theory and research program at the University of Iowa, followed by an academic fellowship in Britain and a stint on Capitol Hill, then returned to the state permanently.While at the Des Moines Register in 1987, Ms Selzer dug through the newspapers polling data and questioned its conclusion that George H. W. Bush would beat Bob Dole in the Republican caucuses.I believe the Register is publishing that George Bush will win the caucus, and I dont think thats true, she told her editor. The Register changed its prediction to Dole C correctly C while Bush came in third.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/ann-selzer-poll-predicts-shock-win-kamala-harris-iowa/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/ann-selzer-poll-predicts-shock-win-kamala-harris-iowa/)","title":"Ann Selzer predicts a shock win for Kamala Harris in Iowa C heres why its a big deal"},{"text":"I like to think the democrats are not going to play by the unspoken rules anymore... because they've seen time and time again that the republicans aren't honoring shit.

If Kamala thought it was REMOTELY in play, she'd at least send her running mate, the governor of the neighboring state, to have a rally or something.That said, there are other ways to know it's absurd. Iowa was like R+8 in 2020 in a national D+4 environment. To be D+3, Iowa would have to shift 11 points to the left relative to itself four years ago. Furthermore, It would have to shift from 12 points right of the nation to 4 points left of the nation (Registrations are expected to be R+1 in 2024). So compared to the nation as a whole, that's a whopping SIXTEEN point shift. In one election cycle. It's unbelievable and incredible. By which I mean \\"not believable\\" and \\"not credible\\".

My homeschool was supplemented by online courses, the quality of which was actually much better than public school. In addition, we had a good community of other homeschoolers, and we had sports, co-ops, clubs, pretty much everything that public school has. I think when you're considering homeschooling, you might be putting it in a bit of a box, applying a few people's experiences to everyone who does it. There are definitely ways to effectively teach a kid, but it definitely depends on the parent. My mother genuinely believed that she could give me a better education than public school, and to be honest, I think she did.When I went to public school, I found that the quality of education was surprisingly much worse than the courses I had taken before, and it felt a bit like a glorified daycare. I think I was taking around four APs, so not a super rigorous course load, but damn was it way too easy for the time that we had to spend on it. In contrast, I think I spent maybe two hours per day on homework when I was homeschooled, as well as three hours of class, but in public school, we spent more time doing half the work.There's definitely something to be said about the social aspect, but I don't think I've suffered in any regard in that matter. In college, I haven't had any difficulty making friends, and homeschooling prepared me extremely well for it. I think it really depends on the person and their family when you're considering homeschooling. I do have a biased view because I reaped the benefits of it, and I know that there are definitely people who have suffered from a lack of a quality education/social life, but it's very case dependent. It seems a bit disingenuous to apply a blanket statement like \\"all homeschooling is damaging\\" when there are many cases of successful homeschoolers, including a lot of people I know.Edit: Just for fun, here's a pdf I found that's purportedly from the ACT about testing statistics: [https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1831-act-homeschool-stats-2020-08.pdf](https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1831-act-homeschool-stats-2020-08.pdf)Not sure how valid it is, but it doesn't seem like homeschoolers do any worse on standardized testing.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Youre good at math.

Turns out that when a ballot is mailed out unsolicited to all registered voters, people turn out who absolutely, positively wouldn't otherwise and those people overwhelmingly vote D. What remains to be seen is how much crossover there is. I'm bearish on the idea that there will be a lot. If someone is so gung-ho about abortion that it's their make or break issue, I find it unlikely that they were ever registered Republican. Abortion can absolutely drive *turnout* in an enormous way, as we've seen in referendum votes and in the 2022 midterms. But I'm not so sure it will drive party crossover, so I suspect the Rs and the Ds that we're seeing in the early vote are (mostly) true R and D votes, with similar levels of crossover in each direction.Abortion doesn't *seem* to be driving turnout, at least not in the early vote. R turnout in early voting is about the same as four years ago while D is down. This, to me, also suggests limited party crossover. Think about it - if registered Republicans were turning out in large numbers to vote D because of abortion, one would think that D turnout would also be up. But it's not.Obviously anything can happen when the election day votes come in. But the roles are reversed from 2020. In 2020 the Democrats had weeks to build up a big lead that Republicans had to try to overcome in a single 12 hour voting day - and Republicans were *this close* to pulling it off. Now the shoe's on the other foot and it's not an advantageous position to be in. Obviously, go vote if you haven't. Harris can still win, of course.

After, I think youre going to be hearing a lot about Iowa having the best chance for flipping a senate seat and governors house in the nation and we will be in the news quite a bit leading up to 26.

Let's recall the Catholic Inquisitions were largely focused on the persecution of Jews for heresey and laid the framework for the genocide of the Holocaust which was also a Christian Inquisition against Jews. I ask you to contemplate whether we might also use this Inquisition label for the War on Drugs. None of that has anything to do with Christ, it's about the church. These are two separate entities. Jesus Christ would have happily munched a handful of shroooms and took a hit off that joint with his glass of wine when it came around because he was moved in his gut to love his neighbor and asked his followers to do the same. It's the church that seeks to divide, exclude, punish and shame. We need look no further than the Inquisitions to see the distinction.

Israel has been the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign aid since its founding, receiving about $300 BILLION (adjusted for inflation) in total economic and military assistance.You seem treat 300B$ as some super unimaginable sum of money when it's pretty standard in the country scale. In fact almost 50 countries have a nominal GDP greater than it, one of them being Israel which has around 500B$. Basically all the US aid is equal to roughly 8 months of revenue for Israel, surely if they hadn't gotten it they would have been more or less fine right? Also that amount of aid is the total, considering US aid to Israel only started around 1970 that averages at around 5.5B$ per year.

I think social media sites and others could used them to verify sign-ups for their sites, regardless of the user name, but they could be a way to offer a verified \\"blue checkmark\\" type sign for users. Even if we can't get rid of the bots or russian troll farms, we might slowly all be able to verify that the people we're talking to are verified users, and likely acting in good faith.You would think its possible for US-based social media companies to have the capability to identify and ban any bot account registered to their site. It doesnt matter where an account originates - companies could be held to the standard of moderating the accounts using their sites. If, additional to that, any US-operating organization was caught attempting to utilize bots to drive engagement for their cause or product, they should be subjected to massive fines. Fine them billions - Im not even joking.Imagine an Amazon with only legitimate product reviews, or YouTube with real upvotes and comments, or Rotten Tomatoes without review bombing, or any social media site we use with nothing but *real engagement.* Imagine even social media influencers getting fined billions of dollars for breaking the law.The real issue here is that many of these companies are publicly traded, and, due to the pyramid scheme we call free market capitalism, they lose value if they are unable to show growth. Not to mention they can charge more for advertising based on the promise of expected engagement. So none of them are particularly inclined to actually *fix* the problem, and if the bots do actually drive engagement by getting real people to respondAnyway, I dont think a government email would solve anything. For starters - as you pointed out, internet users are international, and its unlikely every country would agree to implement such a policy. Additionally, what happens if theres a data breach involving bundles of those emails? It wouldnt be too hard to sell unused ones to hackers intent on driving dissent.I really do think there needs to be some kind of internet bill of rights. You have the right to anonymity and privacy. No organization may track you or monitor your off-site activity. Your personal information - down to the very images that you share of yourself and your loved ones, not to mention whatever words you write - should be protected, even from the owner of the website on which you are sharing your information. You have the right to be protected from bad actors seeking to manipulate your online behavior through false engagement or other forms of sophisticated trickery. Anyone caught trying to violate your rights should face significant consequences.But everyone is so busy trying to exploit us that this will never, ever happen.","title":"To save our democracy, we must get rid of online anonymity"},{"text":"Theyre not wrong.","title":"In Case of a Trump Win - Democrat Governors Are Preparing for Violence"},{"text":"NBC has endorsed \\\\[Insert Democrat\\\\] for the 2028 election already!","title":"Who needs an endorsement?

This man should have been our president for the last 8 years."},{"text":"Okay. We need to consider a few factors here. Firstly, what kind of phone is the banana phone actually meant to resemble? The curved handset of the banana phone bears a resemblance to four primary types of phones  traditional corded phone handsets, cordless home phone handsets, old timey cell phones from the '90s, and flip cell phones which are still in use today (although just barely). To determine the proper function and therefore place of the stem, we need to narrow down what the banana phone IS.We can rule out the corded phone immediately since the banana phone does not have a cord. I suppose you could tie a string to it and make it a quarter phone, but I've never seen that done, so if it has been done it's such a marginal case that it's not worth addressing. We can rule out the '90s cell phone as well. There might have been a time where banana phones COULD have represented this type of phone  but they haven't really been relevant for several decades, so the reference is likely to be lost on the majority of people with modern uses of the banana phone. However, even if we assume that this is a possible identity of the banana phone, it will not affect the final conclusion. This leaves the cordless phone and the flip phone. These are both possible identities of the banana phone  but there shouldn't be any need to narrow it down further, as the same conclusion can be drawn from either, or from the '90s cell phone. Each of these types of phones have an antenna, and that antenna is almost always pointing up. So it is logical to conclude that the stem on the banana phone is also an antenna. Now, this would seem to suggest that you are correct  that the stem should, in fact, be upright toward the ear. But this would be a mistaken conclusion. Because, reading your replies to the previous comments, I noticed something. I noticed that you were advocating, in one of those replies, the placing of the stem INTO the ear  and nobody places the antennae in their ear when talking on the phone. (Well, I suppose SOMEONE might, but there are people out there who have done weirder things with phones that aren't proper use of them either.)Therefore, you are only half right  correct in the general orientation of the banana phone as stem up, and thus correct that Matty Matheson is holding his banana phone upside down. However, your own method remains incorrect  the stem should be ABOVE the ear in the manner of an antenna, not in the ear IN the manner of a q-tip. You're not supposed to be placing things in your ear anyway. Just as typical phone handsets do not have stem thingies sticking out for the microphone, neither do they have stem thingies sticking out for the speaker. To place your ear properly against the speaker, it must be BELOW the stem.*Edit:* various grammatical failures.

Or 'which types of rape are justified'? Or 'what society will not have such power gaps that allows abuse to happen'?Lets answer these one by one  \\n1. No, but not every behavior serves a societal or evolutionary function. Evolution is a series of desirable traits being passed on, and a set of undesirable traits being weeded out, but what people dont acknowledge is that there are plenty of traits somewhere in the middle that are just still getting passed down sometimes, that havent been bred out yet, or that are starting to find their niche late in the Evo game. Violent-mindedness is, unfortunately, one of those traits. We can see this by the fact that its made it here. Given the relative merits of selfishness as a trait, which may include rape, I dont see it going anywhere.2. None. Absolutely none. Even if the only way we could procreate was by rape, rape would be unjustfiable from every human rights and philosophical paradigm that sees bodily autonomy as an innate part of humanity. I would rather us die out than ever sanctify this act under any circumstances. 3. Also none. Powrr gaps arent what cause rape. Evil, hurtful people are what cause rape. some people rape people stronger than them, more powerful than them, there are situations where bosses are assaulted by their employees. Rape is not occurring because of some sort of systemic issue, its happening because some peoples idea of a good time is brutally traumatizing another person and they can get away with it. As long as society exists, deviant behavior will exist. As long as social deviance exists, a portion of that will be violent crime. And as long as violent crime exists, one of these fucking over-evolved monkeys is going to use their genitalia to commit it. Why do you ask? Are you okay?

For all of his years of public service, whenever the GOP held firm on an evil position, it was Joe leading the way in making the Democrats compromise.But you can't \\"compromise\\" with evil. And some issues are black and white. And by compromising again and again with the GOP, we've now reached a place when there are now *establishment Republicans* supporting Harris for president, FFS. That's how indistinguishable the Democratic party has become from what the Republican party *used to be* (not MAGA, of course).Now, don't get me wrong, Harris is better than Trump as president. There can be no question of that. No sane rational argument in Trump's favor can be made.But the same billionaires who took Biden from last place to the presidency in less than a week also chose Harris within 24 hours of Biden stepping down. No primaries, no debates, no brokered convention. We got no choice in picking from a field of Democratic hopefuls...ALL of them more popular than Harris (who had dropped out in 2016 before last place Joe).Unfortunately, though I like the guy and he's made some amends here as VP under Obama and as President for the past four years, Joe's been a huge part of that corruption of Democratic ideals for the overwhelming majority of this public service.

Repeated trauma and lack of autonomy or explanation as to why their personality is 'social unacceptable'.Whilst I agree that a parent can't possible supplement the 'school experience', I've seen a lot of success from homeschooling hubs. Small communities are created where children learn together. Generally from what I've seen, it will be 4-8 children from several families but this hugely varies. In a community, their are more adult skills to tap into and adults will teach to their strengths. Hubs will often outsource 'real world experts' or 'industry professionals' to supplement what they can't meet within the community or for additional enrichment. As for the social aspect of school, I'm not sure it does many kids that good. It's contradictory, confusing, teachers support pupils with bullies/social things and then suddenly you reach an age where you're on your own.

Dr. Stein's commitment to diplomacy is more needed than ever and stands in stark contrast to the two warmongering ruling parties, which are driving us toward WWIII [World War III] and draining resources urgently needed here at home.\\" The event featuring Stein and Putin was a December 2015 gala in Moscow in celebration of the Russian state television channel RT's tenth anniversary. The channel has been banned in several countries for spreading Russian propaganda since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The channel regularly featured Stein during her 2016 campaign. When asked about the dinner by NBC that year, Stein said it was a \\"shameful commentary\\" on U.S. media that she had received more air time on Russian news as a third party candidate. Speaking to The Intercept in 2017, she said the notion that it was an \\"intimate roundtable\\" was \\"mythology,\\" and that Putin and his associates \\"weren't at the table for very long.\\" Stein said that \\"nobody introduced anybody to anybody\\" and that she \\"didn't hear any words exchanged between English speakers and Russians\\" due to the lack of a translator. Stein said that Putin had appeared to make a speech and left immediately after. \\"Nobody cared to make introductions. This wasn't intended to be a discussion of any sort,\\" she told the outlet.","title":"Just because I see this misinformation alot, Jill Stein has has 2 senate intelligence investigations, and 1 Robert Mueller investigation into possible ties with Putin.

We are a democracy, and democracy requires compromise. The mistake he made was not having a Plan B for when the GOP stabbed him in the back. For instance, when it became clear that the American Restoration and Recovery Act was going to get almost no GOP votes after weeks of negotiations, the Democrats should have torpedoed their own bill and passed a more liberal one. In terms of the ACA, Democrats should have lowered the filibuster threshold to keep the public option; if the public option that covers everyone and everything passes, no ones health care is disrupted, and people caught in the recession would feel that much less pressure to find a job, since they would have known that their health and that of their family would have been okay. It would have opened up a can of worms, but the filibuster is why people think government doesnt work and that nothing changes; it would also encourage voters to turn out to protect us from going backwards. The Biden administration seemed to have learned from those mistakes. They tried negotiation for the American Rescue Plan, but when it became clear that was going to come up short, they passed a better bill. I was fine with Biden negotiating infrastructure on a bipartisan basis, as hed promised to do so with there still being independents out there who, for reasons passing understanding, value bipartisanship over the quality of a bill. Then the Democrats didnt even bother reaching out to Republicans to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. It would have been larger had Manchin not insisted that it would be fully paid for, which is fine; Kyrsten Sinemas insistence on not taxing the rich basically killed the chance of it being a bigger bill. She even killed a provision to further tax hedge funds. I doubt that Harris would try to be bipartisan, just based on what the Democrats tried when they had a 50-50 split in the Senate.","title":"Harris Represents the New Democratic Party and the Future"},{"text":"I'm Gen Z so I see it often, and it's gonna be bad if people my age actually vote en masse.

'new' systems rarely spring up ex nihilo, they often syncretise from an existing source, and use the dependabiliy and trustworthiness of the existing as their rock, and sometimes borrow/steal their god (Christianity-from-Judaism).\\n \\ni like old texts, in the original language/context. better if they're engraved on dateable walls of temples. tends to bring the awkwardness of the 'winners' into the light...which isn't always popular. thankfully, we're past the days of the Spanish Inquisition (mostly), or my arse would be toast. it does feel like doing a jigsaw, sometimes, wearing a number of blindfolds. but the more you keep digging, reading, connecting the dots, the clearer the picture becomes. i just hope that breakthroughs like Gobekli Tepe keep pushing others to keep digging and re-evaluating what we do know. ditto using new tech to scan what isn't superficially observable, temples and their subterranean structures, beneath the sands of deserts and jungles, at the peri-diluvian coastlines now submerged.","title":"The Eagle vs. The Serpent: Rivalry(Continued)"},{"text":"Its capitalism.

Of course, later we learned the truth. Jerry Falwell, Jr., the former Evangelical Liberty University President, accepted an offer from Michael Cohen and Donald Trump to bury his threesome sex scandal between himself, his wife, and the 20 year old poolboy, in exchange for Falwell promoting Trump with Evangelicals to help him win the election. You cannot make this up.Evangelicals also threw their values under the bus in exchange for conservative Supreme Court justices and the chance to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Fast-forward to today, and women are suffering severe medical complications and dying as a direct consequence of Trump being elected.  Evangelicals are going to need to answer for Trumps presidency someday.  Billionaires: Then you have billionaires. We saw the likes of Jeff Bezos fold like a cheap suit when he told Washington Post not to endorse Harris. Then theres Elon Musk spending millions of dollars to help elect Trump, no doubt because he thinks it will be financially advantageous. But these billionaires are making a Faustian bargain.  Trumps loyalty is a one-way street. For CEOs of corporations, who care only about profits, morals are not in the equation. They want more tax cuts and Trump has promised more tax cuts and more money in their pockets, shifting more wealth to the top and increasing inequality. There is a direct line between massive inequality and the rise of far right populism. Politicians are great at distractions, pointing the finger at immigrants, instead of addressing the real issues at hand. Of course, the extreme example of that is the economic and political instability in the late 1920s and early 1930s that played a role in helping the Nazis rise to power.Just as Trumps attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power on January 6, the Nazis had a failed coup d'tat in 1923.  They were not held accountable, and in 1933, Hitler came into power.Similar to Project 2025, the Nazis Enabling Act of 1933 allowed the Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, to bypass the system of checks and balances in the government. As John Oliver explained in a segment on Project 2025, their plan for the separation of powers is a game of rock, paper, scissors, except rock crushes paper and scissors every single time.Just as Trump has promised to go after political enemies, Hitler and the Nazis declared a state of emergency through the Reichstag Fire Decree and began a violent crackdown against political enemies.For those who think a right wing extremist movement cannot happen in America, one only need to watch video of the January 6 attack and the documentary, A Night at the Garden, to know that it can. Watching Trump speak at Madison Square Garden, with the vile, hateful comments he made, was surreal in light of this history and his escalating violent rhetoric. Vote for a positive path going forward.","title":"When did moral character stop being vital to leadership in our democracy?"},{"text":"Reddit hates Trump","title":"This is the only thing Democrats can do.

In these stories, leaders werent just chosen for their charisma or ambition; they were selected based on a combination of merit and lineage qualities that supposedly reflected both divine favor and earthly capability. In ancient Sumer, kingship and land distribution were often determined by a mix of bloodline and demonstrated worth, creating a kind of divine mandate to rule. Today, we see echoes of this in the way power is concentrated among certain families, elite circles, and networks that prioritize loyalty, legacy, and specific ideals. While todays leaders may not openly claim divine lineage, theres an unmistakable emphasis on maintaining power within established lineages or elite networks, much like how the Anunnaki structured their hierarchies and chose their representatives. Ancient texts describe how lands and responsibilities were divided among leaders with different roles some would oversee specific regions, others would handle religious duties or military actions, all ultimately serving the interests of the Anunnaki. Similarly, our world is divided into nations, regions, and spheres of influence, each led by figureheads who, in many ways, uphold the interests of global powers that operate behind the scenes. This structure is perpetuated by an elite that controls resources, influence, and policy direction, echoing the Anunnakis practice of dividing authority to maintain balance and order.","title":"The Eagle vs. The Serpent: Rivalry(Continued)"},{"text":"Iowa go blue","title":"Iowa Poll: Democrats are preferred over Republicans in 2 of 4 congressional districts"},{"text":"Yup!

But you guys on both sides don't seem to understand we all see your country breaking up.\\nNow, that obviously cannot happen. So you're gonna have to be friends again. And that will take Democrats and Republicans actually being kind. KH has been kind of Republicans. So why can't other democrats? If your leader can do it, so can you? Look what happens to Hilary \\"the deplorables\\" incident lost her the election. And online aggression does count. It is the driving force of extremist republicanism. \\nDon't dismiss the power of the internet. I'm old enough to remember a time when the internet didn't really exist and neither did extremist groups because they had no loud voice. Now they have a voice and they easily manipulate people.  Social media caused the insurrection because it allowed bad actors - extremist Americans, Russians, Iranians to appeal to people to go to DC that day. Without social media, Trump could have been on every news channel in the US and still only get a handful of followers to turn up.","title":"Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Oprah among celebrities campaigning with Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania"},{"text":"This is just categorically false","title":"Former Democrats"},{"text":"Ive no doubt the guy will go out to his hideaway, sit there listening to the news for reports of insurgencies and invasionshear nothing at all but life going on and quietly come back online the following week like yup!

Then Covid hit, still voting for Trump in 2020. Mail in ballot is one of the way to cheat legally (especially with kids voting for their family members, too much loop hole). Biden won and the worst 4 years ever: Mom got laid off, I got killed by tax, cost of living skyrocket, gas price get to 5$ in TX at some point. I can see people want to move past Biden at some point. Then, he left the race, which is replaced by Kamala and she said she wouldnt change a thing. Still cant understand why people still voting for her. Maybe money is not their top priority. Anyway, Trump getting momentum lately until Iowa polls suggest Harris landslide last night. Now Im super nervous. The problem is not that the next 4 years will be the worst. The main problem is that the mainstream media can show they can influence average American and decide who they want as a President. Mainstream media= government propaganda. That means we may move into one main party, which is basically a country of communist party.","title":"Does it feel different this time?"},{"text":"Thank you.

Now that I've been here a while, the culture is different from my first impressions, but along the same themes I expected.  Issue by issue, people aren't all that conservative in general.  They want better worker protections, to be able to unionize, etc.  When I talk to my neighbors about specific issues, they often articulate complaints and positions that are extremely consistent with DNC talking points.  Yet, if I go as far as asking about particular candidates, all logic and issue positions gets quickly tossed, and they are emotionally wedded to the GOP and Trump.  I still struggle to really understand why, and I'm leaning toward just a lot of propaganda.  The TV commercials here are all about Democrats and government getting in the way and causing problems, but there's never any actual argument, it's just \\"the democrats caused your problems, vote Republican to fix them.\\"  There is no acknowledgment at all that the only Democrats that have been significant in this state in the 21st century are Jim Justice and Joe Manchin, both now Republicans.  There is no acknowledgement that the GOP has been in control literally the whole time that things have been getting worse here.  Basically everyone around here agrees that the sexuality and gender stuff the state house is obsessed with is not something they agree with or want.  However, there is a huge component of evangelical Christianity.  It's not quite an outright majority but it is huge here, and of course evangelical Christians for some reason completely unrelated to the Bible itself are absurdly passionate in their opposition to abortion, not that we have had any in this state for years anyway.  It's very puzzling to me.  Anyway, early voting figures are showing that registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats by a fairly significant amount in early voting, but boy have we been showing up to vote.  The community facebook pages have daily questions about where and how to vote.  There was a significant line when I arrived to vote, and a lot more people arriving as I left.  There are a couple of Harris signs on the main road, although they are vastly outnumbered by Trump signs; in fact the total number of Harris lawn signs doesn't come close to the number giant Trump billboards and flags on display in yards in various kinds of neighborhoods including large well kept farms, trailer parks, and our handful of suburban developments.  Meanwhile, there is some quiet opposition to a state program put in place to attract out of state remote workers like myself, but the program keeps paying people to move here from blue states... and we are bringing our values with us.","title":"Shock Poll Has Harris Beating Trump in Deep Red State - Presidential candidate Kamala Harris has leapfrogged rival Donald Trump in the Hawkeye State amid fierce campaigning in a neck-and-neck showdown."},{"text":"Uniparty?\\nFormer Democrats\\n*It's nice people are beginning to understand politics figure they have maybe 8 years of engagement.

In this case I will mention purity culture, reducing sex education, favoring teen pregnancy. But now I have to be careful arguing if its 'systemic' or not.

Altho the rapes are illegal. And it happens to the point that I question if, the culture itself grows from rape directly. Perhaps not, they do have to afford a lot of propaganda to make it work. Tho, some people are just preaching for life, ez money, ez church. Thats not spending a lot on propaganda. Thats literally just a cult using their platforms and untaxed wealth. And if they are changing laws its by definition become systemic. Such as reducing sex education or blocking it. So, the question does not stop at merely systemic anymore yeah, it becomes 'why is the problem systemic' now.But I suppose rape does not directly help their culture.

There are religious homeschoolers who want to shield their children from secular society. I think when the average person thinks of a homeschooler, that's what they think of. Then there are the uschoolers/radical unschoolers that are purposefully being dense about the importance of ANY formal education. However, there are also secular homeschoolers who thrive in that environment. There are parents who take the time to educate themselves on child development as well as other pedagogies. For example, as others have mentioned, public (and most private) schools follow a one size fits all approach and for kids with learning disabilities like severe ADHD, or physical disabilities that impact their ability to be at school for 8 hours. that's really much more of a recipe for failure. If it's a religious homeschool group that probably won't matter because in general their goal is to isolate their children from society, so the social aspect is kind of nonexistent outside of the church with those groups. I completely agree with every point you made about homeschool when only applied to religious homeschoolers/unschoolers. The HSLDA, a fundamentalist legal organization, is very much responsible for the lack of socialization in non-secular homeschoolers. That org is basically dedicated to making Christian parents think the world is our to get them and lock them up for pulling their kids out of schools. As far as the social aspect goes I think this is a very, very common misconception around homeschooling. Most secular homeschoolers are involved in homeschooling groups with other homeschooled kids. My partner is a homeschooler and he was involved with a homeschooling group that was almost like a co-op. Different parents with different knowledge areas taught different classes. He and all of his homeschooling friends were all involved in sports, clubs, activism organizations, and a humanist organization. He went to an extremely prestigious university and is now getting his masters. His 3 best friends from homeschooling all have PhDs. They are all very well socially adjusted and academically successful. He has severe ADHD that would've certainly set him back in a public school environment. I will admit that he and his friends had probably the best case homeschooling scenario, but it is more common that people like to acknowledge when the majority of mainstream homeschoolers until recently have been the weird Christian ones. It's important to understand that homeschooling is a genuinely better option for many children.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"Isnt Trump still leading? \\nI always see news about how Kamala is leading there and here in some polls, but if i start to research it myself its quite the opposite? \\nSo can any American tell a foreign whats right and whats not?","title":"Kamala Harris Gains Momentum as Campaigns Head into Homestretch"},{"text":"I assume you don't watch any TV because they have been hammering those topics in ads.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Didn't expect that Katy Perry would campaign for Harris honestly.?","title":"Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Oprah among celebrities campaigning with Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania"},{"text":"For those saying this wont convince anyone not already supporting her, the campaigns are no longer as focused on convincing undecideds or winning defectors.

She says school is hard because she just knows shes going to get in trouble all day and disappoint everyone all day. Shes trying her best but its very difficult. Highly likely we may be homeschooling her next year. We have friends who homeschool and it seems to be working out well for their kids. \\nIts a lot different now than it was when I was in school in the late 80s-90s.I developed an unhealthy social anxiety though and I blame it on homeschooling.

You have identified a truth here. The powerful often get away with their crimes. Why? Because they have the means to do so. They can obfuscate and use their wealth and resources in ways that poor and petty criminals cannot. Does this mean that wealth and power leads people to rape (which seems to be your premise)? No. It means that they get away with it easier when they happen to be rapists.However, if one in six people in America are abused, then this is a much bigger problem than people in authority and with wealth. This is a bigger problem than Epstein. This means that the poor and powerless are raping, too. And they get prosecuted.

Johnson.I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, No, I already voted for these people, he said. Then, we have to explain to people, Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now youve got to go again.And youll probably have to go in December and do it one more time, he added.A post-election analysis of Ossoffs field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoffs paid relational organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become community mobilizers  a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off, Ossoff continued.Ossoffs efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor.

Look at the rich. Even China with the uyghur muslims. Prison systems. It seems its inherent to authority fundamentally. In America 1 in 6 have reported sexual assaults. Others are still silent, or have repressed memories so its probably higher. Purity culture is meant to generate future victims. Prolly (but not certainly) the real reason why the rich rightwing want to remove access to abortions is so rich people can pay to invade a victim in a school, then force them to carry their child to term, so they can get more offspring. And families manipulate other families by setting them up to be rped probably.You're not basing this on anything. This is a huge leap to make and kind of disturbing, if I'm perfectly honest. The only think you can point to as an objective metric is that one in six people have been sexually assaulted. This doesn't mean that purity culture leads to rape, nor does it suggest that authority causes rape. If you believe that societies which lacked complex hierarchies and power structures, such as the earliest human tribes, lacked rape in high numbers, then I think you have a biased view. Rape doesn't come from authority, from cultures which promote sexual purity, or anything else. Rape comes from people who view others as sexual objects that are a means to a selfish end. Purity culture promotes an opposite value: That the human person has in inherent dignity which must be guarded and respected until the circumstances are appropriate. Christians frown upon rape while valuing chastity, as an example. Do they still commit rape? Of course, but this occurs in spite of their values, not because of them.The bit about removing access to abortions so that people can rape more is also a massive stretch. Rapists often pressure their victims to get an abortion in order to hide evidence of their crimes, so this is very counter-productive if someone was secretly a closet rape apologist who just really wants to rape some women. It just isn't logical that I would simultaneously rape and get rid of abortion, unless I'm really stupid and haven't thought my positions out very well.","title":"CMV: A r*peless authoritarian society cannot exist"},{"text":"Yeeaaaahh.

But if theres a power disceprancy, some will just bribe others to get off scott free (but evidence of interference would happen like with Epstein's case of the cameras being turned off). So basically, not all societies would diminish it, because of the dynamics of power.","title":"CMV: A r*peless authoritarian society cannot exist"},{"text":"Yeah I agree with you but I think her campaign is pivotal.

More Democrats voted for Bush in FL that year than total number of GP votes for Nader. It was the crossover voted by *registered Dems* that made that race so close. But even more importantly, the number of nonvoters was easily the biggest numbers.So if you u want to lay blame about 2000 in FL, Id say it goes in this order: Supreme Court, Jeb, Reps who voted for Bush, Dems who voted for Bush, non voters, then Nader voters.","title":"Column: Many could vote against Kamala Harris over the war in Gaza.

It was all a con to get votes: Paul Weyrich, the late religious conservative political activist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation, saw his opening. The new political philosophy must be defined by us [conservatives] in moral terms, packaged in non-religious language, and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition, Weyrich wrote in the mid-1970s. When political power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to re-create this great nation. Weyrich believed that the political possibilities of such a coalition were unlimited. The leadership, moral philosophy, and workable vehicle are at hand just waiting to be blended and activated, he wrote. If the moral majority acts, results could well exceed our wildest dreams. But this hypothetical moral majority needed a catalysta standard around which to rally. For nearly two decades, Weyrich, by his own account, had been trying out different issues, hoping one might pique evangelical interest: pornography, prayer in schools, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, even abortion. I was trying to get these people interested in those issues and I utterly failed, Weyrich recalled at a conference in 1990. Weyrich, Falwell and leaders of the emerging religious right enlisted an unlikely ally in their quest to advance abortion as a political issue: Francis A. Schaeffera goateed, knickers-wearing theologian who was warning about the eclipse of Christian values and the advance of something he called secular humanism. Schaeffer, considered by many the intellectual godfather of the religious right, was not known for his political activism, but by the late 1970s he decided that legalized abortion would lead inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia, and he was eager to sound the alarm. Schaeffer teamed with a pediatric surgeon, C. Everett Koop, to produce a series of films entitled Whatever Happened to the Human Race? In the early months of 1979, Schaeffer and Koop, targeting an evangelical audience, toured the country with these films, which depicted the scourge of abortion in graphic termsmost memorably with a scene of plastic baby dolls strewn along the shores of the Dead Sea. Schaeffer and Koop argued that any society that countenanced abortion was captive to secular humanism and therefore caught in a vortex of moral decay.\\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133","title":"Endorsement: Kamala Harris for president to put an end to Trumps long con"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/e436mds06ryd1.jpeg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2405ecc516386fc3a7fb762520527f5503f73634","title":"Kamala has momentum"},{"text":"pretty soon theyll have a bot that slightly misspells and misquotes to make it seem more \\"organic\\"","title":"How comes Reddit isnt investigated for election tampering"},{"text":"Nordic countries didn't have rape before migrants?

The fact that animals rape and kill, and that humans rape and kill, does not justify humans raping and killing - it makes the ability to refrain from these acts a consequence of man's higher faculties.So, any society that advances civilization will diminish these unjustified bad acts, but the confluence of factors necessary to eliminate them entirely is too vague to be an impetus for policy.

No large-scale society has been so authoritarian (or so anarchist, or so anything) that there are 0 murders, 0 thefts, 0 rapes/SAs, etc. And I think that says more about humanity than the type of governance. So it'd have to be a scifi futuristic anarchist society with such tech and lifestyle that its impossible to do without getting your comeuppance. Thats the only possibility I see, and humans might not live to see that tale judging by ecological issues. Maybe I'm a little confused why you believe this could only exist in an anarchist society.

And families manipulate other families by setting them up to be rped probably.?I get that you end it with probably, but I have no idea how you could ever attempt to prove either of these statements enough to apply them to the general populations you're trying to describe. If it's hyperbole ignore, but I'm worried that giving motives to people you disagree with is a short road to making these sort of extreme statements. So for me, the dilemma is, 'do humans need rape for society to function'. Or 'which types of rape are justified'? Or 'what society will not have such power gaps that allows abuse to happen'??In short. 1. No\\n2. None of them\\n3. Realistically none of them.Humans compare one another, they hold up some as examples of good and so raise them higher, they view others as lacking these qualities and therefore consider their words and actions less. You can even see this in children on the playground. The kid with the most personal charisma, the kid that can beat up all the other kids, and the kid with all the shiniest toys are the ones in charge. Power through wealth, or physical force, or force of personality. Now scale that up. If those kids are all nice all the time the world is harmonious for the most part. If they aren't problems follow. No one gave those kids power officially, the other kids simply make a judgement and go with it. So, the only hope I see, is somehow, an anarchist society, possibly, or if automation makes the whole planet a 1st world country, but, even if it did there would be wage and power gaps still. So it'd have to be a scifi futuristic anarchist society with such tech and lifestyle that its impossible to do without getting your comeuppance. Thats the only possibility I see, and humans might not live to see that tale judging by ecological issues.Can you explain to me why an anarchist society would solve the problem of rape?","title":"CMV: A r*peless authoritarian society cannot exist"},{"text":"She's 27?

Their poor choices have led to a meaningless life, which their traits are not likely to be able to correct. Time for children is short and they are more likely to spin out further than fix their lives and become capable of parenting.In this state, the idea of becoming a parent is not a goal they could work towards, but another natural aspect of life they fear. Imagine a drunken meaningless evening with poor planning leading to an unplanned pregnancy, yet another poorly thought out behavior with long-lasting implications. How will they watch hours of Netflix if they were to have a kid? So abortion is very important in their minds, as their lives are already a disaster and any adult responsibilities are met with ways to remove those responsibilities so they can remain infantile.Barring significant rehabilitation, not only psychologically, physically, and spiritually, spending resources to urge such people to have children is not desirable. Should we force them to keep their children, particularly when their first reaction is wanting to abort them?

His supporters want to preserve democracy for white people, which is why they willingly support his authoritarianism.

Im currently in my second year of college. And while the issues you pose here are certainly sometimes true, I think youre misinformed on the variety of ways that homeschooling actually works. \\nIm going to briefly break down my story and then go point by point through your opinions here. I started out in public school in kindergarten, and it did not go well whatsoever. I am autistic and (although I dont like this label because it feels like Im bragging, it is the technical term) profoundly gifted (IQ in the 99.9th percentile). I also struggled with severe anxiety even at 5. So I was insanely bored in kindergarten. I have vivid memories of just how mind numbingly pointless it all felt. And I was also a stubborn little shit (lovingly), so I refused to do said boring work. My parents kept trying to convince them to let me skip grades. They said I couldnt until I proved I could do the work, I refused, the cycle restarts. I was also being bullied, and I was getting so stressed that my eczema was flaring up, cracking my skin, and making me bleed through my clothes. So reluctantly, my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now is a good time for me to clarify what I mean by homeschooled. I think most people picture kids sitting at the kitchen table at home doing worksheets all day, but that is not at all what it looked like for me. I did do some traditional education (things like learning to read, math, etc.), but most of my time was spent exploring the world. We joined all the local homeschool groups (shocking! Homeschoolers socializing!) and went on field trips together all the time. To the beach, to museums, to different workplaces, factories, non profits, zoos, etc etc. I took music lessons and dance classes and joined a bunch of clubs. I was 5 years old during the 2012 election and was very anxious about it. My mom explained the idea of phone banking to me and I was fascinated. She let me call several dozen of her friends and convince them to vote for Obama by explaining a list of policies that we had researched together. Of course these friends were already voting for him, but I couldnt actually phone bank at 5 and my mom helped spark a permanent interest in politics. I actually phone banked in both the 2020 and upcoming elections. This year I also took multiple bus trips to go campaign door to door in swing states on the weekends. \\nThere are a lot of homeschool resource centers near us that essentially offer classes independent of public schools but taught by actual teachers. I took a lot of those. I was doing Algebra 1 by 4th grade. I won national competitions in cake decorating and started competing in ballet. \\nThis is what my education looked like from around age 5-12. I barely spent any time sitting at the kitchen table. Maybe an hour a day doing homework. The rest of the time I was living. Participating in the world. Meeting people, going places. For a long time we fostered newborn kittens. I learned how to bottle feed them, how to make sure they were healthy, litter box train them, etc. They grew up around our dogs and rabbits and lots of our friends so they were super well socialized and all found great homes. When I entered high school ish age (13), things transitioned slightly. My education became more formal. I had grown out of all that the resource centers had to offer so I started attending community college as a dual enrollment student. Although the program was designed to be taken concurrently with high school, I received all my education from these college classes. Which was plenty (10 units per semester) for a 13 yo. \\nNow around this time I was diagnosed with cancer and got really really sick so my education was on hold for a good two years. But during treatment I joined a youth arts non profit as an intern and poured all the energy I could muster into that. \\nI beat cancer and tested out of high school at 15. Today, Im in my second year of college as a pre-med student. Im the lead editor of the arts journalism program at said youth non profit and have been offered a spot on the board. Im nationally ranked in para track and field and spend my free time playing dungeons and dragons and writing music.  \\nI truly, truly believe that if I had been kept in public school I would have killed myself or dropped out. Now I understand that I am lucky. I come from an upper middle class family, my mom was able to stop working. I live in a city with enough resources to facilitate a meaningful education. And my parents were brave enough to go against the orthodoxy of education despite intense criticism from family members in order to do what was right for me. Im not saying that homeschooling never causes damage. I know thats farrrrrrr from the truth. But I think your view is too narrow. All homeschooling really means broadly, is education outside of a public or private school.","title":"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child."},{"text":"This sub suck now","title":"Former Democrats"},{"text":"More like Withercommonsenseintact","title":"Reese Witherspoon Votes for Kamala Harris: 'Protect Democracy at All Costs'"},{"text":"I stopped hanging out in the Pakman sub because of this.

Youre saying this population is vulnerable to propaganda. What are you seeing and hearing that makes you say that?Not just this population-- white women, black men and Hispanics, large swathes of the working class. There is a vacuum of leadership in this country, so when Trump comes out and says he's the anti war candidate or the one who protects women or whatever, he gets away with it. Michigan Muslims are a sub demographic of a sub demographic, but the way they were handled by Democrats is illustrative of wider issues here. The largest Muslim groups wanted to support Kamala but then felt like they couldn't because they got literally nothing from Dems for their people-- so they awkwardly endorse no one while opposing third party votes. That's what an absence of leadership looks like-- a confusing situation ripe for the far right to take advantage of. Voting for Harris is not the same as supporting all of her policies. No, but my point was that if Harris was dystopian on the policies you care about most, maybe it would be easier to understand the lack of cohesion here. Maybe not-- maybe you would unwaveringly support her imprisoning teenage rape victims for the good of the country and the lesser evil. But thats just you. Do you have any plan to make 300 million people vote the same way you do? This is what we keep coming back to-- voters are disorganized masses of individuals. They're not going to vote the same way you do. So if they're not turning out, if they're not voting for the right lesser evil, it's really not their fault: that's literally what leaders, political parties, and campaigns are supposed to achieve. If Dems lose because the working class and white women and Michigan Muslims don't turn out for them, there's not a lot of other folks you can blame... and yet, after every defeat we're reminded of tiny third parties and stupid younger generations or whoever this years scapegoat is and how they cost Dems an election they were entitled to win.","title":"Column: Many could vote against Kamala Harris over the war in Gaza.

That's probably something that Muslims and progressives want, they can want, but they don't have the financial and political power over the political parties in America that Jewish Americans and Israeli citizens do, when AIPAC is the richest political lobbying organization in America, if we don't talk about the ethnicity and citizenship of some of America's richest donors to political parties and their personal politics, they would rather risk losing Kamala, even if they are Democrats, than to change the policy towards Israel, in this case they will not lose no matter who wins.","title":"Rashida Tlaib refuses to endorse Kamala Harris as Gaza war takes toll on Dem voter base"},{"text":"Online panels have been pretty common to use the last decade or so, and especially after the polling misses in 2016 and 2020.

Biden has used almost none of these powers (or when he has, it was against Ukraine's interests), because he didn't want to. And then he pretends that he'd love to help Ukraine but his hands are tied, they're not.   \\nHe certainly can't do as much as he otherwise could with a supportive congress, but he can do enough to significantly change the balance of power, and he hasn't.
