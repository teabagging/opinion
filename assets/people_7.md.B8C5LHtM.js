Do you think our country is so innocent?\\"*Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate.But this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. Trump and even some of his allies have been vocal about their vengeance crusade. Trump has threatened to jail, not even investigate, but jail his political opponents on multiple occasions.Remember that Trump has spent his entire life threatening to sue and seek retribution against anyone who's ever hurt his feelings. This even includes people who merely speculated about his actual net worth.And his threats have only gotten bolder. He's threatened journalists, he's threatened news networks, he's threatened sitting lawmakers and politicians, judges, agency directors, current and former staff members who have spoken out against him, protestors, and high ranking military officials. He's also threatened anyone who was involved in \\"stealing\\" the election from him in 2020.Outside of those of us who have taken these threats seriously, there are Americans on board with this, there are also low propensity voters who couldn't care less or aren't informed of Trump's unconstitutional threats, there are also Americans, and Republicans in particular, who desperately try to rationalize or downplay his rhetoric, arguing that Trump just \\"exaggerates,\\" ironically making the case that Trump isn't someone we should take seriously.

If you need direct relatives, would it be enough to just have parents, or would you need to get married and have kids if you own? And if you do need to do so, what is the time limit? If someone is actively trying to find a partner, is that enough to count as family-oriented because they want a family but just want to start one with the right partner? Once someone finds that partner, is just getting married enough to prove that you are family-oriented, or do you have to have children? What if your partner was born in the US, but they simply decide they dont want to have kids, would you get deported for your partner not wanting to have kids while you want them? Or what if you both want kids but want to wait until you are more financially secure? Or what if one or both of you is unable to have children due to infertility or age? And if you want kids but are unable to have them biologically, is it enough to adopt? Is it enough to attempt to adopt even if you dont get matched up with a child?

Voters in California were okay with this because wine is seen as socially acceptable despite its devastating health consequences and it was forgiveable as he also promised to finally legalize cannabis which was the will of the people and he did so. To Californians, this guy appeared to be on the right track in terms of backing off on the War on Drugs when his unfortunate predecessor, Brown, termed out and we voted him in with glee knowing full legalization would happen without Brown's persistent vetoes.However, when faced with a bill that had made it through the legislature to legalize psilocybin, a chemical which can help provide relief from alcholism, he chose to veto that measure implying that the prisons were the best place for people seeking out psychedelic therapy. So here we have a curiously mixed bag for those who would like to see an end to the War on Drugs which is a high percentage of the voters in California. He managed to exclude and piss off the same people who were supporting him there due to his ambiguous policies that managed to piss off those same people who supported him as lieutenant governor when cannabis legalization was just taking off. This duplicitous money-sniffing nature was on full display once again in recent months when he then slapped a ban on hemp derived cannabis products in order to protect the big money cannabis cartel he helped establish in California keeping prices absurdly high by limiting access to the market with tight restrictions on grower licenses cynically playing the \\"safety\\" card having gotten into politics on wine money. This man is a typical self-serving pig with dollar signs in his eyes. If this guy can't even keep his former California supporters on his side, then how does anyone expect him to perform well in national politics? If I was on the other side of the aisle, I'd just post photos of drunks puking cheap wine all over the streets of San Francisco in conservative markets and then simultaneously remind the progressives of his hypocrisy in insisting that psychedelic users belong in prison while jacking cannabis prices as high as the sky. I really don't see how this guy has any political future becuase he's a typical spineless Democrat who doesn't know what he stands for and just blows in the wind according to what he thinks will appeal to his donors. We are sick of this shit on the progressive side of the political spectrum. This clown has to get shut down. Newsom is a self-serving rat who is out for his own interests.","title":"California Gov.

The same way you might feel like someone is a bit nutty if they're crying over a sports team or getting passionately worked up over a change in a video game or rulebook. They seriously see it in the same light and they don't understand why anyone wouldn't, and they assume you're exaggerating or not grounded in reality.My mom is one - in her eyes there's no point paying attention, there's more important things like directly helping her friends, family and neighbors. She's a \\"good\\" person who is just completely blind to the wider world, or decided a long time ago that whatever happened \\"out there\\" she couldn't influence it and may as well focus on matters closer to hand. If I try to inform her, she shrugs and dismisses it by saying she's too dumb to get it or just seems bemused - I know this isn't true, she's *not* dumb, she just doesn't want to think about it. I kind of get it, she grew up under a regime and immigrated to the US, and has just never really believed individuals can do anything to fix or change things broadly through civic action, only in one's own neighborhood. When I was a kid I assumed everyone else felt that way, as a teenager I thought nobody else felt that way, now as an adult I'm starting to go back to the former view.....It really does kind of feel like, you know, rich and powerful people just play their own games up in the clouds and don't care whether we cheer or riot. Even though citizens make a powerful collective, we're also dumb as a mob, more like a force of nature or some emergent phenomenon than intelligently guided individuals. I think more and more that she's right, all we can do is what's best for ourselves, our kids, our local communities, and as for the rest... eh.In retrospect I see pretty much no value added to my life from actually reading more and more national/international news over the past twelve years and trying to stay abreast of events and understand what's going on. Like, being better informed hasn't helped me make the world any better or do anything positive in my life or anyone else's life. All it's done is stressed me out. My mom probably enacts more good in the world and she doesn't know anything about the president at any given time. I'm not saying I'm giving up, I guess I'm just saying... I don't think people are bad people for setting their \\"civic duty\\" down at this juncture. We're tired.

And I understand your frustrations.  We have a commonality in our belief of a representative democratic Republic form of governance that we're blessed to live under.Yes, there was Freemasonry in the ranks of the Founding Fathers (FF's), but, you also have to look at that organization and how they operated back then, and even before then, in comparison to how they operate today.  That organization was an actual good thing in it's inception, bastardized to unrecognizable along the way.  Speaking of that organization, it has many factions from back then until today.  Even THEY couldn't get themselves into lockstep from the very start, and follow different paths within their structures in comparison of the overall concept.Secret societies, secret orders, private groups, etc. are as old as humanity itself.  Brotherhoods and whatnot.  They're gonna continue to exist, regardless of our personal disdains for them, or our choices not to participate in/with them.  And, within most of them there is a degree of benevolence in their malevolence.But, let's get back to the matters at hand.  Those FF's tried to enjoy their wealth as colonists under a tyrannical king, who kept heaping on the taxation without representation, to the point where they broke away from monarchy and decided to fight for an ideal that we both seem to welcome, accept and believe in.These ideals were meant for them in their selfishness at that time, (malevolence), but, with possibility of all citizenry enjoying inalienable rights along the way (benevolence).  The concepts presented in the cornerstones of building a brand new governance, by a Declaration of Independence, a Constitution and a subsequent Bill of Rights with the first 10 items being the mortar in the building blocks of . . . a mason's build, amIrite?  And I'd take a building built by a mason over a lumberjack, it'll stand the test of time better, IMHO.In my personal history, I have voted Republican, Democrat, Green Party, Independent and Libertarian along the way, evaluating all candidates for the big chair each time and choosing who best represents my ideas and my ideals.  Are they perfect?  Nope.  But, who is?  Are they capable of winning (Go, Dr. Ron Paul!!!), nope.  Yet, I truly believe my vote was counted, even when it was a vote of protest against the \\"favorites\\".  And that, sometimes, is the best I can hope for.  I don't want that clown or this mime, I want THAT dude.  And, in the case of H. Ross Perot it kinda worked.  That dude scared the hell out of the establishment, garnering WAY too big of a share of the vote.  Bigger than they anticipated, and, by their own rules, forced them to acknowledge him and even allow him on the sacred debate stage.If there was a third of the voters that picked the Democratic nominee and a third that picked the Republican nominee and a third picked someone else, they'd shit themselves proper.  Because they would clearly see their days are very numbered.  And those damned Freemason FF's railed against political parties back in the proverbial day.  And, that's where we need to get to. We, the disenfranchised people need to get behind that person that rises up against the grain.I had no good third option this past election, so I decided to look deep into the two mainstream choices.  My deciding factor to give Trump my vote, my voice was his consistency in messaging.  The dude has preached the same thing regarding politics since the Oprah and Letterman interviews back in the 1980's, the magazine articles and additional interviews in the 1990's., 2000's and into a first term as POTUS.  He's different enough from the nepotistic presentations I've been given (a Bush, a Clinton, a Bush, a Clinton, again) and his idealistic approach to that early messaging of decades ago aligns very much with my own.Is he controlled opposition?  Maybe.  Is he rich and powerful with his own agenda?  Probably.  Does he drive the establishment nuts, publicly?  You bet!  I'll give him a chance to prove his allegiance to those old ideals of those interviews so long ago, or not.  Time will tell.  And next time around, I'll give the next person that aligns best with my own ideas/ideals a vote as well.  Especially if I can truly have a choice that's not a feather in either wing of the two winged bird.  I hope you join me in voting next time.","title":"Cognitive Dissonance in America"},{"text":"Considering the other options being floated, Im quite happy with this selection tbh.","title":"Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, sources say"},{"text":"God damn.hes president elect again and still hasnt read the very first amendment.

Then once people were to distracted killing each other off, Russia and china had formed an alliance to invade the US and they did so. When all enemy countries of the US saw what was happening they came to invade as well. It reminded me of the great fall of Rome. They were forcing people out of their homes and dragging them onto the streets. I noticed they had taken my neighbors out of their homes too and when one of the soldiers asked them if they would accept the one world government and order, I heard my neighbors say no that they were not accepting that system because they were followers of Christ. After that the soldiers face changed and he had a blank evil expression on his face and his eyes you couldnt even see his pupils, it was unlike anything Ive ever seen, he shot my neighbor right in the head.  His family as well shot and I was noticing it was happening all around me. The ones who accepted would be spared and taken to another location I couldnt  tell where though cuz I was on a bus but I could see them taking off. Right after a soldier came up to me and asked if I would accept and when I refused he pointed a gun at me and I woke up.

In fact, that was why Illinois' concealed carry ban was overturned in 2012; They banned both concealed carry and open carry. They did not want to risk kicking off Bruen a decade early so they took the loss on the chin and passed a concealed carry law.So, given fourteen states either ban open carry completely or require a concealed carry permit in order to open carry in their borders, the attention has shifted to National Reciprocity, so that they are required to recognize permits issued by other states.

Don't make assumptions, just ask or be specific. If your fiance's family isn't comfortable with gay matrimony specifically, ask them not to attend. People have all sorts of reasons for what political party they align with and who they vote for, and those reasons might have nothing to do with gay marriage. They may even support gay marriage, but cast their votes for other reasons. So yeah, be specific, don't draw broad assumptions and make decisions based on that.

Which is factually correct. This does not equate to saying the average person are doing fine. And so far away from saying nothing is wrong.So then who is this talk about the economy doing better for? If the average person is not doing fine, why should they care?Where did Harris say nothing is wrong? Can you cite it?Clearly I was being facetious and hyperbolizing what she said. However, her policies were never going to be meaningful toward the working class.The Harris platform was almost entirely about helping the middle class. This means they are saying average person is not doing good. It means they were not deaf to the concerns of average Americans.I would say her platform catered exclusively to the upper-middle class. Americans in the lower-middle and lower classes dont have a down payment or credit to even be able to afford or qualify for a home in the first place. A tax credit, which is effectively a reimbursement and not some check they give you at the time of purchase, does not address the housing crisis the working class is facing. Also, this does nothing for you if youre already a homeowner, nor does this address struggles homeowners face.I do not expect someone in the lower classes to benefit from a child tax credit. A $6k reimbursement does not cover you for childbirth if you have no insurance, which averages at around $50k for your trouble, and if you do have coverage, then birthing might be $3k down the hole for you, but then youre left with an extra $3k out of that reimbursement that isnt going to afford you food, diapers, medicine, or the lost wages incurred for any meaningful amount of time (which is irrelevant if youre going to be struggling for an entire year anyway before you see that money during tax season). The working class would benefit more from free daycare, more social safety nets for lower income families to feed their kids, M4A, guaranteed paid maternity and paternity leave, etc. I did not see her mention any of this during her run.The working class doesnt give a shit about a small business tax credit either. If I have no plans on opening a business any time soon, why should I care that some schmuck is going to open a 5 man shop somewhere where Im probably never going to benefit from this? Where are my stronger labor protections instead? For as little as Kamala pulled away from Biden, for some reason, she felt the need to pull away from one of the only redeeming factor of his presidency, which is that he actually gave half a crap about unions and showed up to a picket line.And this is just about the Opportunity Economy^TM . I can keep going with more examples about all the different faults of her campaign in this regard. I will admit however, doing price manipulation for groceries and at home Medicare coverage were amazing things that the working class COULD benefit from. They might be half a step in the right direction, but theyre good nonetheless. Too bad she barely talked about any of this on the trail.Redditors demonstrating the inability to comprehend the distinction between economy and individual is reflective of how the electorate voted. Redditors are evidently no better informed.So if the working class is struggling and they dont give a shit about the inner workings of an economy they dont understand in the first place, then it is not my problem, nor is it anyone elses, that the person that we put in charge (sort of) that were paying tax dollars and donations toward does not comprehend this and adjust their pitch to better reflect the mentality of the voter base.You dont play the fucking game you want to be playing. You play the game already being played. Earn the working classs votes.But nah, Im just a dum dum Redditor who hasnt thought about this for longer than 5 minutes before going Kamala bad ??But by all means, I guess feel free to keep supporting this farce of a political party while they learn absolutely nothing and continue to lose voters to the fucking couch until the end of time.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

And the popular vote shouldve been a massive difference by at least 10M-25M.No way should anybody believe Kamala has 71M votes, more than the more charismatic Obama ever got. As I type this, Trump broke 75M. So he has received about 1M more than what he received in 2020. If Trump got a fair election in 2020, he wouldve been the first person to be elected three times. Ofc, he wouldve never ran in 2024 in the first place if he won in 2020 as no POTUS can no longer be elected thrice like FDR did.https://preview.redd.it/jssodtf4ae0e1.jpeg?width=749&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c78b62702ca45eb55c53eddd651a4d852c17a029Kamalas campaign literally needed to bribe celebrities to endorse her and she still lost!

Take the Obama years, inherited a massive recession from Bush and navigated getting the economy back on track, but did anything get better?  Up until COVID we had the longest period of sustained economic growth in a long time but what changed ?  The middle class pushed down more upper echelon up more.

Lots of kids who were born here who are now legal who have illegal parents. They send ICE to their schools and shit like that. These kids arent criminals. There are also millions of people who have been here most of their lives because they were brought here as young kids and all they know is America.\\nThen there is a real economic issue. Americans dont want to do the jobs the migrants take. Spoiler alert, if business owners were arrested for hiring migrants, there wouldnt be a migrant crisis. But you dont want $10 eggs and $20 hamburgers and no one else does either. Illegal immigrants make up a huge part of our economy.\\nThen there is the logistics issue. Saying youre going to deport all illegals is as dumb as saying youre going to take away everyones gun. Good luck. These are humans who have already traveled across 1000s of miles and entered into a country without getting caught and have assimilated into society. Despite what the media tells you, most migrants are incredibly resourceful and not in fact murderers and rapists. But regardless, law enforcement agencies work independently and are already incredibly understaffed and underfunded. How on earth are they going to undertake a mass deportation effort bigger than anything the world has ever seen before? Whos paying for this? Its hard enough getting 1000 people on busses to and from a rally parking lot. Good luck getting 10,000,000 across border lines AND preventing 10,000,000 more from coming right back across.","title":"46% of Latino voters voted for Trump, the most of any Republican candidate in all time."},{"text":"ths reminds me when someone denyied something to when I was a toddler, I stopped doing that before then learning to read and write, America is sure at the pick of cultural enlightment, I see","title":"I want to break stuff: Rage room bookings increase after Trump wins election"},{"text":"Um only you said that.

Im not trying to play Monday morning quarterback if only the Dems had done THIS, they would have won, but its death by a thousand cuts. Any little bit of improvement could help. I really did like Kamala Harris and Im crushed she didnt win. Because I liked her, I was extra frustrated when her campaign didnt jump on certain opportunities that seemed like such easy layups. Biden/Harris were afraid to acknowledge inflation as anything but transitory or not as bad as it couldve been, thinking that just mentioning at all would mean that theyre accepting blame. Same with illegal immigration. Same with many other things. Voters SEE things. So when issues are not acknowledged at all, it can feel like, well, fuck, if they dont even see it as a problem, will they fix it? Im not a political strategist so I dont know the exact message they could have said but politics, like it or not, nowadays is all about sloganeering and perception. Im surprised but disappointed that the white collar job market and all the layoffs wasnt mentioned at all. To me, its worse in a way, perception-wise, because people see those who are educated, touted as highly-skilled, went into debt for college, climbed the corporate ladder, and got the ideal job, only to get laid off and have to spend a year before getting another job that likely pays less and isnt as good as their first one. If Im looking at that from the outside, as a young person in college or a blue collar worker thinking of going to trying to pivot my career and move up, Id be so demoralized. If even that person is having trouble finding a job, why even bother trying? Layoffs werent acknowledged, neither was outsourcing, AI, all the things that workers worry about.","title":"Trump Stole Bernies Working-Class Story.

It also incentivizes Americans to buy domestic as those will be the most affordable. While there will undoubtedly be some sort of immediate negative windfall it will be good in the long run for our economic infrastructure. Tariffs are only negative in the long-term for nations that dont have the capacity to facilitate their own production needs, we absolutely have the production and resource capacity and we havent been anywhere close to it since the 70s. And all of the economists that are projecting long-term negative effects are using the sum of all possible tariffs that would be charged if it was enacted today before businesses and consumers could adjust (Tax Foundation is one example of this), so it is a worst case scenario based on a bad faith assumption that no foreign or expat businesses would conform to the policy and that there wouldnt be domestic competition to fill any vacuum. We are still the world-leading consumer market so companies are compelled to do business in American so will have no choice but to come state-side or else carry the financial burden.

So I say this with a lot of grains of salt. But these think pieces between her and Bernie arent reflective of an objective reality: people who support the GOP and Trump were never truly on the fence and those who voted for him would have no matter what. Most undecided voters were mostly masquerading as such but mostly trump supporters, at least those Ive spoke with. A hands across America approach would never reach these people because unity is not of their interest and conceding long held party beliefs was never something theyd relinquish. The GOP abandoned the working party just as much as the democrats, and yet it was somehow the democratic elects responsibility to do more and be more to convince un-convincible ?people.?Most undecided voters have decided, they just like leveraging the courtship of being woed for their votes and anti-establishment advocates/ voters will never be swayed out of their own desire to have the same courtship presented to them as undecided voters with the added pressure of having every demand (no matter how rightful it is) met.?AOC (and for that matter, Bernie) exist in political bubbles where the success and popularity of the vote for them was already in line with proposed policy and hopefulness of further progressive values within the community. How they view GOP voters as being able to be swayed by greater empathy and further progressive platforms for the working class doesnt match up with the voters who truly believe they are similar to Trump, even when it routinely fucks them with healthcare and tariffs. The fact that we still have people talking about how Bernie should have won in 2016 and thats why were here is embarrassing, there is no time machine and moving toward a present reality was the option not debating the past after its done. And yet, still we have this silliness.?Ive worked as a social worker in Philly for almost a decade, I work in immigration law now. The policies that will affect both of these communities will be staggering. Trying to appeal to underserved working class populations outside of the city in red pockets has never reached a listening ear because the reality is that the majority dont care. They believe a party line and are eager to hold to it. When Ive had the displeasure of speaking to Trump supporters they cited dangerous illegals, abortion, and inflation as why they voted for him. How do you reach those people who are insistent on dangerous misinformation that is counter active to progressive policies? What concessions do you want to make??The most grossly admirable thing about the GOP is that theyre capable of mobilizing their voters with limited in fighting in order to press forward for a strident and unflinching wave of support.

The election was lost by a thousand cuts so Im not here thinking, If only they did this ONE thing they wouldnt won. But its clear that voters want simple slogans and talking points and simple solutions. They clearly dont care as much about results - half the shit Trump promised, he didnt do the first time, and voters brought him back. So one clear repetitive line of attack could have been Trump and Vance want to help Musk and Thiel, not you. Theyd have plenty of examples to pull out. I wouldnt be surprised if most voters dont know who Thiel is. Framing Vance as a puppet for the rich is a great way to introduce him. Too many people still think Elon is the mad scientist who invented all these things - well, theres another way to paint him, and its not positive for him. I was so frustrated during the vice presidential debate when Vance sanewashed himself with no pushback. Vance sounded like damn Bernie Sanders up there half the time, talking about lowering childcare costs and all these progressive-sounding policies that arent part of the GOP platform. And what happened? Walz didnt rebut any of it and was even saying how much he agreed with Vance half the time!

[Donald Trump's Militaristic Presidency Wasn't Anti-War](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/18/donald-trump-presidency-anti-imperialist-militarism-war/)Lets review the record. Despite inveighing against endless wars, Trump massively escalated the countrys existing wars in multiple theaters, leading to skyrocketing casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially upped the amount of airstrikes, leading to a 330% increase in civilian deaths. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis. According to the United Kingdoms Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were 2,243 drone strikes in just the first two years of Trumps presidency, compared with 1,878 in the entire eight years of the Obama administration.Trump also came very close to tweeting the country into a nuclear war with North Korea in late 2017 and early 2018, a completely self-inflicted incident that seems to have been bizarrely memory-holed. In 2018, Trump bowed to Washingtons neoconservative hawks and withdrew from a working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in Iran scaling up both its provocative activities in the region and its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks, should it decide to do so. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it wouldve taken Iran at least a year. The list goes on...And my favorite:[Trump discussed using a nuclear weapon on North Korea in 2017 and blaming it on someone else](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)","title":"Trump likely to pick Marco Rubio to serve as his secretary of state, sources say"},{"text":"Works for me","title":"Breaking: Trump expected to name Marco Rubio as Secretary of State.

At the last Republican debate, he attempted to justify George W. Bush invading Iraq: No matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of UN resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldnt do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.Stephen Zunes is a professor of politics and coordinator of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of San Francisco. He debunked Rubio's claim: \\"Sen. Marco Rubios claim that at the time of the March 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq that Saddam Hussein was in open violation of U.N. resolutions and that the international community refused to act is completely false. The Iraqi government had in fact been in full compliance with UN Security Council resolutions regarding the elimination of their chemical and biological weapons, their chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs, their long-range missiles, and other proscribed weapons and weapons systems and were allowing United Nations inspectors unfettered access to confirm they had done so.\\" https://accuracy.org/release/rubios-new-generation-of-iraq-war-lies","title":"Trump Picks War Hawk Marco Rubio for Secretary of State"},{"text":"Just trying to help you guys out, since we've been seeing a lot of election denying on this sub","title":"Elon Musks Starlink didnt rig 2024 election for Trump"},{"text":"Very excited about Tom Homan.","title":"Republicans Have Secured The House"},{"text":"Oh?","title":"Elon Musks Starlink didnt rig 2024 election for Trump"},{"text":"What you described is exactly what happens when your home is reassessed at a higher value.","title":"Jeff Bezos' net worth hits all-time high fueled by Amazon shares getting Trump bump"},{"text":"The courts cannot be trusted until they're packed.?The courts were packed full of conservatives and those leopards don't change spots?","title":"Republicans win majority of US House seats in government sweep"},{"text":"Okay?
