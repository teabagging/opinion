Trump's supporters were insufferably vocal about this, but now that Trump is the one actually refusing interviews while agreeing to mostly far right broadcast appearances, and lashing out like a child whenever an interviewer asks him anything remotely nuanced or challenging, his supporters are silent.Either that, or they're doing heavy mental gymnastics to rationalize Trump's actions, but this is nothing new of course.What's frustrating though, is how the media and the general public react differently to both candidates. As a result, Donald Trump's questionable behavior and actions have become normalized, while his opponent is grilled relentlessly for even the most inconsequential of news-making moves.Not only is Donald Trump refusing to do certain interviews, but he's attacking journalists and making unconstitutional threats against the media.He's also doing things like demanding an apology from CBS for hurting his feelings in a previous interview, and rambling incoherently on Truth Social about how \\"unfair\\" the media is towards him, and sometimes because, get this, a network like Fox News chose to give Harris an interview... He's complaining that his opponent is getting an interview slot, while he's shrinking away from doing interviews himself.This type of behavior would be disqualifying for anybody else, but because we've reached a point where Donald Trump has somehow become sane-washed by the very same media he complains about, Americans continue to pretend like Trump's behavior is normal, acceptable, compos fucking mentis.","title":"Time Owner Attacks Kamala Harris for Refusing Interview"},{"text":"Fox News is a mistake","title":"Bret Baier Says He Aired Wrong Trump Clip During Kamala Harris Interview: I Did Make a Mistake"},{"text":"People get mad about words because of what those words mean, not just because the words themselves just feel magically upsetting in your ears right.

Kamalas friends are trying to maintain this status quo.She has too many powerful friends. I mean for fucks sake, who the heck has a campaign fund of OVER ONE BILLION dollars, wasnt democratically elected, cant answer a single question honestly, and spent her entire career destroying young mens lives by putting them in prison for non-violent drug charges Someone whose friends dont want to deal with tariffs when using foreign sweatshops in the Pacific Rim. Someone whose friends need a broken border so they can subcontract a subjugated class of migrant workers (subsidized Big Ag corporate interest groups). Someone who can be black, young, and female enough to simply promise GenZ a bunch of labor rights and handouts and higher corporate taxes, because theyre too clueless to know that it will only indenture small businesses to VCs and larger conglomerates.Trump stands to make Americas middle class stronger, make our nation wealthier, still make the economy boom like never before, bring jobs back, rebuild our middle class, rebuild our border, stop human trafficking, and restore some level of international stability even if via childish diplomacy hinging on subtle business negotiating and carrying a big stick.Her handouts suck. Let me give an example of how Trumps apparent conservative value is actually better than Biden and Kamalas apples-to-apples inflationary handouts: Biden wanted to forgive $10k of student loans for some students. I dont know about you, but I have more student loans than that. With a Trump economy, interest rates would drop, and Id be saving almost $10,000 every year or two in student loans! I know because Trump averaged 1.3% with a max rate of 2.5%, while Biden had us at 5.5 by 2023, despite having all that spending benefit and taking credit for Trumps job growth. So Biden would waste more money, and do less!So do what you may. Kamala will win either way.

I genuinely despised Trump when he first ran. I was mad at him for asking for Obama's birth certificate. I didn't like his candor. He just seemed like an idiot, or worse, malicious. But then I began to watch live streams of protests, and rally's, and debates, and I even attended some. Without fail, every time I saw something with my own eyes, it was flipped around in the news. And then they came out with the -ist list. Trump was a racist, a rapist, a sexist, a isolationist, a terrorist, the list goes on and on. I thought to myself, wow, can he really be ALL of those things? Even in a movie, the bad guy has SOME good qualities, otherwise, he's just a bad bad guy.

This means things like giving the states the power to determine whether or not things like recreational marijuana or abortion (which happened when he overturned Roe vs. Wade) are legal in each state. It is the responsibility of people in each state to vote in state leaders that align with their values on issues like these things.This is the opposite of what the democrats push for- they are a fan of big government. They want people to rely on the government for things like healthcare (AKA universal healthcare) which would basically turn America into a country that more closely aligns with socialism. This is what Canada is like and because of things like universal healthcare, people die of completely curable things all the time. I know many people who moved to America from Canada because of this. In general giving countries that much control over everything has historically not ended up well (China, Russia, etc.). There is also the issue of censorship from the left (AKA over the top political correctness), which has resulted in people losing their jobs and livelihoods just for having opinions that differ from what is considered acceptable from the left. For example, people have gotten cancelled for not fully supporting transgenders or gay marriage. It is no longer seen as okay in many spaces in the US or media to have values that are rooted in religion, especially Christianity. I know so many people that have been attacked and told to off themselves, called a bigot, etc. for saying that they dont support the anyone can be any gender they want ideology, because they hold true to more conservative values as determined by the religion they follow. They are certainly not bad people, but for democrats to immediately jump to that conclusion and say such vile things is extremely INTOLERANT and why I personally left the Democratic Party finally. The whole cancel culture thing overall is a direct consequence of left ideologies.Generally, the democrats play a lot into race politics and encourage followers to hold a victim mentality which I believe has increased racial tensions to increase across the country. The party/ candidate focusing on race primarily seems to be democrats/ Kamala. In trying so hard to be woke I have seen democrats advocate for things like changing the name of the Washington Redskins and erasing the history of the Native American tribe the team was named after (which the Native American tribe is suing the NFL over). I think in trying to be woke, democrats actually end up erasing a lot of other cultures and whitewashing the country which is extremely devastating and also contributing to racial tensions seemingly being at an all time high. This is why I really dont understand why people see republicans as being the racists.Overall, I think Trump is what America needs right now in the face of all this nationwide division and with the ongoing international conflicts were involved in. Democrats started these wars after Trump pulled us out of them, and I think Trump is the stronger leader and the one that is the most likely to take us to where we need to go as a nation. I dont want to rely on the government to get by, I want the American dream and I think were a lot more likely to get there with Trump leading the way.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":" One of the underappreciated things about 2016 is that the electorate kinda sucked\\nThere's less Boomers and *far* less Silents now (Trump's strongest supporters).?\\nIf elections were sane, Dems would win this year on demographic changes alone.

Now having said that, Im happily voting for Trump. He was already president, in that time we had record high stock market, record low unemployment, and didnt get involved in any new foreign wars. GDP growth was higher than Obama and his economic analysts said it could be, America was producing and exporting goods, energy costs and gas were cheaper, and we had low inflation with much better interest rates. The Abraham accords and his work to bring stability to the Middle East was a far contrast to what we have had under Biden and Harris, and we had much better immigration policies, mainly the remain in Mexico policy. I dont expect Trump to be perfect, but unlike a lot of politicians I think Trump genuinely cares about America, I think he has a patriotic pride, why else would he endure so much scrutiny when he could just fuck of into the sunset with his fortunes. I think the fact that he has endured political identity assassination along with actual physical attempts on his life, and constant slandering by main stream media and much of Hollywood, speaks volumes to his character and his want to bring America into a better place. I also think him bringing in RFK has a great potential to right our fda and big pharmaceutical issues, I agree with a lot of what RFK says when he starts talking about how corrupt our government oversight of our food and pharmaceutical drug companies is and I think Trump aligning with him and Tulsi, who I also like, shows again hes less concerned with right wing and more concerned with whats right for Americans. Seeing him draw in these two democrats is also a stark contrast to who Harris drws in from the GOP, namely dick Chaney and Liz, who are both absolute war hawks. Hes also talked about reducing the size and scope of government, something no politician ever does, even going as far as talking about bringing in people like Elon musk to look over government efficiency. Weather I like Musk or not, I will not deny his ability to obtain efficiency, or his high iq, I want oversight on federal corruption, and to see some of the governments bloat and bureaucracy cut down. Trump has talked a lot about these types of changes to federal agencies, like a simpler tax code. Again, whens the last time weve seen a politician talk about reducing bureaucracy and the size and scope of government.Overall Im not concerned with Trumps morality or mean tweets because of his actions that I mentioned as well as his previous record as president. There are many things I disagree on Trump with and things I dont like about him but Im not voting for him to be my father figure, Im voting for him to fix the economy so I can afford gas and groceries, and to get us out of foreign conflicts and focus on Americans first, and I believe hell do that better than Harris will. Harris has a terrible track record as ag in ca, never received any primary votes, and has at best been incredibly inconsistent with her plans for this country, and I literally cant afford to gamble on her having another 4 years to correct, frankly a lot of the mistakes the Biden administration did. Shes openly said she will allow Trumps tax cuts to expire which will be a costly burden on me in an already terrible economy. I literally cant afford her to be president. I think Trump would be a better net positive for America than Harris, I have more faith in his ability to bolster our economy, and saturate the job market. I believe hell work to bring manufacturing back to America and will seek to end foreign conflicts instead of seeking to profit off it. Again, Im sure I wont agree with everything Trump does but right now Im far less worried about social issues than I am financial issues. Anyways thats why Im voting for Trump, for what Ive already seen him do, and for what he has undergone yet still persist. As Michael Moore once said, Trump is the middle finger to the rest of the establishment, a hand grande voters can chuck into dc, and the way the country is going I think its whats needed.","title":"I'm a democrat, but would like to talk to Trump supporters and generally understand why you support him."},{"text":"Like the SCOTUS that was ruthless!!","title":"LMAO ??

I can't for the life of me understand the mindset of white, male friends who say their top priority is the economy and think Trump is better than Harris on that particular topic. I spent like an hour talking with someone just yesterday. For example on inflation: first of all Jerome Powell was a Trump appointee who has been in charge of the fed the whole time, second of all a huge portion of the fiscal spending during covid was signed under Trump, third of all economists view fiscal spending as explaining a tiny portion of the inflation that we saw, fourth of all compare the inflation the US had and growth rate we saw compared to other developed countries, fifth of all consider housing the supply of which can't be increased much in 4 years, sixth of all consider gas prices which saw a which demand shock and oversupply during covid which led to less supply being invested in and then is more influenced by opec than anything Biden can do in the short term.... But even with a friend where you're having a non-antagonistic conversation you're never really going to change anyone's mind. I'm not even voting for Harris I'm just trying to talk about observable reality. Anyways my point is these things aren't based on facts or logic it's just an impression people have.

One day I found out how the media misaligned Sarah Palin. I was ashamed for having believed so many lies when I'd always been for avoiding bad gossip. So I looked into Trump seriously. The things I found, the times I went back over his history to fact check, the works. And there was no getting around it. A  lot of the things said were out and out lies.So I started to look into his platform. The first thing I had to accept is that you're not going to agree 100% with any politician. It's weird when you do.And then, the final nail in the coffin, was working with some Hillary supporters and listening to them talk. I tried once to be reasonable and tell them, hey, there are other walks of life out there that your wants (not needs) trample. And I was told \\"Well in MY America...\\" - that's a direct quote btw. And it literally scared me. I had never ever been frightened like that for my country's future before. I'm not even republican, so it's not a matter of this side and that side for me. It's a matter of what's right.THEN after it was over I was called out in front of the entire voice acting troop and blamed for everything wrong with the country because they lost. They really tore into me.This time I was waffling between RFK and Trump. I don't completely trust any one politician. But I can tell you that when it comes to Kamala, the dirt that's been out about her - verifiable dirt not fake stuff like Russian dossiers - make me feel like she's unfit to be in ANY leadership position much less that of president. I can't get behind someone who boasts about having the power of the pen. I can't get behind someone who won't answer things directly and lies about their past. I have a messy past, but I doubt I'd like about it the way she does. If you're such and such a race and don't like me for not being it, that's on you and I don't care. But her attitude reminds me of some evangelical pastors I've known: numbers first, consequences later. And we're not cabbages to be harvested in the rain.When RFK joined Trump that made it easier on me as a voter, but I'll be honest when I tell you I'll never exactly be on the Trump train. I'm on the horse running alongside. He did GREAT for the country before until he was cock blocked at every turn.

Churches should face consequences for breaking these laws, specifically by losing their tax-exempt status and being fined. The underlying principle is that tax-exempt organizations, including churches under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, are prohibited from participating in partisan political activities, and enforcement of these rules is necessary to maintain the separation of church and state and ensure a fair democratic process. The IRS doesn't appear to be enforcing this, even though laws and regulations exist. They may not have the funding to do so. It's almost as if churches should be allowed to engage in political activities without risking their tax-exempt status.   \\n  \\nMore clearly, I want the IRS to crack down on organizations that are in breach of Section 501(c)(3). They should have to pay taxes if they are going to break the very rules that allow them to maintain tax-free status. I'm not providing my own counter view or argument against my view.

But this election is not about choosing the most likeable person. We are voting between two vastly different ideologies. We are voting for the country we want to leave our children and grandchildren. Trump represents that future and has proven that he can deliver. He is a patriot to the core and even served his country for 4 years without pay.That moment when someone says, \\n\\"I can't believe you're voting for Trump\\". I simply reply, I'm NOT voting for Trump.I'm voting for the First Amendment and freedom of speech. I'm voting for the right to speak my opinion and not be censored. Im voting for secure borders and LEGAL immigration. I am voting for election integrity to include mandatory voter ID.  (Why would anyone vote against this?)I'm voting for the Second Amendment and my right to defend my life and my family.I'm voting for the police to be respected once again. I am voting for law &amp; order and an end to allowing protesters to trespass and burn our cities, destroying innocent small business. (Tim Walz)I am voting for personal responsibility and the end of the revolving door where criminals are being put back on the street. (Kamala Harris)I'm voting for the next Supreme Court Justice(s) to protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.Im voting for a return of our troops from foreign countries and the end to Americas involvement in foreign conflicts.I'm voting for the Electoral College and for the Republic in which we live.Im voting for the continued appointment of Federal Judges who respect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.Im voting for keeping our jobs to remain in America and not be outsourced all over the world - to China, Mexico and other foreign countries.I am voting for doing away with all of the freebies given to all of the illegals and not looking after the needs of the American citizens and homeless veterans. I'm voting for the military &amp; the veterans who fought for this country I'm voting to keep men out of women's sports.Im voting for peace progress in the Middle East.Im voting to fight against human/child trafficking.I'm voting for Freedom of Religion.

Agenda 47 on his website is a good place to start which provides some insight into what he plans to do.The policies, alongside the people who support him, all genuinely care about the country and the American people. They have nothing to do with identity politics, or aim to divide the country using racial policies unlike the opposing party.If you take a moment to read up on unbiased information, what he has done in the past, as four years in office, compare that to what is currently going on now in terms of economy, world presence, and state of the country, it's not hard to see the difference. Ask yourself why democrats are trying so hard to take this man down. Defame him, ridicule him. They even tried to kill him. Twice. Is it warranted? Is he truly the man they claim with all the hateful rhetoric that he supposedly is? Sure he has a big mouth, but sometimes it takes courage to speak loudly on what goes on in some people's minds. He has no filter. Starting WW3, project 2023, locking LGBT in concentration camps, removing women's rights, full out racism and discrimination especially towards the black community. Many many many more outrageous claims. Fact check them. He's been president for 4 years already. We have historical data. Did these things happen as democrats suggest?My biggest issue is it is unfortunate that reddit is full of leftist users and maybe bot accounts, that control most of the major subreddits like politics, news, world news, even television and media. They are never impartial and it is near impossible to gain unbiased information from both sides. No matter how badly Kamala fucks up, they will die on her hill. While Trump and Vance will always be the enemy to their eyes. Therefore, I highly recommend you find research outside of reddit because it is not a good source to gain impartial information, especially from the community whose blatant hate for Trump blinds them from providing impartial information.Tldr - Agenda 47 on website.

This isn't a matter of opinion, it's simple facts. One only needs a basic education and the ability to look up what a Tariff is. Tariffs are effective as a way to boost a domestic industry that would otherwise be threatened by cheaper foreign imports. Example: if American car companies were unable to produce cars as cheaply as the Japanese and German brands and were therefore unable to compete for sales to American consumers, then introducing a Tariff on automobile imports could force those Japanese and German brands to pay the tariff and they would then need to raise the price of their cars (otherwise they'd be selling them at a loss), and this would give the American brands an advantage in pricing (since they wouldn't pay any tariff to import cars), and enabling them to sell more cars in the local market, make a profit, and continue operating and employing American workers. And meanwhile, the Tariffs would make money for the US Treasury. However, the cost of imported cars would go up, and there would be no more cheap cars available. Because that is the point. (Mind you, it doesn't really work that simply in the auto industry because all these manufacturers distribute their supply chain and manufacturing/ assembly factories across both foreign and domestic locations, but it could probably be figured out) Tariffs don't have to be bad for the domestic economy, but by definition they cause prices to go up. To claim Tariffs would lower prices shows a fundamental lack of understanding of basic economics and what a Tariff is. Like, it's as stupid as suggesting that if we were to raise taxes on small businesses, that their profits would go up.  Now, it's probably not a coincidence that someone making such an erroneous, ignorant claim also has a history of failed businesses, but one doesn't depend upon the other. What Trump *might* think that wouldn't be absolutely stupid on its face is that the threat of Tariffs could be leveraged to pressure China to subsidize the production of goods that are exported to the US and offer lower prices to Americans as a result, so that they weren't singled out in a trade war and lose market share to other foreign producers of the same products. But that premise ignores the fact that China has a ridiculous share of the US consumer goods market and among the lowest costs of production, command of most of the supply chain, and there are almost no potential competitors. Therefore it's a hollow threat that would only hurt American consumers (a lot!) in the short term, and would become politically untenable long before China felt any pain. Not to mention China has other ways to retaliate and cause the US even more economic pain. It's a terrible plan. Mark Cuban is 100% correct. All I'm saying is his being right doesn't depend on his track record of successful entrepreneurship. It's just fact.","title":"I am going to trust Mark Cuban who is a self made successful businessman vs. a trust fund baby who has bankrupted the majority of his companies.

Werfel* case. This actually does bring up important questions about the automatic classification of churches as 501(c)(3) organizations and the perceived disparate treatment of religious entities.However, the concern is not about disliking religion or imposing unfair restrictions on religious organizations. The law prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations from participating in partisan politics, not just religious ones.?The idea that I'm essentially stating \\"*RELIGION*?cannot do things other tax exempt organizations do - simply because?*you don't like religion*...\\" is a false premise. Not only is it a Strawman but it feels a bit like an ad hominem masked as an assumption.My point being \\"bluntly wrong\\" is actually wrong, because you brining up caselaw inadvertently points out the law and tax code  that religious institutions need to maintain their tax-exempt status.Now, churches in the United States are generally granted automatic tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which means they do not need to apply for recognition from the IRS to be considered tax-exempt. This isn't a flaw in the system, it's been to the benefit of churches as they don't have to file and immediately receive tax-free status.However, this automatic exemption comes with certain restrictions, including the prohibition against participating in partisan political activities. All 501(c)(3) organizations, whether religious or secular, are subject to these same restrictions.If a church or religious organization wishes to engage more directly in political advocacy, it has the option to establish a separate entity under a different tax-exempt status, such as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, which allows for some political activities but comes with different tax implications and requirements.","title":"CMV: Churches that promote one political ideology, endorse one candidate over another, give parishioner funds to PACs or directly to a preferred candidate, should lose their tax exemption and be fined for breaking tax law."},{"text":"PA is preparing to have a few day delay in announcing their results due the switch to hand counting ballots","title":"For the first time since Harris replaced Biden atop the DNC ticket, Trump leads in all swing states per Real Clear Politics aggregate polling"},{"text":"I dont understand people who are against this yet they dont have any problem with spending trillions on nuclear weapons and bombs.

You probably also never heard that when it came to light almost a year later that Isaac had made *another* copy of the hard drive just in case, and that the information on it was about to become public, that the FBI \\"prepped\\" all the social media companies and news networks by telling them that \\"Russian disinformation\\" was about to come out and that they should suppress it to avoid interfering with the election.  Then the laptop files, detailing over a hundred crimes by Hunter and half a dozen by Joe became public, and the FBI said nothing - despite knowing it was real.  ...nor did they say anything when 51 \\"current and former intelligence officials\\" published a letter saying the laptop was Russian disinformation - despite knowing that was false.  The laptop data was eventually used by the government in one of the cases against Hunter Biden, which demonstrates its authenticity.You probably also never heard that there was a government operation consisting of dozens of officials whose job just before and after the 2020 election was to tell social media companies what (true) information to censor and who to ban....and that's before we get to things like the semi-truck load of completed ballots trucked across state lines, or the other election fraud, or the voter fraud.","title":"Fox Interview Did to Harris What the Debate Did to Biden"},{"text":"What pollsters are doing is statistically sound. They are looking at data from 2016 and 2020 and adjusting their baseline they judge their sample against based on that. It is true that in 2016 and 2020 the demographics who voted were slightly different in ways that favored trump over the baseline pollsters were using. They aren't going too deep down any rabbit hole or cooking the books for Trump as many suggest, what they are doing is including a certain number of trump leaning demographics who weren't considered likely voters prior to 2016 into their sampling selection criteria and based on 2016 and 2020 this is the statistically sensible thing to do.The potential problem is there isn't very good data to judge who might turn out for Harris, and it's very possible these \\"Trumpy\\" demographics who didn't really turn out before trump don't turn out in 2024 as strongly as they did in 2020. The Polling is \\"correct\\" in that it is measuring what it set out to measure, but it does seem likely to me that there is some level of sampling error simply due to the lack of data on Harris as a candidate.","title":"Hey Democrats, Dont Panic  Heres Why"},{"text":"isnt this an AI meme video being referenced in the tweet?\\nEdit: ooopsie I meant this tweet?https://x.com/Madhula73460014/status/1846963007081140378/mediaViewer?currentTweet=1846963007081140378&amp;currentTweetUser=Madhula73460014","title":"Apparently biden just said this to obama"},{"text":"this was dumb when Gore did it in 2000 and it's dumb now.","title":"After Harris nails Fox News and 60 Minutes interviews, ranting Trump makes absurd demand"},{"text":"You know what?

Churches, like all 501(c)(3) organizations, voluntarily accept tax-exempt status in exchange for adhering to certain restrictions, including refraining from partisan political activities. This agreement does not strip them of representation; rather, it ensures they do not use tax-advantaged resources to influence elections unfairly. If a church wishes to engage in political advocacy, it can do so by forgoing its tax-exempt status or establishing affiliated organizations under different tax codes, just as other entities do.The claim of a double standard with organizations like Planned Parenthood overlooks the fact that they, too, must comply with the same tax laws. Planned Parenthood separates its political advocacy through 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations, which are subject to taxation and different regulatory requirements. Churches have the same opportunity to establish such entities if they choose to engage in political activities. The issue is not about wealth or access to legal representation but about adhering to the legal framework that applies equally to all.   \\n  \\nWhat jobs a person holds (or is called to), their tax bracket, broad income inequality, or whether an organization decides to invest in a separate entity, has very little if anything to do with my CMV. Enforcing existing laws more effectively is not a radical change or a rewriting of standards; it is the proper function of regulatory agencies like the IRS. Ensuring compliance upholds the integrity of both the tax system and the democratic process. The argument is not an attack on religious institutions but a call for fairness and the preservation of constitutional principles that protect both religion and government from undue influence over one another.The idea that there's no separation of church and state in the U.S. Constitution, no existing interpretation in the courts including the SCOTUS, or more broadly within established law, overlooks the historical and legal interpretations of the First Amendment.?George Washington leading a prayer with the first Congress, eh. Its important to understand that practices have evolved, and an early action from the first president doesn't override constitutional principles, the actions of the other 46 (soon to be 47), and it surely doesn't negate relevant history since. True traditionalists wouldn't go so far. The fact that certain religious activities occurred in government settings during the nations infancy does not override the subsequent legal developments that have clarified and enforced the separation of church and state. Tradition alone cannot justify actions that conflict with constitutional mandates designed to protect religious freedom and governmental neutrality.","title":"CMV: Churches that promote one political ideology, endorse one candidate over another, give parishioner funds to PACs or directly to a preferred candidate, should lose their tax exemption and be fined for breaking tax law."},{"text":"which left are beating kids to death? and whats that got to do with the American left/Democrats?","title":"CMV: the left and democrats are not capable of the same cult behavior as maga"},{"text":"This!!

So it is massively incorrect to say my rabbi wields no more power over me as a voter than any politician.Finally, even if that's true, OP is simply calling for the cleric to be treated equally to a politician - ie their organisation should not be given a special exemption. \\"X is no different from Y\\" is an argument for treating X and Y equally, not for giving X a special treatment that Y doesn't have","title":"CMV: Churches that promote one political ideology, endorse one candidate over another, give parishioner funds to PACs or directly to a preferred candidate, should lose their tax exemption and be fined for breaking tax law."},{"text":"Release the Kraken!","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 17, 2024 - 19 days until election day!"},{"text":"The most basic way of measuring party loyalty is via The Democrats consistently have higher conformity scores with both the house and senate proving there is less nuance there. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/01/republicans-congress-party-conformity/Keep in mind that the majority of congressional bills are unanimous bills to rename post offices (not just simple, unanimous bills, that is even more - literally just renaming post offices), so conformity rates over 80% are all but expected - of that remaining 20% is what truly matters.","title":"CMV: the left and democrats are not capable of the same cult behavior as maga"},{"text":"While Id like to agree with you and recognize Im following into the thing op is talking about, your concept requires a good faith requirement that these people are *actually* undecided.

Which I think is laughable considering the amount of money funneled into diocese and archdiocese across America that also tend to have a many, many lawyers on retainer for a number of reasons (not to say the order of wealth the Vatican possesses).Most American Christians are protestant, they dont have the vatican at their back. Pastors work about 70 hours a week for about 60k on average. Not to say that they are absurdly poor, as if they have some sudden issue they have a congregation that will help them, but the sure as hell are not rich and do not have the ability to afford teams of lawyers at 400 an hour. You are explicitly holding a double standard where you are wanting to allow planned parenthood to do political advocacy while retaining tax advantageous status through complicated mix of 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), and 527 organizations, while denying that same ability to churches as they are unable to afford legal representation. You are explicitly wanting it to be legal to be a non-profit organization who advacates for politics, but only if you are rich enough as an organization to afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees and accountants to justify the structuring. Rather, its about ensuring that all tax-exempt organizations, including churches, comply with existing laws that prohibit partisan political activities. These laws apply equally to all 501(c)(3) entitiesreligious or secularto maintain a fair and impartial democratic process (especially important during elections).You cannot hide under the excuse that \\"I am only following rules\\" when you are also setting the rules to be followed. You are calling for radical changes in how these rules are enforced. Do you know what that is called? Case law. The fact that it is case law vs statutory law does not change that this is literally a change in the law that you are calling for. And again, that removes the excuse that you are only following the rules.  Regarding the concern that enforcing these laws harms society to the chagrin of everyone, its important to recognize that upholding the separation of church and stateAgain, there is no separation of church and state. That is not a part of the US constitution.The first thing George Washington did with the first congress was lead a prayer.Regardless of whether you want the USA to stand for that, the USA was not built on that standard. If you want to call for a new standard, you automatically remove any sort of argument from tradition or argument from authority, as you are setting yourself up as the new authority and are defying tradition.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to prevent government endorsement or support of religion in generalnot just to avoid establishing a specific national church.And again, the first thing George Washington did with the first congress was lead a prayer. The specific wording is literally to not create a specific national church, and that is it.   the revolt over the tea tax was about taxation without representation, not opposition to taxation itself. Your entire premise is to remove representation and do taxation.  My view isnt to tax the donations themselves but to enforce EXISTING tax laws you are not defending the status quo, you are advocating to re-write standards. That is a change in law. A radical change in case law is still a change in law, even if it is not a change in statutory law. So it is not existing law you want, it is new law.

I'm seeing your username allover this post. I find myself agreeing with you here and disagreeing with you there. I really do appreciate the debate. Really.  \\n  \\nThe issue isnt about churches lacking the legal resources to navigate complex regulations. Which I think is laughable considering the amount of money funneled into diocese and archdiocese across America that also tend to have a many, many lawyers on retainer for a number of reasons (not to say the order of wealth the Vatican possesses). Rather, its about ensuring that all tax-exempt organizations, including churches, comply with existing laws that prohibit partisan political activities. These laws apply equally to all 501(c)(3) entitiesreligious or secularto maintain a fair and impartial democratic process (especially important during elections).Regarding the concern that enforcing these laws harms society to the chagrin of everyone, its important to recognize that upholding the separation of church and state protects both religious freedom and governmental neutrality. This principle ensures that no single religion is given preferential treatment by the government, which is essential in a diverse society with multiple faiths and beliefs.As for the assertion that only modern progressive justices support these interpretations (I'm seeing bias here), its worth noting that the Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, strongly advocated for a clear separation between church and state. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to prevent government endorsement or support of religion in generalnot just to avoid establishing a specific national church.As for no-magic-in-this-house Thomas Jeffersons role in the American Revolution, the revolt over the tea tax was about taxation without representation, not opposition to taxation itself.   \\n  \\nTheres a clear misunderstanding about taxing donations to churches (which I began to address on another one of your comments). My view isnt to tax the donations themselves but to enforce EXISTING tax laws by revoking tax-exempt status or imposing fines (which is a tool the IRS uses) on churches that engage in prohibited partisan political activities.Lastly, suggesting that any enforcement of existing law aims to create a Maoist atheist state is... hyperbolic on a good day, but also another window into bias here (which I'm sure you'll address). The goal is to uphold constitutional principles that protect both religious liberty and the integrity of our political system.

If that happens, we'll be looking at hyperinflation, and the dollar being worth less than the paper it is printed on.Our military *used to be* the best.  Obama replaced most of the senior officers with woke leftists when he was President, and they replaced lower level officers and senior NCOs.  Our military now focuses on woke garbage, can't meet recruitment targets, and just got beat on the high seas by the Houthis - a fifth rate terrorist organization whose navy consists of repurposed fishing boats.Meanwhile, Biden-Harris have involved us in WWIII, while simultaneously depleting our ammunition stockpiles and funding terrorist organizations....and Harris thinks all of that was fine, and wouldn't do anything differently - but is running on \\"change\\".","title":"Fox Interview Did to Harris What the Debate Did to Biden"},{"text":"cool where do i go to find out im not in the list of people?","title":"Biden has approved $175 billion in student loan forgiveness for nearly 5 million people"},{"text":"What I WANT is everyone to vote.

Funding it with Nord Stream when its waging a hybrid war on both the West and Ukraine, and a conventional one on the latter to top it all off, is inherently counterproductive and suicidal. How, after almost 3 years of full-scale war, is this not obvious to everyone? Seems like victim blaming mentality. If China invaded Taiwan would you say \\"it's irrelevant who invaded Taiwan, the US is at fault for their economic struggles for getting addicted to Taiwanese fabs.\\" Sure Taiwan is an ally but they're clearly within the influence zone of our \\"enemy\\" China, seems dumb to rely on them for anything!Except the US IS diversifying, including by getting a new TSMC factory in Arizona. TSMC is also investing in countries allied to America, so your analogy holds no water. What progress is to be made with resolving the tensions of Russia and the west if we just see them as an \\"enemy country\\" we shouldn't do business with? Is that going to lead to worse or better tension? I know this sub is a huge proponent of instilling democracy through capitalism, baby.Because totalitarian Russia initiated this new Cold War and refuses to stop it except by taking off more and more slices off the Wests influence and power. Its up to Russia to change, democratize and stop assuming an adversarial posture. When it does, relations with Russia will massively improve, and the situation of her, the West and the entire world will as well. If it doesn't do that and keeps with the destruction of manpower, infrastructure (and military equipment as a result), thus creating forced barriers between countries, the regime must be destroyed. Lastly, what value does Russia have in a) kneecapping Germanys reliance on them as an energy producer and b) kneecapping the money they can make from the pipeline? \\"We are just gonna take the leverage we have and uhhh... Blow it the fuck up\\"The Kremlin doesnt think as logically as many of us assume, in fact their way of thinking is totally different and alien to that of the West. They thought they were gonna completely cripple Europe with this. They come from a line of Soviet-era KGB Chekists where they were taught to hate and oppose the West, and this is the mentality Vladimir Putin brought to Russia as a whole by assuming power in 2000. If he and his aides didnt do that, they wouldnt have transformed Russia from a problematic, but economically growing democracy, to a full-blown totalitarian state thats declining and getting hammered on all fronts every year. They also wouldnt be doing stuff like recently banning Discord and removing a vital communications apparatus for the Russian military, businesses and populations at large.And as I mentioned, it's all irrelevant when Russia turned off the taps for Nord Stream before even the explosions, regardless of who authored them.","title":"Voters wont thank Kamala Harris for the state of the economy | Why voters are down on Americas remarkable economy"},{"text":" The plain text doesn't say anything about being only about or even primarily about taxesState religion meant replacing the Church of England with the Church of the Untied States.

Going strictly by vibe test, she feels like she should be in a good position to at least match Biden's 2020 performance vs Trump. Trump will always be hated by more people than he's liked.

The wall between church and state is not a mere architectural feature of our republic; It is not a feature of our republic. There is no wall between church and state, the only rule is no state religion. This was designed to prevent a specific church tax to fund a specific national church - like the Church Rate to fund the Church of England. Think of how, instead of having social security taxes, we paid that tax to a \\"Church of the United States of America\\" - that is what is forbidden. Because obviously if that one specific church got 1.2 trillion dollars a year in tax  revenue, vs a the next largest church in the USA (the catholic church) has revenue of only about 20% as much, that one specific church would be dominant. It is about tax dollars going to religious institutions and specific religions being prioritized over others. Most of the times where this actually comes up, quite frankly from a purely pragmatic point of view it is better to side with the religious institutions. School vouchers that could be used to pay for religious schools... those religious schools spend less per student and actually get better academic results, and it can be used on any school not just the religious ones anyways. The average annual tuition for elementary students at a Catholic school is around $5,000 vs about $17,500 for public schools. For high school students the gap narrows to about 10k vs 19k, but that is still a huge gap.  Tax dollars for using churches for natural disaster relief... the local church knows the community better than some bureaucrat at FEMA in DC, and again they are not going to be the sole way of distributing aid.  When religious organizations decide to wade into partisan politics, they not only betray their sacred mission Most religions are specifically political ideologies, and are definitionally a partisan faction in and of themselves.  It is an affront to the principle of secular governance to ask citizens to cast their ballots under the gaze of religious symbols,The USA has never stood for that. The first thing George Washington did with the first congress was lead a prayer.Regardless of whether you want the USA to stand for that, the USA was not built on that standard.","title":"CMV: Churches that promote one political ideology, endorse one candidate over another, give parishioner funds to PACs or directly to a preferred candidate, should lose their tax exemption and be fined for breaking tax law."},{"text":"Why the fuck do we care what someone's grandparents are?

Besides the standard and imo more common rhetoric of calling each other stupid. Right leaning Americans almost by default and with few exceptions talk of democrats in a fiercely negative and aggressive way.  This goes for the leaders and the normies who vote for them.It took years and expert,  academic backing for democrats and leftists in the main stream sense  to call out Trump for his fascist rhetoric and even then they generally remain quite reserved in my experience.The right has been calling the left/democrats shit like that for my entire life and presumably before quite openly.It really is  like the right is often  treated like the children they are, because it is expected and prudent to do so , but the \\"left\\" needs to act like adults and bare  them with patience and love as if they're just known  to be more respectable.

And there was no way  there was no way of making a correct statement that early.  I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters.

Do they have any semblance of guilt?Let me ask you this:  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?  Do they have any problem?  I think they do.  As far as Im concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.Q ? ?Youre not putting these THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.  Im not finished.  Im not finished, fake news.  That was a horrible day Q    Sir, youre not putting these protestors on the same level as neo-Nazis Q    Is the alt-left as bad as white supremacy?THE PRESIDENT:  I will tell you something.  I watched those very closely  much more closely than you people watched it.  And you have  you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent.  And nobody wants to say that, but Ill say it right now.  You had a group  you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violentQ    Is the alt-left as bad as Nazis?  Are they as bad as Nazis?THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Q    Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?THE PRESIDENT:  Those people  all of those people Cexcuse me, Ive condemned neo-Nazis.  Ive condemned many different groups.  But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.  Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.  Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. LeeQ    Should that statue be taken down?THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.  If you take a look at some of the groups, and you see  and youd know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases youre not  but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.So this week its Robert E. Lee.  I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down.  I wonder, is it George Washington next week?  And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?  You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?But they were there to protest  excuse me, if you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.(...)\\n \\nQ    Mr. President, are you putting what youre calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane?THE PRESIDENT:  Im not putting anybody on a moral plane.  What Im saying is this:  You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs  and it was vicious and it was horrible.  And it was a horrible thing to watch.But there is another side.  There was a group on this side.  You can call them the left  you just called them the left  that came violently attacking the other group.  So you can say what you want, but thats the way it is.Q    (Inaudible) both sides, sir.  You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides.  Are the THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think theres blame on both sides.  If you look at both sides  I think theres blame on both sides.  And I have no doubt about it, and you dont have any doubt about it either.And if you reported it accurately, you would say.Q    The neo-Nazis started this.  They showed up in Charlottesville to protest THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.  They didnt put themselves  and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.  You had people in that group.  Q    (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.  I saw the same pictures as you did.You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.(...) THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.  Are we going to take down the statue?  Because he was a major slave owner.  Now, are we going to take down his statue?So you know what, its fine.  Youre changing history.  Youre changing culture.  And you had people  and Im not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists  because they should be condemned totally.  But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.  Okay?  And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people.  But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats.  You had a lot of bad people in the other group.Q    Who are the good people?Q    Sir, I just didnt understand what you were saying.  You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?  I just dont understand what you were saying.THE PRESIDENT: ?No, no. ?There were people in that rally  and I looked the night before  if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. ?Im sure in that group there were some bad ones. ?The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people  neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest  because I dont know if you know, they had a permit. ?The other group didnt have a permit. ?So I only tell you this: ?There are two sides to a story. ?I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country  a horrible moment. ?But there are two sides to the country.Does anybody have a final \\n https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-infrastructure/","title":"cmv: the Charlottesville \\"very fine people\\" quote/controversy was not fake news"},{"text":"A poignant example of intelligence polarization","title":"Inside the Secretive $700 Million Ad-Testing Factory for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"This is such an irrational line from the right.

Most everyone cares about the same shit and wants in life -- not just the occasional irrational/smooth at a trump rally parroting garbage... same goes for MSNBC parrots (only they are slightly less 'loud' about it; which brings to question whether they have some degree of internal debate as to what it is that's clear brainwash... and possibly what's not).Thing is, if you take a gander at every election result - the messaging collectively yields a 50-50 split. As a progressive (depending on what content/beliefs you have, I err more to the left of the usual and def to the left of centralist/MSNBCers).  Why is it always 50-50 and why doesn't the self-proclaimed pseudo-progressive centralist dem *not* get a greater proportion by: advocating for marijuana legalization (\\\\~78% america is pro legal), anti-war (huge proportion of america hates war and is fucking sick of it), pro M4A (this is up there, some \\\\~68%, a supermajority of america wants this), canceling student debt... canceling medical debt... environmental/climate change considerations... it Goes on and on and on.  My point is she could win NO DOUBT, like 68-32 kind-of margins here if she just picked one of these things. Instead she/DNC play loosey goosy with it, don't forget about sprinkles of ambiguity... and takes the DUH ones and blows them up into super weighty things. Roe is a DUH DUH DUH, it isn't progressive, it should just be standard.The big problem, the real problem is both players are there for the elites - either center-right to right and then far-right to authoritarian. Do people not see the scale this way? I wouldn't even consider Kamala as even 'centrist'. She might dip a pinky toe into centrist policy, but she's got her fingers twisted behind her back.Don't believe me? Look. At. Both. Approval. Numbers.  Why not Bernie in '16? He had the numbers, he had cali nomination... he WAS THERE!  Likewise, why couldn't Walz be at the top of the ticket instead of being subverted as the underling, the mouthpiece without any real power to accomplish these things? Kamala will make it look like she's really trying to get these policies done... she might even sternly target you through the tv camera stating she's try real hard. And yet we'll have 2 congress/senators that are supposedly dem but they have changes of heart at the last second (think Sinema and Manchin) if the elites don't really approve of something that doesn't benefit them, there will be two cocksuckers there ready to play wide receiver.

Details were scant. No time or place was certain, but the word was that white nationalists and supremacists coming to town for Saturdays Unite the Right rally had a Friday night surprise. They were going to march in a torchlight procession  a symbolic gathering meant to evoke similar marches of Hitler Youth and other ultraright nationalist organizations of the past century. A little after 8 p.m., Richard Spencer, a leader of far-right white nationalists and a scheduled headline speaker at the Saturday rally, texted a reporter. Id be near campus tonight, if I were you, he wrote. After 9 p.m. Nameless field. The rumor was true. The torchlight parade was on. It would prove to be the catalyst for a horrific 24 hours in this usually quiet college town that would come to be seen by the nation and world as a day of racial rage, hate, violence and death. When it was over, questions about how this could happen centered on three groups: a meticulously organized, well coordinated and heavily armed company of white nationalists; a fiercely resistant and determined group of counterprotesters prepared to stop the Saturday rally; and state and local authorities who seemed caught off guard by the boldness and persistence of both groups. By 8:45 p.m. Friday, a column of about 250 mostly young white males, many wearing khaki pants and white polo shirts, began to stretch across the shadowy Nameless Field, a large expanse of grass behind Memorial Gymnasium at the University of Virginia. Their torches, filled with kerosene by workers at a nearby table, were still dark. Stay in formation! barked an organizer carrying a bullhorn. Two by two! Two by two! Within minutes, marchers lit their torches. Additional organizers, wearing earpieces and carrying radios, ran up and down the line shouting directions. Now! Now! Go!\\" The marchers took off at a brisk pace and immediately began yelling slogans: Blood and soil! You will not replace us!

The idea of the \\"culture of poverty\\" is super prevalent in the conservative culture war, but it isn't taken very seriously elsewhere. It is because the underlying question is whether culture is an independent and self-sustaining factor in creating and perpetuating poverty cycles. When put into a way you can operationalize and test, what the evidence shows, time and again, that conditions of poverty cause the poverty culture so the remedy is elimination of poverty.The operative takeaway for policy making is obvious. What this means is if the expression of poverty are only changed by solving for poverty, then things like a more expansive welfare state and equitable worker's protections and caps on executive pay and these sorts of solutions are on the table. But if it's an incurable biproduct of a cultural pathology then, welp, that's just the way it is.Sources: [https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28019?login=false](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28019?login=false) and [https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/steinberg-php/](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/steinberg-php/)The book black rednecks and white liberals by Thomas Sowell further touches on the trickle down effect this had on blacks.Sowell's work has internally contradictory causal stories. One thing Sowell points out is that disparities were better in the past and are worse since the Civil War. If that's the case, then blaming an ancient pathological defect in the culture of people that can be traced back to their descendants wouldn't show this. Two is that Sowell cites that black redneck culture came from white redneck culture and was transported in Northern cities in the 1960s. Why wasn't there any evidence of this culture prior to the 1960s? In fact, you saw black excellence prior to Jim Crow laws and structural barriers being erected in the back lash of Reconstruction. It was structural and institutionalized racism that killed Tulsa's boom in the 1920s.Third - if even if you could trace back cultural transmission from the 17th British highlands, then why does Sowell rule out that the 19th century slavery or 20th century Jim crow laws don't have material consequences vis-a-vis concentrating poverty?of the issue of the poor mentalities in the black American community.?Wells Fargo systematically scored black and latino applicants to higher risk classes on the basis of their race and no other crediting writing factor. So, when all these people are denied loans or have to pay higher costs of borrowing, was it really a lack of mentality?Not only did the DOJ settle with them in 2012, but more reporting since 2020 on shows they're the only company rejecting more black applicants than they accept. So they're still at it. Stuff like this 100% has nothing to do with the black mentality.When the NYC were stopping and risking people of color - stripping of them of their dignity and showing them that society thinks they have heightened criminality, that, and not that they like hip hop or whatever, is what drives people to despair and hopelessness.When a parent goes into the world and knows the world isn't giving them opportunities their talent states they deserve. Then a child repeats the same steps.

People can relate to him. Or actually, it's HE that relates to the people!He's not a politician.  He's a billionaire.  But he doesn't act like one, so regular people relate to him.If you don't have Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Or hate him because that's all you know because that's all the media tells you about him.(They brainwash their followers to think Trump is Hitler &amp; a horrible, very bad man. When he us not.)(THEY actually are the threat to our Constitutional Republic, as they want to abolish our constitution. Take away our freedom of speech,  and so on, if you follow what they are doing.)So if you think for yourself, use common sense, then you see the truth.Then he's a likable, relatable guy.\\nWho knows business.  Knows commerce. And ran our country the 4 years he did, so that EVERYBODY benefited. Not just one side.All while being persecuted from day one with all lies! As came out later!...\\nWhen I first saw him come down the escalator, I was for him. No one else was, back then. I don't watch TV, so I had no idea who he even \\"was\\".Why did I like him?Because we gave them through house. We gave them the senate. What did they do?Nothing! -Empty promises. -All lies to get in. ... Typical politicians. I was sick and tired of, and fed up with it, beyond belief. I BELIEVED Trump, because he spoke believable.Was he perfect? No. ... I didn't want perfect.  I wanted someone who would do what he said.And you know what? He did. He kept his promises. HOW MANY POLITICIANS DO THAT??!!  ...  None!!And I don't agree with every thing he says, but he's a president for ALL people.  Even those I might personally disagree with.And I can live with that.He's a decent human being.I've read story after story of how he's helped people in his day to day, own, personal life. -That the news doesn't/ won't tell you.That's how you judge character.And no he's not perfect.  But he's good where it counts.  Good where it matters. I'm not picking someone to marry, I'm picking the best person to run our country!He truly cares about America.  And he truly cares about the American people. He's fighting FOR us! It's not him they're after, per se. ... It's us. He's just in the way.They lie. They persecute him. The media is dishonest and can't be trusted. They don't have real reasons (as they're all untruths) ... it's just hate, hate, hate. -Him AND us.Orange man bad.  ... TDS is a real thing. ... I love to hear stories about those whose eyes have been opened.  And I'm glad for them to see the truth..... When Trump talks, it just puts a smile on my face.  Even if I may not exactly care for something he says.I think, man, this guy doesn't have to do this. He's not doing it for the money. .... He's doing it because he loves and cares about we the people,  and this great country!And he and WE, know that he's our last chance.  ... If they stay in power, they will utterly destroy this country, and I think there will be no going back.People won't be able to afford to feed their families.  Or afford anything.  This country will turn into a 3rd world * hole. There's a million things I could write here of what will happen.  ...In 2016, I had to convince my family to go for Trump and why. .... These days, we all know if this country is going to be saved, Donald J. Trump has got to win.Or we will never be able to recover,  or be a free country again!!2- He does not have much to show?I disagree there! He's done so much, ALL while being falsely attacked from day one!I know not ONE other person who could withstand what he's been through. Weren't you better off under his polices? I know I was. And many more people I know were.Actually, the whole country was better off, and safer, too.We should all be praying he gets in, or our country is truly lost.","title":"Not an American nor do I live there, just wondering about everyone's perspective."},{"text":"Heard where?

This reportedly pissed off the then-President, who reluctantly gave a second statement.This is the **second public statement** [(August 14, 2017)](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/14/full-text-trump-comments-white-supremacists-charlottesville-va-transcript-241618).\\"Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\\"Wow!  Great!  Finally we can put this to rest, right?Except *Trump fucking hated this*.  According to Bob Woodward in \\"Fear: Trump In the White House,\\" Trump resented the fact that he had to walk back his earlier statement.  For narcissists like Trump, the slightest hint of admitting you were in the wrong is a sign of weakness.  In an exchange with his Staff Secretary Rob Porter, Trump raged:That was the biggest fucking mistake Ive made, the president told Porter. You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didnt do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?Though Porter had not written the original draft, he had spent almost four hours editing it with Trump, providing the accommodating language. But strangely Trump did not direct his rage at Porter. I cant believe I got forced to do that, Trump said, apparently still not blaming Porter but venting directly to him. Thats the worst speech Ive ever given. Im never going to do anything like that again. He continued to stew about what he had said and how it was a huge mistake.This is where Trump made his **third public statement** [(August 15, 2017)](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html), where even though Trump condemned this \\"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence,\\" he also ended up blaming the \\"alt-left\\" and walking back his walk-back with the words that made him infamous:\\"There is blame on both sides?.?.?. you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had a lot of bad people in the other group too?.?.?. there are two sides to a story.\\"To which David Duke, former leader of the KKK reacted to in a tweet:  \\"Thank you President Trump for your honesty &amp; courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville.\\"So there you have it.  The full context of the \\"very fine people on both sides.\\"  It was a moment where Trump, resentful over being forced to come out and condemn neo-Nazis and align with people who find Nazis detestable, fell back on waffling and again drew a false equivalence between the two groups.So yes, it was a case where Trump's advisors tried to get him to stop shitting the bed, but he dragged himself back to scoot around on the skidmarks.tl;dr:1. Trump's \\"very fine people on both sides\\" statement was part of a larger pattern of him waffling in condemning neo-Nazis, and even explicitly insisting that the nonexistent \\"alt left\\" counterprotesting the Nazi rally were just as bad.\\n2. Trump's condemnation of neo-Nazis were a separate statement that he made because his staffers pressured him to.\\n3. Trump HATED having to condemn the neo-Nazis.  Granted, this isn't necessarily because Trump aligned with neo-Nazis, but more due to his narcissistic outrage at having to issue a correction which made him \\"look weak.\\"\\n4. Republicans themselves condemned Trump's waffling, and at least some KKK members and neo-Nazis saw this waffling as a sign of support from Trump.","title":"cmv: the Charlottesville \\"very fine people\\" quote/controversy was not fake news"},{"text":"Baier himself vehemently disagrees with you.

Also remember the context here is the Charlottesville \\"Unite the Right\\" rally was organized by neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, so the rally definitely had neo-Nazi origins and motives. These statements/press briefings were Trump's response to the vehicular assault by neo-Nazi James Alex Fields, who plowed into a crowd and injured 35 people, killing one (Heather Heyer).The **first public statement** [(August 12, 2017, the day of the murder)](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-va-choice-and-quality-employment-act-2017-bedminster-new-jersey) was the one that got Trump in trouble:\\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\\"This rather ambiguous statement blaming \\"many sides\\" [came under fire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/charlottesville-protest-trump-condemns-violence-many-sides) because it seemed to draw an equivalence between the neo-Nazis, and the counter-protestors who were very much anti-Nazi.Now some might claim this outrage is just the result of liberal pearl-clutching, *many Republicans themselves* came out to criticize Trump and explicitly condemn neo-Nazis out of shock and disgust at his rather milquetoast statement:[Marco Rubio:](https://x.com/marcorubio/status/896483980857532416)  \\"Very important for the nation to hear u/potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists\\"[Cory Gardener:](https://x.com/SenCoryGardner/status/896472477844385792)  \\"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name.

My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home. -OGH\\"Lindsey Graham even went on Fox News Sunday to criticize Trump, saying that the President needs to correct the record here. *These groups seem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House*, and I would urge the president to dissuade these groups that hes their friend.[Part 2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g61cwb/comment/lsfww0i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)","title":"cmv: the Charlottesville \\"very fine people\\" quote/controversy was not fake news"},{"text":"Yes.

Their field offices are set up to turn out every single democratic leaning voter in the swing states, the Republican ground game has been outsourced to super PACs and he needs to get historically unreliable voters to turn out for him. They might, and Trump has been good at that but bare in mind that Trump has never once gotten beyond a 47% vote share nationwide and that's where the polls have him now. He's unlikely to do better than the polls put him currently.The Democrats on the other hand have a higher voter ceiling, they can get 51% of this race if they turn out their voters, which will win them the election. It comes down to ground game, and this is where the Democrats have the advantage, not to mention history. Famously they won the 2012 election where polls had Obama and Romney pretty much in the same position as Harris and Trump are at now in the polls, Obama won comfortably.You seem to be of the opinion that Trump's momentum will continue with his current posture. That is a fallacy. And there is no real momentum. What you're seeing as momentum is some tightening in the polls and statistical noise. A 7% shift in likelihood in the 538 forecast is essentially no movement at all.","title":"Why Kamala Harriss Fox Interview Was a Failure"},{"text":"He is already going after Fox in his latest ramblings on truth social.","title":"Fox News interview with Kamala Harris draws 7.1 million viewers, more than quadruple channels average audience"},{"text":"Oh I know I'm not talking about never recovering for the election, I mean he'll personally never recover from it.

If marching to preserve the statue is bad, then it's bad whether or not the Nazis were there. If it's not bad, then the presence of Nazis doesn't change that either.Maybe you've never heard the \\"Nazis also drink water\\" argument, but this is exactly what you are doing in the above.  You are saying that Nazi affiliation doesn't *inherently* make an issue right or wrong, which is true: if drinking water is good then it's good regardless of whether the Nazis drink water too.  But what I am pointing out is that the white supremacist beliefs of the Nazis and the preservation of the Lee statue are clearly connected.  Why else do you think the Nazis showed up?  It is to preserve the statue as a symbol of white supremacy, i.e. as a symbol of the very thing that everyone hates about the Nazis.Do you in fact believe that the marchers would have been in the moral right if the Nazis weren't there? I would still morally object to the protestors because I don't think \\"historical preservation\\" outweighs eliminating symbols of white supremacy.  I just wouldn't necessarily think they are *as bad* as Nazis, I would just think that their priorities reflect some lesser degree of racial bias.  But the Nazis *were* there which makes the decision to prioritize \\"historical preservation\\" even more unlikely to be the sole concern of the protestors.   Because now, they are prioritizing \\"historical preservation\\" over eliminating symbols of white supremacy **AND** affiliating themselves with Nazis.  Why does that inference need to be made, and what value does it add?People make inferences when they are presented with two possibilities and they want to know, using logic and reason, which of the two possibilities is *most likely* to be true.  If your stance is now that you just don't care to know whether it's more likely that the people protesting alongside Nazis were white supremacists / racists themselves, or whether they were just innocent people that wanted to protect a piece of history, then that's fine - I guess it just doesn't matter one way or another to you.  But your indifference is not an argument against one possibility clearly being much more likely than the other.","title":"cmv: the Charlottesville \\"very fine people\\" quote/controversy was not fake news"},{"text":"Women looking fine up in here!","title":"Obamas calling it.

Ben Axelrod of Awful Announcing details some of the choice quotes Lewis gave in his interview:What were watching is a change of behaviour, Lewis told Subramanian. This is what happens to football players who get hit in the head: they run into problems with violence and aggression.Per Subramanian, Lewis also speculated that perhaps one of Ohers lawyers thought it was a good time to sue the Tuohys or that Oher figured the public would get behind him if he makes these accusations.Its of course worth noting that Tuohys are longtime friends of Lewis and that his portrayal of Oher and the familys relationship had already been the subject of scrutiny prior to the lawsuit. Lewis, however, has doubled down on his depiction of the family taking Oher into its home while he was in high school, despite claims that it paints a convenient white savior narrative.Its this cancel culture thing, Lewis told Subramanian, noting former Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freezes support for the Tuohys.

It's everyone's place to say that it should be devoted to the horrors that happened rather than celebrating the Nazis. The context is a necessary part of any of these monuments being okay, but the context was what was being marched against not just moving it to a museum.

THIS WHOLE SORDID AND FRAUDULENT EVENT IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY! Trump wrote on Truth Social.?? What a child...  He's throwing a temper tantrum because it's \\"not fair\\" that he doesn't get to go up against the opponent *he* wants to face. And what's worse is that the media and the general public have normalized this behavior.The irony is that Trump should have been disqualified long ago, any other candidate would have been.It's all projection. The Republican party has chosen Trump as the ringleader of their circus for three elections in a row... He just can't compute, he can't accept that Biden dropped out of the race because for one, he's terrified of Harris, and two, he'd never even consider yielding power to another.So that's what this is about, his growing insecurities. He then suggested that President Biden jump back in the race and for Harris to be investigated over the interview.This is also about his supporter's unease. They too are upset that Biden is no longer Trump's opponent. But here's what's important to keep in mind.These same people have been claiming for years that Joe Biden is unfit... And now that he's out of the race, all of a sudden, it's unfair. This has to be acknowledged. These people are so entitled. It's always about what *they* want, about *their* feelings. They obviously don't care about democracy, otherwise they'd agree that Joe Biden, the man they've been saying is unfit for the presidency, was obligated to drop out of the race. They now, in retrospect, perceive that Trump had a better chance of defeating Biden, so they choose to contradict themselves and reveal just how upset they are that things aren't going their way. Let me make things clear to all those conservatives whining incessantly like children that this matchup isn't fair... The Constitution contains multiple articles and clauses that lay out the electoral process, but provide little guidance for nominating a presidential candidate. Primaries eventually became adopted as part of the process, and came well after the existence of conventions, but at the end of the day it's state/party delegates who nominate the candidate. Biden never received that nomination. Harris acquired enough delegates for the nomination months ago, and while no one stepped up to challenge her.The Constitution has little say on this matter, there's nothing inherently illegally or unconstitutional about any of this, and most Democrats have been onboard since Biden stepped aside. In fact, most democratic voters expressed their reservations about Biden being the nominee. Polls consistently showed concerns from a majority of voters, which means that if Biden stayed in the race, it would have actually invalidated those voter's concerns and desire for a new candidate. THIS is the Democratic outcome.AND The only *real* problem that conservatives have with this outcome, is that it hurts their *feelings.*Harris has met all of the qualifications, and Biden didn't zip-line into the convention to take the nom back from Harris like Trump suggested he would because Trump can't fathom doing what Biden did, he prioritized country over party and over self. Trump on the other hand, has consistently shown us that he's only capable of the opposite. Donald Trump is Trump first, not America first.Keep in mind also that there's no precedent for this situation. An ostensible incumbent is through the primaries and steps aside while waiting for the convention, this is a very rare thing, which means there's no distinct guidelines either, there's also no \\"primary do-over\\". Harris followed the process, she has the delegates, she has the support, she has the nomination. She was made the nominee because she is the natural successor to the president, and she was voted in as that successor by 81 million Americans. Both she and the Democratic party have done nothing to deserve this criticism. For all intents and purposes, Harris followed the Democratic process and she absolutely has the support of the Democratic party, In fact, she has more support than Biden did, which means her candidacy is actually more in line with our country's democratic ideals, and guess what? there's nothing Trump or his seething followers can do about it except whine incessantly like children on social media.All this is doing is highlighting the Republican party's capitulation to Trump, their decision to make Trump their frontrunner three elections in a row, while democrats have instead put forth three *different* candidates. Term limits my ass...It also highlights their unabashed and shameless sycophancy, cronyism, favoritism, and deification of the narcissistic manchild they fawn over.I mean, the humiliating fact is that Trumpism is its own religious order and his supporters have wrapped their entire identities and personalities around him, living vicariously through him in a soon-to-be emotionally scarring way.But most importantly, what it highlights is the difference between Democrats and Trump. Where one is willing to step aside, where one is willing to speak out, express concerns about the leader of their party without being branded a \\"DINO,\\" a traitor, an outcast, without being alienated, slandered, burned at the stake... Where one is willing to hear those concerns, willing to give up another chance at power, for whatever reason, we see someone like Donald Trump, a malignant narcissist, who would never, no matter the circumstances, drop out of the race or relinquish power.

Or why egg prices were allowed to come down without hurting the economy, but nothing else.Change in the price of individual goods vs. change in the general level of prices are different things. A decrease in the price of a particular good is rarely a bad thing. Often it's pretty beneficial. An example is the decrease in price of flatscreen TVs over the past couple decades. They've gotten cheaper to make, leading to more people being able to buy them. Sometimes the price of a good decreases because of falling demand. You can pick up an Xbox 360 nowadays for pretty cheap due to that, as an example.Now when you look at a decrease in the general price level of goods, or deflation, you're looking at similar phenomena but in the aggregate. It's much more likely for a decrease in demand to be behind that. That's not good. A whole economy buying less goods is a bad sign. There might be a few examples throughout history of an increase in aggregate supply being behind deflation, but very rarely will it be the case that supply across the economy sees an increase like that. Improvements in technology or productivity just tend to be largely concentrated in one area.","title":"Voters wont thank Kamala Harris for the state of the economy | Why voters are down on Americas remarkable economy"},{"text":"Came to say this","title":"The NRA cant wrap their minds around the fact that a Democrat is the only hunter thats a candidate."},{"text":"Its all about putting JD Vance in a position where if (and when) DJT steps down, he can pardon and let Elon Musk and Peter Thiel run the country as technocrats for the next four years.?","title":"Trump complains to judge that Kamala Harris has used Jack Smith's evidence in ads"},{"text":"I suspect her strategy team has decided its too late to change the narrative.

You can generally assume that the politicians that erected them were Klan members, and likely high ranking ones. Those monuments, in and of themselves, are monuments to white supremacy. It's one thing to move them to a museum exhibit explicitly about racism, or placing a plaque on them talking about Jim Crow era Klan politicians, but that's not what we're talking about. They were, in fact, marching to prevent the sratue from being placed within those contexts.","title":"cmv: the Charlottesville \\"very fine people\\" quote/controversy was not fake news"},{"text":"Because the people who think the current administration has any success will already be voting for her.\\nShe's hoping to pick up a few votes from people who have been brainwashed to believe all Biden actions have been bad.","title":"After Harris nails Fox News and 60 Minutes interviews, ranting Trump makes absurd demand"},{"text":"She agreed to it so she could bash Trump.

They are just there to protest the removal of the statue of a Confederate general, and this issue is so important to them that, despite not being white supremacists themselves, they continue to protest alongside the neo-Nazis.2) The people not wearing swastikas are also white supremacists / neo-Nazis and just aren't wearing any swastikas or other explicit indicators of their affiliations.Which of these two inferences is more reasonable?Obviously it's 2, right? The main reason why this is obvious is that there is no legitimate reason to preserve the statue at the cost of aligning oneself with the most reviled political organization in the history of time.  No reasonable person has such a strong interest in \\"historical preservation\\" that they would willingly align themselves with neo-Nazis.

The narrative is that elections are about people choosing between A and B. In reality, the people who actually change their minds like that are vanishingly few, and elections are often decided not by people choosing who to support, but whether or not they vote at all.Polls will try to determine voter likelihood, but they typically set a threshold and discard all respondents below their threshold, and count those above. In other words, it's a binary state, and an independent variable. *Who* those voters want to vote for is treated as the dependent variable. But there's a strong case to be made that that's backwards. Polls might even be more accurate simply asking which party someone voted for in the past, and then focusing on determining a percentage likelihood of the person voting as the dependent variable.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Yep.","title":"Kamala Harris shares full Trump clip after accusing Fox News of editing"},{"text":"Newsweek is gonna Newsweek","title":"Kamala Harris shares full Trump clip after accusing Fox News of editing"},{"text":"To be clear: Stein *wants* to hurt Harris more than Trump.It's just that she's an awkward mix of insane and irrelevant.And so her pool of eligible marks is heavily contaminated.","title":"Jill Stein hurts Donald Trump more than Kamala Harris, poll suggests"},{"text":"I don't wish for harm on anyone, but I hope the left goes ape shit.

For the most part the energy will always flow from the path of least resistance, flowing from low potential to high potential. So information, behaves in a way that is identical to the way energy behaves.So, we've bridged A) How reality works with B) How your brain works with C) How computers work. This is why AI actually works. Simplest possible explanation: It's because the information that people understand is now in the same form that a computer can understand. So, we have information to simulate the model and we can safely assume that it will follow the laws nature and energy, giving us a range of outcomes that doesn't rely on statistics (the science of observing the outcomes of interactions) and we can replace that representation with a somewhat accurate simulation of the interactions themselves, and those interactions are far more predictable than people realize. Given a long enough amount of time, human populations will always follow the path of least resistance, from the perspective of energy itself.Note: I need to work on this explanation, as I read it, I realize it could be a lot better.

The Democratic Party seems to go out of their way to go for moderate republicans and conservative swing voters and most of the time I hear pro-Democtats defend taking conservative positions to win over those voters.But for non-voters or dis-affected progressives, there is a lot of condescension from the Democratic Party surrogates and repeated by regular people on social media. I think for the Democratic Party establishment it makes sense from a cynical electoral view. There are almost as many eligible non-voters as there are voters for either party. Non-voters are on average younger, poorer, and support many progressive things. Trump has appealed to the non-voters who are white peoples paranoid uncle who doesnt vote because he thinks the secret world government people flying around in black helicopters will know his address if he does. Democrats had their own key to non-voters with Sanders but um, well he was less popular with big donors and the political establishment.So thats the thing. It makes sense from the position of wanting to win the election but not alienate the political and economic establishment. If you go for a tiny number of fairly conservative suburbanites in a few states, you dont need to offer any progress or reforms or promise of anything really besides not being so bad. But if youre poor or part of a marginalized group urban or rural, that just sounds like they dont care that things are already kind of bad. So why vote, why care? If Democrats said the rents too damn high and had a viable plan (even if not immediate but really worked for it) theyd get enthusiastic support from millions of non-voters. But they would also upset Wall Street which is the collectively the largest landlord in the US since the Great Recession. So instead they can promise nothing that will threaten Wall Street or the Pentagon while telling progressives to moderate and compromise (with a party the Democrats also say are a threat to Democracy?)This is not new for the Democratic Party. After Bush won re-election a lot of Democrats were blaming lgbtq demands for gay marriage. They still blame Nader for Bushs first win despite more registered Democrats voting for Bush in Florida than voting for Nader not to mention the DNC not contesting and the Supreme Court actually deciding or that in the quarter century since Democrats still defend the electoral college and do nothing against gerrymandering etc even when they had the power to reform undemocratic electoral features that have caused the vote loser to be President in 2/5th of the Presidential elections this century.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Theyre helping build the narrative that trump is winning so that when he loses they can whip people up.\\"All the betting sites had us winning\\"","title":"Betting odds swing toward Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.

Swing voters align themselves more closely with a candidate than a party. Undecided voters do not know what they are going to do less than 3 weeks from today.

It makes sense to me, at least, since his policies often don't make any sense (see his tariff comments). Even the policies that are cited are morally charged (see abortion). If you make the argument that voting against someone for moral grounds rather than policy tradeoff is the vehicle you choose for your argument, it stands to reason that someone faced with the moral question disagreeing or failing to agree with your conclusion must have some morality that does not align with yours. This is the train of thought that leads to most of the hostility I see. Poking fun or belittling people who are in moral opposition to you is not new or unique. Taking offense to it makes about as much sense as trying to get everyone in Gaza to sit in a circle and sing Kumbya... then getting upset it didn't work out. You have better things to do with your energy.Thay said, real undecided voters are among the least educated and most uninformed groups in all political categories. Jokes about it are as old as this country. The likelihood of an undecided voter subscribing to politically charged subs is very low. Hell, even engaged, decided voters are muting subs right now. Given the attitude that ignorance of Trump's actions are the only excuse for being undecided, any avenue where a meme like that would be posted would land on folks who DO know.Next, if someone is planning on voting for Trump but sees a meme offending them for that opinion, they are very unlikely to use that energy to help Trump more. Making people feel wrong or ashamed is a proven tactic to reduce voter turnout, and the feeling that you are too stupid for your vote to be correct is a very strong indicator for abstaining altogether. You may think it's wrong, but it does work, and your premise focuses on winning. Personally, I wish we would use all this energy against the truly worst voter bloc in the US... 3rd party voters.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"What makes it even worse is that it looks like the expert was reading lips... off of a video recording.That adds another layer of bullshit to this story.","title":"Biden tells Obama shes not as strong as me  and ex-prez agrees thats true at Ethel Kennedy service"},{"text":"I actually am, as part of this [Washington Post series](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2024/michael-lewis-chris-marks-the-canary-who-is-government/) (which will be published as a book ((called Who Is Government?)) next March) The character is a woman at the FDA who has taken it upon herself to help people find experimental cures for rare infectious diseases.

It's similar to the (also fictional) \\"Bernie to Trump pipeline\\" in 2016 that was also largely online conservative fanfic that the Clinton campaign latched on to in attempt to find anyone to blame but themselves for why Hillary lost.The reality is that if Gaza is a deal breaking issue for someone, they're not considering voting for Trump, they're deciding whether to vote in the presidential race at all (and/or voting third party). That might not seem like a meaningful difference given our electoral system, but the presidential race is not the only one, and those \\"undecided voters\\" are almost certainly voting straight blue down ballot. That's why there's been zero effort from conservatives to try and actually court the \\"undecided Gaza voters\\"; their efforts have mostly been trying to ram the wedge in further and make them feel even more disenfranchised so they don't vote at all. The Republican strategy is to try and alienate them from the Democratic party completely, and the Democrats don't really do themselves any favors by calling anyone who has problem with Harris' Gaza policy uninformed morons who clearly just want Trump to win.

It shouldn't be, but it is.  \\nFor some reason, a large share of the population is not going to vote. They should vote, but they are not going to do that.  \\nAnd for some reason, we all are bombarded by \\"undecided voters think X' statements that we love to consume because the election seems to be just so damn close. And because we're soo eager to consume it, the media becomes even more incentivized to present such a statement or a group of \\"undecided voters\\" that comment of the political news of the day and how that influences their vote.How I read the OP that you referenced (and why I find it funny) is not a mocking of \\"undecided voters\\" per se, but a mocking of the media that builds these panels, often (imo) with a flimsy background check, making it plausible a 1/6 insurrectionist could get in as an 'undecided voter' just because they say so.While I agree that compassion towards our fellow humans is generally good policy and probably also good strategy,  \\nour focus on ridicule on the media for their very, very different standards for the two candidates is ALSO good strategy. On top of that, if (and I assume that is true) more Trump voters are ashamed of their vote than Harris voters, the \\"undecided\\" group is just naturally more right-leaning than it \\"should\\" be; falsely steering the country away from discussion issues important to you and me.And, consider my second statement of facts, the election is as much of a turnout game as it is a \\"swing the swing voters\\" kind of game. While I agree that \\"Trump is worse at this\\" on its own isn't a useful argument, why is this election so close then? Trump regularly mocks all kinds of people he would traditionally need to win the election. And still, he's neck-in-neck. Turn out the vote could be a reason why. Telling a liberal to get off the couch and also ignore the Stein-woman and vote for Harris can be almost as effective as telling an undecided voter to vote for her: While the math would indicate that you need two liberals to counter one swing voter, if enough so called swing voters are really dead set on voting for Trump (but shy about it), your real effects might actually be better by investing time to win against \\"Candidate couch\\".And, to be fully blunt with you, my energy to be kind and compassionate towards people who still don't know what to think about Trump, who \\"hasn't stopped whining about himself since he rode down that golden escalator over 10 years ago\\" (Obama, 2024) is just very low. I try if I can, but it is dragging me down. It's good to sometimes get to laugh and have some fun, even if it's not the most strategic thing. It can give me the energy to be strategic again when it's most valuable - when I get to interact with real humans I have a personal connection to: They have the highest likelyhood of being responsive to my inputs, much, much more than people that walk around on reddit.","title":"CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters"},{"text":"Watching her on Fox News def made me respect her more.
