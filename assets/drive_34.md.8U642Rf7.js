It's true that the Trump administration didn't really result in major on-the-ground changes to status quo. But also the situation was also radically different during the Trump administration and a second Trump term will coincide with the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, an emboldened and ascendent settler movement in the West Bank and (possibly) a war with Lebanon. It seems reasonable to believe there would be a massive lobbying effort on Trump personally by his inner circle to sign off on things like e.g. new settlements in Gaza, population transfers into Egypt and annexations of parts of the West Bank. I think chalking up a Trump and Harris administration as the same on this issue is placing a lot of faith in *Donald Trump* to resist this pressure when there will be a huge political incentive for him to just accede to whatever they ask of him.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"Great deflection.

Whether it's the current system, or a by-district system, or a national system, the people on the losing side won't feel like they've gained anything if they don't get their candidate in office.The misunderstanding with the Electoral system is twofold.1. That it's not a popular vote. It absolutely is, just not a national popular vote. It is a weighted aggregate of 50 different popular votes. It's not as \\"pure\\" as a national popular since it's possible to lose the national popular but win the election, but when Dems have won every national popular vote since 1972, it also balances things a little bit to let other guys (well one other guy) try their hand and maybe get some representation at the presidential level now and again and feel less like they have no say.2. There seems to be this feeling that only the Presidential election really matters. It's the one that drives shitloads of media coverage, and it's the only one people constantly bring up. Midterms consistently post much lower turnout, yet those Representatives and Senators are just as key to legislation and forming the nation as the President. In fact, the president's desk is the *last* stop for all bills, and it is possible to veto-proof legislation which takes the President completely out of the equation. Spending bills *must* originate in the House.

And we get to refresh our entire House every 2 years, and if we get someone who is rock solid at their job then we can keep them around since there's no term limits. We also get to refresh 1/3rd our Senate every 2 years as well, and again if we land someone rock solid for the job can continue keeping them there.Make no bones about it, the Presidency is a very powerful position but people tend to treat it like the throne of an absolute monarchy or something and put massive amounts of emphasis on it while ignoring the fact that they're just one cog in the machine. Because of that, the current system is fine in this sense, weighting the results of all these individual popular votes. At the end of the day it's we as a district and we as a state who decides what even ends up on the President's desk to begin with, and it is completely possible to pass legislation through both chambers with such support that it becomes immune to veto. For example during the Presidency of Andrew Johnson, when southern states were trying to put their old leaders back in power and trying to deprive freedmen of as many civil liberties as possible, Johnson tried vetoing attempts by Congress to enact legislation to get the South in line, which were then overridden.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"For the sake of this argument, youd have to provide data to compare the two.

While Ms. Harris skipped Mr. Netanyahus speech to Congress in July, she met with him privately while he was in Washington.Mr. Trump strongly supported Mr. Netanyahus government and as president gave it a number of political gifts, including backing hard-line Israeli policies that previous U.S. administrations had rejected.How they feel about the war in GazaMs. Harris supports a cease-fire in which Hamas would release all hostages who were seized in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza. She first called for a cease-fire in early March, and has been somewhat more vocal than President Biden about the humanitarian crisis that Israels bombardment and invasion have caused in Gaza.Mr. Trump has expressed his continued support of the countrys invasion and bombardment of Gaza. He has also urged Israel to finish up the war because it is losing support. While he was initially critical of Mr. Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence, calling them unprepared for the Oct. 7 attack, Mr. Trump quickly backtracked from those remarks and said he stood with the Israeli leader, with whom he was closely allied as president.Along with all this, Trump is using Palestinian as a slur.

He's a conman and, whatever you might say about his competence in *other* areas, that's something he's very good at. This is important to consider when reading Trump's speeches - most things he says aren't true and you can't always get the message he's giving based on the words he says. Now, with that, Trump blatantly contradicts himself in this speech, saying he both does and doesn't think the Nazis were fine people. As such, we're left with two options here. 1. Trump wanted to condemn his racist voter base, slipped up and corrected himself. 2. Trump tried to signal his support for his racist voter base while giving enough of a gloss to cover his ass in the media. Given what we know of Trump's desire for power, willingness to condemn racism and eagerness to admit when he made a mistake, which seems more likely?Personally, based on what I know of trump, I am 100% sure it's the latter. He knows who his voting base is and knows how to fire them up. He also knows that just saying \\"the Nazis are good, vote Trump\\" will go down badly, so he also talks about how he doesn't mean the *Nazis*, he meant the other unspecified people in the crowd who were totally there. But he's not fooling anyone. He was saying he supported the neo-nazis. The fascists knew it - they thanked him for the speech - and the people who are the fascist's victim's got the message - they saw the speech as a threat . The people who the message was for got the message, and anyone else can't prove it.It's standard plausible deniability, a classic wink to the camera and \\"of course I don't mean *that\\"*. But like I said, it's not fooling anyone. It's very clear from the speech that he meant \\"the Nazis are very fine people\\". You can't prove it, intentionally, but the alternative is that *Trump* suddenly decided to risk his election chances by honestly admitting when he made a mistake and unequivocally condemning racists. And that seems *very* unlikely.","title":"CMV: Trump did NOT say Nazis were \\"very fine people\\" in Charlottesville"},{"text":"Man, you are being purposefully ignorant and using the same kinds of false equivalency tactics that Trump used.

If a man is wearing women's clothes in public it doesn't hurt anyone. If a man is reading a book to children, again, it doesn't hurt those children.Laws against drag queens, either on the books or planned, limit the behavior of people in ways that aren't federally limited (there are no national laws that address men wearing women's clothing or doing so while reading books to children) - those laws are being enacted at local levels because it offends some people. The belief that is being violated by the drag queens actually doesn't hurt anybody any more than me, for instance, wearing shorts and sandals in the winter does - the belief is being harmed, not the person holding the belief, not matter how much they dislike. Much the same could be said for abortion law. If a woman has an abortion it hurts literally no extant human being. It only bothers people for social reasons that are mostly based around religious belief, a _belief_ held by some people that is then used to create a _law_ that affects everybody.If we define harm as a deleterious physical effect to a person or their property, then many laws regulate behavior that is harmless, and the law is based around the belief of an inherently unharmed group.","title":"CMV: the State's rights argument has no place in modern America"},{"text":"She said she wouldnt support an arms embargo, the two things are different, and one is not realistic because of the connection between the US and Israeli military industrial complexes.","title":"CMV: As a Palestinian-American single issue voter, not voting or voting third party is the best way to achieve my political goals."},{"text":"Son, you're posting online, which is not IRL.

Another was political rivals, whom he sought to tar with allegations of the same kind of wrongdoing, like collusion with foreign countries, that he was under investigation for.He also wanted government power deployed against news organizations that produced coverage he did not like, as well as against people from his personal and business life he felt had betrayed him.His most intense focus was on F.B.I. officials who were involved in the Russia investigation. They included Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe and Mr. Strzok, all of whom would come under the scrutiny of the Justice Department and, in the case of Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe, who were subjects of unusual and invasive I.R.S. audits. (A later investigation by the tax agencys inspector general found no evidence that the audits could be traced back to political pressure.)Mr. Trump also pushed aggressively for an investigation based on his belief that the entire Russia investigation stemmed from a conspiracy against him by intelligence or law enforcement agencies. Mr. Barr named a special counsel, John H. Durham, to undertake that inquiry.

Not signing up for the Selective Service System in the United States can lead to several significant consequences, even though there hasn't been an actual draft since the Vietnam War:  \\n1. Legal Penalties: According to federal law, failure to register for Selective Service is punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. However, actual prosecutions for failure to register are relatively rare.\\n2. Loss of Federal Benefits:\\n   * Financial Aid: Men who fail to register are ineligible for federal student loans, grants, and work-study programs.\\n   * Federal Jobs: Registration with Selective Service is required for most federal jobs, which includes not just government positions but also jobs with companies that have federal contracts.\\n   * Job Training: Access to job training under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is restricted.\\n   * U.S. Citizenship: If a male immigrant does not register, they could face delays in their U.S. citizenship application process. For those who were required to register before turning 26, not having registered can lead to citizenship being denied unless they can prove their failure to register was not knowing or willful.\\n3. State Benefits: Similarly, in some states, failure to register can affect eligibility for state-funded student financial aid and other state benefits or employment.\\n4. Consequences for Not Registering After Age 26: If you're over 26 and didn't register, you can't register anymore. This means you're permanently barred from these benefits unless you can prove that your failure to register was not knowing and willful.\\n5. Public Sentiment and Perception: While not a legal consequence, there's a societal aspect where failing to register might be viewed negatively by some, especially in contexts where national service or duty is highly valued.\\n6. No Impact on Private Employment: However, not registering does not affect eligibility for private sector jobs unless those jobs require government security clearances.","title":"CMV: The voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16."},{"text":"One candidate wants to help us ALL.One candidate wants to shit on us ALL to help himself.Pretty obvious choice if youre not a fucking scumbag.","title":"Kamala Harris Is the Clear Choice for President - One candidate has spent her career as a dedicated public servant, who believes government exists to serve the people, the other has divided the nation for his own personal gain"},{"text":" order to provide someone the right to vote they have to be a legal adultWhy?

Obviously there's biological things like puberty and various neurochemicals, but also most 4th graders have not demonstrated an interest in or understanding of the larger world, while many teenagers have. Additionally, taxes aren't the only issue- 16-year-olds are also old enough to drive and get emancipated (if their home situation warrants it )and are at an age where they're looking at their transition to adulthood, I deciding if and where they want to start looking at colleges, thinking more about their possible career paths, etc.?\\nThe taxation is One large issue in favor of the voting, but it's hardly the only one.

Just wanted to address your points from my perspective because I think it may be helpful. To be clear, my arguments are going to boil down to this: Trump's knowledge of the crowd composition wasn't the important point, the important point was what the crowd composition actually was and what the general consensus regarding that crowd composition was.Also, a disclaimer. While I'll try to be respectful and even handed, recognize this is an event I still have a lot of strong feelings about, especially guilt and anger. I'm only human. I'll try my best.Okay, here we go. Let's start with these two points:But people who support the statue ARE supremecists by default because of what it represents - That is false. I've known people....But people marching with Nazis ARE Nazis because they didn't leave - I don't know what the crowd compositions were...So the people you go on to describe in the first section (folks that see the battle flag as a symbol of rebellion and southern pride, separate from the white supremacist overtones historically associated with the flag) simply weren't the majority. I won't say absolutely nobody like that showed up, but I would certainly be surprised if they stayed had they not aligned with the supremacist ideologies of the other groups. Nothing about the UTR rally was subtle on the ground. There were the chants you've heard about (which I'd prefer not to repeat, but some explicitly Nazi slogans, some as simple as \\"white lives matter\\"). There were swastikas abound. There were literally people in matching polo shirts carrying shields marching and chanting, separating sections of the crowd before tear gassing us.Additionally, that's not who the event was advertised to in the first place. You can see early advertisements [at this link](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Poster-and-image-circulated-on-social-media-and-social-networking-sites-advertising_fig5_348238565). The speakers advertised were either alt-right influencers known to push or mainstream racist narratives or outright white supremacists like Richard Spencer or Chris Cantwell. I've definitely seen a few posters advertising David Duke (who I can confirm was there).From an article in Vox, [which you may wish to read](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/26/18517980/trump-unite-the-right-racism-defense-charlottesville) as it documents this all in better detail than I am, we have the following regarding the intended purpose of the rally which pretty well encapsulates the thrust of the advertising:\\"The attendees of Unite the Right were crystal clear as to what the event was supposed to be  not a show of support for history, but a pro-white activist event. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin?described?the upcoming Unite the Right rally as in a post on the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer on August 8, 2017: 'Although the rally was initially planned in support of the Lee Monument, which the Jew Mayor and his N Deputy have marked for destruction, it has become something much bigger than that. It is now an historic rally, which will serve as a rallying point and battle cry for the rising Alt-Right movement.' \\"Second, no group's representing those people you're describing were in attendance. [This page from the SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/08/15/people-groups-and-symbols-charlottesville) lays out the groups that were there pretty well. From my perspective, the flags being waved were a mix of swastikas, battle flags, a couple Trump flags (not the majority, but they were certainly there), and an array of specific group's flags like the National Socialist Movement (who used to literally [show up in Nazi uniforms](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna14534144)).To be fair, some members of militia groups showed up in support of the protestors, but these were not organized by the groups at large. I know for a fact there were Three-Percenters there at the start standing between us and the NSM shields. I talked to one guy as I was being pushed (who argued he was there to protect free speech). To their credit, those people seemed to disappear when the neo-Nazis pulled out the tear gas and pepper spray.So, from my perspective (and hopefully I've convinced you here, at least somewhat), the makeup of the crowd was by and large white supremacists that were not there to defend a statue, but instead there to demonstrate white power. That was what was reported and, regardless of his beliefs on the subject, he.was praising a group that was almost exclusively white supremacists (and again I find it hard to believe ANYONE who was not was still there when the fighting started).I want to close with this comment of yours:[...] I won't say Kamala is lying [...] Maybe she knows context I don't...I'd argue the context here is maybe that you're assuming the rally was tame enough that someone without explicitly white supremacist views would have stuck around. That's certainly what people quibbling over Trump's wording would have you believe. Having been there, I can't see how a reasonable person, albeit one with political views different from mine, would show up and choose to stay. The crowd was explicitly white supremacist and grew more vocal and violent over the course of the hour we were fighting at the park's edge.That's all I got. I hope I didn't come off judgemental or angry. Hope I explained well. It's a hot topic for me. I tried to limit editorializing. Open to comments and questions, but overall, I hope some of this context helps.","title":"CMV: Trump did NOT say Nazis were \\"very fine people\\" in Charlottesville"},{"text":"Im not sure I follow your line of logic.

I am arguing that a single, monolithic federal government is infeasible when accounting for the vast demographic and geographic differences of a country like the US if you also must protect the other rights guaranteed to Americans.The only way to allow actual non-conformity is individualism- allowing more flexibility at an individual level, not a state level. So national legislation protecting individual rights should be prioritised above state legislation attacking those rights, even though that means less states rights.You can parse this by scoping in or out however you like - my argument is that, as you have said, non-comformity (or in this case, protections/allowances for the widest variety of people/values/class/creed/etc.) is best achieved at an individual level.  Moving individual rights to a national would absolutely lose the resolution provided by having state-, county-, and municipal-level governments.  This of course assumes that OP's position is that there are no governments smaller than federal (as any subdivision of the country would functionally still be a state).  The gas station attendant laws are a good example of this - in New Jersey, to protect gas attendant jobs, it is illegal to pump your own gas.  This measure was implemented as an alleged safety protocol to prevent spillage and fires, though it's also commonly cited as a protection of labor against being replaced by monolithic self-serve entities.  In either case, it's unlikely that a state like Kansas would 1) have as many gas-station-related fires or 2) have as many gas station attendants.  Not only would the need for such legislation be reduced, but there would be far fewer parties fighting to protect the jobs of those workers simply because there were fewer of them. This last part is an example that shows how we can actually retain more representation by ensuring that our government has lower echelons that affect our daily lives.","title":"CMV: the State's rights argument has no place in modern America"},{"text":"Don't hold your breath.","title":"Republicans ask for more civility in politics.

If the proposal is to allow 16 year olds the ability to vote they would need to be subject to military conscription, just like everyone else. Obviously we havent had to do this in almost a 100 years but its not off the table. I think if we were in a situation where this was a very really concern people would much rather not vote and stay a child for another two years.

There werent. There were white supremacists throwing a rally and the people against them. The theoretical third side being the people who were there only to protest statues were in fact there in support of white supremacy. How so?A) The statues themselves are symbols of people who fought a war to maintain a system of white supremacy. They were white supremacists. Supporting them is supporting white supremacy.B) The statues are not relics of the past. They were mostly erected decades after the Civil War as a response to the move for Civil Rights, another move to maintain the institutions of white supremacy. So even if you buy they are into southern history and pride, these statues are not historical and were never intended for that purpose.2\\\\ You say:\\nBut people who support the statues ARE supremacists  That is false. Ive known people my whole life who only see the confederate flag and symbols as meaning southern prideA) And Southern Pride as referenced today, does not date back to farming, or the original colonialist, or literally ANYTHING, other than referencing a specific historical time, dating back to the Civil War, which was essentially fought over white supremacy. This is specifically why they wave a flag that represents that war rather than a flag with a gator, or collard greens, a liberty bell, or some other thing that would represent the south. When you confront these people, theyll even say it. Im celebrating states rights (to own slaves). B) It doesnt really matter _why_ you support something when its clear what that something represents. Would you give a guy flying a Nazi flag a pass if he told you it wasnt about white supremacy but was instead about German pride? Even if they were being genuine? I dont think you would.  3\\\\ You say:But people marching with Nazis \\nARE Nazis because  I dont know what the crowd compositions were  pretty sure Trump didnt either  If someone told him there were non-NazisA) Youve moved from being objective, to what ifs, aimed at making your point. What if there were non white supremacists at the white supremacy rally and Trump was talking to them? This seems like a stretch. What were they doing there? Even if they were there, why would Trump take the time to address this marginal unconfirmed crowd as the people he wanted to champion as fine people?This would be like going to CPAC to address Democrats. It wouldnt make sense.3\\\\ Even if Trump was trying to distinguish between the people yelling blood and soil, from the people _only_ there to support white supremacist statues, he was doing this in the wake of a white supremacist running down a protester against white supremacy. There were only two side to that debate, yet he picked this straw man of a third that also served as an attempt to legitimize the broader rally that was Organized by, and aimed at white supremacy. 4\\\\ Your entire line of reasoning assumes Trump is being truthful. Setting aside politics- Trump is an objectively untruthful person. In fact, I think this is the ONLY argument you have going for you here. It may very well be the case that Trump was not supporting white supremacy but instead was trying to pander to both sides by effectively saying both sides were right and wrong. This is not the case youre making but is likely closer to ground truth. That said, Trump has made multiple comments in the past and since that indicates he in fact does support white supremacy. So Id still say he was saying the white supremacists had fine people on their side.","title":"CMV: Trump did NOT say Nazis were \\"very fine people\\" in Charlottesville"},{"text":"Let her cook","title":"Padma Lakshmi: Why Kamala Harriss Love of Cooking Could Help Make Her a Great President"},{"text":"Yeah those comments are really cause and point defeating.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., former FBI director James Comey, and other named defendants. The original petition alleged a conspiracy in which the parties worked toward a nefarious scheme to discredit, delegitimize and defame the then-first time candidate Trump.What a blast from the past, not just the lawsuit coming back but the list of names. Now, in the waning days of his third bid for public office, the underlying lawsuit is long-since dead and gone C dismissed as frivolous and hyperbole by a district court in Florida in September 2022 C but remains on appellate life support in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\\"Brutal\\" - Nathan Explosion, lead vocalist of Dethklok, upon reading that line.In a terse order, Trump-appointed U.S. Circuit Judge Kevin C. Newsom gave Trump an opportunity to stretch the process a bit further C and to opine about the issues at stake in the appeal at length.Appellants unopposed motion to exceed the word limitation in their consolidated reply brief and to enlarge the time to file that brief is GRANTED, the judges order reads. The consolidated reply brief, which may not exceed 10,000 words, is due by September 27, 2024.That's on Friday, and in the Jan 6th Case Jack Smith has to file his immunity brief (why Trump can be charged and is not immune despite the SCOTUS ruling) on Thursday the 26th. So as everyone is marvelling over how Jack Smith nails Trump to the wall with one hand behind his back, Trump will be whaling on Hillary Clinton stealing the 2016 election from him, again. In late August, Trump asked Clintons counsel for consent in order to obtain the since-granted extension C citing pressing hearings occurring in other cases. The original deadline was Aug. 30. The original word limit, under court rules, was 6,500 words.**At first, Clinton and others opposed the motion.**Emphasis mine.No good cause is set forth for this third extension, the appellees wrote in opposition to the 45th presidents request. You assert that your request is occasioned by pressing hearings occurring in other cases, but you do not specify what proceedings might be occurring in the month of August to justify further delay or state why your entire team is unable to complete a reply brief.Days later, Trumps attorneys responded C listing several different cases in various jurisdictions throughout the country that the various parties and attorneys were involved in.\\"This clown's got appointments at other kids birthdays.\\" said Trumps attorney. \\"Oh yeah, name them?\\" said Clintons attorney, and Trumps attorney proceeded to name all the other locations they go to get laughed at.The interests of justice and judicial economy will be served by permitting this extension of time in the context of the multiple consolidated appeals, Trumps attorneys wrote. Appellants counsel conferred with Appellees counsel regarding the relief sought in this motion and all Appellees oppose this extension request.But apparently the detailed plea for more time C and more words to make their case; though this was not really at issue C was convincing.Later that same day, Clinton acquiesced to the request she previously pilloried as yet again delayed after several such delays.On the basis of the representations Appellants make in their present motion, Appellee Clinton does not oppose the present extension request, the former first ladys attorneys wrote.The lawsuit is still built on a foundation of shit, I don't think Clinton or her counsel are worried about giving him more rope. In February, Trump brought his case to the 11th Circuit C arguing that he was never given the opportunity to properly cure any defects in his original lawsuit when it was dismissed.The former president also argued that he should be allowed to essentially ignore the statute of limitations C making a bid for various forms of tolling based on equitable considerations due to his time in the White House and a particular statute. Tolling is the process by which a time clock for filing a given document is paused for one reason or another.Trump wants to call timeout on his term in the White House so he can sue Clinton... for stealing the election that got him into the White House? I need to smoke more or less weed to have this make sense.In June, Clintons attorneys lambasted those arguments C saying that Trump was trying to rewrite an imported provision of inapplicable law and then misapply the invented law,Trump was previously ordered to pay nearly $1 million in sanctions for the lawsuit against Clinton.Donald Trump #1 donor to the Clinton Foundation.","title":"Donald Trump gets key date pushed back in Hillary Clinton RICO appeal despite complaints about further delay"},{"text":"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/kamala-harris-president-rolling-stone-endorsement-1235096166/) reduced by 85%.

To reframe what you just said, why cant an underprivileged black family in the inner city just move 5head? Why is gentrification bad?!? The answer, of course, is that a given place has the resources, community, and history for a place and people. You seem to be speaking from a very privileged place of being able to move to find work/follow your career/go to a good school, but its simply not feasible for a large swathe of the population. Theres a reason, for example, that traveling nurses and locums doctors get paid such obscene amounts of money just to be placed to an underserved location/system to provide healthcare. Its not a matter of equalizing regulation. Staying in this healthcare example, California has WAY more strict doctor licensing boards than West Virginia, because WV will take any healthcare they can get, while CA has doctors in abundance (despite having not nearly enough residency slots; a topic for another thread). If WV made their licensing laws the same as in Cali, the state govt wouldnt have enough money no matter what to attract doctors there, and people would just fucking die if they got sick.

So a town or county should regulate a pond, a state a lake, and the federal government a large interstate river. Read the federal papers to see how the USA constitution is built around this idea of federalism.Check out the Nobel prize winning economist Eleanor Olstrom. Her work on the so-called tragedy of the commons effectively shows how public goods are best regulated at the most local possible level.As a public school teacher, I can personally attest to the truth that the further a politician is from the local reality of the classroom, the worse the policy.Finally, Ill add that maybe the whole USA can be understood as a vast experiment in whether or not different states can cooperate. If we can honor smaller states and work together to collaborate in a mutually beneficial way, maybe the whole world can do it.

If someone told him there were non-nazi people there, then he probably believed it and repeated it. At best, he carelessly praised nazis without meaning to which is still bad, but not a clear cut example of praising white supremecists.Generously assuming that this was incompetence rather than malice, that still means he called Nazis (or at least white supremacists) \\"very fine people\\". It also means that sentence needs an asterisk after it to say it's not as bad as it looks at first. But that doesn't make the sentence itself untrue.But whilst Trump has shown a lot of willingness to make claims without knowing the facts, he has also shown a lot of willingness to stoke animosity and lend credibility to the far right, so I think the statement being incompetence and the statement being malice are both plausible scenarios.","title":"CMV: Trump did NOT say Nazis were \\"very fine people\\" in Charlottesville"},{"text":"Well if the big stuff's so important, why jeopardize it with the small stuff?

I don't want someone from Nebraska deciding what my life in New York should be like.  The critical element that \\"states rights\\" preserve is the ability for us to self-govern - and it allows for progress to be made as different states set new precedents.  California, for instance, led the way for marijuana.  In another example, the California Air Resources Board became a standard reference point for other states, and is critical in helping those states determine possible EV legislation (among other things).Why are parts of this country permitted to have laws different than other parts for inherently political reasons? Why, for instance, should the laws around state parks be different in Kentucky from Nevada??HOAs do a great example of showing where uniformity of regulation does not necessarily lead to \\"right\\" or \\"appropriate\\" outcomes.  Why should a community be able to stop a member from placing a flamingo on their lawn?  Similarly, with a vast population, how can you ensure that a law that is fair in one geographic or demographic region has the same intended effects as those in another?  Where does the line begin and end - at the county level? the town level?  And what is the process for changing these nationally-applied laws?  What if a nationally applied law fails to cover the nuance of a local situation - what systems are in place to allow amendments or repeals to rapidly address changing situations?  The federal government, by virtue of the various stakeholders, cannot act as quickly on more local issues as a more local government.  All that I have ever seen \\"states rights\\" be used for is to fire up specific parts of the conservative base in the US. I have never seen any state choose to make their laws different than those of their neighbors specifically to make that state a nicer place to be compared to those neighbors.This isn't really a reason against \\"states rights.\\"  If it were, anything that could fire up any part of any base would likewise be suspect.  Finally, though, the critical component is avoiding the enforcement of a singular idea as presented by a monarchy.  How would this single, normalized national government avoid performing functionally as a monarchy?  How would votes be counted?  What are the organs of government that will execute these, and what controls are in place in the event an extremist position occupies power?","title":"CMV: the State's rights argument has no place in modern America"},{"text":"In lots of Louisiana it's illegal to bury dead people, because flooding.

I went to school at CU Boulder and I had the worst roommates of my life at that time. Ive had 32 roommates in my life. I never understood why there was so much hate, but when reflecting on it I realize that they were actual liberals and we fundamentally disagreed on basic principles - and that they were bigots. One day we got in an argument and my roommate locked me out of the house. I had nowhere to go, tried to contact the landlord while the roommate was looking at me inside the locked house through the window. This was insane! I ended up climbing through my room window. Then they started playing a song that went something like fk you, fk you, fk you on repeat on a speaker pointing near my door. I didnt have phone service at the time (they knew that) and they disconnected the internet and I was unable to contact anyone. It was evil. I eventually called the cops so they could be there while I removed my things and got the hell out. This ordeal took place for like 10 hours and all 3 of my roommates were in on it. That was a short description of what took place there but I honestly have PTSD thinking about it and have tried to forget a lot of it so bare with my scattered recollection. I just thought they were shitty people. Luck of the draw. Nothing more. Later I worked as a marketing coordinator for a conglomerate of LGBT night clubs/restaurants in California and I was open about voting for Trump to my co workers. It didnt seem weird to me to simply vote for someonethis is America, right?! I remember making Hillary Clinton buttons that pin on shirts in my office for 2016 debate viewing parties we would throw. I made some Trump buttons too but 90% were for Hillary. So what? Thats what they want - I had no issue with it. This is America.right?! We also got cardboard cut outs of Hillary and Trump. Someone at the bar asked for a sharpie. I thought nothing of it and they drew a hitler mustache on Trumps cutout. Anyways, fast forward to when Trump won in November 16. I foolishly posted on facebook heres to prosperity in America and went to sleep. A switch fkn flipped. Woke up to over 150 comments of people I interacted with every day, co workers and friends unanimously calling me horrible things, saying theyll spit in my food, calling me a traitor and saying Im just another straight white racist cis gender misogynistic homophobe that doesnt deserve to breath the same airtypical liberal hate. My girlfriend also left me and literally moved to Hawaii. So that was it for me, I finally realized that a lot of liberals are bigots. I realized that the victims of hate are often the ones that proliferate it the most. I realized that with liberals, they will stab you in the back because its always a means to an end. A democrat will shatter a window at night to get passive revenge on a neighbor. Cheating and breaking the law is okay as long as their end goal is perceived as virtuous. In reality, they all have constantly changing etch-a-sketch progressive values and have no framework for morals. This results in a very dangerous mindset - where evil actions become justified for the greater good. Even if liberals got what they wanted, by definition, progressives - are constantly changing and they will never ever be pleased or ever back off. They constantly move the goal posts even if they get what they claim to want.Not all liberals are bad. Most are just misguided by the MSM. I have a very close bleeding heart liberal friend, we tolerate each other. He doesnt stab me in the back. We make jabs and argue with logic and facts, still dont agree, and simply change the topic. He watches CNN every day and sincerely believes the lies that the democrat platform spews. But thats okay. We bet lunch on the result of the election. I will take him to Costco to get him a $1.50 hotdog and drink if Kamala wins and well both have a good laugh.Anyways, not all republicans are good either. Ive seen republicans lie, cheat, steal, rob me. There are bad eggs everywhere. Voting republican or democrat is an indicator of how you perceive life, whether you perceive the objectivity of good and evil. Most of my republican friends believe in a higher power of some sort. Most liberals are atheists. Republican, liberal, right, left. Its not even politics. Its about whether or not an individual has a moral compass that is backed by traditional judaeo-christian principles, the foundation for our successful Western Civilization. Liberals have a moral compass that doesnt point north or anywhere reliably.So to answer OPs question: Imagine a river. You are standing in it, the current is getting rough. Everything around you is washing away. What do you do? Stand your ground! Stand. Your. Ground. Improve your footing on things you know to be the truth. Be aware of your moral compass and be consistent with every decision you make in public and private life. Be honest and transparent with everyone. Eventually, the waters will calm and you will have an even stronger foundation to build your life and perception upon. All the unimportant things, that seem important now, will have washed away. Order always follows chaos. Even after all the muck I went through, I have some liberal friends who fkn hate how I vote and everything I stand for. But, they come to me and say I think you have shit politics but at least youre consistent, and I appreciate that. Were good friends now. Their values change so quick that eventually the needle will go around and the liberals worth keeping around will at least respect you and see you as a reliable person compared to their peers.","title":"A newly converted republican"},{"text":"Because the Arkansas ranch hand might have a fundamentally different view on how society should work and its not your place to tell that person if hes right or wrong.

A city has more people more taxs and more tax burdens the \\"government\\" of New York City would be over bloated and unnecessary in some wyoming city of a few hundred. Why should the hunting laws be the same in a city that hasn't seen a mountain lion out in the wild for over a century be the same laws of a state where hogs are literally destroying millions of dollars of land and agriculture. Why should the water laws and rights be the same in Michigan as in Arizona. Why should Vegas lose gambling if the majority of the Union doesn't want it in their particular state. Why should California not allow abortions even if all 49 other states decided they didn't agree with it. The American Experiment really was an experiment and it's the oldest standing Democratic Republic pretty successful I say. The civil war was over slaves no doubt,  but states rights was a secondary issue on the level of or we a collection of states first or a union or you a New Yorker first or an American first. We decide the Union is more important but we didn't repeal the 10th amendment. The facts are States are an effective way of governing and allow flexibility. A practical example the Texas power grid a step too far they felt the federal code was to strict for a place that doesn't often get cold. While they went to far in cheapening Texans payed less for power in part for years because they didn't follow a over stringent federal code which required the power system meet conditions it (almost never) does. If the governor wasn't too busy demonizing wind and solar which was the only thing left holding up the grid and just tried to fix the problem it might have blown over quicker. People died, things could have been better but one could at least argue with a better response no body could have died and Texas could have gone back to selling cheaper power ignoring federal code for another 100 years without issues and saving their customer/ tax payer money.","title":"CMV: the State's rights argument has no place in modern America"},{"text":"According to thr Bible, a fetus is not a human being until it takes its first breath and it's soul enters its body.So...no, it's not a morality issue - at least according to the book that drives your morality.The idea of life at conception is as old as the happy meal.

First, the Electoral College is not the reason the winner takes all.   The College requires that each state sends their delegates to vote for the president and vice president separately.  The College does not require delegates to vote for the candidates that the state's electorate voted for.When the constitution was ratified and the College was created, unlike today, it was understood that the interests of the states and the interests of the people were equal in the republic.  Therefore, the College was made up of both the representatives of the people and the representatives of the states.  It was not uncommon for the delegates to be split until we decided state interests in the federal government were no longer important and gave state representation to the people by effectively expanding The House of Representatives to include the Senate.  Over time, it became less and less common for states to have split Electoral College votes after the 17th amendment was ratified. Today, the only power states have left to advance their interests in our republic is the authority to determine how they vote and the best way to make the federal government cater to their constituency is to have a winner takes all system that forces the two parties to compete for the state as a whole rather than just Democrats or Republicans in the state.  When you acknowledge that states are separate political entities within the Federative system, it makes sense.However, even before the 17th amendment, the party convention and primary rules were headed in this direction.  Before Andrew Jackson, there were no party conventions or even primaries. By 1836, the Whigs, after being beaten over and over again, adopted the party convention and primary system the Democrats had been using to consolidate votes and run local and national candidates.  After this, we see fewer candidates locally and nationally, and the single ticket for president and vice president becomes the norm.  Keep in mind that none of this is in the constitution.  All of our convention, primary and debate rules are imposed by the parties. I disagree that it would increase voter turnout voter participation with very few exceptions historically sitting around 50-60% with an all-time high turnout being around 70-80% from 1840-1900. It may be that the winner takes all system lead to this, but that is far from certain, and even in the post WWII era, when patriotic American idealism was high, the voter turnout was similar to today.\\nhttps://www.electproject.org/national-1789-presentIn conclusion, I argue that the two most powerful political parties hold on power in our system, and when you acknowledge that states are separate political entities within the Federative system, it makes sense why the states chose a winner takes all system.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"I dont know if they make grocery bags big enough to go over her head or liquor strong enough to entice a normal dude to tackle that obnoxious hag","title":"Sarah Huckabee Sanders strategic cruelty toward Kamala Harris is very bad for Trump"},{"text":"You also agree 59.6% of teamsters are turds as well?","title":"Democrats privately worry the Teamsters non-endorsement is a warning sign"},{"text":"I think shes a B candidate.

This is my perspective as a left of center gun owner: There is nothing wrong with civilians having access to semiautomatic rifles of any make or design.?\\nWe, as citizens of this country, have four ways of getting recourse from our government and elected officials. Discriminatory laws that strip LGBTQ+ folks of their rights, or unaccountable violence against that community by the police or non-state actors are two examples of what we should be defending against. We can use the soap box to make our views heard in public and private, and lobby our government to change their ways. If that fails, we can use the ballot box to vote in new elected officials who better reflect our views and the needs of the community. If that election is not allowed to take place, or the results are overturned (cough cough Jan 6th cough), or the results of the election do not satisfy, then we can use the jury box to take our grievance to the courts. If the courts in this nation, which for the most part in comparison to other nations are pretty good, fail to recognize the human and civil rights that should be endowed to us all, or they fail to hold the people who would harm that community accountable for their crimes, then we move on to the last box, cartridge. Ultimately, violence is the last resort that we have as a people against a government that fails to be held accountable to our voices, our votes, and the courts. It's an ugly place for our society to go, but that failsafe exists out of necessity. Think of Stonewall, think of the BLM protests, think of Malcom X.\\nIn addition, if you believe, as many people rightfully do, that Trump represents a swing to authoritarian government that will target minorities, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ folks, then why on earth would you not want to be prepared to protect yourself against state sponsored or state-ignored violence? You can't call someone like Trump, or Abbot, or Desantis the next Hitler without tickling the ingrained part of the brain of the folks who have sat alongside elders that had numbers involuntarily tattooed on their arms. If you believe that actual Nazis have infiltrated our law enforcement, and that white supremacists are trying to legitimize violence and discrimination against your community, then why on earth would you keep yourself at a disadvantage?\\nI get that peaceful protest is more appealing and pleasant, but it rarely works in a vacuum without some other form of violent protest or the threat thereof. I think they are relying on the Gandhi Trap, which no longer works in American society like it once did.

State legislatures selected electors, and those electors went to DC where the electoral college voted for President as a completely independent body, with the delegates free to vote however they wanted and to change their votes if they so chose. It wasnt for several cycles that states shifted to holding open elections to select delegates, and then gradually states shifted to the winner take all system to make their states more important. If you read through The Federalist Papers, the founders vision for how Presidential Elections would be held is nothing like how we do it today. I would go further than just saying it shouldnt be winner take all. It should go back to a system where we actually vote for electors, who arent pledged to a candidate, but who are free to vote for who they feel is the best person for office.","title":"CMV: The electoral college should not be winner take all"},{"text":"You mean like RFKjr?

Additionally, the electors in the electoral college can actually vote for either candidate, although each state has different rules for what the electors have pledged to do.If you look at the map of the US in the 2020 election, there were 224 congressional districts won by [Biden](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/11/14/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-2020) and 211 for Trump. In the same year, Biden won the popular vote 81 million to 74 million. For the congressional districts, Biden won 51.5% of districts. For the popular vote, Biden won 51.3% of the vote. By any metric, he won. By any change you propose, he won. In 2016, Trump won 230 congressional districts and Clinton won 205. In 2016, Clinton won the popular vote by some 3 million votes. But, even with the split you propose, Clinton would get 256 votes and Trump would get 250, which doesn't make either win.

It was Haley who was pulling in corporate money.  Side by side, Trump was pulling in nearly nothing, not corporate money, not public money.  Most of his campaign money was cash transfers.  Republicans ignored that, and just kicked Haley out right when she was also gaining public traction to overtake Trump.  Can't have any confusion among the ranks.  She 100% was the stronger candidate.  She wasn't bringing a lot to the table, but she wasn't Trump.  And for most, that was enough to happily vote Republican.  She was enough.  She could also debate well enough on party agenda, unlike Trump who just rambles off his own things and serves no value to the party.  Worse, the Republican party let's it happen, which is nuts.  It's not just a complete lack of party branding and party agenda.  It's also a lack of funds (less than half normal), and this hurts every congressional run too, likely over the next two cycles.  And it's a lack of brand identify.  They don't even try to bring fourth a comparable.  There is no dominant figure in all of the Republican party.  It doesn't help the party self mutilates by attacking any non conformers, any outliers.  All that remains are extremists and infamy.  It's ask inedibly unstable. Worse yet, it's repeatedly proven to promote incompetency and ignorance.  It's developing a moronic party, a crew of imbeciles.  It's an insane road to follow, and the risk of complete collapse of the entire party is real.And the ONLY protection a party like the has is the immense cash and media ownership willing to portray an unrealistic narrative of a party that doesn't really exist anymore.

This is a dramatic shift, considering Harris was once polling so low that, at times, she flirted with being the least popular vice president in recent history.\\"She has been allowed to shine a bit, which I think is very difficult to do when you're the No. 2. By definition, a large part of your job is to stand a few feet to the left and a few feet behind the president and be supportive,\\" Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics told Business Insider. \\"As opposed to now being the person who is front and center and is allowed to talk about who she is, what she wants to accomplish, and she is allowed to talk about her strengths and what she brings to the table.\\"Tim Malloy, a polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll, said that favorability is a massive umbrella encompassing a wide range of emotions voters have for candidates. Likability also has a fraught history when it comes to female candidates, as best encapsulated by Barack Obama's infamous 2008 jab that his Democratic senate colleague Hillary Clinton was \\"likable enough.\\"Harris' reversal of fortunes is a warning sign for former President Donald Trump's campaign. Despite his and his allies' best efforts, voters have yet to buy into their branding of Harris as a progressive chameleon who can't be trusted. Even top Republicans, including former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, have recoiled at Trump's attacks, including questioning her intelligence.Harris has shaken up an election that once seemed poised to feature two of the least popular major presidential candidates since 1980, as FiveThirtyEight documented earlier this spring. Her rise is all the more remarkable given the hyperpartisanship that has overshadowed US politics to the point that some even wondered if there would ever be a return of popular presidential hopefuls.As Gabe Fleisher wrote in his newsletter, Wake Up To Politics, the explanation for the shift could be very simple. Research shows Americans don't form strong opinions of vice presidents. Now, reexamined on her terms, Harris has, to borrow one of her lines, \\"unburdened by what has been.\\"But Trump could still win this election.Harris' campaign still views itself as an underdog. Famed forecaster Nate Silver's model has returned to essentially a coin flip, though on Friday, it showed Harris with the first edge in weeks in the race to win the electoral college. The former president has been here before. Despite the reality that the most favorable candidate usually wins, he emerged victorious over Hillary Clinton in 2016 (who was also unpopular, though not nearly as disliked as he was).This isn't 2016, though. Walsh said Clinton's failure was a flash point for women in American politics, a trend she thinks will benefit Harris. More women are now running for office and getting involved in politics than ever before. There's now a larger percentage of women in Congress than at any other point in American history, according to the Pew Research Center.Unlike Clinton, Walsh pointed out Harris hasn't spent decades in the spotlight and isn't faced with assuaging voters' fears of a potential political dynasty. Clinton's favorability, in fact, took almost the complete opposite journey from Harris'. Clinton was viewed more favorably as President Obama's Secretary of State. Still, that goodwill dissipated as she geared up to become the first woman to be a major party's presidential nominee and was made into a \\"caricature of who she was,\\" in Walsh's view.\\"I don't know if you remember, but you could buy in airports the 'Hillary Clinton' nutcracker,\\" said Walsh, whose center is based at Rutgers University. \\"It played out, a lot of it gender-based, but compounded by all of these other factors that went into her candidacy and the public's reaction to that.\\"This isn't Trump's only struggleOne of Trump's allies, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, is pressing on with a struggling gubernatorial campaign in a state that Democrats have only carried once this century (2008) but is now too close to call amid Harris' rise. Robinson is trying to press through the latest scandal that he called himself a \\"Black Nazi\\" on a pornography forum decades ago. (Robinson has denied those are his words, despite CNN obtaining voluminous evidence to the contrary.)Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, remains deeply unpopular. And by almost every account, Trump lost the first and perhaps only debate to Harris. Democrats are even cutting into Trump's advantage on the economy, the campaign's biggest issue.The best news he received all week is that Republicans in Nebraska may try one final time to change the state's laws to deprive Harris of a likely Electoral College vote, potentially eroding her Great Lakes states/\\"Blue Wall\\" strategy.Trump has also enjoyed a bit of a resurgence himself. Over the past year, he's risen roughly 6 points in FiveThirtyEight's favorability average. But a majority of Americans still view him unfavorably, which has been true since he descended the escalator in Trump Tower over nine years ago.More troubling for Trump, Malloy pointed to Quinnipiac's recent findings that Harris is ahead in Pennsylvania and Michigan with a third key battleground, Wisconsin, up for grabs. He said the combined results should be warning signs for the former president's campaign. Harris' favorability was up slightly in both Pennsylvania and Michigan.\\"That is the canary in the coal mine for the Trump folks, that is the red flag for the Trump folks because it means people are getting to know her as a person,\\" Malloy said.","title":"America sort of likes Kamala Harris C and that might just be enough"},{"text":"It appears the quote google gave me was about the NPU (neural processing unit):The NPU of the A18, with 35 TOPS, is approximately 58.33 times more powerful than the NPU of the Apple A11 (600 billion operations per second versus 35 trillion operations per second), which was the first Apple chip with a Neural Engine.

To its credit, it's not as bad as the original book. With other movies I could mention like 300 or Pearl Harbor (the 2001 film) they're not nearly as actively, repulsively harmful as TBitSP. I don't use the term harmful lightly; I'm convinced that it actively is a form of atrocity anti-education. It's far from the only film to distort a real atrocity for the sake of accessible and nonthreatening drama but this is the worst example I know.It's not a case of artistic license; I'm comfortable calling it artistic malpractice. Basic facts about the characters and plot rely on a Third Reich and Holocaust so sanitized on every dimension that it's unrecognizable. If you want a historical fiction on the Holocaust that's appropriate for general audiences, a book like *Number the Stars* by Lois Lowry is so much better in every conceivable way even though the characters/plot focus more on resistance to Nazi oppression rather than the killing itself.

This was due to the support for incumbent President Donald Trump, who had started fundraising much earlier in his term.\\n   - The RNC, combined with Donald Trumps campaign, raised around $1.96 billion by the end of the 2020 election cycle.\\n   - A large portion of the RNCs funds came from wealthy donors and large fundraising events.Overall, while the RNC raised slightly more in total, the DNC made significant gains later in the cycle, particularly due to grassroots fundraising and anti-incumbency sentiment. The combination of candidate-specific funds and national party fundraising efforts made both organizations extremely competitive in terms of financial resources during the 2020 election.","title":"Harris' fundraising triples Trump's in August, growing Democrat's warchest, FEC filings show | Harris and the DNC raised $257 million, as Trump and the RNC raised $85 million."},{"text":" Milei is good only insofar as he is the least rotten apple in the Argentinian political basket.

Closed-list systems are absolutely democratic - they just operate differently from candidate-focused systems like first-past-the-post. In a closed-list system, voters elect parties based on their platforms and policies, not on individual personalities. This leads to a more representative and proportional outcome because the number of seats a party gets directly reflects the percentage of votes they receive.If anything, closed-list systems can be more democratic because they prevent the domination of individual personalities and force parties to actually stand for a coherent set of policies. They also ensure minority voices are heard, as smaller parties have a better chance of gaining representation, unlike in winner-takes-all systems where millions of votes can be wasted on losing candidates.The idea that closed-list systems are \\"not democratic\\" seems to confuse democracy with individualism.

This is finally changing, and for good reason: Having more judges, including openly LGBTQ judges, who come from all of our communities helps to build more trust in the judiciary and brings vitally important perspectives into our justice system.\\" &amp;quot;The selection of openly LGBTQ judges also sends a powerful signal to young LGBTQ lawyers, law students, and other potential future judges that they belong on the federal bench and in positions of power,&amp;quot; Zwarensteyn continued.\\n**\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1fm0tan/joe_biden_makes_history_by_confirming_12th_lgbtq/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \\"Version 2.02, ~694148 tl;drs so far.\\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \\"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Judge**^#1 **LGBTQ**^#2 **Costello**^#3 **Biden**^#4 **District**^#5","title":"Joe Biden makes history by confirming 12th LGBTQ+ judge, the most of any presidency"},{"text":"Banning nazi dog whistles is echo clambering now?","title":"Republicans of Reddit, what are your thoughts on your side resorting to manipulated pictures showing Kamala Harris with Diddy, when there's dozens of real pics of him with Trump?"},{"text":"MAGA will see it as winning.","title":"Republicans of Reddit, what are your thoughts on your side resorting to manipulated pictures showing Kamala Harris with Diddy, when there's dozens of real pics of him with Trump?"},{"text":"Wow.

But the two campaigns would not say whether their candidates, if elected, would direct the EPA to stop arguing that it is immune from civil liability and make a financial settlement with Flint residents. The EPA is charged with ensuring compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and a paper trail shows its officials knew about dangerously inadequate treatment of water from the Flint River months before residents were notified.The horse race reports tell us that the problem for Kamala is that she needs the voters in Detroit and Dearborn much more than Trump does.So the bipartisan support for genocide and hatred of the poor is more damaging to her and Democrats who didnt use to stand for such things.Unsurprisingly, many Michigan residents?are lookingat supporting Green antiwar candidate Jill Stein or simply not voting.For example, the Uncommitted Movement, which began in Michigan put out an?odd statement?on September 19 in which it refuses to endorse Kamala, opposes Trump, and does not recommend a third-party vote.Despite not just doing nothing to earn their votes but indeed actively courting their hatred by supporting genocide, the Democrats will no doubt aim (some already are) the blame cannons at Muslims in Michigan should Trump win the state and the presidency.

That alone makes the attack discriminate, even if they had no information about where the pagers were or if they couldn't account for all of them. Even if they knew that half of the pagers were handed off to civilians, it would still not be indiscriminate. Rather, they would have to determine the proportionality of the attack. A 1:1 ratio of civilians to fighters would very likely still be considered proportional.But that's not even what happened. Virtually every single one of these devices belonged to a Hezbollah operative.The indiscriminate version of this attack would be to intercept a shipment of iPhones and installing the bombs not knowing who would own them, and hoping that some Hezbollah fighters would die by random chance alone.

Human nature just wouldn't allow for that. I mean, we have disgusting, lowest common denominator reality TV shows based around this. It's hard to get ten people to get along in the \\"Real World\\" TV show let alone all the Jews/Masons/Catholics/CIA/MI6. I think that there are good and bad people in every institution. In every walk of life. That includes the powerful people that run our world. I do honestly believe that Trump is an outsider within this elite circle. I do believe that just because people are rich, doesn't mean they are automatically evil. That would be just as silly as thinking that being poor automatically makes you good. I think Trump genuinely cares about the American people. I think that him being wealthy is a positive, because that means he cannot be bought. I do not think he is on the same side as this \\"deep state\\" of endless, bureaucratic alphabet agencies that act as parasites on the American people. The most damning evidence for this is the first assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. I don't care how well trained a shooter could be. I don't care how much power, influence, and money there is.

For example, let's take a hypothetical dataset consisting of 3, 5, and 10. To get the mean/average, you add up those up and divide by the number of values in the dataset, in this case three. The mean/average is 6.The median, on the other hand, is defined as the middle most number in the dataset when the values are ordered from smallest to largest. In this case, the median would be 5. One of the main reasons people use the median instead of the mean/average is that the latter can be skewed by outliers.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 20, 2024 - 46 days until election day!"},{"text":"Nah, they are two different things.Mean is adding up everything and dividing by the number of things you added up. Median is if you put every number on a number line and then took turns taking a number off from each end of it, and then the only number you are left with in the middle is the median (if you are left with two numbers, then you take a mean of those remaining numbers, but *only* if you are left with two numbers).The important difference between the two is that mean is affected by extreme numbers on either end, while median is not. This is important for things like income, where, for example, if you had a bunch of billionaires living in Wyoming, it'd make the mean income of Wyoming way higher than the median.Average usually refers to mean, but people often informally use it to refer to any measure of central tendency (mean, median, or rarely mode).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: September 20, 2024 - 46 days until election day!"},{"text":"She wasn't home though.

It's almost a non-sequitur: whether or not Israel's conduct is justified is it's *own entire question*. International law is international law and war crimes are war crimes.I can understand why Tlaib would not immediately concede to the framing of that question, precisely because it should not matter whether she supports Hamas *when it comes* to criticizing Israel's unethical conduct (which given the history of her statements on the subject it should be fairly obvious she doesn't support terrorists).It's like when the Onion published the article \\"Dying Palestinians Criticized for Not Using Last Words to Condemn Hamas\\". Their condemnation is not necessary for their criticism of Israel's conduct to be valid. In fact, it's pretty silly to ask in response to any criticism, \\"well do you support their enemy?\\" It's incredibly binary thinking. It is entirely possible for two sides of a conflict to both be guilty of horrendous crimes. We can argue scale, but in either case, one doesn't need to \\"support\\" the enemy to levy criticism.Like, we just saw Senator John Kennedy ceaselessly question an Arab-American spokesperson about whether she supports Hamas or Hezbollah, when she was there to talk about hate crimes. Despite her clear statements that she doesn't, it didn't matter; Kennedy's questions were never intended to actually ascertain whether she supported them. All Kennedy knew was that she was an Arab-American and had made some criticism of Israel, thus, she must be allied with the enemy. It's dangerous thinking that absolves any of our allies of genuine moral failures.","title":"Rashida Tlaib condemns cartoonist for racist image of her with exploding pager"},{"text":"We have both oligarchs and Presidents.

In the early 2000s, court documents released through litigation over controversial drugs - such as Vioxx and the hormone replacement therapy Prempro - showed pharmaceutical companies frequently hiring medical communication agencies to ghostwrite articles and place them in influential medical journals under the \\"authorship\\" of well-known academics paid thousands of pounds for their endorsement. Rather than relying solely on clinical data, we should take in consideration the history of the companies themselves and whether or not they have a history of unethical behaviorDid you know in 2009 Pfizer pleaded guilty to misbranding a drug with intent to defraud or mislead, bribing doctors and suppressing adverse trial results. Pfizer was required to pay a settlement of $2.3 Billion to the Department of Justice, the 2nd largest healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the Department of Justice. Pfizer has paid over $10 billion in settlements for offenses like unapproved promotion of medical products, equipment safety and environmental violation, false claims and foreign corrupt practices. Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA Commissioner and is currently a board member for Pfizer. In the past 40 years, 9 of the 10 FDA Commissioners have worked for pharmaceutical companies after leaving the FDA. Reuters is the company responsible for the fact checking on Twitter and Facebook. Jim Smith is the Chairman of Reuters Foundation and also a board member for Pfizer. The only FDA approved treatment for covid was originally just Remdesiver.

Strengthening parties doesnt make representatives less accountable- it makes them _more_ accountable. Right now, representatives can say one thing during a campaign, get elected on personal appeal, and then completely abandon their platform. Thats not accountability, thats political theater. Under a proportional representation system, parties are directly tied to delivering on their entire platform, not just riding on the popularity of a few figureheads. Fail to deliver, and the entire party pays the price in the next electionnot just one person.You also ignore the fact that the current system already leaves voters with little actual control over policy outcomes. Vote-splitting gives you the illusion of choice, but fragmented candidates with no cohesive strategy lead to the same legislative gridlock and inefficiency everyones tired of. A stronger party system forces consistency, alignment, and actual delivery of results. Voters can hold the party as a whole responsible, not just individual personalities that change with every election cycle.The reality is that the current model gives you less control and accountability than you're claiming.","title":"An argument for the Single Vote"},{"text":"Why do you think we dont have an Air Force in Canada?

Before Biden dropped out, they used town hall straw polls to gauge membership opinion. After Harris got in, they used a traditional phone/online poll to figure it out, so the sample method is very different. Under a town hall format, the most informed members show up, including the members that are aware that Biden saved their pensions. Town halls also give informed Teamsters and opportunity to inform attendees on this issue.   In a phone poll, you're getting a sample of the whole membership, including a huge swath that either don't know or don't care about the differences between the candidates on labor issues. One can think of it in the same way that caucuses So, I don't think there's much evidence for a massive shift to Trump amongst Teamsters since Biden dropped out. That being said, this is an indictment of Teamster leadership, who should be working hard to communicate the material stakes of the election to their membership.

Well yeah, welcome to democracy.  As a member of a society, we have to share power, which entails a degree of individual compromise and conformity if one doesn't want to be a meaningless outlier.   Forcing me to chose just one party is forcing me to chose just one policy set. Splitting a ticket allows me to chose candidates based on my policy preferences rather than just going with whichever party happens to get closest with their set.Your concern assumes that splitting tickets gives you meaningful control over policy, but in reality, it fragments your influence. Voting for individual candidates who may align with some of your views doesn't ensure that they will be able to enact meaningful change when their party is either out of power or internally divided. The current system gives the illusion of choice, but in practice, it leads to gridlock and inconsistent governance, where your preferred policies get lost in the mix of competing individual interests.The Single Vote system actually gives you more agency in shaping policies by empowering you to vote for a party that must present a coherent platform and deliver on it. You arent \\"forced\\" to accept a single policy set forever - youre participating in a system where parties are incentivized to be more responsive to their electorate. And in a proportional representation system, smaller parties can and do emerge, so your vote could go toward a party that more closely aligns with your specific values. Often times new parties split from an existing one over key policy areas, enabling you to choose which successor party to support.  Rather than relying on individual candidates who may shift their positions post-election, you would be backing a platform accountable to you as part of a larger, representative system.As for your point about personalities driving politics, I agree they wont disappear entirely - but the system I propose shifts the focus from individuals to platforms. Personalities can still exist, but under a system where parties are responsible for delivering on their agenda, youre voting for collective action, not just a figurehead. This reduces the toxic personalism that dominates American politics today. In most functioning democracies with strong parties, voters are more concerned with policy outcomes and less with individual personalities because the party as a whole is accountable, not just one candidate. Its not about creating an \\"in-group\\"; its about ensuring that the platform, not just the person, drives governance.","title":"An argument for the Single Vote"},{"text":"Once described by Dave Barry as \\"the punction mark used by small business owners to signal that an \\"s\\" is forthcoming.\\"","title":"Hillary Clinton: It would be exhilarating to see Kamala Harris achieve the breakthrough I didnt"},{"text":"The brain worms are making their move?","title":"GOP candidate slammed for saying the + in LGBTQ+ means pedophilia.
