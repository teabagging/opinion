Even in this case, the issue with this can be simply explained through the difference between how autocracies and democracies function.In a democracy, there is no consistent character of government. With every election, the people in power change and with this, their values, priorities and everything like that may completely change. The only thing that permanently binds democracies are laws and contracts because, once those are through all of the checks and balances, they are usually pretty hard to overturn (not impossible, but hard, and a government will be criticised for it). Autocracies are the opposite. An autocrat can pretty easily break the law, as long as their image of strength, dependability and righteousness that they are projecting to their people remains untouched. Because of this, laws do not bind these states, but if the leader gives a promise, that tends to be a lot more binding. If an authoritarian leader as much as expresses an opinion on something, that tends to be a lot more impactful than it would be in a democratic country.The whole \\"broken promise\\" argument can be explained through this as a simple mismatch between a democratic and an autocratic negotiator. Among autocrats, expressing your stance, but then \\"retracting it\\" for formal reasons is a pretty common way to signal your intentions to someone else. Among the members of a democratic government, this sort of thing is largely meaningless and may just have been an empty phrase used to placate the other person. because of this, it makes sense how both sides would arrive at the conclusions they did come to. In this way, this failure of communication is not just a personal failure of the people saying this, but a failure of the logic of autocracy itself and one of the reasons why, historically, democracies and autocracies rarely get along for long.","title":"CMV:  The promise to Gorbachev has no value."},{"text":"\\"Trump would likely strike a balance between bringing in fresh perspectives and younger individuals, while also appointing experienced and expert individuals in areas that require a high level of technical expertise and deep understanding of the issues.  \\n  \\nThis approach would allow him to tap into the energy and new ideas of younger individuals, while also leveraging the expertise and experience of seasoned professionals in critical areas such as national security, foreign policy, and economic policy.  \\n  \\nBy taking a balanced approach, Trump could potentially create a strong and effective team that is well-equipped to tackle the complex challenges facing the country.  \\n  \\nAdditionally, there are many positions in the administration that require a high level of technical expertise, such as in areas like science, technology, and healthcare.

And I'll turn it around and \\"facts don't care about *your* feelings\\" with what I already have prepared for people like you: (don't bring a pool noodle to a gun fight)- The Mueller investigation did NOT exonerate Trump\\n- The phrase \\"no collusion* appears nowhere in the Mueller report\\n- Not only did the Mueller probe discover this, but also a Republican led senate panel found that Russia did, in fact, engage in \\"information warfare\\" and attempted to interfere in the 2016 election to the benefit of the Trump campaign and with the intention of damaging Clinton's\\n- Mueller says the Russians directly targeted our election systems. \\n- Russian intelligence conducted computer intrusion operations against entities, employees and volunteers working on the Clinton campaign.\\n- Russia used the Internet to fool American voters and hackers to attack Democratic computer networks.\\n- According to Mueller's report, the Russian campaign began in mid-2014. That's when the employees of what's known as the \\"Internet Research Agency\\" first came to the U.S. to gather the material that they would later use in their elaborate interference campaign.\\n- By the end of 2016, the Russians had set up fake social media accounts that reached millions of voters aimed at promoting Trump or dividing Americans.\\n- The Mueller report lays out how the Russian interference campaign ensnared real American political operatives, including the Trump campaign and its allies.\\n- For more than 100 pages, Robert Mueller lays out scores of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign or the Trump presidency.\\n- According to the report, Russian agents also posed as American citizens and tried to communicate with the Trump campaign to ask them for assistance. \\n- Despite the reports conclusion, Mueller writes that, \\"there were numerous links between the campaign and the Russians, that several people connected to the campaign lied to his team and tried to obstruct their investigation into their contacts with the Russians.\\"\\n- WikiLeaks contacted the Russians privately on Twitter, saying: \\"If you have anything Hillary-related, we want it in the next two days preferable.\\" And then, on July 22, three days before the Democratic National Convention began, WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 emails and other stolen documents. It was a clear attempt to embarrass Clinton and weaken her candidacy.\\n- In 2013, Donald Trump takes his Miss Universe Pageant to Moscow. The Mueller report points out, this is how the Trumps got to know Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire and ally of Vladimir Putin. He owned the event hall where the pageant was held.\\n- Things start moving pretty quickly. Within a few months, Donald Trump Jr. signs a preliminary agreement with Agalarov's company to build a big Trump Tower property in Moscow. Trump announces his run for presidency in 2015.\\n- Mueller points out that, three months later, a new effort to build the Trump Tower in Moscow begins, this time led by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, and developer Felix Sater.\\n- Meanwhile, Felix Sater tells Michael Cohen he's working with high-level Russian officials. He emails Cohen, saying, \\"Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this.\\"\\n- The Moscow Trump Tower project is just one source of Russian contacts. Mueller outlines about a dozen of them in total. They vary widely.\\n- Campaign aide Carter Page meets with Russians and gives a speech in Russia. \\n- Michael Flynn gives speeches in Russia and has numerous contacts with the Russian ambassador, including a discussion of softening sanctions.\\n- Foreign policy and national security adviser, Jeff Sessions, also meets with the Russian ambassador.    \\n- Campaign chairman Paul Manafort regularly shares internal polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.\\n- Fellow Trump aide George Papadopoulos repeatedly meets with a different man connected to Russian intelligence, who tells Papadopoulos the Russians have dirt on Hillary Clinton.\\n- Another contact point was the infamous New York Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. That morning, Donald Trump Jr. tells colleagues he has a lead on negative information about Hillary Clinton. Russians pitched the meeting to Trump Jr., claiming they had dirt on Clinton. Trump Jr. responds, \\"If it's what you say, I love it.\\"\\n- On Page 77, Mueller writes: \\"The acting attorney general appointed a special counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting the president to state that it was the end of his presidency.\\"\\n- The Washington Post revealed that the president is under investigation for obstruction of justice. According to Mueller, three days later, President Trump tells White House counsel Don McGahn to call acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to say Mueller has conflicts and can't serve anymore. The president says Mueller has to go. McGahn doesn't comply.\\n- Mueller outlines in the report that Trump was found to have obstructed justice at least ten times\\n- Mueller chose not to indict due to the DOJ and Bill Barr's insistence that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\\n- Another serious charge about the president is that he tried to block Mueller from investigating him or his campaign.\\n- On page 89, Mueller writes: \\"Substantial evidence indicates the attempts to remove the special counsel were linked to investigations of the president's conduct.\\"\\n- On Page 97, \\"Substantial evidence indicates that the president's effort to limit the special counsel's investigation was intended to prevent further scrutiny of the president's and his campaign's conduct.\\"\\n- the investigation led to the indictments of 34 individuals\\n- Trump's campaign staff presented themselves as \\"attractive counterintelligence vulnerabilities\\"\\n- The steel dossier had nothing to do with Mueller's findings. In fact, the first probe began prior to the steele dossier being released and the investigation began in response to Russian cyber attacks on the DNC (find her emails!), and intel describing a Russian plot to reach out to the Trump campaign and provide information on Clinton.\\n- Trump encouraged Russia on national TV to engage in cyber attacks against Democrats. \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\\"\\n- within five hours of candidate Trump saying those words, Russians largest foreign intelligence service targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time\\n- Both Rick Gates and Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI \\n- Roger Stone was charged with obstructing and lying to Congress about his contacts and the release of documents stolen by the Russians.","title":"Russia won the Cold War with Trump: Pro-Russia agenda certain with second term"},{"text":"The sane voices get banned.","title":"Trump sure hit a nerve with the Attorney General pick!"},{"text":"Uhh yes what exactly did you expect the CCP to be pushing.

Trump doesn't care or strategize about geopolitics at this stage, as he knows it will be his last term, and will only work to protect his personal financial interests and solve his legal troubles. But intentionally or not he is a Russian asset. He is nihilistic to Ukrainie, and cares nothing about protecting or spreading democracies or democratic values which is great for Putin and bad for any European people's who want to be free and independent from tyranny and oppression.

The only reason why he wasn't convicted was that the supreme court decided to declare that it is legal for the president to threaten to fire his AG for refusing to send a false statement to states claiming to have found election fraud when they have not.70. In late December 2020, the Defendant attempted to use the Justice Department to make knowingly false claims of election fraud to officials in the targeted states through a formal letter under the Acting Attorney General's signature, thus giving the Defendant's lies the backing of the federal government and attempting to improperly influence the targeted states to replace legitimate Biden electors with the Defendant's.Jeffery Clarke literally wrote up a letter attesting that the DOJ had found election fraud (which it had not) and sent it around to be signed his his collegues at Trump's request. When the AG found out he told Clarke to stop this since Clarke was a random environmental lawyer.In response trump said in a meeting with his AG:\\"People tell me \\\\[Co-Conspirator 4\\\\] is great. I should put him in.\\" (That is Clarke)When the Acting Attorney General told the Defendant that the Justice Department could not and would not change the outcome of the election, the Defendant responded, **\\"Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\\"**Then acting AG Rosen, in a stunning display of professionalism, told Donald Trump to go fuck himself. Specifically, the majority of DOJ staff announced they would resign en masse rather than lie to the states so that Trump could try to steal an election using lies from the DOJ.

Have we simply considered that Trump and his cronies secretly reflect the hidden and chained desires of millions of people? There are lots of examples in history where evil people ruled with the consent of their people and actions we see as horrifying (Death camps, mass murder etc) were not only tolerated, but carried out with glee by lots of the population. Even if they were not carried out with zest, but the toleration of such evil is more than enough to show that society is apathetic to such issues.We are an inherently violent, murderous and perverted species, as are most animals. The idea of being 'good' is a relatively recent phenomenon where we tell ourselves that the people we do not like or don't match the new standards are a minority, and we use law enforcement to ensure they remain a minority. (because harsh law enforcement is required when the vast majority of people are 'normal').Lots of people want what he is offering, and we need to stop pretending that people are inherently good or moral by todays standards.","title":"The White House after Matt Gaetz gets a cabinet position"},{"text":"Agreed.

Hitler was successful in becoming a dictator because he took advantage of the Reichstag Fire Decree due to the fire that destroyed the Reichstag capitol. It was supposedly caused by a \\"communist\\", but no one knows for sure who did it even to this day. When the Reichstag Decree was declared it made him dictator for a short period of time, it gave him the legal right to suspend civil liberties and arrest political opponents particularly \\"Communists\\" and \\"leftists\\". Now understand this was legal. It wasn't illegal. It was part of the Weimar Republic's Constitution. Then he wanted to pass the Enabling Act of 1933 which essentially made him a dictator for life. He needed a 2/3rds vote from Parlaiment. The courts didn't help him become a dictator perse it was more of the chaos in the country that existed at the time and the constant threats he made to politicians to get them to support him. Germany at the time was in horrible shape, they just lost a major war and have literally become indebted to their enemies. On top of that, Unemployment rate was at near 20% and inflation was sky high. Much different time. Now take note, there is nothing in the United States Constitution that gives any sitting president the legal right to go after political opponents. Literally nothing in law. The issue with Germany in the 1930s, is that there were loopholes in its legal document that allowed you to commit what we would consider unlawful acts, but to them it was lawful.   \\nNow granted he could attempt to declare martial law, but he needs a damn good reason to do it and even then, it doesn't make the president a dictator by any means nor give him the legal right to pursue a political opponent.","title":"CMV: Republicans don't have a serious plan to enact the reforms they want"},{"text":"Lmao I love watching Reddit libs melt down.

They needed someone they thought could actually give them a fighting chance against Trump in this election cycle.It's bizarre how Joe literally looks way happier and sounds coherent now. I think Joe tweeted that he's putting Kamala in himself as his replacement as a last 'F U' to his puppet masters because he knew that they did not want Kamala in and that she clearly wouldn't be able to win against Trump.Tell me, why would the 'powers that be' go through all this effort to try to defeat Trump from 3x assassination attempts, the impeachment, inditements and all the other BS... and then throw the election so deliberately by putting Kamala in as Biden's replacement? They were trying SO hard this whole time to get rid of Trump, it just doesn't make sense for them to do that.Biden's decision to throw Kamala in was definitely to mess up their plans, hence why hes so happy now, and why he 'accidentally' wore a Trump MAGA hat once.

They cannot govern except through force. There should not be any doubt left as to who is responsible for what will come. It's clear the public must experience it directly as they simply will lie to themselves otherwise, that that could never happen here.  Now, to your question. States still run elections.

Not always was it such a bad problem, and at times it has been even worse, like right before the Great Recession 17 years ago. The economy is doing well, but workers arent. Expensive healthcare is part of the reason. Wages not keeping up with cost of living is also a problem. For their part, health care coverage for their employees is so expensive that a lot of midsize companies and small businesses cant really afford to do both: provide both adequate healthcare and high wages, that is. Bigger companies could afford to pay more but most of their money ends up going to shareholders and executives. The only people doing really well in this booming economy are the upper income brackets, and the higher up they are the better things are going. That reflects several different problems. One is that most of the wealth of these people is tied up in stocks. But the bottom half of the population in terms of wealth doesnt own any stock, or very little. This means the economic gains in the stock market mean nothing to most of these people, and see none of that wealth themselves. Unfortunately, a large portion of those people mistakenly believed that Trump would somehow fix that for them, and make their lives better, not realizing hes probably the last guy who will help make these poor blue collar workers get rich.","title":"Biden leaves Trump a booming economy, with almost no unemployment and inflation under control"},{"text":"Honestly, it's probably time for a rewrite.

I'd expect it to be certainly in a sitting president's power to prevent permanent and significant damage to the institution.  This isn't a preserve democracy here.  This is prevent permanent and irreversible harm to the literal government.  It may not be terrorists strapped with bombs attacking the White House (and...now I'm on some list, lol).  But Trump is just as damaging. Frankly, I don't mind a new election.  I don't mind preventing Trump from becoming president.  Contain him, prosecute him, and run another election.  Biden still has to step down per the law.  So does Kamala.  There will be an interm president who will run the position while a new election is started.  There's systems in place to deal with this kind of stuff.There is no greater threat to America than Trump and the sheer enabling he brings with him.  Him alone, not much threat.  But he's so corrupt that he enables, hundreds, if not thousands of people to run amuck and wreck everything the institution stands for, not just locally but globally too.  It's literally nuts to allow this to follow through.Uphold democracy, do elections, vote in a candidate that isn't a career criminal with the intent to do great harm.The window is open right up until he's sworn in.  After that moment, we're fucked.  America is fucked.  There's no way to sugar coat this.Media was weaponized.  People bought into the propaganda.  People voted through sheer ignorance.  And now we have someone coming in who will kill this nation.  There's is nothing right or just to upholding process for the sake of process when it was fundamentally flawed and corrupt.  This needs to be fixed, and right now Biden is kind of the guy in power to do it.  He can end this sham, start a new election process and step down both him and Kamala per the law.  We can properly run primaries and the public can back the best candidates for their side, just the same, just without Trump.There is nothing normal with this presidency.  There is nothing more dire than letting it play out.  You just aren't upholding democracy when the process was compromised from the start.  There is no way to fix 10 years of media lore building with Trump.  There no way to fight propaganda in a 24/7 media environment.  You can't fix 2,000,000 hours of programming.  All you can do is bypass it and not give the choice it so vetted for 10 years.  You need to remove that option.  You need to eliminate the entire value of the propaganda machine.  THAT is the only way this works correctly.","title":"'It Could Be Very Hard to Do Our Job': Top Military Officers Brace for Trump's Potential Loyalty Review Boards"},{"text":"Begging what?

Remember that inflation is a rate, not a level. That is to say, it is recognized that the prices will continue to remain high as a result of the previous higher rates of inflation.Donald Trump is a known ally of Vladimir Putin. Did I say \\"ally\\"? What I meant was \\"lackey\\". He would indeed bring a swift end to the war in Ukraine. He would do that by withdrawing all assistance to Ukraine, allowing the Russian invasion to go to completion. After that, it is likely that we will not have war in Ukraine. The war will instead extend into the larger part of Europe, triggering Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, and bringing us into a war in the greater European theater.The problem is that Trump is aligned with Russia and Vladimir Putin in particular. And so he will not allow the United States to fulfill its treaty obligations. No matter the outcome, this will destroy any international confidence in the United States as a reliable nation. In Asia, the signal will be seen as the go-ahead for China to invade Taiwan. Trump will probably ignore our obligations there as well, making it necessary for Japan to expand its rather thin self-defense forces to make itself too problematic for China to consider for the near future. But North Korea will be emboldened to proceed with its plans to invade the south. This will give us three hot spots in Eurasia.The United States under Donald Trump may take a strictly isolationist stance. But the anger of our former allies will cause them to withdraw from us in terms of trade, diplomacy, and defense. This will dry up the supply of imported goods while closing markets for export, maybe driving us into a deep recession with runaway inflation. The economic hardship will certainly cause the so-called border problem to be solved, since there will be no incentive for people from other countries to come to live and work at America.If the free countries of the world prevail against Russia and China, not a foregone conclusion by any means, they will need to rebuild a new world order. The United States will be excluded from that post-war world. We will no longer possess the world's reserve currency as we do now, with serious consequences for our own economy and economic self-determination. We will also be an international pariah for a century or more.The price of peace, as it were. You are definitely correct.

He knows thatll be unpopular.  He has publicly stated that he doesnt support equal rights to marry (look it up for yourself).  But the plan is to strengthen the courts further with Christian nationalists, who will send it back to the states where itll create a hellscape for those of us it affects.  There will be bans in some states, whereas others itll be legal.  In my state, for example, theres a trigger ban, meaning we would then get the pleasure of needing to do additional legal paperwork to protect ourselves and would need to file federally as married, and state as separate.   Additionally, wed have the pleasure of opening this crap back up for debates and all the fun that goes with it.gross political ads, culture wars, ballot measures, etc.   its all ridiculous!

If he tried it again 6 minutes later the order would be ignored since he is no longer the Commander-in-Chief.
