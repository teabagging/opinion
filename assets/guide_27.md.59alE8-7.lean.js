We tried that, and it had a paradoxical effect. The majority of our citizens are low-information, low-participation voters with high levels of distrust and cynicism. Many people on both ends of the political spectrum feel that government is broken; radical change is needed to fix things. Most do not have the ability or patience to form a nuanced view of our system. The flood of biased content and hyperbolic rhetoric has only served to convince casual participants that both parties are equally bad; all representatives are corrupt; everyone is lying.As it turns out, this environment favors a candidate whose whole appeal is *Im the guy who pisses off the people you hate.* Why should it matter to voters that Trump lies if everyone lies? At least, they rationalize, hes a *genuine* liar.This last election made it clear that Trump wasnt a fluke. Back in 2016, I rationalized that he was the result of many unlikely factors coming together in a really unfortunate way. Back then it made some sense to resist every thing he did because his legitimacy could be credibly questioned. The Mueller Report was, after all, NOT a hoax or witch hunt.Now though, we cant have any doubt. A lot of Americans are so disillusioned and nihilistic about our country they think it cant get any worse. They are idiots, obviously. This country is doing exceedingly well by global standards. Our economy is the envy of the world. We have a lot to lose. I truly believe there isnt anything so wrong with our country that it cant be fixed with whats right. That said, we cant allow ourselves to be goaded into hysteria by every little provocation. We have to pick our battles wisely, and when appropriate, either stand back and let them fuck things up, or, take them at their word. Case in point: Democrats should embrace this stupid DOGE commission bullshit. We should take the opportunity to say Absolutely! We **agree** that government is wasteful and bloated! Here is our agenda for cutting expenses, lets talk.Let the American people see that a.) our proposals involve cutting actual bloat, and b.) the only way they can get anywhere near what Leon has suggested would be to cut popular programs that boomers fucking love, such as Medicare and Social Security. Yes, we should fight and resist each and every attempt to take away peoples freedoms, safety, and dignity. As for the rest, we need to regain our place as Fighters of the System by reminding voters the system which really needs a do-over is our economic class system. Republicans can re-brand themselves all they want, but they are still the party of the wealthy. Despite our many faults, Democrats are still unquestionably the party of campaign finance reform and the working class.","title":"I Refuse to Fear Trump"},{"text":"Hes enrage posting.Ignore him the same way youd ignore a child having a tantrum in the aisle of Walmart.","title":"Trump now claims Canada *wants* to be the 51st state..."},{"text":"Luftballon?

The last one was actively molesting the four girls from the first one and having sex with her in front of them.  The kid's dads finally got involved.  They took the kids, and it's taken some cajoling but they are getting the kids the counseling they need.  I know both of these men would love to just shoot that woman and much worse to that man.  What would that accomplish?  These two men would then be fighting the law and the kids would lose both of their parents.

If so, there's really not much.I agree with you.  Biden and Democratic leadership failed the american people by not doing everything they could to bring Trump to justice.  There were limits to what they could do though, and the legal system which has been corrupted as well (looking at you SCOTUS), aided Trump's evasion of accountability.  I blame Republican Judges and Justices for their ratfuckery far more than neoliberals who at least were speaking out against what happened before and during January 6th.Celebrating the political, extra-judicial, and corrupt persecution of neoliberals undermines democracy just the same.

Saying everyone does it doesnt make it OK.Again, I don't know what you're talking about, though. And you're right that it doesn't make it ok. I believe that you're probably right that he probably profits from taxpayer initiatives, but I don't know what they are. If you wanted to change my mind about his own corruption, this would be the one that could do it.is he any worse than the others it is this just a feeling you have? I certainly think it's better than profiting off Ukraine. The one I know about with Trump is the Saudi investment with kushner. That one is definitely bad but it's also just general elitism- kushner is a billionaire with Israeli connections and the Israelis installed mbs.5. I've heard this argument about child seperation. Yes, again it's really bad. At the same time what are you supposed to do with illegal immigrants?  Dems always prettlend that their tyranny is bureaucratic rather than malicious.6. Quid pro quo is how transactional relationships work. Can you use the powers of your office to expose the corruption of your political enemies - yes, absolutely. But I don't see any virtue in sending weapons to Ukraine and I'm in favor of not funding proxy wars so maybe I'm biased. I understand that you probably see this as him using foregn aid as leverage for his own personal gain, but I totally disagree.7. Your argument rests on the continued denial of natural conferred immunity, which was the heart of the fraud. Talk about undermining science... the great barrington declaration was epidemiologically, socially, and economically sound. It's basically what they did in Sweden, which was to focus protections on the vulnerable. Covid was dangerous to the old, obese, and infirm and the rest of us were going to get it anyway and the vast vast vast majority wouldn't need hospitalization. the US had one of the highest death rates in the world, but if you can't be honest about the FACT they lied about naturally immunity and then of course you don't have the self awareness  to realize you fucked up and lost this argument a long time ago. What a fraud and absolutely murderous failure. Trying to Blame Trump for those lies is so egregiously embarrassing.  Have some shame. Booster jabronis spreading the virus holier than though quoting CDC and Biden saying it stops transmission. Virtuous murderous frauds. I know you remember that Dems had a much higher miscalculation of the death rate because you were exposed to so much propaganda. The Dems shut down parks and downplayed the importance of vitamin. They arrested a guy for surfing. Double masked zombies goose-stepping on sidewalks each making their own insane faith based cultist justifications for whatever authoritarian nonsense they're spewing onp a given week.I'm sure the kids are doing real great after the two weeks lockdown that extended to three years. Fauci keeps lying like he didnt recommend it. You got covid. You spread covid. You pushed your vaccines on those of us who didn't need it and you lied about the risks. I'm not talking about you because I don't know you and you have no power, but you are spreading dangerous medical disinfo. And you learned nothing. That one I have no tolerance for and I remember when Dems realized big pharma was evil and had captured the regulatory ansd public health agencies (now they are being conditioned to believe it's just the health insurance companies). I remember when Dems valued bodily autonomy.9. No it's not a false equivalence - Obama negotiated a withdrawal with the Taliban directly. The talks formally started in June 2013 and the negotiations were done in Doha. Anyone who wasn't a clown knew that the Taliban would be handed the reigns and that the war was based on fraud like every other neocon/neoliberal war.First thought- if you're going to argue, don't use the same debunked lies that have been posted on reddit ad nauseum for 8 years.","title":"Trump voters discovering hes the same malicious idiot"},{"text":"But but but, MTG was going to expose all the other creeps in Congress if this got let out.","title":"House Ethics Committee quietly voted to release Matt Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"Oh my this will be good","title":"House Ethics Committee quietly voted to release Matt Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"Yeah after they had a chance to see it.

We have label and definition of words and party lines for a reason. I am not too sure why you think you can gloss over Social Democrats not being considered socialists. They themselves **do not consider themselves socialists**, nor do self-identified socialists consider them socialists. Yes, this is a meaningful difference. Yes it is absolutely fair to use this basis for understanding the differences.\\n2.) I think a party official specifying the preference for Warren and Buttigieg, while describing Sanders more akin to their countrys Left party is in fact notable. Especially when said party official is from a country that has helped bring fame to the Nordic Model, and has their social Democratic Party similarly acknowledged for the same reasons. Trying to obfuscate the differences by trying to suggest that people dont have a general understanding of how these terms are used colloquially is **IMMENSELY** disingenuous.That article you linked talks about his?supporters, not his own actual policy positions. So sure if Bernie is as left as you get you are going to have people who are further left among his supporters, it's their best option to get a leftist elected.And notably Buttigieg and Warren dont get the same support from the same groups. Almost like there?is a *distinct* difference between the candidates? Also, is it not ironic that just below you start going in a tirade about the No True Socialist while simultaneously arguing that sanders *isnt a leftist?*There is not a single word in that article about any of Sanders actual policy positions. It's a sort of guilt by association thing.The Social Democratic Party official was giving an opinion as a representative of the party. Were you expecting him to give and defend a PHD thesis of why he believes Sanders fits in best with their Left party and supported Warren and Buttgieg in his short interview? Isnt that a rather ridiculous proposal? Yes, I actually think a party representative of the Social Democrats from a country with one of the most well known Social Democratic parties in existence making a statement that Sanders doesnt seem like a Social Democrat is a fair way to judge sanders. Why even try and fight against this?\\nIn Europe, most countries have entirely mainstream centre-left parties, and the Overton window is substantially further to the left.*In Germany, the postal service is privatized. You have to be an affluent capitalist boot-licker to receive your mail. It isnt a right like the nationalized USPS*. Or something like that. Not sure what your basis is for Europe is substantially left, since that is clearly not true if you overlook Europe and their policies. Unless you are cherry-picking a few example, then no, you generally wont observe this difference. Even more so when we talk about various social and civil rights. Vast parts of Europe dont even have *jus soli*. And many American states have abortion laws more progressive than entire countries; the idea that America has some extremely further right overton window is just a trite leftists repeat ad nauseam.*And what exactly is the motivation to try and argue against literal social democratic party officials words that Sanders is a Social Democrat*? ?Why does he **need** to be a social democrat so badly that you feel compelled to write a multi-paragraph tirade about how the Social Democratic Party officials (the party that people try to compare sanders to) dont know what they are talking about? They dont consider him a social democrat. Sanders doesnt describe himself as a social democrat. Multiple people dont consider him a social democrat.

But I can't register for that party and still vote in the primaries.We all know that the Republican party is a criminal syndicate top to bottom, an oligarchy, and never should have been allowed to come to power. What we also know is that Democrats had 4 years to do something about it, and instead, Biden and Pelosi and Schumer and the other top neoliberal Democrats chose to serve billionaires and corporations instead of doing something to save American democracy. That's just a fact. You can Google \\"Democrats serving two masters\\" to learn more about this known and studied tactic among Democratic politicians. For possibly longer than a year, Donald Trump has been promising to imprison his political enemies, to be a dictator, and he has named the very people he wanted to imprison. Biden, Pelosi, and some of the other people he specifically named as his enemies had all this time to do something to prevent him to from taking power, to hold him accountable for his crimes, to do more for the American people to ensure a Democratic win. Instead, they continued to choose to please their corporate Masters, and do nothing for the voters. (This is where you come in, neoliberal nose in the air,  and say that Biden passed the Rural Fisheries Act that gave four people jobs and we all have to be way more grateful for all the work that Democrats did. And this is where Americans shout you down for this pandering bullshit, Because listing acts that did not make life measurably better for us, and still allowed GOP criminals to go free, is One of the many reasons why Democrats lost.) Top Democrats had 4 years to imprison the the very people who tried to have them murdered on January 6th, and they didn't. If your coworker tried to have you murdered, would you be sitting in committee with them a week later, laughing at their jokes, like top Democrats did? If so, there's really not much. You and I have to discuss because I can't have a conversation with people I don't respect.","title":"After investigating January 6, House GOP sides with Trump and goes after Liz Cheney"},{"text":"Just make him Hamberders with a mug of covfefe and he'll be happy.","title":"Ex-White House Chef Explains Why Trump Was 'Hardest' President To Cook For"},{"text":"He's gonna find a way to install vance as president but make it look like the people chose himAnd the conservatives who blasted democrats for not having a primary this year and giving their base a chance to vote will be perfectly fine with the republicans not giving them a chance to vote.","title":"Trump can't run again in 2028.

I don't deny at all that when it comes to the Chinese people themselves, the economic growth has been remarkable and positive (though, when it comes to economic strategy, massively subsidizing your own industries is bound to piss off the people you consequently force to deindustrialize, and it's not exactly surprising that there's now a backlash and the CCP cannot be held innocent).As far as both sides believing time is on their side making war less likely, I just think you're being ludicrously optimistic. The CCP has basically been broadcasting in every way other than directly stating it that they intend to make a move on Taiwan in the late 2020s. The war is coming.

My representative was a Democrat who just lost his election. Partially because of how he sucked up to Republicans like Matt Gaetz. Here's a tip. If you have a co-worker who rapes girls, and everyday you sit in committee with that coworker, and laugh at his jokes, and sip coffee with him, and look at pictures of little teenage nude girls on his phone, and chuckle, and leave his face unpunched, and uncoated in saliva, maybe people are going to start to think that you don't have a problem with raping little girls. Maybe people are going to start to look at you kind of weird. Maybe people are going to wonder why you tolerate that behavior, and they're going to want someone else in that seat instead of a child rape enabler. Because I can promise you this, if one of my co-workers raped a minor, and started bragging about it, and showing pictures of nude teenagers on their phone in meetings, hell would not have his ass. He wouldn't be coming into meetings everyday with that grin on his face, And walking out of that meeting with his face unpunched. Because me and my coworkers are decent people. But every single member of the House, including the House majority and minority leaders, and every single Democrat, had absolutely no problem walking the halls and sitting in chambers with this man. They didn't do a damn thing.","title":"House reverses course and plans to release Matt Gaetz ethics report"},{"text":"Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, if he wins  I believed that","title":"Democrats' playbook to beat Republicans in 2 years: work with them now"},{"text":"Made progress?

You're assuming the US is the only party to the trade war, but in fact, pretty much every Western developed nation is slowly getting dragged down the vortex. The EU simply cannot allow the Chinese car industry to displace one of their primary remaining industrial sectors, especially not with Germany at the helm. The subsidy-based Chinse economy requires its trading partners to deindustrialize, which is going to make the trade relationship increasingly toxic in places where the precarity of post-industrialism is a fraught political issue. This is already happening. A somewhat lesser-covered development is that **the U.S. is now Germany's biggest trading partner, NOT China**. There's a lot of reasons for this, but a big one is that the U.S. is one of the only real options in the supply chain for a wide variety of things if you are trying to avoid overdependence on China and Russia, especially when it comes to energy. That will result in deeper trading relationships between the US and its closest friends (unless Trump wrecks it all, more about that at the end).Moreover, you are ignoring the elephant in the room, which is Chinese foreign policy. The Chinese *are* going to seize Taiwan. The question is not if, but when, and how the West responds. If the United States and its partners decide to stand up for Taiwanese liberalism, as they should and as I suspect they probably will, the war will decimate the Chinese trading relationship with basically every developed market, and most likely turning the Indo-Pacific into a hot war zone will do a number on its trading relationships with everyone else too.Meanwhile, I notice further downthread that you support the deepening of trade among developed nations and China, but I think you are greatly mistaken. China is not operating under the classical assumptions of how free trade works. It is not a true market economy. It's an economy under a fiscal repression regime that artificially boosts exports and uses it's enormous control of both capital flows and corporate behavior to concentrate as many of the value added nodes as possible. Trade with China will absolutely benefit many nations in the short-term, but in the long-term the only proven path to becoming developed is the creation of domestic industry and manufacturing and the slow climb up the value chain. Instead, China will turn all of these into basically raw material export nodes or extremely labor-intensive, low-value manufacturing hubs, but the deeper its influence grows in both a market and in a political sense, the harder it will be for these countries to transition to manufacturing. (India is a bit of an exception here -- it's so large and its development path is so centered on integrating with Western post-industrial sectors that I think they will still grow very quickly but in a somewhat non-standard way).Now, let's put all this aside for a moment. That's the bear case for China and its trading partners. You are *absolutely* correct about one crucial thing, which is that **Trump's tariffs are a terrible idea** and American protectionism threatens our ability to take advantage of this conflict in any material way. We should not be isolating and creating an autarkic economy, we should be isolating *China specifically* until it rehabilitates its behavior and changes the policy regime to be more in line with the expectations of a liberal trade relationship, and we should be diverting that demand to new partners. For the record, I think we have actually been doing this to some extent under Biden, especially with our Mexican and European partners, though not as much as we should have. Under Trump, the risk is that he blows all those relationships up in favor of true autarky. I don't know if he really plans to do it. His business allies seem to think no, but everyone else thinks yes, and frankly Trump himself probably thinks something different every time he wakes up. The most crucial fulcrum point for the entire future history of the world is coming, and unfortunately we have put the worst man in charge at the exact time we need to deal with it.","title":"Chinas Slowdown Has Changed the Trade War: America Now Has the Upper Handbut Trumps Maximalist Tariffs Would Still Carry Risks"},{"text":"I scrolled by too fast and thought you said little sluthaha","title":"Trump sues Des Moines Register and top pollster over final Iowa survey"},{"text":"Its going to be a long four years","title":"Trump Sues The Des Moines Register, Escalating Threats Against the Media"},{"text":"If this keeps him occupied its a win.

But on Tuesday, he became the latest senior figure in corporate America to step into Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort to pay tribute to the Republican president-elect and build relations with his incoming administration. From Hollywood to Silicon Valley and Wall Street, senior executives have been bending over backwards to meet Trump since he won the presidential election against Kamala Harris in early November. The pace of meetings has accelerated in recent days  and has moved well beyond the world of Republican donors Trump steadily reeled in to finance his campaign. As well as seeing Sarandos, Trump is due to meet billionaire Amazon boss Jeff Bezos on Wednesday. This follows a visit from Shou Zi Chew, the CEO of TikTok, on Monday, just hours after Trump stood beside Masayoshi Son to announce a $100bn US investment from Japans SoftBank. Inside Trumps orbit, the meetings are cast as a vote of confidence in the president-elect and his economic policies. Many in the business world had stopped engaging with Trump after his tumultuous first term and the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Some had backed Trumps opponents in this years White House race. Some of these CEOs are showing that they will be willing partners in the upcoming administration, and saying that they want to focus on where they can work together, even if they have not been politically supportive in the past, said Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser. There will be a whole bunch more coming, domestic CEOs and international CEOs.The executives motivations vary: TikToks Shou is looking to save the popular app from a US ban due to take effect next year and hoping to find some sympathy from Trump. Big Tech executives, including Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, are seeking a more benign regulatory environment. It takes a lot for an uber-wealthy, creative-type CEO, many of whom lean left, to suck it up and deal with Trump, said a Washington lobbyist. But what choice do they have? Wall Street chief executives also believe Trump will reverse President Joe Bidens policies that they perceived as anti-business, including on tax and antitrust. Corporate America does have some serious concerns about Trump, especially his plans for sweeping tariffs, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and the rollback of some manufacturing subsidies. But executives also see Trump as a dealmaker and learned that it is better to engage with him with exuberance and flattery than to criticise him and risk his public rebukes or retaliation. What I tell CEOs is that its good to get face time with President Trump. Its good to let him know what youre working on. Its good to let him know how youre growing business, said Nikki Haley, who battled him for the Republican party presidential nomination but is now vice-chair of the consultancy Edelman, where she advises companies on how to deal with the president-elect. Im not talking to any CEOs that are fearful of Trump, she told the Financial Times. As well as meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and new investment announcements, some executives and companies  such as Sam Altman of OpenAI and banks including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs  are expressing their support for the next president by helping to bankroll his inauguration. Some executives think their charm offensive is working. We dont really need to hire lobbyists, Trump is representing Wall Street, said a top financier. One top adviser to several bank chief executives added: They are all making the pilgrimage to pay their respects, either in person or virtually.The Washington lobbyist said corporate America saw Trumps victory in the popular vote as confirmation of public support  giving him the kind of mandate he lacked after winning in 2016 despite trailing Hillary Clinton across the electorate. But Trump has also cast himself as a champion of the working class, with even more populist plans than during his first term. That is another reason for corporate executives to shore up their relationship with the Republican. Trump is going to govern as a Main Street-type guy, not a Wall Street guy. So they better get in and explain how their respective companies are driving the economy and arent anti-competitive, the lobbyist said. Hedge fund and private equity executives are also using Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, Trumps picks for treasury and commerce secretary, respectively, as a conduit to meet or talk to the president-elect. Both men have spent long careers as investors in New York. Two people with direct knowledge of these conversations said they had been fairly light on content, although the wish list for corporate bosses was long. Dealmakers especially hope the new president will undo anything promoted by Lina Khan, Bidens progressive Federal Trade Commissioner chair, including removing tough new merger guidelines. They have also asked for reforms to limit reviews by Cfius  which assesses the impact of foreign investment on national security  only to transactions involving US enemies such as Russia, Iran and North Korea. This would exempt from Cfius scrutiny any proposed mergers by companies from allies such as Japan, the UK and other European countries.?Miller said the new administration would immediately begin deregulating, allow more oil and gas exploration, and cut taxes to improve the business climate  all outcomes sought by CEOs who came into Trumps fold. American workers know that President Trump will stand up for their industries and protect them from foreign competitors trying to wipe out their very existence. Everybody wants to get on board.","title":"What choice do they have?: Americas CEOs bend the knee to Donald Trump"},{"text":"It's okay, I am sure Thomas and Alito will run to Dear Leader's defense woth some bullshit ruling after Trump inevitably appeals this and it heads to the Supreme Court","title":"Trump Loses It After Hush-Money Judge Says Hes Not Immune"},{"text":"The call it Congress when it about republicans and they say \\"Dems\\" when its the Dems.","title":"After investigating January 6, House GOP sides with Trump and goes after Liz Cheney"},{"text":"Ironic since Trump needs the \\"anti-Trump\\" states to fund his bullshit since GOP states can't generate revenue for the Fed.","title":"Democrats look to state legislatures as their anti-Trump firewall"},{"text":"I am incredibly flattered that you remembered this post and quoted it here!

We should be rerouting those industrial sectors to less developed friendly nations, but we have decided that we want to process intermediate goods and low-tech manufacturing here instead, for some reason.","title":"Chinas Slowdown Has Changed the Trade War: America Now Has the Upper Handbut Trumps Maximalist Tariffs Would Still Carry Risks"},{"text":"Weve taken trillions from Social Security to pay for unfunded wars, tax cuts for the rich and corporate subsidies.

Bill Cassidy to support Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Another told Republican voters how to encourage Cassidy to vote for all of Trumps nominees  follow state treasurer John Fleming, Cassidys brand-new GOP primary challenger.Im openly and publicly supporting all of [Trumps] nominees, Fleming told Semafor. It doesnt mean that I necessarily agree with everything theyve said in the past. But I trust President Trump.As they weigh the president-elects Cabinet picks, incumbent GOP senators are facing serious pressure to vote his way if they want to avoid tough and costly primary challenges. Trump confirmed as much on Monday, telling reporters that if Republicans are unreasonable, if theyre opposing somebody for political reasons or stupid reasons, then those senators would be primaried.Trump wont take office for more than a month, but his comments followed already-intense conservative media pressure and organized calls to Senate offices pushing Republicans to back Trumps nominees. The effect of the MAGA-driven campaign is already palpable, but some of the targeted Republicans are taking it in stride.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told Semafor that he is guaranteed to draw a primary challenge in 2026 and that Trump has a valid point in asking GOP senators to explain their opposition to Cabinet nominees. Tillis has indicated hell support any Trump pick who gets out of Senate committees and on to a full vote.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/17/2024/republican-senators-begin-their-battle-against-maga-primary-challengers?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"The battle begins: Republican senators vs. MAGA primary foes"},{"text":"Classic billionaires.

Their internal demand is not nearly enough to satiate their supply. And with their consumption lagging they are relying even more on investment.

Some can be countered in the courts (see: Marc Elias), some can be countered electorally (yes, there WILL continue to be elections, but even if that were an uncertain thing, wed have to proceed as if there would be, what other choice do we have?), a lot can be countered at the state level, etc. People who do this arent sticking their heads in the sand and pretending everything will just work out on its own, they recognize the fight ahead and the hard work it will take.2) I hate to say it, but misinformation about how the government works can be found all along the political spectrum, not just on the right. At least some of the people dooming the hardest are doing so over things that would have an extremely low chance of happening even if the incoming administration was very competent and strongly ideologically unified (it isnt). One of the bigger examples of this is the dooming over the lunatic fringe that wants to get rid of the 19th amendment. Its kind of surprising how many left-leaning people Ive seen comment on this who dont appear to be aware that getting rid of a constitutional amendment requires passage of *another* constitutional amendment (remember how we got rid of Prohibition?), which is just about impossible in the current political environment. And, IMO, fretting over this distracts activist-minded people from the myriad other ways that the GOP is ALREADY disenfranchising voters, and what can be done to fight those. And that comes back to focusing on individual battles: educate yourself about the actual political/legal feasibility of something that Trump *says* he wants to do (he certainly does say a lot of things, and a lot of them are things he cant just unilaterally do, because he doesnt really know how the government works either), and prepare to fight it accordingly should the government try to make it happen.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 17, 2024"},{"text":"It's giving Vice City??","title":"Donald Trump got a new hairstyle ?\\n"},{"text":"10 % believe it was stolen.

Hitler barely had to do *any* brainwashing, and was more a *result* of those beliefs, not their cause.","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"Dawg, If I lose my job it ain't no fuckin 'mirage'.","title":"Paul Krugman sums up why Trump won the election"},{"text":"I dont care that you think it shouldnt be repeated.

I lost friends to either COVID or other illness due to the strained hospital system, had an extended period of unemployment, nearly went broke 2-3 times. The life I planned and expected to live for myself went to absolute hell in many ways. I lost a major relationship due to the collapse of their mental health and the toxicity of social media and the culture wars.Yet the irony is by just persevering on and 'not' giving up things didn't just get better, they got a lot better. I try not to talk much about my IRL here, but for the past 2 and a half years I've worked to establish myself in a dream industry bit by bit, doing things I deeply care about, and I only got to do this because I didn't give up and worked to survive even when times were tough.Am I discouraged by the outcome of this election, concerned for the future, and genuinely questioning the value of democracy itself even? Yes and Yes, and even to the last one... yes at least a bit.But in truth I've learned a lot more about how to survive because of the events of the past few years. I've learned more about what I can tolerate and what I can't. I've learned how to stretch my funds when necessary, and what to prioritize when I must spend, and I've learned a lot more about what I care about and how to advocate for myself wherever possible.I've learned that I'm a survivor, and that there are people I can still find community with no matter what Trumpism tries to do. I've learned that I am simultaneously a person who can make a difference, yet still too small for MAGA's ego to care about and I can disappear just as quickly when I need to, and help others do so too. I survived a life surrounded by conservatism in the 90s and 2000s. I know how these people think and operate, even when I disagree. I know how to get through this, at least as much as anyone can.So I'm walking away from the rest of reddit and even most of political social media if that's all it has to offer. Endless doom is worthless hyperbole. It helps no one survive or adapt in a crisis. It at best serves as an outlet to vent and mourn, at worst is literally itself a tool of oppression to control how you think and steal your own happiness and productivity, even if there can only be so much of it to find at one given time.We'll survive until we can't. And if your number does come up? Then you did what you could amidst a world that was never going to be fully fair in the first place, that was always imperfect. Strive to make a positive impact with the time you have. Help people at the local level. Acknowledge your fears, but then keep going anyway. Protect yourself, but don't give up on empathy when you do.And when the time comes, pick your battles. Despite all the hyperbole, a full on civil war isn't what's coming. Everything Trump and MAGA say they want to do are extremely hard to implement long term, and even the conservative SCOTUS has limits to what they can pull off. Practically no one actually wants Christian Nationalism in a practical sense, but they all live in fear and have not yet learned how to manage that. If it gets chaotic for a bit, so be it, but balkanization or civil war is not the end result we're likely to see here. There is no clear territorial dispute by which to define it.Find your communities, anywhere you can. Do not rely on social media alone if you can avoid it, or at least when you use it, make sure you're connecting with real people at a local level at least in small ways. That's the best way to survive whatever happens.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 17, 2024"},{"text":"Trump's Justice Department will indict the Judge for some made up crime and he will be forced to change his mind.Or the case will go to the federal courts and they will overturn the decision.","title":"Trump Loses It After Hush-Money Judge Says Hes Not Immune"},{"text":"You can't just blame propaganda and fake news all the time.\\nYou already have to be dumb enough to believe all this bullshit and that this clown you see with your own eyes is cabable of holding any office","title":"Your poll made Trump mad is not a valid basis for a lawsuit"},{"text":"5d chess in 2024 again, love to see resident conservatives make another case for why their fave doesn't actually support Trump","title":"Milei and Trump"},{"text":"I think there is no changing your view, you are on the soapbox, not the seek understanding box.Having said that the main difference with 2020 and 2024 that may change your view was the margins and the accusations.In 2024 Trump improved in basically every countyIn 2020, what was proven was large media and social media entities were suppressing the reach of conservatives.

I get what you are saying but when you are talking about 150+ million voters one or two percent difference is millions of votes.  And yet polling did tell us something we didn't know this election. Aside from telling us that the election was a tossup which is not a given, we knew exactly what the swing states were. No state outside of the seven ones which were too close to call went to anyone other than who they were predicted to go to. Polling isn't magic and there is a lot it can't account for, hence the margin of error. But there is a lot of stuff we knew this election because of polling, so much so that it informed and changed the course of the election. It lead to Biden resigning his campaign and the Trump campaign giving up on states like New Hampshire which they'd otherwise treat as swing states.","title":"GOP report recommends Liz Cheney be criminally investigated over Jan. 6 work"},{"text":"Is it due to most of the media being gobbled up by right wing oligarchs, like in the US and UK?","title":"How Trumps tariff threat pushed Canadas Trudeau to brink of resignation"},{"text":"They didn't storm the capitol, but this is what he is referring to.https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/inauguration-2017/washington-faces-more-anti-trump-protests-after-day-rage-n709946Edit:\\nA better link. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisruptJ20","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"Yeah nearly a third of *known* pregnancies end in miscarriage.","title":"South Carolina Republicans Set To Reintroduce Bill Allowing Death Penalty For Abortions"},{"text":"But he kind of did.

It *is* a fine working description. But it's not just semantics. The way you think about people and world affects how you act. And if you keep using the shortcut description that seems to imply an immutable characteristic rather than a prediction based on previous experiences, you may end up treating the person as if they had this immutable characteristic. This is more relevant in cases in your personal life than passing judgment on cases in the news about people you will never meet. But it's two different modes of thinking. A person does X because \\\\[some reasons about what the situation was, what the person's motivations were, and so on\\\\], and X is evil. Versus: A person does evil because they are evil. The latter is much easier way to think and talk. And next time, when you are trying to predict what the person might do next? If you adopt the first mode, you think to compare the situation and the person's motivations, and decide based on that. But if you adopt the second mode, the only reasonable prediction is that an evil person will do evil.I am not saying you *will* become a bigot if you use the second mode. But bigotry is based on generalizations just like the second mode.

The easiest way to enact violence while maintaining a thin veneer of decency is to depict the people receiving your violence as evil and deserving of whatever you do to them.There are terrible people who, though they could be stopped peacefully, aren't being held accountable. I think targeted violence to stop true evil is certainly possible (personally I think we saw that with Luigi), but it's dangerous once it becomes less targeted, once evil is thrown around more loosely, and there is a whole lot of room for error.","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"She conceded THAT NIGHT you fucking regard.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"You had me going there for a minute.","title":"Steve Bannon Is Already Setting the Stage for a Third Trump Term"},{"text":"Historically Democrat administrations leave more seats open in the appeal of fairness than republicans.Furthering my point that republicans believe politics are a competitive sport whereas democrats to their own detriment believe it to be cooperative.

That's witness tampering.It's ex parte communications, you lose your license if you do that and the testimony gets thrown out, it opens you up to being investigated and charged for witness tampering, and since she deliberately used encrypted communication channels, that looks to be just what happened here.Prosecutors aren't even allowed to speak to the judge behind closed doors without the opposing council being there, it's grounds for immediate dismissal and disbarment by both the judge and prosecutor. You don't do it, she did..Trump didn't own her testimony. He and his fake-lawyer/handler had no right to tell her what to say, or block her from voluntarily talking to others.Would you say that if during the trial Trump started sending a ton of encrypted messages to Cohen and Stormy Daniels that could not be subpoenaed or retrieved by the court?

Or what if they came back and felt so bad about the part theyd played they devote their life to others entirely in the hopes of redemption?Basically Im saying, how many good vs bad acts does it take to be evil or good? Standing by whilst Jews were rounded up during the holocaust is not a morally neutral act, but is it an evil act?

Socialism is a broad church and sure modern social democracy is not orthodox Marxism, it has adapted, in particular to the expansion of the franchise; when Marx was writing, workers in most of the West did not have the vote, so revolution and direct action was the only option. This changed as the franchise expanded, and more moderate socialists changed their methods in accordance. The reality is that all the \\"socialist\\" parties in Europe that actually win elections are social democrats. The Trotskyists sit sniping from the sidelines and have zero actual support.This is the position that none of the European parties in the [Socialist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International), which includes many very mainstream centre-left parties, such as the current government of Spain and former governments of France and the UK, are actually socialist. Because only the extreme far-left is True Socialism.That article you linked talks about his *supporters*, not his own actual policy positions. So sure if Bernie is as left as you get you are going to have people who are further left among his supporters, it's their best option to get a leftist elected. We were at a Sanders event, and it was like being at a Left Party meeting,\\" he told Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, according to one translation. \\"It was a mixture of very young people and old Marxists, who think they were right all along. There were no ordinary people there, simply.There is not a single word in that article about any of Sanders actual policy positions. It's a sort of guilt by association thing.In Europe, most countries have entirely mainstream centre-left parties, and the Overton window is substantially further to the left. Many European countries have electoral systems that allow you to vote for who you want to, it's not a two party system where you only have two choices and you have to hold your nose and vote for what you consider the least worst. So in this scenario, the far-left will vote for far-left candidates, and sometimes they end up as a minority partner in a coalition.I don't believe Sanders has ever suggested he wants to totally nationalize the means of production, has he? If you look at his actual policies, they are social democracy.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Bernie_SandersHowever, many representatives belonging to the Democratic Socialists of America, Socialist Workers Party, and Socialist Party USA have criticized Sanders, arguing that he is either not a socialist because he merely aims to reform capitalism, or for failing to fully reject the two-party system in the United States. ... Former Sanders colleague Peter Diamondstone claimed that Sanders was a socialist during his time in the Liberty Union Party, but is no longer a socialist.So this is it, it's the far left that does this, it's a total No True Socialist, if you actually have a chance of election you can't be socialist.To a large extent, also, trying to pretend there is this sharp and universally agreed division between social democracy and democratic socialism is disingenuous. The reality is these are somewhat fluid definitions and Sanders has applied both to himself. Social democracy (sometimes used synonymously with democratic socialism)- [International Encyclopedia of Political Science](https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/intlpoliticalscience/chpt/social-democracy)If you want to say there is a distinct difference, the academic distinction is that social democracy aims for a welfare state and some public ownership of infrastructure (health, education, transportation, etc) within capitalism without ever overthrowing capitalism. While democratic socialism aims for the eventual complete dismantling of capitalism and public ownership of the means of production, but attained through democratic means.But if you accept this distinction between them, Sanders is a social democrat. He has not called for the eventual nationalization of the entire economy.Genuinely interested if you can come up with Sanders policy positions that are far outside the mainstream centre-left in Europe.","title":"Milei and Trump"},{"text":"The best comedys of all time are Tragicomedys.

Obama also saw even slight economic improvement, where unemployment went from 10% to 7.9% so it felt like progress was being made. Even then, that election broke late for him...likely because he was facing a poor opponent. \\n2.

To go beyond voting, and to create a real democratic culture also requires creating durable democratic organizations, embedded in the community, beyond political parties and at smaller scales. This is what unions represented in the 20th century, where members took part in much more than voting, but they were also able to directly connect their votes with tangible benefits. The question then is how much authority to delegate to these organizations, and how far should their influence extend i.e. work, schools etc.Furthermore, you also need to address the media landscape if you want to revive this type of participatory democracy, and reverse the nationalization of politics.","title":"How Can We Improve Democracy?"},{"text":"The person I was responding to was **blatantly** operating in bad faith.","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"Thank you!\\nThat was incredibly well written and a good reminder to all of us that a criminal is about to take power in the USAThe entire GOP runs on muck.

CCP panics, Xi Jinping acknowledges the \\"development situation\\" is \\"incredibly complex\\" which is about as close as a Chinese leader will ever get to admitting that they are in some deep shit.The great solution? Massive government support for manufacturing, especially advanced manufacturing. The great experiment -- what if we took the \\"fiscal repression to fund enormous transfers to capital\\" playbook that everyone now seems to agree is sometimes acceptable (especially the Germans, who love this strategy) and just kept running it harder and harder to see what happens.Well, what happens is you end up with genuinely staggering productive and industrial capacity consuming resources at a prodigious rate. Good thing we have all these wealthy de-industrialized countries that have spent the last two decades absorbing our excess capacity, right? .... right?we still have those markets, right?they wouldn't cut us off, harming themselves in the process, because our foreign policy has made them terrified of us, right?whoopsThis describes the current regime of tariffs going up all around the west against Chinese goods. We are already in a trade conflict, if a cold one. [Escalation is continuing](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/), and shows no sign of stopping. It will be harmful for both sides, seeing as China relies on its mercantilist economic model (achieved by unprecedented subsidizing of industries for export). When demand overseas drops due to tariff walls, China's only growth engine will start shuddering. They refuse to pursue policies which increase domestic demand in large part because they're terrified of a wealthy middle class threatening the CCPs power, so they'll stick out the export focus in spite of mounting tariffs throughout the current preliminary phase, and the even the worst parts of a future trade war. On the other end, the west is reliant on China as an outsourced industrial base so the west can maintain higher productivity post-industrial sectors. Cutting off trade from them will cause prices to rise and unsettle incumbent politicans/parties. Who knows what the conclusion of this conflict will be.My personal view is that the Chinese Communist Party is Hostis Humani Generis, the enemy of all mankind, and anything that hurts their geopolitical/economic/domestic power more than it hurts that of the free world as a collective is to be considered good policy until proven otherwise.

So, federal law says when electors must meet. Has the date and everything. So, what happens in a state where there's still a real legitimate court case and the outcome still isn't decided by the meeting of the electoral college? Obviously the state legislature lets the currently projected winner's electors meet and vote. Ok, sure, but what happens if, two days later, the court overturns the recount or whatever and the other group wins? They didn't vote on the legally required day. So now the state has zero electors. Which is obviously a nonsensical outcome. So in many states, having the underdog electors meet and vote is still fine and legal. What is ILLEGAL is having them sign a document that claims they are the legitimate electors. What they need to do, usually, to comply with state and federal laws, is meet and vote with a statement that says they are the backup electors pending the court decision etc. It turns out several \\"fake electors\\" in 2020 DID add such a signing statement, most notably in Pennsylvania. But other states didn't and their \\"vote\\" of their fake electors claimed they were the legitimate electors. So, again, not every one of these fake electors is a criminal. Some of them, specifically the ones that claimed they were the undisputed duly chosen electors, are criminals. But others, like those from Pennsylvania, are not. Part of the problem here is federal law does not have any protocols to deal with elections that aren't 100% decided with all court cases wrapped up in time for the legally mandated date of electoral college meeting. The law should be clarified here so that backup slates pending specific court cases can legally be signed, and then make clear who is the decider (preferably at the state level).","title":"13 'fake electors' to cast their states' Electoral College votes for Trump"},{"text":"Since hes just giving out nominations like candy, how do I apply for Ambassador to Tahiti or wherever?","title":"Trump names Herschel Walker as ambassador to Bahamas"},{"text":" conflictedAfter all this time he still thinks conflicted is the same as conflict of interest.

It started with months of Trump and Republican leaders and media spreading constant conspiracy theories to discredit the election, before the election even took place. This turned into using the legal system to push their claims, making a ton of insane and already totally discredited claims in court while asking the courts to throw out ultimately millions of legally cast ballots. Multiple lawyers lost their ability to practice law after this. This then turned into Trump, the sitting president, personally calling hundreds of state representatives around the country and threatening them and demanding they throw out exactly enough legally cast ballots to give him the win. Simultaneously, he was pressuring states to send false electors to vote for him over the winning candidate. He and his advisors, like Flynn, were crafting executive orders to have the military seize ballots and machines. Fortunately it didn't come to that. This all culminated in Trump urging his supporters to march on the Capitol to pressure his VP to unconstitutionally reject the certification of entire states. He refused, and Trump's supporters rioted and violently stormed the Capitol, threatening to murder a number of politicians, including Pence, in a last ditch effort to overturn the election. Throughout the entire process Trump was claiming that he won the election and was the legitimate president, and refused to concede. Nothing like this has ever occurred in our history. You've given examples of handfuls of legislators sending a letter, and some random protestors totally unconnected to Hillary Clinton or Obama. In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the same night if I'm not mistaken, or the next day. In 2024, Kamala Harris conceded almost immediately. They didn't go on a massive campaign of lying to the public, breaking the law and threatening states to get them to throw out ballots, or trying unconstitutional moves like rejecting the certification of entire states.It was completely unprecedented and wildly undemocratic. A sitting president tried to overturn an election, and we can all literally listen to him as he does it. That's why Trump was indicted and charged with a multitude of felonies in state and federal courts over his efforts to overturn the election.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"Turning Point USA would have new content.","title":"If Donald Trump were abducted by aliens during his inauguration day speech next month, how would the US and the world react?"},{"text":"GOP recomends...\\nImmediately disregarded.","title":"GOP report recommends Liz Cheney be criminally investigated over Jan. 6 work"},{"text":"Free Luigi!!!!","title":"CMV: Most people aren't nearly violent enough against true evil"},{"text":"Fuck him and his diaper shitting feelings!!!!","title":"Trump Loses It After Hush-Money Judge Says Hes Not Immune"},{"text":"I mock their partys lack of ethics.","title":"Strikes at the heart of impartiality: Obama-appointed judge who unretired on Trump gets hit with judicial misconduct complaint from GOP group who mocks his change of heart"},{"text":"Merchan refused to toss the case, but has also delayed the sentencing indefinitely.

It is very common to see high level politicians in their 70's, 80's, and even 90's in America while that is much less common in other democracies. Indeed politicians born in the 1940's and even 1930's are still relevant in America today, while similarly aged politicians in Europe have been out of power for many years. To fix this problem I propose that there should be a maximum age of 70 to be in government. This maximum age limit would apply regardless of whether the person is appointed or elected, whether they are in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches, and whether they are in the federal, state, or local government. On the other hand, the minimum age to be involved as either a legislator or executive at any level of government should be 18 years old. These reforms would not eliminate \\"career politicians\\", a term which in my opinion has received far too much negative attention. Rather it would eliminate people overstaying their welcome in politics. What do you think of the proposed maximum age limit?

You're changing what the poll asked to try to make it fit, but it doesn't. Russia engaged in a massive campaign to influence the election, that went as high as Trump's campaign manager and many of his associates. It certainly had an impact, but it's impossible to say how much of an impact. Saying \\"I think the impact was large enough to change the results\\" isn't saying Trump is illegitimate or should be removed from office or something. It should also be noted that *Trump himself* called Biden an illegitimate president, and Trump tried to overturn the election. Biden didn't do that. Kamala Harris didn't do that. Obama and Hillary Clinton didn't do that. There is no both sides on this issue. Only one side is threatening state reps to throw out legally cast ballots, changing laws to make it easier for them to throw out votes, refusing to concede the election and instead going on massive campaigns pushing fraudulent claims to rile up their base to the point that they'll storm the Capitol building.Like OP said, I'm tired of pretending this is perfectly normal, acceptable part of politics. It isn't. Trump was facing dozens of felonies in state and federal courts for trying to overturn the election. Those disappeared because he got elected president again. It is so fucking insane that the vast majority of a major political party believes in completely discredited conspiracy theories, pushed by a losing president who was trying to maintain power. It's insane that people are still supporting this guy, who tried to overturn an election he lost.

I mean Jesus Christ, if overturning elections isn't damaging to democracy then what the hell is?I wish Trump supporters would at least man the fuck up and admit what it is they're supporting, instead of playing all of these ridiculous games to try to justify their undemocratic, autocratic beliefs and desires for the country.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"I made fun of republicans in 2020 and democrats in 2024","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"This is a wildly inaccurate comparison.

Labor rights groups and unions protested and pressured state governments into raising the minimum wage, which dragged up the national average.
