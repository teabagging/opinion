It's specifically federal workers. Government employees who take lower pay than they'd make in the private sector because they care about their work. Nobody is working from \\"vacation places.\\" And the goal isn't to improve their work, it's to make them miserable so they quit. Trump's people are saying this out loud, on the record. And once they've dragged everyone back to the DC area with its absurdly high rents? Then comes the hiring and pay freezes, the shutdowns, and furloughs. He did all those things last time, and he will absolutely do them again if it forces people out. And yet, the reality is that all the work being done now won't stop. Even if programs are cancelled, there will be people needed to wind them down, dispose of assets, reallocate funding, etc. Now it'll just be outsourced to contractors who *are often the exact same people*, just more expensive. For example: a program manager at the Department of Agriculture who makes $75k/year takes a job with Deloitte... on a contract for the Department of Agriculture. But now he makes $110k and the government pays Deloitte $150k for the exact same work. The DoD analyst to Booz Allen consultant pipeline is such a common thing that it's kind of a meme. A [study by the Project on Government Oversight](https://www.pogo.org/public-comments/feds-vs-contractors-federal-employees-often-save-money-but-an-advisory-panel-is-needed-to-create-a-cost-comparison-model) found that: the federal government approves service contract billing rates... that pay contractors 1.83 times more than the government pays federal employees in total compensationand  Federal employees were less expensive than contractors in 33 of the 35 occupational classifications POGO reviewed; In one instance, contractor billing rates were nearly 5 times more than the full compensation paid to federal employees performing comparable services;and  the DoD expends between 2.35 and 3.53 times more of its funding on service contracts than on its civilian workforce, and that the cost of an average [full-time contractor] is nearly 3 times more than an average DoD civilian full-time equivalentThe kicker? Almost all of the federal contracting workforce in the DC area currently works from home. A lot of these companies don't even have enough offices for all their employees to come to work at the same time even if they wanted to. So how does this play out? Trump will impose rules that make life harder for government employees, many of them will leave their agencies and take higher paying jobs with government contractors, and go back to doing the exact same work as before... still from home. But the overall number of 'true' federal employees will go down, and Trump will pat himself on the back and brag about how much he's cutting waste. Meanwhile... government spending will go *up* to afford the additional contractors... not down.Yay government efficiency.","title":"Trump, DOGE would make a huge mistake waging war on remote work"},{"text":"Thanks for confirming:)","title":"Trump Team Signs Transition Agreement but Shuns F.B.I.

This law states that the president can raise tariffs on imports that pose a threat to national security. Section 232 allows the President to implement these tariffs without the approval of Congress, following an investigation by the Department of Commerce. The Commerce Department has noted that threats to national security may include fostering U.S. dependence on unreliable or unsafe imports or fundamentally threatening the ability of U.S. domestic industries to satisfy national security needs.1 However, there are many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who would like to rein in the Presidents ability to unilaterally impose tariffs.So Trump could, hypothetically, use this law to implement tariffs on crude without congressional approval using the same arguments he made to impose tariffs he did on Steel in his last term.","title":"Exclusive: Trump plans no exemption for oil imports under new tariff plan, sources say"},{"text":"You don't have to agree with Marxism as a whole but a part of Marxist thought is generally about critical thinking regarding the historical context or the material conditions of the time as to why something happened or is happening.

As I warned this past April, stunning his opponents with more outrages than they can handle is a classic Trump tactic ... Neither the voters nor the members of the U.S. Senate, however, should fall for it this time. Professor Timothy Snyder of Yale University has written that the most important way to resist a rising authoritarian regime is not to obey in advancethat is, changing our behavior in ways we think might conform to the demands of the new ruling group. Thats good advice, but I might add a corollary here: People should not panic and exhaust themselves in advance, either.In practice, this means setting prioritiesmine are the preservation of democracy and national securityand conserving mental energy and political effort to concentrate on those issues and Trumps plans for them. Its important to bear in mind as well that Trump will not take the oath of office for another two months. (Such oaths do not matter to him, but he cannot grab the machinery of government without it.) If citizens and their representatives react to every moment of trollery over the coming weeks, they will be exhausted by Inauguration Day.Trump will now dominate the news cycle almost every day with some new smoke bomb that is meant to distract from his attempts to stock the government with a strange conglomeration of nihilistic opportunists and self-styled revolutionaries. He will propose plans that he has no real hope of accomplishing quickly, while trying to build an aura of inevitability and omnipotence around himself. (His vow to begin mass deportations on his first day, for example, is a logistical impossibility, unless by mass he means slightly more than usual. He may be able to set in motion some sort of planning on day one, but he has no way to execute a large-scale operation yet, and it will be some time before he has anywhere to put so many people marked for deportation.)...But Trump cannot simply will things into existence. Yes, the people have spoken, but it was a narrow win, and Trump again seems to have fallen short of gaining 50 percent of the popular vote. Just as Democrats have had to learn that running up big margins in California does not win the presidency, Republicans are finding yet again that electoral votes are not the same thing as a popular mandate. The Senate Republican conference is rife with cowards, but only a small handful of principled GOP senators are needed to stop some of Trumps worst nominees.The other reality is that Trump has already accomplished the one thing he really cared about: staying out of jail. Today, Special Counsel Jack Smith moved to dismiss the January 6Crelated case against him. So be it; if enough voters have decided they can live with a convicted felon in the White House, theres nothing the rest of us can do about that.But Trump returning to office does not mean he can rule by fiat. If his opponents react to every piece of bait he throws in front of them, they will lose their bearings. And even some of Trumps votersat least those outside the MAGA personality cultmight not have expected this kind of irresponsible trolling. If these Republican voters want to hold Trump accountable for the promises he made to them during the campaign, theyll have to keep their heads rather than get caught up in Trumps daily dramas.It will be important for those, such as members of the fourth estate as well as opposition politicians, when working to maintain accountability to keep things in perspective, and try to look beyond the surface outrage-du-jour for what is happening more quietly. If they fail to do this, then many more deeply damaging policies will likely proceed unnoticed until it's too late.","title":"The Trump Marathon | If Americans want to hold Trump accountable in a second term, they must keep their heads when he uses chaos as a strategy"},{"text":"The data and simulations that Bidens team had showed Trump getting either 408 or 420 EVs.

The fact that there has been no improvement on metrics from incoming students that did not experience the lock downs strongly suggests that #1 may not be the root cause.

He also said he would punish schools and teachers who suggest to a child that they may be transgender, ban transgender women from female sports, and ask Congress to pass a law that the only genders recognized by the US government are male and female  and they are assigned at birth.People in the transgender community are worried that if federal agencies adopt such a policy, and they dont update their passports and other documents before Trump takes office, they would be blocked from a number of activities, including traveling overseas.We are publicizing all the name-change clinics \\\\[that help with updating documents\\\\] because it is very much a real fear that things will come to a screeching halt with federal bans, said Nina Selvaggio, executive director of?[Greater Boston PFLAG](https://www.gbpflag.org/), an LGBTQ advocacy organization.The growing anxiety has prompted a flood of calls to lawyers, advocates, and therapists who are guiding families through the time-consuming and emotionally fraught process as they confront a tight timeline before Inauguration Day?on Jan. 20.[GLAD Law](https://www.glad.org/), a Boston legal and LGBTQ+ advocacy nonprofit, is fielding calls from people across New England seeking guidance on updating their legal documents. The number of requests it has received for help recently tripled, from 27 in October, to 79, just in the first three weeks of November. Thats in addition to the heavy traffic on GLADs?[Transgender ID webpage](https://www.glad.org/id/), which includes step-by-step directions for updating the documents on your own.People can have a lot of complications introduced into their life if they dont have ID documents that match who they are, said Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD.You might wrongly be told that you cant cash a check or cant buy groceries, she said. If you have a passport and youre traveling, and you present with an ID thats inconsistent with who you are... it can cause very significant problems.What about people who have already successfully updated their passports?

No one wants to appear weak on the international stage and I don't blame them. It's an unsurprising move on Mexico's part and, frankly, doesn't warrant comment.Much in the same way Trudeau said he would negotiate nothing with the USA (their largest trade partner) if tariffs were used and, yet, he **scrambled** to get on the phone with Trump within two hours of the announcement and declared the conversation with Trump good and positive. However, premiers of Canadian provinces are still in a panic over possible tariffs, the most vocal being the Quebec Premier. As long as trade balances can be negotiated and if Canada manages their side of the border more carefully, they can avoid tariffs, which is cheaper and more manageable than economic recession.Mexico's new President needs to appear tough in her first economic altercation, but the US being Mexico's largest trade partner and their overextension of recent socialist programs puts them financially in a very tough spot. This is likely why Mexico began breaking up the large migratory group of illegal immigrants from reaching the Mexico US border and announcing that they would not reach their destination. This was a day or two after Trump announced tariffs. All Mexico has to do is manage their side of the border, and get serious on the inflow and outflow of drugs before the US does unilaterally. Mexico, but mostly the cartels, do not want the US handling the drug issue themselves. They have a great concern over cartels being designated terrorist groups, which would allow the US to move more freely towards the source of the problem within Mexico. These tariffs aren't to negotiate a trade imbalance, they're meant to economically cripple Mexico if they don't manage their border more aggressively and keep the cartels in line while stemming the flow of drugs. This really does put Mexico between a rock and a hard place. Depending on the administration, the cartels can be more than just entwined in local government, they can be in bed with presidential office. And the Morena Party is attached at the hip with cartels. However, when it's a choice between the US and cartels, Mexico will side with the US. I also expect Mexico to acquiesce even before Trump's inauguration.The tariffs on China and the ensuing trade war with them is something entirely different, but China is practical and it's currently dealing with taking on a massive deficit due to severe financial mismanagement of local provinces and a slowing housing market. Negotiations will go on for a few months but should wrap up with similar speed as last time.*^(Post edited for general grammar and spelling due to talk-to-text.

My first console was the NES, which graduated in the early/mid 90s to an SNES, than a Sega, than an N64, to a PS. Then ps2, ps3, ps4 (as well as WII, and a switch) Also picked up a couple Xboxes along the way.  Also at one point, on my gaming PC, I had emulators for every system, along with the entire library of NES, SNES, Sega, N64 and ps games. So I'm am saying this from a place of lifetime experience.... I don't think they put \\"magic\\" into the consoles. You can only ever experience something \\"for the first time\\", one time. You can revisit those games, you can remember them fondly and feel a sense of nostalgia, but once you play it once, that will always be your first experience with it and follow up visits won't ever be the same. Also, I disagree that playing on an emulator not being as \\"magical\\". Case and point - The legend of Zelda, link to the past for the SNES. I played this game extensively as a child. I loved it, it was likely my favorite game at the time. But, when I revisited the game via an emulator as an adult, and got my plug ins set up perfectly, and got myself a controller that felt good in my hands, the game experience was far superior than that of my childhood play through(s), and it felt even more \\"magical\\" to me. That said, I will say by and large gaming titles mostly suck today. (Not all games today suck, mind you. There are plenty of good games out there still). But I don't think it's because of or lack of any sort of magic. The problem with modern gaming is that now gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry and most developers and publishers are less concerned with making an excellent gaming experience and more concerned with making a shit ton of money and being \\"accessible\\" and \\"inclusive\\".  One thing that particular grinds my gears is the trend in the gaming world to make games that hold the players hand and spoon feed the gamer. For example, the new dragon age, it practically tells you how to play it the entire game. Old games are not like this. You were lucky if you got a tutorial, but most games just used to throw you into the game and you had to figure it out. That said, it's been a long time since a game has really captivated my attention like games once did and made me *want* to play them. Outside of a few notable exceptions (elden ring and cyberpunk 2077 being the two I can think of in the last 8 or so years), most games can not captivate me and hold my attention for any significant length of time (i.e. more than a week or so). Even games that *are* fun, and highly rated (Zelda BotW for example) don't seem to hit the same place they once did for me. If I could personally go back to any time period and re-experence any point in my gaming life, I'd go back to when I played WoW. Now that game *was* magical.  That entire period from vanilla wow all the way though MOP was some of the best gaming experiences of my life. I had so much fun during that time, and I really made some good friends  (although, in hindsight the way I played WoW was probably unhealthy. Almost every single day, for 4 hours minimum, but there were most days it was actually more like 8-10 hours a day)...I was at one point the best geared, top rated warlock in one of the top rated guilds attempting to do server firsts on a high ranked server.

When kids are 6-8 years old, they too get to experience, and understand, the idea of virtual 3D worlds, it's not like that disappeared. If anything, due to the advances in technology, I can imagine this immersion being on a level far beyond what we can imagine.I remember lying in bed as a kid playing the pokemon games on my gameboy, and thinking how insane it would be to be able to watch entire movies on the 100 pixel gameboy screen. They have that now, for beyond that even.Online play for the first time, it was insane to think you were connected to a real person somewhere else on the same level in theI remember playing Age of Empires 1 around 2000 and playing a 3 hour game online vs a guy from Texas. I called over my entire family to show them I was physically connected to someone in Texas, it blews everyone's mind away.Kids today experience that far sooner, as soon as they understand the tablet/phone their parents give them, they'll come to terms with these concepts, at a far younger age than we did.You could play those libraries for a lifetime and never need another systemThis feels heavily nostalgia, because clearly you didn't do it yourself. At some point, you also abandonded your old system, either for work, school, or simply to replace them with newer technology.Let's be real here, OG games are fun, but you could NOT play them for a lifetime.  I would argue more recent MMO and PVP games do fit that category. Games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, games that either have online interaction or a competitive side, THOSE u could technically play forever, because it's not that much different from things like Chess and Go.I can get sucked into tony hawk pro skater for several hours but call of duty feels stale after an hour or so? Its like the magic is in the console itself. Its in the cartridges and the old discs. Its in the wired controllers and old school av plugs.You were alot younger back then, for the same reason a toddler can be entertained for hours by a mere soundboard with animal noises.I also think you're forgetting the disc's scratching, running out of memory card space, getting stuck in a game and not having any way to progress. (the internet was feeble back then) Cables not being long enough, etc...There were quite a few negative which I think you're omitting through these nostalgia glasses.The THPS remakes from 4 years ago are also very good.","title":"90s to early 2000s gaming, they added some sort of magic to those consoles.

It sets the price to charge consumers such that it generates a percent return on that investment (profit).A company is set up to make money on its investments. Paying tariffs is just part of that investment. They arent going to pay it out and then not get a return on that money later. It would be like offering an interest free loan to the consumer.Example:Company imports widget from Mexico for $100. Their other costs (payroll, advertising etc) add up to $150 on top of that. Thats $250 invested in bringing that widget. If they sell the widget for $250, they break even, but have no profit. So they mark up the price to $275 for a shareholder acceptable 10% return.Now a 25% tariff is added to their costs. $275 is the new break even point, so they mark up the price to pass it along to the customers, but they still need that 10% return for their investors, so the final price goes up to  $302.50. Later,  the tariff goes away and the companys costs return to pre tariff conditions. The customers are used to paying $302.50,, so when the company drops the price to $290, theyre happy, but the profit went from $27.50 on an investment of $275 to $40 on an investment of $250.The decrease in sales you describe to drive down profit depends on the level of competition in the market and the elasticity of demand. If the tariff is on a good that people need (e.g., gasoline from Canada) then people will buy it no matter the profit margin.)We are seeing record profits because of inflation, not in spite of it. When the goods in the supply chain increase in price, the downstream buyers need to charge more, not just to cover the additional costs incurred, but also to cover the opportunity costs of not being able to invest that money elsewhere. If Im floating a tariff fee for six months until I can sell to my customer, I cant put that money into another investment that will earn money for that period.","title":"Trumps tariff plan will send prices through the roof, warn US firms"},{"text":"This NEEDS to happen.

It is the unobtrusive act of the law given protection against a sinister use of his testimony, not like a pardon, requiring him to confess his guilt in order to avoid a conviction of it.This is actually what is referred to as *obiter dictum* which is a non-binding comment made by a court or judge in passing.  *Dicta* can be considered persuasive by lower courts, but it does not carry the same weight as precedent.So the 10th circuit ruling is a precedent setting event, where as the *obiter dictum* of the Burdick ruling is merely a non-binding comment.","title":"Jack Smith Ending Trump Lawfare Case Proves It Was Witch Hunt"},{"text":"Of course he was.

Studios discovered that they could release a bare bones game, then charge the players to do the research and development of the game all while making a second round of profits through micro transactions. Take Madden for example. It used to be about Franchise mode because that was the part of the game that was replayable. It is what drove sales.

You have to reject the woman's bodily autonomy to say she is not allowed to abort, that she **has** to be pregnant and deliver the baby.

Yes.

He screams and barks publicly on social media, that brings trade partners to the table and then they find common ground.

The other candidate thinks independent voters in swing states are all pregnant girls needy of abortions.The rich and their crony media don't want the political discussion on tax hikes. To be safe they don't want it on _any_ economic issues, at least not _before_ the election. (Afterward it's ok to blame voters for being stupid as shill media are never at fault.) Tax cuts isn't a weak desire in American media. It's more powerful than anything in the universe. Harris was so ultra compliant with crony media she never answered the complaint.So Harris loses by default _even though she would have won on the merits had she made it across the threshold, the first issue preclusion step_.Democrats need to put their culture war position papers on a web page. When on stage with Anderson or Rachael and they try to jerryspringer a culture war, just give them the link.Orally.

Orally. \\"We're going to hike taxes so high on Bezos WaPo gonna scandal monger the White House mouse.\\"Repeat as necessary.A candidate can do this exactly once before MSM gonna know their wet piece of cardboard Democrat has bolted their plantation.The long knives will come out and it will be so vicious . . . you have to experience it to even have a clue.You are literally forcing media shills to retrain for the productive sector.Shill media are even more entitlement minded than MAGA.","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"Vote Republican!

Disease experts worry Trump and RFK Jr. will mangle response like COVID"},{"text":"WASHINGTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps transition team has signed a memorandum of understanding with the White House that will allow Trump to formally begin his transition to power, his incoming chief of staff said on Tuesday, after weeks of delays.The move will allow Trumps team to coordinate directly with federal agencies and access documents. The unusual delay in signing the agreement after the Nov. 5 election had raised concerns among some critics about potential hiccups in government operations or conflicts of interest.This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power, Susie Wiles, Trumps chief of staff, said in a statement.Trump, a Republican, will take office on Jan. 20. His team had rejected entreaties from Democratic President Joe Bidens administration to quickly sign a memorandum of understanding and had objected to some elements of a traditional transition agreement, according to the White House.Under the agreement signed on Tuesday, Trumps team avoided signing a government ethics pledge, saying it has its own ethics plan that will meet the requirements for personnel to seamlessly move into the Trump administration.The separate ethics pledge was later posted to the General Services Administrations website. It included promises that transition team members will avoid conflicts of interests, will safeguard classified information and will disqualify themselves from involvement in any matter if they have engaged in lobbying on the issue in the previous 12 months.However, it did not include a pledge that Trump would avoid conflicts of interest or that he hold only non-conflicting assets, promises in the more standard agreement signed by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.Trump has a stake valued at $3.76 billion in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which runs his Truth Social platform, as well as stakes in a cryptocurrency business, real estate properties and several foreign deals.The family real estate company, now run largely by Trumps son Eric, owns a portfolio of hotels, golf courses, resorts and New York City office space, retail operations and condominiums.The Trump pledge also did not include a promise to protect whistleblowers on his transition team, a promise in the Harris pledge.SECURITY CLEARANCESSeparately, the Trump transition team has not entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice to allow the FBI to conduct background checks of nominees, and it has not sent the FBI the names of prospective national security personnel who would have access to classified information.A White House official said while a Justice Department agreement has not been signed, progress has been made toward such an agreement.Circumventing background checks would buck a long-established norm in Washington, but the president has the final authority on whom he nominates and picks to conduct background checks.The transition said on Tuesday it already has existing security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight.Trumps team also broke from tradition and did not sign an agreement with the General Services Administration that would provide the use of office space. The team said it did not want to waste taxpayer money by using government offices.White House spokesperson Saloni Sharma said the Biden administration did not agree with the Trump teams decision to forgo signing some of the usual agreements but the White House would go ahead with the transition process to avoid more delays.Trumps team said his transition will use private funding instead of government money to pay for transition costs. The team said donors to the transition will be disclosed to the public.","title":"Trump team signs transition agreement with Biden White House after delays"},{"text":"This is the image they project but their actions tell a differnet story.","title":"Only a Working-Class Party Can Challenge Donald Trumps Corruption"},{"text":"\\"cause you'd be in jail\\"","title":"Which Donald Trump Presidential Debate is your favorite?"},{"text":"The New York Times will fall in line. All the media will fall in line eventually. Nothing in the American media's behaviour during the campaign would have convinced me otherwise. American journalists, on the whole, seem to be the most sycophantic, lazy and weak snivelling cowards imaginable. It's nothing new, either. As a fun example from history, [here](https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=knz&amp;datum=19380312&amp;seite=1&amp;zoom=33) is an Austrian newspaper from March 12th, 1938, urging its readers to vote \\"yes\\" in the Austrian independence referendum scheduled for the next day and to reject Germany's expansion plans. In the end, that referendum never happened because Hitler [marched into Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss) that day and annexed the country into Germany. So [here's](https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=knz&amp;datum=19380316&amp;seite=1&amp;zoom=36) *that very same newspaper* a mere four days later on March 16th, now with a swastika in its masthead and a headline of \\"The Fhrer in the Austrian capital - Unbelievable Jubilation\\". My point is that throughout history too many journalists have chosen the path of least resistance when it would have mattered that they stand firm. And it's already happening in the United States now. One of the worst and most depraved examples is obviously Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski immediately hurrying to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee, but realistically, all the media will either continue to sanewash Trump or ramp it up another notch and try not to rock the boat too much, lest they find themselves at the receiving end of his wrath. They know which way the wind is blowing and will bend with it because they have zero integrity.

Anything but giving their mass of viewers a real education on what is really quite simple economics.That is not to say I am blaming Fox and alike for this upcoming car crash, I dont even put this specifically at the doorsteps of republicans either.

More than 9 million birds have been called since the beginning of the bird flu outbreak across several states. Bird flu is also widely suspected to have caused substantial numbers of deaths among migratory Birds and Native Wildlife including bald eagles.In the wake of this, Colorado's egg production fell to approximately 30% of its prior total.  Obviously if you are a chicken farmer and the FDA tells you that you have to slaughter all of your chickens it hurts your business. There is a lot of anger about it.However, I think the real fear from an epidemiological perspective is that a trump Administration would refuse to enforce these rules and thereby create a situation with large scale spread of bird flu within the bird population that creates a situation where a variant that can transfer to humans appears and can spread.","title":"Bird flu is getting worse.

In particular it appears that he receives royalties off of Seinfeld. His career is truly bizarre and it makes me wonder what skills he had that led to that. He grew up in a middle-class family and went to Virginia tech.   He served in the Navy for 5 years as an officer.  Then he got a master's degree in National Security studies from Georgetown through the Navy and an MBA from Harvard after leaving the navy. He works for Goldman Sachs from 1985 to 1990 and then left Goldman Sachs with others to found his own Investment Bank (Bannon and Co.) which focused on investments in television production.   One particular deal was negotiating the sale of Castle Rock entertainment to Turner Broadcasting where they accepted royalties in lieu of a traditional payment. In 1993 he became the director of the biosphere project in Arizona. Through the 1990s and early 2000s he became an executive producer of approximately 18 Hollywood movies. Given his investment banking background he was most likely the money guy.  That is, Bannon and Co. probably facilitated Wall Street funding for movies and he was named as an executive producer for his role in the project. In 2006 he persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest in a company called internet gaming entertainment (IGE) best known for selling World of Warcraft gold. He was the CEO of IGE from 2007 to 2011.   The company itself failed and was sold although Bannon allegedly developed an interest in online gaming culture as a part of this work.In 2012 he was hired to be the executive director of Breitbart News. He left in 2016 and briefly returned in 2018 before being fired by the Mercers due to his public break with trump.","title":"Steve Bannon Says Elon Musk Is the Reason Trump Won the Election"},{"text":"I'm sure these upcoming holidays my hard R leaning relatives will also say Biden was just as \\"loud\\", \\"obnoxious\\" and \\"ignorant\\", but the \\"news outlets\\" shielded him.","title":"Trumps Eruption of Rage at NYT Offers Unnerving Hint of Whats Coming"},{"text":"Less a study and more just a fact..

People usually shit on this, but theoretically, it can actually get you within 3.1% +/- with a 95% confidence interval with a population of 370,000,000 regarding the opinion of the average American. They are actually pretty accurate if you consider the results of the popular vote. You can confirm that here: https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=1&amp;cl=95&amp;ci=3.1&amp;pp=50&amp;ps=370000000&amp;x=CalculateHowever, 370,000,000 Americans do not vote as many are too young or not qualified and I am not sure how many Americans are eligible to vote, but it still may require a sample size of 1k. I think where they go wrong with external election polls and why they are usually off when it comes to election outcomes is their sampling methodology. If they correctly stratified based on party affiliation and broke it down by individual states, they could much more accurately predict elections based on electoral college outcomes and it would require a larger sample size due to the change in methodology as opposed to random sampling. However, these types of polls cost a ton of money and are usually paid for by the parties and are kept internal.I am pretty sure the Seltzer lady does this for Iowa and that is why she is taken seriously. However, I think she was paid off or something because she immediately retired because she lost all credibility.","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump ??"},{"text":"They voted for this, we'll be the ones paying for it.","title":"Bird flu is getting worse.

The main commodities affected were soybean, sorghum and pork. Farmers lost a very profitable market in China calculated at $24 billion. During the 115th and 116th Congressional Hearings in 2018 and 2019 respectively, American soybean farmers testified to rising debts, increased costs of production and declining farm incomes in the industry. In July 2019, a representative in the Committee on Small Business US Congressional Hearing discussed how the number of bankruptcies filed by farmers in 2018 was the highest in over a decade. These Congressional discussions on the economic downturns paved the way for the Family Farmer Relief Act, passed into law on August 23, 2019; the Family Farmer Relief Act gives family farmers greater protection in bankruptcy proceedings.\\"*SOURCE: https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/10/26/policies-and-politics-effects-on-us-china-soybean-trade/\\n*\\"The Trump administration gave more taxpayer dollars to farmers harmed by the administrations trade policies than the federal government spends each year building ships for the Navy or maintaining Americas nuclear arsenal, according to a new report. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis concluded the spending on farmers was also higher than the annual budgets of several government agencies. The amount of money raises questions about the strategy of imposing tariffs and permitting the use of taxpayer money to shield policymakers from the consequences of their actions, according to the analysis.\\"*SOURCE: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/01/21/trump-tariff-aid-to-farmers-cost-more-than-us-nuclear-forces/ (link to analysis posted in the article)\\n*\\"When China's retaliatory tariffs hurt US farm exports in 2018C19, Trump awarded the sector tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies.Soybeans made up roughly 60 percent of US agricultural exports to China in 2017.

The spending surge began in mid-2018 when USDA started writing checks to farmers and ranchers to pay for the damage from Trumps trade war, which brought about higher tariffs that crushed agricultural exports and commodity prices. Farm sales to China plummeted from $19.5 billion in 2017 to just $9 billion the next year; as producers continued to hemorrhage profits in 2019, farm bankruptcies jumped nearly 20 percent last year.The trade bailout has now spanned three years and surpassed $23 billion, even though it was never appropriated by Congress.

The root causes of WW1 are based in nationalism and social darwinism. A staunch social darwinist might have the best intentions - yet be the cause for great destruction. Does that make him evil? I honestly dont care. I dont think its fruitful to apply current day moral to the past. Rather, we should ask \\"why did it happen\\".So, what actually did happen?Before WW1, there was a widespread believe that not every nation would keep existing. History was seen as a struggle between people, where only the strongest would survive. This led to a struggle for global influence, and ofc Germany (but also others) participated in this struggle.For Germany specificially, there was a strong sense that they were running out of time. Seeing both of their strong neighbours France and Russia as enemies, Russian industrialization in particular was seen as a threat. While the German army planning staff was optimistic for their prospect about a future war vs. either France or Russia, they thought that soon, a combined offensive of the two could not be held back. They wanted war, as soon as possible.In 1912, von Moltke (the younger) begged the Emperor to start the war - \\"the sooner, the better\\". The same guy also pressured Austrian diplomacy to escalte the war against serbia and called for total mobilization before Russian mobilization was confirmed.In the July Crisis that would eventually lead to WW1, there were many players of which some tried to save the peace, while some called for war. The issue was - nobody was willing to step back. Russia did not want to call off mobiliziation, as they wanted to be prepared for an eventual war against Germany. Austria did not want to let Serbia off the hook, even after they had given in to most of Austrian demands. Serbia did not want to let Austrian officials lead an investigation into the assasination.But in the end, it was Germany who invaded Belgium to attack France and made the regional conflict a continent-wide war.So, while I think it is useless to judge if Germany was \\"evil\\", I still think they have a bigger responsibility for the war than any other nation.

The guitar is a really interesting one, because the guitar market has such a wide variety of options at virtually every price point imaginable.Theyre charging $1.5k on a guitar, where market suggests a sub $300 price point or sub $500 accounting for the collectability aspect. The guitar has a bolt on neck and metric hardware, placing the build of the actual guitar possibly in Asia. Before everyone jumps into China conclusion, which is indeed plausible, other Asian countries like Indonesia, South Korea and lately India as well have also built a reputation for striking a good balance between price and quality. Epiphone, which is owned by Gibson, more on that later, makes a guitar of similar construction for under $300 MSRP. To account for collectability status, squire, owned by Fender, made a limited run of Hello Kitty guitars, which sold out in one single day. Those will put you back $500 ($499 to be exact) MSRP. Basically MAGA guitar is roughly a $500 with an added $1k, and thats not even taking into account the $10k ones that are the same guitars are the $1.5k, but signed personally by Trump.A little pedantic observation is that its not a counterfeit guitar, but a Les Paul style guitar that got too close for comfort and received a cease a desist letter by Gibson due to Trademark infringement. Trademark is really interesting because the company who owns the trademark has to actively defense it otherwise they lose it. The MAGA electric guitars are shaped a lot like Gibsons Les Paul, Id argue both the body and headstock shapes. Thus Gibson sent a cease and desist letter to protect their trademark. Whats interesting about this is that other manufacturers who build guitars with a similar shape deviate from the Gibson Les Paul just enough to not warrant a trademark cease and desist letter. MAGA guitars just didnt do enough to deviate from Gibsons guitar shape.Lastly, when asked where the guitars were being made, clearly abroad, they are being vague. The guitar contains a huge screen print on the body eagle and flag. That screen print is applied in the US, which I surmise is what allows them to be vague about where the guitars are being made. For context, youre usually able to find out the exact factory guitars are being made from other manufacturers.","title":"Gibson Hits Trump Guitars With Cease and Desist"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|dsuI4YRvjPqASKWKAq|downsized)","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump ??"},{"text":"I just read about his beef with the F-35 and it is laughable that it is so delusional.","title":"Trump tariffs: President-elect is serious but it's not about trade"},{"text":"I'm not even sure he's going to live until the end of the next 4 years...

In that sense, illegal immigrants really just aren't criminals, because they overwhelmingly don't tend to commit crimes once the initial illegal entry/overstay crime is out of the way.It's probable she was trying to correct people who were referring to illegal immigrants in the 'burgler/murderer/fraudster' sense of criminal (as they would be doing so wrongly), followed by them immediately hiding behind 'well technically they're all criminals because illegal immigration is a crime'.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":" The goal is to ensure that the new administration is ready to take over on Jan. 20.They will be.

Germany at the time were quite nationalistic, but the socialist democrats were also making gains. The socialist democrats were critical of the Kaiser and anti-royal sentiments were growing. In private the German hierarchy thought the war would entrench nationalism and kill any gains the socialist democrats had made, they also thought it would galvanise public support for the Kaiser. The reason Germany were viewed as evil, and the reason there were harsh punishments put in place at the end of the war were due to a few things. 1. They invaded Belgium. Thanks to the Treaty of London, Belgium had been internationally recognised as neutral for nearly 100 years. Invading a neutral country is as close to state terrorism that currently exists, I can't really put into words how badly viewed that is. It also dragged Britain into the war that cost a million lives. 2. Rape of Belgium, as the name suggests (official name btw), they did a lot of damage in Belgium. It is a series of war crimes committed by Germany in WW1 which included the mass murder of 24,000 Belgians, 35,000 injured and a further 120,000 people who were mass deported from Belgium and either used as forced labour or forced into military action for Germany where they were mostly used as cannon fodder. They destroyed industrial buildings creating 600,000 unemployed people, they sacked and looted cities, destroyed 25,000 homes and put up an electrified fence near the boarder with the Netherlands which killed another 3000 people who were trying to flee. They also denied the population of its basic needs including food and water. 3. Sham trials and mass executions, in both Belgium and France they would march into towns/cities, accuse people of harbouring fugitives or helping resistance efforts and with either no trial, or a sham trial, prisoners would be executed. A lot of the actions of the Germans in WW1 were kind of a practice run for WW2. Aside from the literal industrial death complexes, everything else was there. Mass murder, mass executions, internment, forced labour etc. You name it, aside from Bergen-Belsen/Auschwitz, there was a lot that was incredibly similar.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_Alliance_(1879)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Crisis","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"You say this cringe because you have nothing to say/cant refute the facts.

Germany's plan for the war - the Schlieffen Plan - was based on the assumption that Russia is slow to mobilize and Germany can defeat France before facing Russia. So if Russia starts to mobilize, you have to go to war or you already lost the war. Germany was in a constraint to strike first because of its geography and because of the unfortunate alliance system.Germany was not more or less evil than Russia, Austria or France.

Both of which are huge advantages especially in the last decade. If he can't overcome whatever the DNC is supposedly doing against him, I don't have any hope he would do much better in general election than any generic Democrat. The last three elections were pretty tight, so it is entirely possible he could have won them but it is also entirely plausible that he wouldn't have done much better. It also would not have radically changed downballot races or have any significant impact on the political landscape. I think Progressives are just as delusional about who American voters actually are.","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"To be fair he promised everything, lied and Elons PAC spread so many lies and deceptive content.

I think the major things the Democratic party mismanaged were 1.) Biden deciding to run again (he should have said he would not run again as far back as after the midterms in 2022) and 2.) Bidens political advisors not ringing the alarm when they saw he was not going to be able to present himself as someone capable of running for president. Even using up the month of time they had between the debate with Trump and when he officially dropped out took too long. Had he dropped out sooner, the party could have had a more proper primary process and whether Harris won it or not, the winning candidate would have gathered useful information about the kind of message that would resonate with voters this year and had more time to introduce themself to the nation.That said, I think ultimately the Harris campaign had a tremendously tall mountain to climb given the worldwide anti-incumbent political climate (every incumbent party in a country with a major economy has lost re-election since 2022; the first time this has happened since 1905). And in fact, they almost did climb it; they closed a lot of the gap Trump had over Biden with the 107 days they had. Its an unpopular opinion, but once Harris took over, I actually dont think her campaign did a terrible job. Even though they lost all the swing states, the swing to the right seen nationally and across nearly all demographics was actually smallest in swing states where the campaign was most active, showing that their strategy did have some effect, but just not enough to actually win. We also dont even nearly have the full picture of what happened this election. It has been less than a month and no full reliable report on voter turnout will be available for months. It very well could be the case that no Democrat was ever going to win this election due to the national/worldwide desire for change sparked by covid-related inflation. I personally believe that the election was winnable because Trump actually was a pretty weak candidate, but Biden dropping out of the election at such a late point in time forced the party into running with Harris and it forced the Harris campaign into a position where they had no time to test strategies and messages to see what would work. They had to do the best they could with the data they had and they never should have been in that situation. And they still only lost narrowly.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing","title":"Did Merrick Garland blow it?

I don't think it's a misconception based on who pays the tariffs that led him to post that. Yes, countries like China will export, US companies will pay the tariffs, and consumers will pay the additional cost of those tariffs. Ceteris paribus, consumers get the short end of the stick, the companies maintain equal profits, exporters maintain equal exports, and consumers are essentially paying the cost of the tariff to the government as a consumption tax. But all things are not equal. These pieces will shift and adjust accordingly. Cuban is right - tariffs DO affect exporters, that's usually a notable aspect of why they're implemented. That's also why countries start trade wars over tariffs. If they were unaffected, they wouldn't start a trade war. (However, I'm don't fully buy that these countries will give the US anything to ease the tariffs, esp if their response is a trade war - perhaps Trump will stop the tariffs bc they're hurting the US, but he'll spin it as a win anyway).But in general, you can look at how the different stakeholders are going to respond - affecting supply/demand/prices accordingly.**Consumers:**Higher prices - Less consumption/demandLess consumption is something the companies will consider. Their profit per consumer will remain stagnant if they pass on the same % of the tariffs, so they might increase prices beyond the additional cost from the tariffs to make up for that, or they might tank a minor in profit-per-consumer to reduce the decrease in demand based on the price increase.Obv the major drawback for consumers here is higher prices**Companies:**On the consumer side, they'll need to consider the fact that raising the prices proportionally to the tariffs are going to reduce demand. They'll definitely take a loss to profits bc of the tariffs IF they But tariffs act as a protectionist policy. The idea is to drive companies toward local manufacturing/producing locally. Obviously this is kind of stupid in a case where goods can't be produced/manufactured locally, but companies will likely find other sources of supply, esp locally, IF POSSIBLE to minimise how much they lose to the tariffs. Alternatively, they can find other countries to import from (which likely will be more expensive than their original exporters, if these countries can even meet the demand).Yes, the companies will continue to try to maximise profits, but they'll struggle to so if they increase prices and consumers reduce consumption (mainly for non-essential goods), so they'll likely find other ways to obtain their goods - i.e. reduce exports from China/Mexico/CanadaAlso, I'm not saying these alternate sources will allow companies to keep the prices the same. They'll definitely be charging more for goods, **especially** in the short term.**Exporters/other countries:**Bc they recognise how companies are going to seek alternate sources of imports, or shift manufacturing/production locally where possible, they'll need to adapt accordingly.They 100% will not be receiving the same amount of demand as compared to w/o the tariffs. If consumer prices go up, consumer demand goes down, and companies start to import less from the exporters bc existing supply starts to exceed the new demand.Less demand =  Less exports = Less profit. Obv exporters aren't going to like this, esp if these companies start to make major shifts towards other exporters or local production. They will respond accordingly. THIS is how exporters are affected by tariffs. They don't pay them directly, but they're affected by the reduced demand.Some optimists/conservatives believe this may result in exporters reducing prices to stay competitive with other exporters. That's definitely... one potential outcome. It makes sense if you look at it in a vacuum - exporters (based on a supply-demand model) might say \\"ok, if i reduce prices, i can bring demand back up. then while i get less profit per equivalent volume of export, i still make overall more profit than i otherwise would if demand drops and i have nobody to export to\\". The hope is that this is how tariffs would be offloaded to exporters - if they reduce their export prices accordingly, companies are able to keep selling goods at the same price, so the exporters are effectively paying the tariffs instead.Obv that's not how it works also. Most likely these countries will respond aggressively - instituting trade wars, taking proactive steps etc. - or maybe they have such a stranglehold on that specific export to the US that companies have no option but to continue importing from them. When the government starts bailing out US exporters bc of tariffs introduced on them by other countries, that's when shit starts to get really fucked.\\nTL;DR: The direct effect of tariffs ppl talk abt here always focuses on how tariffs are offloaded onto consumers by companies. But tariffs ultimately have a broader effect. Tariffs have a justification in driving companies toward local/alternative production and put pressure on exporters to reduce prices or lose access to the US market. While an oversimplification, tariffs will not just affect consumers. Companies will be driven to find other means of getting the same goods at lower prices if possible, and exporters will respond to the lower demand - either by lowering prices (unlikely) to stay competitive, or by instituting trade wars for example.","title":"Trump will take the earliest excuse to drop the tariff talk, and then the cult will say 'the threat worked'"},{"text":"counterpoint: blue states won't cooperate and might even actively resist.

Again. Back then, we had a lot of empires and wannabe empires. And then we had the mess thats the German bund which eventually evolved into the Kaiserreich. Germans at that time wanted first a unified identity, which they hadnt had for hundreds of years. And being a people so fragmented it doesnt even really deserve the name, historically speaking, they never had much of a chance to take part in that times world politics. Which basically just meant to conquer everything. To make a convoluted complex situation simple: Germans wanted to catch up. They wanted what everyone else already had. But they were hindered by their own lack of cohesion. Which eventually led to 1849/50. Fast forward a very few years. And it IS but a few- people didnt need history lessons, they REMEMBERED their history or were taught it by their parents who did live it. Of course they tried to grasp the bull by its horns. Just like everyone else would, just like everyone else DID when offered the opportunity. Did it bite them in the ass? You bet. Did they do questionable things? Also yes. Were they innocent ? THATS a far too loaded question; they did as they should, as in, they acted in their own best interest  which was defined by a person rather than its people as a whole. Weimar Republic began AFTER the war, and it was held responsible; legitimately, sure, but strictly speaking were condemning the successor for the mistakes of their predecessor. And lets not forget, Nazi success was not intrinsic either. It was enabled by the allied forces which intended to see Germany BLEED. To the extent that experts at the time (correctly) predicted this would bite them on their collective butts. \\nWars at the time were common. There is a REASON ww1 then was considered the end of all wars. That, once and for all, there would be less armed conflict between Europeans. And thats because Europeans at that point had, for as long as they could remember, been in conflict with someone or another. That thing we call peace? It didnt exist. \\nSo its easy to sit on our collective bums and cry responsibility; but the truth is, everyone HAD to passively- and actively pay attention to their continued existence.

A true primary was out of the question. Even a mini-primary would have taken up precious time, likely damaged whatever candidate would come out on top, and if it was anyone other than Kamala, they would have lost the millions in campaign funds that they had already accrued. Biden choosing to run again likely killed whatever chance the Dems had. It's truly insane this country chose Trump after COVID, Jan 6th, the classified documents case, and his fraud convictions, but there was no real option other than Kamala after Biden chose to run again","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"Kamara talked about nothing but policies while on debates and campaigning. The fact you \\"can't remember\\" or dont care shows you couldn't listen past the color of her skin or the sex in her pants. Not only did she talk policies, but she also gave very realistic ways to achieve them. Meanwhile, Mr. Sweet potatoe toupee bandit wanted to do nothing other than ramble on about crazy shit. The hatians eating cats and dogs? \\"You'll be begging you dont want any more electricity\\"? \\"I love the uneducated?\\" The only reason what this dude says is so \\"memorable\\" is because it's the raving idiocy of a mad man. If trump wasn't who he was, and he didn't have as large of an illusion of money as he's got, he'd be in a nursing home somewhere. He's only memorable because he's deranged, and there are actually people who consciously voted for him. There are people among us who appear to be intelligent enough to carry jobs, mortgages/rent, and can drive that are among us, but are so slow that even with things like tariffs spelled out for them they still dont get it. Also, We are voting for the person who supports the policies we supportSo, you support mass deportation? If you do, did you know that illegal immigrants pay about 96 billion in taxes yearly but never see a dime of that back with tax returns or social security? When trump rounds up illegals like cattle and our society goes to shit and the social security officially runs out in 4 years, the loss of 96 billion in taxes because the illegal immigrants were persecuted is why. So, you also support the deconstruction of obamacare? Well, that's the affordable care act, buddy.. so when your gran no longer gets her social security or medicide insurance, just remember, you voted to support the policies our president supports. You voted to end that.So, you support the turning of reproductive care over to the states? By doing this not only did you codify the fact that many women will die, but you also made it possible for things like IVF, birth control, and care for things like stis to go right out the window. states are already coming after those things. Flordia and Texas are trying to end access to ivf. So all those embryos waiting for transplantation are just sitting there while families try frantically to get their embryos moved out of state for a safer chance at actually getting to use them. Texas and I believe Alabama is trying to limit or all out stop the access to things like birth control (pills, patches, IUD, nexplanon, and depo shot being the common methods.) They also have made it where doctors second guess themselves and thier care, so treatment for stis are about to end. So, you also support higher tariffs on products coming from other countries like China, Canada, and Mexico? First, let me ask, do you know what a tariff is and who has to pay that? If you dont, please go google it. Google is free. That being said, trump wants to implement higher tariffs. I dont know if you've seen the news or not, but companies like Walmart, Target, kroger (smiths), GMC, Chevrolet, and so many more have released statements about how they will be RAISING prices in response to trumps supposed tariffs. Now let me ask, do you know where the stuff around your home comes from? Obviously, you don't. Let me just break a few down for you. We get almost all our produce (fruits and vegetables) from Canada and Mexico. So those $1.50 tomatoes or $0.55/lb bananas you get? Yeah, have fun looking at $3 tomatoes and $1.55/lb bananas. Our oil? We get 52% of that from Canada, not Iraq. Textiles? Mostly Mexico and China. Car parts, medical supplies, home good items? All China. So, while you're complaining about $600/month in groceries, $60 oil change, and $2.69/gallon of gas. Just know it's about to be $1000/month in groceries, $100 minimum oil change, and $6/gallon of gas. And you voted for that. These are a few of the things trump plans to do or has done. This doesn't even scratch the surface of things trump plans to do. Dont even get me started on his cabinet picks and how he plans to run this country. Kamala had a clear, loud voice. Trump just happened to be louder and spoke directly to the uneducated or undereducated. Unfortunately, they happen to be a large majority in this country.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"To really bring the point home, the letters left in the line, (K O R B) are easily associated with the favorite line of Winston Churchill when completing a call with the American President Roosevelt when speaking on the War.

Even if not the best candidate, she made the effort. Heres my take: no other Democrat candidate (including men young and old) could have won the elections. It was an unbalanced race between the voter  groups: while the Trumpist crowd stood behind Trump under all circumstances, democrats had weakness inside their camp. Regardless of what Trump said and did his supporters never criticized him. Not a word. When I asked how can you support someone who does X or Y, they preferred not responding and detached themselves from the conversation. In contrast, democrats were always eager to find faults (and problems)  with their candidate. It started with Biden being hammered not by republicans, but by his friends inside the party. It took the form of  an avalanche: which party insider will be more critical: We need a younger candidate. Why old white men are always elected? A younger woman of color who appeals to women and minorities will seal the deal. So were insiders and media commentators telling voters day and night. (At the same time no Republican criticized Trump in any way). But the self bashing continued even after the woman of color replaced Biden. Nobody can win such race when insiders are the worst critics. When the candidate (any candidate) is put under the magnifying glass to see whats wrong with them. At 78 Trump is old. Nobody from inside the Republican party dared saying that a man at such age shouldnt run for president. Only Biden is old. After all even his peers are saying so.The a group of young voters came with a brilliant idea: I will not vote for Harris since there is no difference between the two partiesI didnt hear even once a Republican claiming there is no difference between Trump and Kamala Harris.

There are different indices that you can measure but consumer price index (CPI) is the usual one being cited when people are talking about inflation in everyday economics or politics.  It simply adds up the prices of a predetermined basket of goods and compares them to what that same basket of goods cost at previous times.  Even if some things go up and others go down the total basket might cost the same so just the price of eggs going up wouldnt mean there was inflation if the price of other things went down proportionally.Some versions like core price index will exclude certain things like oil/gas from the basket (theyre in normal CPI) because theyre volatile commodities that can move on their own despite overall trends in other things.So, inflation can be from increasing the money supply, like youre saying, but also from supply chain shocks, demand spikes, tariffs, low unemployment driving wages up, regulations, collusion between competing firms, or anything that makes the general prices of things go up.Youre thinking of currency devaluation, which is a part of but not exclusively the cause of inflation.  Print a bunch of money and the moneys worth less.  This was even more of an issue when countries were on the gold standard (or other physical store of value) that the money represented.  In the US, the treasury is in charge of this.That still affects modern markets but the money supply consists of a lot more than physical dollars.  Due to reserve ratios, checkable deposits, and debt instruments theres a lot of lent money that doesnt actually physically exist anywhere but is nonetheless part of the money supply.The Fed, FDIC, and office of the comptroller can all influence this to expand or contract how big the theoretical money supply is.  Some of our recent inflation was due to the Fed.But the money supply ALSO includes government debt instruments like T-bills.  When the US deficit spends, it issues these in exchange for currency and both the new debt and the money paid for it are now part of the money supply.Congress is in charge of that but Presidents have been messing around with it more and more by redirecting funds from one thing to another using emergency powers and then congress has to issue more debt to pay for what the money was SUPPOSED to be for in the first place.Tariffs can lead to increases that, too.  The government buys a lot of stuff.  If there are tariffs on that stuff and they have to buy it anyway, thats higher prices - more deficit spending - more government bonds - bigger money supply - currency devaluation (your original concern) - inflation.Ideally, a tariff would cause you to buy from a domestic firm rather than a foreign one but even if they can meet the new demand the domestic price must be higher than the old foreign price or youd have been buying domestic already without the tariff.Can also happen due to counter-tariffs, like we saw with China vs. US soybean farmers.  Now you have to prop them up with subsidies paid for by deficit spending (same chain as above) ending in inflation.Now, if the extra tax revenues you received from the tariffs exceeded the extra debt youd have to issue to ameliorate their effects, it would avoid all that.  Spoiler:  it virtually never does and theres generally a (usually small) net loss of GDP, stock market performance, and jobs, with an increase in CPI (inflation) and deficit spending.Is it worth it?  Maybe, if your goal is protecting certain domestic industries.  If were all willing to pitch in a tiny amount to support something like US electric vehicle production (one of the foreign industries the Trump/Biden tariffs targeted) there can be a case to make for it.But it WILL lead to inflation by any definition.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Continually sad to see how much of our government and society run on \\"good faith\\" that in general no longer exists and can disappear in an instant.","title":"Trump Team Signs Transition Agreement but Shuns F.B.I.

The Kaiser gave Austria Hungary a blank cheque of support for offensive action against Russia. That went significantly beyond their basic responsibilities as an ally, and perpetuated the escalation of an otherwise-insignificant region crisis into a world war. Even if we said that was warranted however, none of that justifies Germany's unprovoked invasion of democratic neutral nations like Belgium whom they had sworn to protect in the treaty of London. Being at war with one country does not allow you to throw out all of international law for the sake of tactical convenience.Even if it did, nothing justifies the systemic atrocities committed by the German army against civilian populations in that invasion. The Rape of Belgium is not simply a unfortunate case of a few localised units losing discipline in getting out of hand, bad as that would be. Rather, the use of collective punishment, indiscriminate reprisals, rape as a weapon of war, mass hostage taking, looting, pillaging, and razing of unresistant cities, destruction of heritage artifacts, summary arrest and execution of anticipated 'troublemakers', etc were all officially sanctioned, orchestrated, and part of established German doctrine. Indiscriminate terror against civilians to prevent resistance was not merely tolerated, but expected.This was a clear violation of the most basic laws of war, but as with international law and their treaty obligations, Germany saw these as just more 'scraps of paper' which had no meaning, and couldn't see why everyone else was so fussed about them.Importantly, this is not a case of the war in general being terrible for humanity. Particularly on the Western front this behavior was entirely without comparison or equivalent on the allied side. The disdain and disregard for morals and laws was unique to Germany on the western front.It also established a pattern of lawbreaking that would persist throughout the conflict. Be it the initial use of poison gas, unrestricted submarine warfare against cruiser rules, or the execution of British POWs, the laws of war were things that only applied to other people.","title":"CMV: Germany wasn't evil in WW1"},{"text":"Florida does deserve him","title":"Matt Gaetz is now hinting that he plans to run to succeed Ron DeSantis as Florida's governor"},{"text":"I so desperately hope youre right.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"Doesn't excuse anyone is a position of responsibility from exercising that responsibility.","title":"Did Merrick Garland blow it?

Serbia. Pan-Slavic nationalists from independent Serbia believed that assassinating Ferdinand would provoke an uprising in Croatia and Bosnia against Austria-Hungary (similar to Serbia's uprising that led to its independence from the Ottomans). That, of course, did not happen. When Croatia and Bosnia didn't revolt against the Hapsburgs, Serbia pled for military aid from Russia as a fellow Slavic nation, which led to the cascade of defensive pacts drawing the whole of Europe into a war. Serbia could *still* have avoided the whole conflict if they had just handed Princip over to Austria-Hungary (and probably made some concessions for assassinating the *crown prince*).2. Kaiser Wilhelm II. Wilhelm II was a largely incompetent ruler that wanted Germany to rapidly expand, to \\"enlarge Germany's place in the sun.\\" In 1890 he dismissed Otto von Bismarck (who was the person *responsible* for the tangled web of alliances that held the European powers in check, and probably the only person who could navigate them), and rapidly embarked on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" meant to solidify Germany as a superpower.

He is benefitting off of a cynicism about truth in politics that allows him to evade accountability for his actions, or even justifying what he says. His overarching proposition to the public, in a few words, is that he is going to bring America back to the golden age by turning back the clock on globalization.

It is not however a complete picture of what inflation is, more is it the only cause. Far more commonly, inflation is caused by increasing prices. Tariffs will raise the price of consumer goods in America, by definition, raising inflation. \\nCertainly, an economy that starts booming would cause inflation. Is that the argument as to how tariffs will cause inflation?No. **Simply put, there are products that cannot be produced in America as cost effectively as they can be in other parts of the world.**America has worker and environmental protection laws that prevent extreme cost savings measures. America lacks the climate for some agricultural products, and the infrastructure for the manufacture of some products. Even for things that can grow in American climates, scaling up agriculture production of specific crops takes decades. Similarly, America CAN build more factories, scrap worker protections and environmental regulations in order to produce items more cost effectively, but again, such a transition takes years to decades to construct the facilities, acquisition and distribution networks and secure material suppliers. \\nIn the years and decades while these industries are being rebuilt in America, consumer demand remains high, but local supplies are low, forcing the American people to pay more to maintain the same quality of life, as imported goods are now more expensive. \\nAdd to that the uncertainty from an investor standpoint. Imagine you are considering investing in American manufacturing, as the tariffs will increase prices, you could make a solid return by being one of the earliest competitors on the market. But, do you take that risk? In 4 years, the Democrats have a good chance of winning the election, removing the tariffs, and now you are stuck with the bill from building a manufacturing plant that is now unable to compete with the old, tarrif free prices! **It's a huge risk to invest, since removing the tarrifs will like be a platform democrats will run on**. TLDR, it's a double whammy. Inflation is more than just the increased money supply, and if the tariffs are implemented, it will cause substantial price increases while America until local production and manufacturing can catch up.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"What's so amazing; given a fixed money supply prices are still determined by supply and demand.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Im tired.. so tired","title":"Trump Has Late-Night Meltdown Over New York Times Story on Close Aide - Donald Trump is fuming after a New York Times story on his relationship with Natalie Harp, his 33-year-old personal aide."},{"text":"The personality problem is a symptom of the underlying nihilism, lack of confidence, and influence of wealthy donors.

But if everyone is only spending $1 a day, everyone is only making $1 a day as well, so prices have to be lower, even though there is exactly the same amount of money in the economy, it just isn't moving around that much.

Now that this is established lets consider how this could raise the prices of any given good.\\nA singular product like say steel would have x% tariff on it from its country of origin. Lets say the us company builders inc imported steel from elsewhere before the tariff would raise their costs by that x%, US suppliers could undercut that amount by some lesser percentage (x-competitive market)% to incentivize this building company to buy US steel but that new percentage increase in cost would be passed off to consumers anyways so thats strike one.The example above has a bunch of assumptions built in and is very crude in the business product development cycle for now common multinational companies. One example is that the US could match foreign production for the respective imports like Steel but what about other goods. Strike twoAlongside these supply chains products can weirdly go back and forth between multiple different countries factories because there is no real all in one manufacturing hubs for most goods that involve microchips nowadays so if that is the case you could see the tariff effect happen multiple times in the production process. Strike threeLastly tariffs do not exist in a vacuum countries impacted are not going to take it lightly and will enact policies against the US which will causes general global prices to rise since the US and China are the two biggest economies in the world.\\nNow your out","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Oh my god, what is happening to this place?

A moral statement is along the lines of \\"10,000 people entering the US illegally, in a fully uncontrolled manner is a national security risk, Americans overwhelmingly oppose it, and as President, I'm going to shut it down and keep Americans safe by doing X, Y, Z.\\"First, what does that have to do with morals? Second, what people enter \\"in a fully uncontrolled manner?\\" MOST people either overstay a visa or are asylum-seekers. She's going to \\"shut it down\\"?

As president I won't tolerate criminals, and we will deport them in a heartbeat. But for those seeking opportunity, whose only desire is to contribute to this great country, Or for those who are escaping great peril, we have to have a find a safe and legal path.\\"You mean like....\\"I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane,\\" Harris said. \\"We can and we must do both.\\"Harris pledged to bar undocumented border crossers from receiving asylum, as well as a promise to arrest, deport and impose a five-year ban on migrants who have crossed \\"between ports of entry.\\"\\n...\\n\\"The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously,\\" Harris said. \\"We are also a nation of immigrants  we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane.

It is language that I think people have rightly found similar to the language of Hitler. And I think its just critically important that we remind each other, including our children, that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based not on who they beat down, but who they lift up.Or It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler  the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews, and hundreds of thousands of Americans,\\" Harris said  ...\\"Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable\\"So when she said what you imagine, somehow, she didn't, that's....?You maybe want to look up the word moral.","title":"CMV: The Democratic party is being heavily mismanaged and it needs a strong leader"},{"text":"The weirdest part of that story was the massive bot army, all posting a thank you to Biden, using virtually identical phrasing about how they intended to use the money.

Kids in poorer households neither had the tech nor the space at home to be taught remotely. I worked education-adjacent at the time and things were BAD.The secondary effects of that time are still felt here. The COVID-generation of pupils is behind non-pandemic pupils in every academic metric. Also, and I think this is arguably worse, those kids have lost 1-2 years of proper socializing and while they might have more or less recuperated in that department, its effects are still obvious, i.e. in happiness surveys. We massively fucked over the younger generations globally in favor of keeping the elderly alive and keeping the work force healthy. As always with these things, \\neconomically unfortunate people were affected MUCH harder by this.I understand why it was done that way and dont agree with OP that the value of these measures were questionable. Also I didnt have a better solution at the time and dont have a better solution in hindsight either. It was very painful but I think it was the right call, all things considered. But looking at the effects of COVID measures on young people is a very good way to see secondary effects of COVID response and I think we shouldnt turn a blind eye to that","title":"Trump names COVID lockdown critic Dr. Jay Bhattacharya as pick for NIH director"},{"text":"So you need to do some easy math.Add tariffs to only products coming from outside US mostly.Subtract the % of corporate tax cuts and subtract the time won by deregulationNow subtract energy pricesNow add the tax cuts from tax/overtime/social pay for individuals and families.What do you get?\\n1) American Products become more affordable\\n2) Imported goods prices will be competitive to American Products\\n3) Corporate Expenses drop, meaning?

Monetary expansion happens when central banks or financial institutions create new moneysuch as through quantitative easing, lower interest rates, or increased lending. This increases the money available in the economy, potentially leading to demand outpacing supply, which pushes prices up.But inflation isnt always about money supply. Tariffs can cause cost-push inflation, where prices rise due to higher production costs rather than increased demand. Here's how this works: Tariffs are a tax on imports, so when goods like steel, semiconductors, or machinery become more expensive, domestic producers pay more for these inputs. Those higher costs are passed on to consumers through higher prices for finished products, like cars or appliances. Unlike monetary expansion, cost-push inflation doesnt require more money circulatingits driven by supply-side pressures.Tariffs also disrupt comparative advantage, which keeps trade efficient. For example, instead of importing cheaper goods from abroad, tariffs incentivize domestic production in sectors where the U.S. might be less efficient. This means higher production costs, reduced competition, and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Retaliatory tariffs and disrupted global supply chains add to the problem, creating shortages and further inflating prices. So easy econ 101, less supply + similar demand = inflation.Finally, while you suggest tariffs might lead to a domestic economic boom and inflation through loan creation, the reality is different. Higher costs from tariffs reduce disposable income and profit margins, slowing growth rather than increasing demand. Inflation driven by tariffs isnt about monetary expansionits about inefficiencies, higher costs, and supply chain disruptions that make goods more expensive across the board.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Thats the critique of this take.

Inflation is the general rise of prices across an economy. To see this clearly, think about a concept known as the \\"velocity\\" of money. The same one dollar bill could be spent once a year or once a day. Even with a small money supply, a very high velocity of money could sustain higher prices than an economy with a low velocity of money, because (with the range money supply) there is more money moving around. Additionally, there is a concept called the \\"dead weight loss\\" of taxes. In general, as prices go up for a product, fewer people will buy the product. And as prices go down, fewer will be produced. The point where these meet is an \\"equilibrium\\" and the economy will produce as many as will be consumed at the optimal price. When you add a tax, the price to the consumer goes up (or the price received by the company goes down, or both, the outcome is the same in any case). This means that fewer people will buy that thing, and it means that fewer companies will produce it. And together there will be fewer sales of that good and they will happen at a higher price. So, regardless of what you call it, taxes and tariffs on goods do, necessarily, raise the price (and lower the availability) of the good. When people see rising prices they (correctly) call it inflation, but regardless of what you call it, prices do rise. But like I said, you should call it inflation because money supply and inflation are distinct things. While often connected, they are distinct concepts that are useful to keep separated.","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"Yes","title":"Which Donald Trump Presidential Debate is your favorite?"},{"text":" Inflation is simply the expansion of the money supplyCould you not also say that inflation is the reduction of the demand for a given unit of money?Imported widget costs $1I have an imported widget which I will exchange for $125% tariffImported widget now costs $1.25I no longer want $1 enough to exchange my widget for itThe tariff has reduced the money demand","title":"CMV: Tarrifs and taxes are not inflationary."},{"text":"He's not a great orator in the sense that his words make sense when strung together.

We aren't voting for the morally superior candidate. We are voting for the person who supports the policies we support, and if you can't clearly define them, then what are we voting for?Political parties do not select candidates for you, the voter. Political parties select candidates for itself, the institution. The democratic party purposely selects (not elects) candidates specifically for their lack of policies and lack of convictions, because the candidate's purpose is to be an empty sock puppet.Do you really think Biden has been running anything? He's just there to read a teleprompter and take the blame when things go bad. He's not making decisions, and neither would Harris. Such a role cannot be filled by someone with conviction because it would invite conflict and betrayal. Therefore policy is not only irrelevant, but detrimental. Because policy is a promise that can bite them next election.So yes, the democratic party is mismanaged.

He hasn't gone anywhere, he just can't run again. But do you remember who ran before him? Probably not, because John Kerry wasn't a particularly amazing orator. Or Al Gore? He was not a particularly rousing politician either. You have to go back to JFK for your next examplealthough I thought Bill Clinton was quite a charismatic politician. It's not so much that there's a dearth of interesting and engaging politicians on the leftjust as there wasn't when Kerry and Gore ranit's more that things have to line up juuuuuuust right for any one person to make it to the top of the ticket. And only one person can. And another shot doesn't come around for 4 years. So if circumstances don't line up perfectly, as they haven't in several of the last campaigns, it could be for so many other reasons. Things like there's an incumbent running (as was the case with this year's election until he dropped out), or one of their opponents has insanely high name recognition and is a well-known quantity (like Hillary Clinton in 2016), or perhaps people are just feeling like everything is too out of control and they long for something safe and familiar (which is what many believe was the overwhelming reason Democrats backed Biden in 2020). Ironically, had Biden dropped out of the 2024 race much earlier, there might have been a robust primary contest that would have tested Harris against otherssomething that would have informed people early if she had improved as a potential candidate since her previous attempt. Since that didn't happen, no other potential candidates even had a chance to take their shot this time. The good newsif there is good news in this situationis that for the next election, Democrats have no incumbent and no one with huge name recognition who's been waiting around to get his or her chance (although one could make the argument that Bernie Sanders fits that description, but I'd doubt very much he'd win the primaries due to his age). So the next election cycle might give us the chance to see some young, fresh, charismatic and articulate people step up.

I think the only thing that's going to prevent a coup in this country in the next 12 years is a mass movement on the left as an answer to the crypto-fascists on the right. Because all they need is a good 10-20% of the population + police and military firmly on their side to take power.TL;DR building out a movement is equally if not more important than finding the right candidate.

That includes adding all the electronics and computers past fighters didn't have or had to be added down the road.Some of those electronics will be dedicated to so called \\"loyal wingman\\" drones that will be de0lpyed alongside the F-35s. The F-35s massive array of sensors, radars, EW jammers, and communications gear means that the plane can support and integrate into nearly every other modern weapon, from aiding ground troops and air defense to other squadrons of older aircraft. No doubt some day that will be aiding *newer* aircraft dedicated to air superiority or to specialized missions. F-35s requirements also meant the plane had tk be capable of deploying from \\"austere\\" environments, such as highways in Scandinavia or desert runways, and the F-35B that gave stealth strike capability to nations who only had helicopter carriers or ski-jump decks. Its not like B-2s that need an air conditioned hangar.You would be hard pressed to get all that capability in a drone or even families of drones. Sure your drone can take on G-forces higher than a pilot, but those G-forces still stress the airframe. You can place a computer to run a number of autonomous decisions, such as handling jammers, but the distance between the ground base and the mission means there is lag between the airplane and the airspace. And at least one constant comms channel...reducing your stealth, reducing your reaction time. Finally, there is quantity and cost. Yes, F-35s are expensive but it fulfills a number of missions. The theory was to replace A-10s, Hornets, Harriers, F-16s and F-15s, in part or entirely. Thats a lot fewer products lines, factories, designs, training infrastructure, parts, etc you have to pay for than if you maintained that airframe diversity in the fleet.","title":"Matt Gaetz doesn't like the F-35 platform because it turns 18 in December 2024"},{"text":"There is literally nothing to say we cant.My top 10 most likely:1.

The election was close, and Kamala was slipping in spite of the dishonest public polls, and they changed course, and that's when she started doing interviews.
