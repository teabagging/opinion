And they deserve to know the federal judiciary has the bandwidth to carefully and thoroughly consider their cases.McConnell has led Republican efforts in the past to block Democratic nominees for existing court vacancies, including the blockade of President Barack Obamas 2016 Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. The White Houses announcement on Tuesday noted that some of the new openings the JUDGES Act would create were in states where senators have sought to hold open existing judicial vacancies.Those efforts to hold open vacancies suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now, the White House said.Lawmakers may try to get the bill passed in the new Congress, but getting Democratic support may require delaying the first allocation of new judges until 2029, when White House control will be unknown.\\"","title":"Biden says hell veto bill that would let Trump nominate more judges"},{"text":"Motherfuka needs to free and pardon LUIGI!https://preview.redd.it/tq9bmjin196e1.jpeg?width=656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d150bd40f39ae81516896d604e6acca20ac1caa1","title":"Biden Says He Regrets Not Signing Name to Covid Checks Like Trump Did"},{"text":"There never was an Epstein list - it's all a distraction.?","title":"Why do we have so much info on Luigi Mangione, and so little info on the 3 people who tried to kill the president?"},{"text":"Distracted?Health insurance affects every single American family, especially those with children and elderly relatives.I couldn't care less what people in Israel do or how many guys in dresses shit next to me if my children and parents are in actual danger.","title":"The Assassination of Brian Thompson - A Compilation of some facts, and 4 possible theories I have on what's really going on"},{"text":"This concept of a mandate is so exclusively american and so stupid.

Darrell Issa, the California Republican who spearheaded the legislation, said Tuesday that the legislation was a durable solution to a national judge shortage and was the product of the the work of a national array of stakeholders over a number of years, ultimately earning the support of a unanimous Senate and a strong bipartisan majority in the House.Enter your email to sign up for CNN's \\"What Matters\\" Newsletter.close dialogDo you want the latest in US politics summarized each day?Sign up for CNN's What Matters newsletter.Sign me upBy subscribing you agree to our?[Privacy Policy](https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/WMNS/en-us/).The Biden White House can veto this bill, but it cant stop a consensus idea whose time has come, he said in a statement to CNN.Judges C?[including in interviews with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/federal-judges-vacancies-backlog-congress/index.html)?C have said that the judiciary faces a staffing crisis that is undermining litigants right to speedy justice.

In some of the overburdened courthouses targeted by the legislation, the median criminal case can take years to resolve.Still, the White House , while also acknowledging the post-election timing of the House vote, claimed in its announcement that the judges were being hastily added and that they were unnecessary to the efficient and effective administration of justice.","title":"Biden says hell veto bill that would let Trump nominate more judges"},{"text":"Trump will never  deport anyone.

Graham said the two talk all the time, and hes not the only one coordinating with Miller.House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose Republicans arent fully on board yet with Graham and Millers plan to pass a border bill before a tax bill, said he and Miller talk almost daily.

Itll all come together soon.Once seen by some in his party as on the fringe of GOP politics, Miller now finds himself at the center of its delicate negotiations over the 2025 agenda  and the cost of failure could be steep for Republicans, given Trumps high expectations for progress. Miller is bolstering the push by senior senators, including the incoming majority leader, to pass a border security and energy production package  before a tax bill.But a powerful House Republican chairman who said he speaks to Trump quite often and Miller even more is making clear that hed prefer one big mega-bill.[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/11/2024/stephen-miller-takes-a-starring-role-in-hill-republicans-agenda-drama?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)","title":"Stephen Miller takes a starring role in Hill Republicans agenda drama"},{"text":"I know.

As a result, they lost support from black voters, brown voters, arab voters, irish voters, and younger voters, all while republicans kept a unified base. That's why they lost not just the executive office, but also elections down the entire ballot. They ran off the very base that allowed them to hold office.

It can (does) mean both, but there's a distinction to be made between Trump's rhetoric about race, gender, gender identity, sexuality, etc., and about the very tenuous chances that his demo would elect a black/south asian woman under any circumstances; and both parties' appeals to voters on the basis of race, gender, gender identity, sexuality, etc. The difference I'm talking about is a little hard to understand, but think of it like this - Trump practices identity politics on a personal, tactical level in the shitty, hateful way he talks about people, and the way he expects his voters to respond to it. This is what (I believe) you're talking about when you say that republicans used the economy as an excuse not to vote for a black/indian woman. This is different than the higher-order, strategic/operational way that both parties use identity politics to identify, persuade and turn out their voters. Republicans use race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality etc it to mobilize their voters during the election (\\"they're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats; \\"taxpayer funded transgender operations on illegal immigrants who are in jail;\\" \\"Kamala is for they/them,\\" puerto rico garbage island nonsense - you get the idea). Democrats play the same game, they just did it poorly this time and took their votesr for granted because they assumed that the stakes were so high that persuasion was redundant. They expected women to turn out to protect abortion and to punish sex pests; latinos to turn out presumably because they like porous borders, blacks to turn out because they always have and presumably always will. They were just wrong. This is all a very long winded way of saying that both parties \\"use identity politics,\\" and so its a little misleading to say that the Democrats failed because they stuck to kitchen table issues. As discussed, the democrats leaned way too hard on identity politics as a turnout engine without actually making their case. They took their voters for granted and assumed that abortion and Trump's convictions would hand them women, that latinos love open borders, and that blacks will vote democrat because they usually do. **Point 2, subpart a - the Democrats lost in very large part because they were the incumbent party during a prolonged period of inflation.** Above a certain threshold, the cost of living hurts and voters pin that tail on whatever donkey is in the White House. Home prices/interest rates, cost of gas, food, etc., you name it, Democrats took the blame for it. It does not matter that the stock market was surging all throughout or that the jobless rate stayed really low. Most people don't have much, if anything, invested inthe stock market, and whatever pay bump they got during the Biden years didn't keep up with the cost of food and gas. They were feeling the pain literally every time they swiped the ol debit card. To a voter, these are the only economic figures that matter - how many fucking hours do I have to work to pay for this bag of groceries? If the answer is \\"lots,\\" you're going to lose the election. It doesn't matter if its your fault, the buck stops with the sitting president and his party. The incumbent party/candidate owns the economic conditions of their term and right or wrong voters didn't feel like they were personally better off than they were under Trump. They wanted an alternative and they got it. **Point 2 subpart b - the Democrats were fucked from the jump because they not only owned inflation, but had no answer for it, no ability to deal with it, and made the dumb shit mistake of saying so.** To the extent that the Democrats did spin their wheels on \\"the issues,\\" it's arguable that they were fucked no matter what simply because they were the incumbent party during several consecutive years of unaffordable housing and sky-high grocery prices, and the only answer they had (indeed the only answer they could give owing to the limited control the President has to control consumer prices) was to blame \\"greedflation\\" and rattle their saber about big corporations. People ain't tryna hear that and it doesn't matter that Trump will face the same complete lack of leverage with respect to prices - he was telling them what they want to hear which is that \\"I'll make it better, I have a plan.\\" Is that bullshit? Probably. Does he have any more control over prices than Biden did? Nope, not unless he intends to rule by fiat (maybe!). Either way, that sounds way better to voters than \\"what the fuck do you expect me to do about it?\\"(side note, the Democrats - and only the Democrats - have this realy irritating, counterproductive tendency to confuse campaigning with governing, and to treat elections like policy roundtables. You see this play out every time a democratic pundit or the Post or the Times \\"fact checks\\" Trump and nobody gives a shit. To be fair, part of the problem is that the democrats, as the adults in the room, are held to a higher standard  in this regard. No one expects republicans to do anything but dribble on their tits and rant about immigrants during campaign season, and they somehow benefit from this. But, I digress. Bottom line, campaigning is advertising. Cynical but true, and the Republicans understand this better than the Democrats. That \\"Trump is for us, Kamala is for they/them\\" line? That was *killer.* Whoever wrote that ad got a bag, I guarantee. Say what you will about the substance but that is a fucking great line, and it probably mattered a little. And the Democrats had nothing in the clip, at least that mattered to persuadable voters.) **Point 3 - the Democrats lost in part because they owned a legitimate immigration crisis and had no good answers for it.** You had Kamala Harris on the record saying she couldn't thing of a thing she'd have done differently about immigration if she was President instead of Biden. That plays really, really, really, really fucking badly against campaign ads about busloads of migrants in tent cities and illegal immigrants attacking cops and stabbing commuters in NYC.**TLDR:** Identity politics is necessary but insufficient to explain the outcome of the election and its not enough to say that Trump won because his voters won't elect a black woman. It's more accurate to say that identity politics mattered more on a strategic/operational basis, in that the Republicans were able to get their voters to the polls by leveraging far left positions on immigration and transgender rights against the entire Democratic party, while the democrats a) overestimated their support from women, latinos and blacks while also continuing to lose men particularly young men, and b) failed to offer an alternative vision rather than relying on the fact that Trump is a sundowning convicted felon and incipient autocrat. Basically, instead of advocating an actual policy position that would appeal to voters, they did the John Oliver thing and just started screaming LOOK AT THIS SHIT, DO YOU WANT THIS GUY BACK IN OFFICE?! And they got their answer. As a wise man once told me, never ask a question you don't want to hear the answer to. And I think economic issues mattered way more, objectively, and more than you seem to think because Biden and by extension Harris and the rest of the democratic party owned inflation even if there was nothing they could do about it. Trump won by default on this because he hasn't been in office since 2020, and wasn't responsible for having to come up with a solution. He offered voters an alternative and promised to fix it, while the Democrats did neither. And, significantly, factual, objective reality is not relevant to this calculus.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"Hell yes!

Add to that the decay of traditional (i.e., principled and edited) news organizations at the hands of greed-motivated megacorps; decades-long lack of civics education in the public schools; the rise of a culture based on all-encompassing entertainment and acquisitiveness; the decline of community-sustaining local organizations, and the long war by the rising hard right to devalue education and compassion while increasing division, fear and blame.

So what made him nervous to admit to it when he was so calm when shooting the gun? I guess it could be because he was less worried about murdering a CEO than admitting to murdering a CEO, which, also, totally possible and even understandable.

By their lights he was a failed casino owner and thrice-married playboy. He had no apparent principles, no policy blueprint and no grasp of the Bible. He didnt even understand free-market theory, something they consider to be a fountainhead of American liberty. Yet here he was in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Va., soliciting support from a closed-door group of conservative leaders called the Council for National Policy.For months after the event, Dannenfelser and some other CNP members were determined to stop Trump. While he solidified his lead as GOP front-runner, they denounced him as a charlatan in the conservative magazine National Review, blasted his prior support of abortion rights and implored Republican voters to choose another candidate.Then came a great swerve that would upend politics in America: Millions of conservatives  Dannenfelser and other CNP members among them  got firmly behind Trump.McGahn thought Trump could benefit by releasing a list of nominees to replace Scalia, an unusual move that would reassure religious and social conservatives who wanted an anti-abortion jurist. Trump expressed support for one of Leos long-cherished goals: a federal court system dominated by judges who would interpret the Constitution in ways that favored business and conservative views.In the summer of 2016, Trump made another strategic move that would seal the deal with Dannenfelser, the anti-abortion activist, and other CNP members. He pledged to oppose abortion and put the promises onto paper in September. Dear Pro-Life Leader, Trumps letter began. I am writing to invite you to join my campaigns Pro-Life Coalition, which is being spearheaded by longtime leader Marjorie Dannenfelser. Trump said he would nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, defund Planned Parenthood and take other measures that the anti-abortion activists had demanded.Dannenfelser was thrilled. Before that we were still stomping our feet, she said last year at a CNP meeting, according to one of the internal videos. Little did we know that this man, who was a performer and can incite audiences in ways we never even thought could be, would galvanize audiences in battleground states all over the country and put life at the center of the project. The CNP crowd whooped and hollered at her remarks.In Reeds book, he writes that Dannenfelser told him: Trump was my last choice until he was my first.","title":"Psychoanalysis explains why Donald Trump is taunting Canada and Governor Justin Trudeau"},{"text":"Genocide of transgenders continues.","title":"House GOP Uses Must-Pass Defense Bill To Strip Care From Military Families Trans Kids"},{"text":"Yes.

This is the full text of Section 708 of the current version of the NDAA. Section 1079(a) of title 10, United States Code is amended by adding at the end of the following new paragraph:\\n(20) medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization may not be provided to a child under the age of 18. The headline is a little misleading here.This article also leaves out that the current version of the bill got rid of three other provisions that were either in the House bill that passed in April, or the Senate bill introduced earlier this year.House-passed H.R. 8070Section 579C would prohibit an Exceptional Family Member Program from providing gender transition procedures or providing referrals for gender transition services to a minor dependent child. The provision would also prohibit the approval of a change of duty station due to a minor dependent child having a lack of access to gender transition services.Removed.Section 713 would amend Title 10, Chapter 55, of the U.S. Code to prohibit DOD from providing or paying for genderaffirming surgical care and hormone therapy for all beneficiaries.RemovedSenate Armed Services Committee-reported  S. 4638Section 708 would amend Title 10, Chapter 55, of the U.S. Code to prohibit the use of DOD funds for performing or facilitating sex change surgeries.Removed.To be clear, I dont particularly like this version either, but its specific enough to allow for less invasive intervention, so its probably the best compromise well get.Also, though, I think its important to highlight that the three sections removed by this amended proposal are waaaay more restrictive, and we should acknowledge the small victory by the HASC/SASC.","title":"House GOP Uses Must-Pass Defense Bill To Strip Care From Military Families Trans Kids"},{"text":"Pay to play scam is already starting","title":"Trump selling out America (yet AGAIN)"},{"text":"Ah so theyre packing Kimberly off to Mykonos aa a consolation prize.","title":"Trump chooses Kimberly Guilfoyle as his pick for Greece ambassador"},{"text":"If only anyone had the power to hold him accountable, oh well, time to let him waltz into office!","title":"Bragg says Trump's crimes and 'history of malicious conduct' are too serious for his hush-money case to be dismissed"},{"text":"The post office even tried to run itself like a business and make a profit by selling merchandise, and then the GOP banned them from doing so.

He wasnt closeted, quite the opposite.  His most famous essay on it in 1957 catapulted the National Review into its influential role, and catapulted him into becoming a profoundly influential, central advisor to Reagan and others.In the 80s Reagan said and did some really horrible things but was *wildly* popular with mainstream republicans.A few years after Reagan, Gingrich declared war on the whole notion of liberal democracy in 1993, defining it publicly as the existential threat to our western heritage, a call back to some of the same racist code words that Buckley had used.  Also catapulted him into the speakership and popularity within conservative circles.Every 10 to 20 years, about once per generation, the Republicans have rallied around someone who dared to say the quiet parts out loud.  This wasnt some new phenomenon that Trump tapped into using some secret mind control beam.  No, its been the central thread of conservatism for a long damn time.Over the last 30 years, the idea of toning it down and not saying all the things out loud became popular again.  Political correctness, cancel culture, shame, whatever you want to call it, it just became harder and harder to be the resistance against progress party.  And the numbers proved that, republicans were losing electoral relevance in national elections for 20+ years now.Then along comes a guy that says we gotta start saying the quiet stuff out loud, like weve never said it before.  Even the most moderate republicans, and even some undecideds, all jumped on board in numbers weve never seen before.  Most of them dont like him personally and dont like his antics, but they adore him like no other conservative figure, even Reagan, because he encourages them to take pride in all the stuff, all of it, even the quietest quiet parts.  And his numbers prove that thats what mainstream conservatives have been aching for their lifetimes.  Every moderate Republican I know tells me I like that he says things out loud that arent safe for me to say.  That tells me that Trump and MAGA are not the conquerors of rhetoric Republican Party that we paint them to be.So Im not personally on board with theories that MAGA is a minority that has caused some shift in the Republican Party.  McCains and Romneys moderation were unpopular in the party, they never represented the real core of conservatism, and they finally got the guy they had been waiting for.","title":"Republicans called Jan. 6 rioters un-American.

Prior to that, American-born Chinese people in particular regularly had their citizenship denied and were blocked from returning to the US if they ever left the country.?\\nThe case highlighted disagreements over the precise meaning of one phrase in the Citizenship Clausenamely, the provision that a person born in the United States who is \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" acquires automatic citizenship. The Supreme Court's majority concluded that this phrase referred to being required to obey U.S. law; on this basis, they interpreted the language of the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that granted U.S. citizenship to children born of foreigners , with only a limited set of exceptions mostly based in English common law. The court's dissenters argued that being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States meant not being subject to any foreign powerthat is, not being claimed as a citizen by another country via jus sanguinis (inheriting citizenship from a parent)an interpretation which, in the minority's view, would have excluded \\"the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country\\".\\nThe dissent shows one path that could be taken, by having a majority flip the reasoning and say that the original majority was wrong?\\nI'll also note that Native Americans were explicitly denied citizenship under [Elk v.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the lawThe key phrase here is \\"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\". Historic legal reading has used \\"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" to exclude people born in the US whose parent(s) are in the US due to a diplomatic mission. I believe (IANAL) that they look at the situation from the lens of the child (is the child a subject to the jurisdiction) and not the parents, but I could see them try to argue it is the parents that matter and illegal immigrants are not subject(s) to the jurisdiction; therefore, children of illegals born in the US are not entitled to citizenship. Normally, I don't think that interpretation would be accepted, but given the way the Supreme Court has been operating, they may change precedent.The second scary part is \\"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law\\".

There is nothing within the constitution that prevents the SCOTUS from essentially nullifying parts of the constitution. If the SCOTUS decides to interpret that the 1st amendment doesn't actually give you freedom of speech, you no longer have freedom of speech. There is no check against a SCOTUS that works to undermine the constitution directly.\\\\- The POTUS cares what the SCOTUS says. The Executive Branch is the enforcement arm of the USA. The enforcement arm has gone rogue before. The decision of the supreme court has fell still born, and they find that it cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate. - Andrew Jackson. The built in check against a rogue POTUS is technically impeachment, but that's never happened. It's unlikely that the GOP would impeach a POTUS that blatantly ignores the constitution if that POTUS is also a member of the GOP.So, while it's nice and all that the constitution directly contradicts a lot of the promises Trump is making, we've seen that the GOP does not care about the constitution. Texas, as an example, has overstepped their authority on the border and *nothing* was done about it. The concern therefore isn't whether or not the constitution protects birthright citizenship, but rather how far the GOP, controlling all three branches of government, would go to erode the constitution in order to go on their xenophobic crusade to attack non-Americans.Hopefully all goes well and either Trump is blowing out his ass or the GOP has no inclination to subvert the constitution for Trump to adhere to his campaign promises.

So militaries were changed from territorial defence to intervention/peacekeeping forces. We, in Europe, should have started to reverse that trend in 2008/9, latest in 2014. It's starting now but as you can imagine it's a painful process. Those who are threatened the most by Russia are also those who pay the 2% goal or more, so the sentiment of countries not paying their bills is not entirely correct over the entirety of Europe. It's also a bit of a question to whom this bill really is. A lot of the hardware being bought is coming from American suppliers and is not a handout - the MiC makes a lot of money from Europe that's buying American, not russian. I foresee that there's going to be more expenditure in the future, too, as European arms makers can't produce as much even if everyone would walk up to them with bags of cash now. \\nSo while I agree that Europe collectively needs to get a grip on a more independent footing for territorial defence I am confused where the emnity comes from, as us taxpayer money isn't spent on protecting a polish garden, it's spent on us soldiers, contractors and companies to produce, supply and man posts and factories. This influence as an ally allows access to a lot of customers for the us defence industry, it allows a lot of influence in the region and helps the hegemonial status of the US as a superpower. Bases in Europe are also used as transport hubs and to stage campaigns in the middle east/iran and Africa, as well as keeping eyes on Russia which at least sees itself as a rival. \\nThere's a lot of threats on the horizon and it would probably be better if we'd all go along with having healthy discourses that aren't aimed at polarising, as that will only weaken everyone involved. And you bet that the assholes around the globe are watching, celebrating and instigating this sort of thing.","title":"Trump told Macron that the U.S. will leave NATO if European nations don't start paying their bills"},{"text":"Do it.","title":"On the Electoral Colleges future, maybe Democrats should call Trumps bluff"},{"text":"Will be pardoned in a month","title":"Police arrest suspect accused of assaulting Nancy Mace on Capitol grounds"},{"text":"I feel like that's by design.

Make up your mind, do you think we're in desperate times or not? Stop being vague. Give me some actual examples you think will reach these people.I literally did. Democrats ran on the strength of the economy, but ignored that nobody cares about the *rate* of inflation as long as they suffer from the consequences of that inflation. A lot of things caused high inflation on basic consumer goods, like eggs.Did you know that last year a jury in Illinois found that egg producers conspired to fix prices from 2004 to 2008 by limiting the supply of eggs, as alleged in a 2011 lawsuit? Did you know that we've had several egg shortages since 2020, causing the price of eggs to increase? Do I need to spell it out for you, or can you piece it together that Democrats had a slam-fucking-dunk to pin the cost of eggs on corporate meddling and promise to punish the conspirators and bring prices down?This is what I mean. Regardless of whether this particular bout of inflation is the product of corporate conspiracy, the conspiracy exists. I say \\"lie\\" but it's not even really a lie, it's just not relying on facts. It's not even that big of a leap to say if they could do it in 2008 (and they need to hit on that year, the year of the great recession) they can do it in 2024.Same goes for the other things I pointed out. People are so mad about health insurance that an insurance company CEO gets murdered and people are mad the assassin got caught. Why do we even have private health insurance? Oh yeah, Republicans fought tooth an nail against even a public option, let alone universal healthcare.People have a lot of opinions on the Israel/Palestine conflict, both ways. Twitter is all about having lots of opinions on things, and Trump's BFF Musk owns that privately. Remind the pro-Israel side that Musk allows Nazis on his platform, and remind the pro-Palestine side that Facebook was found culpable for facilitating the Rohingya genocide back when *it* was the hot social media platform, that Musk has proven willing to censor content for right-wing regimes like Turkey.Again, not even lying, just not sticking to the facts.","title":"CMV: The republicans won the 2024 election because of identity politics."},{"text":"I asked myself the same question.","title":"Republicans who oppose Donald Trump face risk of retaliation from Elon Musk"},{"text":"Perhaps, the concerning thing this time is its a lot different than it was 8 years ago.

Also, Im not someone who identifies as a man, but I am AMAB and it seems like Ask-Any was bending over backwards to make a misandrist quip about male entitlement at the expense of a gay man simply talking to another gay person about their lived experience as a gay person.

Ill try and summarize: Joel Greenburg was a tax collector in Florida who gambled tax money on crypto and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars (lol.) He was simultaneously having sex with dozens of women whom he met on a Sugar Daddy website. One of those women turned out to be 17. Rather than cut ties and claim ignorance, he used his position to steal someones identity and printed this underage girl off an actual, of age Florida ID. Greenburg gets investigated by the FBI for the crypto scam and this is all gets uncovered and also results in sex trafficking charges for the underage minor. Somewhere along the line Gaetz has sexual relations with this girl who is using a false identity of someone who is of age at a party that Greenburg was also at. Gaetz most likely had no idea who this woman was or that she was a minor but there was most likely a honeypot operation going on at parties with this 17 year old using a false identity to entrap people. Some guys who were most likely in on the honeypot use this sexual relationship with the 17 y/o fake identity girl and Gaetz to try and extort Gaetz father for $25 million dollars. They spin up an Iranian hostage extraction operation for a guy who was captured by Iran over a decade ago and is probably dead. They told Don Gaetz that if he funds the hostage extraction, he will secure a pardon for Matt Gaetz. No one has any fucking clue what is going on so the Gaetz contact the FBI who then opens an investigation and criminally charges and secures plea deals for the extortion attempt The FBI very quickly dropped the investigation into Matt Gaetz because they knew the minor he allegedly had sex with was using a stolen identity she had schemed up with Greenburg. What happened to Gaetz reeks of a fed honeypot. https://youtu.be/xm8vDgTvb3o?si=2pGCyOXTVoRMh6ub","title":"Report: Top Ethics Committee Democrat Leaked Matt Gaetz Report Details, Violating Sworn Oath"},{"text":"Fall harder.","title":"And yet, Trump is perfectly fit both physically and mentally to run America, eh? ??"},{"text":"Yeah there might be something to that.

A couple points first: We had universal programs that raised a generation of Americans out of the great depression.It's almost unanimously agreed by economists that while the new deal helped to stabilize the economy, world war II production, not the new deal, was the key contributing factor to lifting America out of the depression. We had civil rightsHuh? Most of those reforms weren't until the late 60s or 70s and even then the anti civil rights (drug infusion into black communities, higher incarceration, e.g.) persisted into the 80s and even until the turn of the millenium. Then everything changed when the Ronald Regan attacked.Appreciate this reference. The problem is that this rests on the belief that society should always get better. Unlimited growth is not sustainable.... Things are ultimately way better than they were 100 years ago. While I agree that unlimited growth isn't sustainable, continuous improvement is. It's true that virtually everyone is better off than their counterpart from 1924, and that there are more of us, but there are still problems that can be addressed, which brings me to the crux of the argument: Democrats are hopeless because they lack unity in their cause. To explain: Democrats/Liberals/Progressives are, as the name implies, interested in progress, in change, in improvement (or what they feel to be improvement). However, within the party there are competing opinions and interests on the direction that progress should take. Do we care about racial injustice or income inequality. Is immigration, healthcare, or college tuition the bigger issue. To some, some of these issues might not even be on the radar while to others, they are seismic. To all, each issue carries a different weight of interest.This translates to different candidates who care about different things. Joe Biden might have polled well with college age adults by promising to forgive large amounts of tuition, but for a moderate, middle-aged dixiecrat. That issue might be irrelevant or even one they oppose. And that sort of pattern is natural with those seeking progress.On the other hand, republicans/conservatives are more concerned with conservation of the existing power structure, which is a united front. If the system has worked well for you (and to be sure, for the vast majority, republican or democrat, it has), what incentive do you have to change?So I don't think having high expectations is the issue. Obamacare was a high expectation that improved the lives of millions by giving them access to healthcare that they didn't previously have. What's plaguing the democrats is that they have too many competing players trying like salespeople to entice voters with too many varying incentives.","title":"CMV: The reason things seem so politically hopeless in America for the left is because their expectations are too high"},{"text":"YOU ARE DYING IN REAL TIME MITCH, JUST FUCK OFF ALREADY","title":"And yet, Trump is perfectly fit both physically and mentally to run America, eh? ??"},{"text":"Make Putin go broke.","title":"US Mulls New Russia Oil Sanctions to Weaken Putin Ahead of Trump"},{"text":"Funny how the leaks only ever go one way","title":"Report: Top Ethics Committee Democrat Leaked Matt Gaetz Report Details, Violating Sworn Oath"},{"text":"Good luck maintaining force readiness.

Firstly, the article paints J.D. Vance as some sort of techno-authoritarian bogeyman, akin to a villain in a dystopian novel where everyone ends up wearing grey jumpsuits and living in pods. But let's get this straight: Vance isn't advocating for a society where we convert the unproductive into biofuel or trap them in VR headsets. That's just the media's way of saying, \\"Look at this shiny, scary thing!\\" to distract you from the real issues. \\nInaccuracy #1: Misrepresentation of Ideology: The piece suggests Vance's ideas are directly from the mind of Curtis Yarvin, painting him as a mere puppet of tech billionaires. However, Vance's political philosophy is more a cocktail of his own experiences, his Ohio roots, and yes, some Silicon Valley influence, but not the one-note tune the article plays. His book, \\"Hillbilly Elegy,\\" shows a man deeply concerned with the plight of America's working class, not just a mouthpiece for the tech elite.\\nInaccuracy #2: Oversimplification of Relationships: The narrative around Vance being Thiel's \\"creation\\" is as simplistic as saying Earth was created by some guy with a white beard in the clouds. Vance's connection with Peter Thiel is about mentorship and shared ideas on innovation, not puppetry. Thiel's support doesn't equate to Vance being a clone of Thiel's ideologies. Remember, even the most advanced AI has its own quirks, let alone a human being.\\nInaccuracy #3: Doom-Saying About Democracy: The article implies that Vance's potential influence in a Trump administration would lead to a dictatorship. But, come on, isn't this just the political equivalent of crying \\"Wolf!\\"? Vance has spoken about the need for government reform, but last I checked, democracy in America isn't made of paper mache. It's more like one of those really durable, annoying toys that bounce back no matter how many times you think you've knocked it down.\\nInaccuracy #4: Ignoring Vance's Public Statements: It's easy to paint Vance with a broad stroke of authoritarianism, but this ignores his public statements where he has clearly outlined his vision for a government that's more responsive to the needs of the working class rather than just the elite. His critiques of current systems are about making government work for all, not just for a select few.\\nInaccuracy #5: The Tech Billionaire Conspiracy: The article's focus on Vance's Silicon Valley connections as some sinister plot overlooks the fact that Silicon Valley has been influencing politics for decades on both sides of the aisle. If we're to blame Vance for this, then let's just throw all politicians with tech connections into the same barrel and label it \\"Suspect.\\"\\nIn conclusion, while the article might serve up a narrative as juicy as a freshly-made, Earth-bound burger, it's seasoned with a bit too much fear and not enough fact. J.D. Vance isn't the harbinger of a techno-dystopia; he's a politician with a vision shaped by a unique blend of experiences and influences. Just like trying to understand the universe through the Infinite Improbability Drive, politics is much more complex than it seems at first glance.","title":"Where J.D.

I do believe the higher ups can control our minds..think MK Ultra developed by the Nazis. Now its much more intricate.

Heck maybe they can even insert images into people's minds under these conditions. Gangstalking comes to mind you know?In the past they might have relied on superstition and maybe sleight of hand magic or something to convince people of their occult power. Maybe they seeded the origins of the major religions so they could use them as control mechanisms?\\nToday who knows. We've always talked about blue beam using holograms to trick people into an alien invasion..... Maybe they can do it on an individual basis by remotely stimulating people's neurons? That might be why they were so gung ho to get graphene and fluorescent compounds in the vaccines in as many people's circulatory systems as possible.....\\nPS I brought up DMT because about 15 years ago I had an experience where like, the curtain of reality was pulled back somewhat, and I communicated with two entities who seemed deeply malevolent.

Newfies generally know absolutely nothing about Trump but almost all of them hate him anyway because they've been told he's evil by the media. Newfoundland is likely the most leftist province in the country, but at least it's not wokism like in the cores of big cities in other provinces. Alberta is the most conservative province, but Edmonton is a cesspool (think Portland of the North), and likely where that idiot blaming Newfies actually lives.Luckily my wife is one of the very rare conservative Newfoundlanders who likes Trump.
