Fundamentally, a second Trump presidency would be just fine for Democratic leadership because they can do the \\"#resist\\" song and dance to fundraise, and the people making all the top-level strategic decisions for the party are sufficiently rich (and primarily white, cis and straight) enough that the policies of Trump 2: Electric Boogaloo wouldn't really affect them much.The Democratic Party and the Republican Party, despite their posturing, are fundamentally two wings of the same party, both serving the same bourgeois class against the interest of the working class. They have disagreements on some policies and one wing is lest outwardly bigoted than the other, but they both still serve billionaires and protect capital while enforcing American imperial control abroad and maintaining capitalist oppression domestically.If the Democrats actually wanted to win elections, they could easily crush the Republicans year after year (at least at the national level) even just with fairly moderate social democratic policies, but even social democracy is too much for their actual masters, because those policies would benefit workers and maybe allow them the breathing room to advocate for themselves and demand yet greater concessions.","title":"Kristen Welker / Bernie Sanders Interview: Kamala has flipped her stance on Universal Healthcare"},{"text":"He wants to surrender to Putin.","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 4"},{"text":"Harris hasn't yet gotten that rhetorical final blow... there's still time, but we need a Mortal Kombat FINISH HIM moment in this debate.","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 4"},{"text":"I am pretty confident that he doesnt want to win, he just wants the campaign money","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 4"},{"text":"\\"DO YOU WANT UKRAINE TO WIN THE WAR'I want the war to stop!","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 4"},{"text":"Hes being obliterated","title":"Discussion Thread: First Presidential Debate of the 2024 General Election Between Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump, Part 4"},{"text":"Oh, they are asking him about Ukraine.

Plus, if done within the next couple of days, if anything happens (ie- they never receive it or there is a mistake on form, etc.) you may still have time to get it corrected!www.votetexas.gov(Again, please know in Texas you cannot register online, so when you go to the above link and fill out the form while there is a \\"submit\\" button, that does **not** mean you are registered.   You must then print it out and mail it in!  This is just yet another petty loop hole Texas makes us jump through, totally unnecessary,  but it is what it is.  You can also just go by your local registrar office and do it there in person if you prefer!)**And last tip for ALL new voters: VOTE during early voting!**  It is so easy and quick.  You will have multiple locations to choose from,  will even be open on a Saturday, and there will be little to no line.  It usually takes under 15 min!  On election day you can only vote from your one designated location (in Texas that is, not sure about other states) and it may not be very convenient,  especially in more populated urban areas (which is by design, courtesy of Republicans in charge), parking can be more difficult, and the lines are often long.  If you must go on voting day though, definitely still go, it's usually manageable and not too bad, but keep all that in mind and prepare ahead of time.  If you are nervous (totally normal, I was too the first time), take someone that has voted before with you!

Every state that requires voter ID will give it to you for free already. What makes a free federal ID superior to a free state ID? The argument against free state IDs comes down to the rigamarole for people who dont have one to get one. You have to go to the DMV and stand in line for hours, and if you dont have other documents like a birth certificate etc, you have to go through more bureaucratic hell to get those first. To some, that all amounts to a poll tax. So, how does your national ID avoid that situation?  What easier process is in place if I lose my ID?  Do I just walk into the national ID office and say yes hello, Im Jason Momoa. Please give me Jason Momoas ID and they just hand it to me?  Hopefully not!  Nah, Im still going to have to go find my birth certificate or jump through all the same additional hoops to replace that.

One big Trump fuckup I complain about is Trumps own decision to put Chris Wray as head of the fbi. Trump absolutely could fuck up some more. I can't in good faith claim he's better than, say, Jill Stein. So even for people living in swing states here, voting for Jill Stein is probably the best.

Also aside from all that, the one big issue I'm more concerned about than anything is the US role in the world, where Trump ends up being much better (whether on purpose or not is irrelevant).

What plays well to broad voter bases is not a 1:1 reflection of reality. Which shouldn't need to be said. Yes, lots of people who are objectively better off than they were or would've been at any other time are still unhappy because they want more. If this is surprising to you, I don't know what to say.Which is fine, but that's not the same thing as \\"everyone is getting poorer and the economy is terrible!\\" Those things are factually not true, and the overwhelming majority of working Americans are doing pretty well. Yes, the single-digit percentage of people earning low wages still deserve attention. That this is a repeating point of contention in elections doesn't change the fact that it's a minority of people and that the economy isn't in shambles. Point one.Point two, there is a lot more to economic policy than \\"ECONOMY BAD! EVERYONE POOR!\\" or \\"ECONOMY GOOD! DO NOTHING!\\" That economic policy is still a thing that needs continued attention isn't proof that the economy is actually terrible, and everyone is struggling.Point three: if you've been paying attention, Kamala's campaign has significantly walked back the more populist (i.e. intended to appeal to uninformed rabble) positions like price caps and taxes on unrealized gains, among others. Because it's *politics*. What sounds good to the kind of people who watch presidential campaign speeches, and what's sound economic policy based on reality are often two different things. Again - shouldn't need much explaining.[Here's an article with sources](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/if-this-is-a-bad-economy-please-tell), although it probably can't compete with your \\"vibes\\" based on your personal bubble of experiences. There are many more (and slightly more current) if you're interested in finding them.TL;DR: Unemployment is low, inflation is low, real incomes are higher than ever. The economy is doing well. People like to complain. Anecdotes aren't data, which for some reason everyone agrees with until it's *their* anecdote.\\"Are you saying that a bunch of people who complain about something might not be 100% perfectly representing the broader reality outside of their personal situations? Are you saying that people who *feel* like they know what's going on with a giant, complicated system they don't care to study, based on nothing but extrapolating a bunch of assumptions from their own personal situation?\\"Uh, YES.","title":"CMV: i dont think Western countries populations value democracy and human rights so much as they believe"},{"text":"I have a feeling its going to be a landslide victory for the democrats in November.

California is not receiving enough federal assistance for the influx of homeless folks, so the social support systems are overwhelmed. If the US has a [Universal Basic Income (UBI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl39KHS07Xc), then [these folks would be better off](https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-simple-solution-homelessness-researcher-study-2023-12).Mind you, UBI does not fix the housing crisis, we need other solutions such as banning companies from owning non-commercial real estate to use as an index fund. Also, having decently high federal property taxes on anyone with 3+ houses would help as well. The whole Bay Area needs more affordable housing. UBI can be funded by increasing federal corporate taxes to be what they were pre-Reagan around 45% and creating new tax brackets for the mega millionaires and billionaires. Taxing stock that is used as collateral on loans as if it is sold would make sense as well, since this is how the billionaires get around having to ever pay taxes on their wealth.Vice President Harris doesnt work alone is the key thing, as a president can only get their policies goals accomplished if they have a solid majority in the House and Senate (preferably Super Majority in the Senate).

I am a Chinese myself, born and raised up until high school. I definitely think the CCP does a lot of things with the interest of the people at heart, and is not evil like some western media portrays. However its just a fact that the NPC is just approving what has been pre determined by the CCP, and the different political parties represented are also only those authorised by the CCP and have to present as a united front.And I completely agree with you about us congress, but the difference is that congress still allows for individual legislators to advocate for a wide range of interests, including those of the general public. This is just not the case for the national peoples congress, where decision making on policy is centralised within the party. Also, you seem to think that those delegates in the national peoples congress are those elected by the citizens and that is simply not true. People in villages and townships can elect for the local peoples congress, these candidates have been approved by the CCP, once elected, the local peoples congress then choose delegates for the next level up in the county and then the provincial congress and until the provincial peoples congress who will vote for delegates to the national peoples congress.As a Chinese, I can tell you that majority of the people do not care about internal politics, they are not going to go out and protest in the street because the views of their elected officials, which they dont actually elect, have no actual power. Chinese people see our government as highly effective and that keeps most people satisfied to not even have to think or care about domestic politics, everyone knows the party decided everything and majority of people are completely ok with that, wide scale protests are rare and only happen when peoples livelihood is effected (e.g zero Covid policy).","title":"CMV: China will become a democratic country within this century"},{"text":"Please tell me she is bringing E.

Compare that to Harris, who has specific plans to decrease costs for housing, groceries, and medication, which economists say will work.As for explaining why \\"Democrat-run cities\\" have high homelessness and related problems, the thing to keep in mind is that homelessness can't be solved on a city or even state level. Homeless people will move to the states and cities where it's easier for them to survive (the liberal ones that offer more shelters and programs, plus the ones with temperate climates like California so it's safer to sleep outside). Changing policies in those cities wouldn't make the homeless people disappear, it would just make them go somewhere else. The real solution is national programs that reduce homelessness: jobs investment, veterans assistance, and reducing housing costs.

The [standard for getting an ID](https://nn4youth.org/wp-content/uploads/Field-Guide_Obtaining-ID-Cards.pdf) in America is already high but it could be higher: For those states that do align with the REAL ID Act, the following four basic elements must be met: 1. Proof of identity, including full legal name and date of birth; 2. Proof of lawful status in the U.S.; 3. Proof of Social Security number or verification that the person is not eligible for one; and 4. Proof of principal residence that includes the persons full legal name and address. Other states generally require proof of name, date of birth, citizenship or immigration status, Social Security\\nnumber and residency status. Presenting a birth certificate, Social Security card, passport and/or official\\nimmigration or visa documentation is typically the most straightforward route to prove identity, date of\\nbirth, citizenship status and Social Security number.

The last time a political party held three terms was the 1988 Bush senior presidency. This and the preceding Reagan landslides freaked the democrats out so badly that they took a rapid turn to the right, fully embracing the sort of rightwing neoliberal policies that they still are fully entrenched in today. The republicans in turn flew even further to the right, eventually leading to the political situation we're in now.

This is also their weak point, as they work the opposite as science. They just believe what they want to believe because no one wants to be wrong. Now everyone has some form of confirmation bias, but in these circles (where belief is already such a big part of their lives) its quite a difficult thing to backtrack on their beliefs. Its possible in rare cases to chip away though by seeing where they are unsure of themselves, and using non confrontational language and slowly exposing their conclusions based on belief as foregone conclusion instead of informed ones based on rational and critical thought.In short you want to be asking questions with them that crack away at the rigid belief system.

Right now there is a critical lack of male representation in education, and as Marian University points out, diversity has numerous benefits for young students:[Male Teachers Play an Important Role in the Future of Education](https://www.marianuniversity.edu/news/importance-of-male-teachers-future-of-education/)Sometimes, the mere presence of men in the classroom can help students. According to studies cited by the Australian Association for Research in Education (AARE), having male and female teachers contributes to childrens gender knowledge. Having men in the classroom is particularly important as they allow students to observe men who are non-violent and whose interactions with women are positive.Other advantages of male teachers in the classroom, according to the AARE, include the following.* Having both male and female teachers gives students the chance to learn from others they perceive as similar. This can foster a sense of belonging and reduce instances of disruptive behavior.\\n* Some students will see teachers as role models to better understand how to interact with adults who are different from themselves positively.\\n* A diverse workforce can enhance decision-making processes and drive positive outcomes, according to AARE, because people from different backgrounds see challenges in different ways. A diverse workforce also can improve job satisfaction.\\n* AARE also writes that the presence of male teachers may help promote alternative, non-violent, and gender-equitable versions of masculinity, adding that men who work as teachers can help to break down the polarized differences that foster gender inequalities.The research suggests that both male and female teachers contribute to a well-rounded education and a childs social-emotional development. A number of factors contribute to the dearth of male teachers, especially at the grade-school level. A big one, says Ethan Zagore in a USA Today article, is that many people just fundamentally  consciously or subconsciously  believe the role of an elementary teacher is better suited for women.Similarly the University of North Carolina found that exposure to a Black teacher had a massive impact on Black male students in the long run:[Edge: The power of a Black teacher | It takes just one to make a difference for Black students; directions for research, policy](https://ed.unc.edu/2020/09/08/the-power-of-a-black-teacher/)They found that having a Black teacher for one year in elementary school raised long-run educational attainment for Black male students, especially for those from low-income households. For the most disadvantaged Black males, Lindsay and the team estimated that exposure to a Black teacher in elementary school reduced high school dropout rates by 39% and raised college-going aspirations.Diversity has an impact *and* plays a role in education. At a time when [boys and men are falling behind girls and women in education](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/), these actions can become critically important.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $28 Million in Grants to Recruit, Prepare, and Develop a Diverse Educator Workforce | U.S. Department of Education Additionally Releases New Data on Public Service Loan Forgiveness Approvals in Every State"},{"text":"If they believe it now with 0 evidence they'll come up with a way this voter ID isn't stopping it","title":"Democrats should propose a National ID, with automatic voter registration"},{"text":"I disagree, both with the characterization of his actions and with his character mattering that much.

In general this is great, because it results with many political parties to choose from (unlike the USA which has only two). The downside of it is what happenned with Bibi. He was too corrupt for people to agree to join his coalition, so he had to combine votes with many small right wing extremists. The coalition is so close to the minimum allowed votes that if each member of the coalition departures, the government falls and there is a re-election. So basically they are holding him by the balls. This is not a testament to the failure of democracy or the voting process (which is what we find in Russia). It is a failure on a different level - allowing people accused of crimes to become the president. This is very similar to Trump. We wouldn't dare saying that the USA isn't a democracy. But, Trump can become a president even if he is a felon (or even if he is at the time serving prison time). Every system has its faults, but that isn't to say that the democratic process isnt functioning, or that ISrael is in any way authoratarian. In my opinion it is a failure of the education system that creates more Bibi supporters.","title":"CMV: The wars of the arab world with Israel are the result of autocracy vs democracy, and not because of Israel staling arab land."},{"text":"lol good one","title":"Harris Hilariously Shreds Trumps Insecurities in Pre-Debate Ad - Kamala Harris continues to hit Donald Trump where it hurts."},{"text":"Thanks Billy, hows Windows going?","title":"Bill Gates is planning another pandemic of WW3 doesn't start soon"},{"text":"Big Bernie Sanders supporter but now is not the time.

Overall, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, we're looking really good as far as the Presidential election is concerned. The polls are in our favor and Trump is pulling funding from his ground game here. New Hampshire will reject him again, I'm sure of it. But I don't feel the same confidence about the race for governor. Not gonna lie, it's been a bit of a mess. The primary is heavily contested on our end, and the two frontrunners (Joyce Craig and Cinde Warmington) have been going negative against each other. *Very* negative. We're talking stuff like *\\"Joyce Craig let her constituents get murdered on her watch\\"* and *\\"Cinde Warmington pushes opioids for Big Pharma\\"*. They're both going scorched earth on each other, while our real opponent gets a free hand to set the narrative.That opponent is Kelly Ayotte, and unfortunately she's been making the most of this opportunity. Instead of attacking her own primary opponents (who are running way behind her), she's been doing the smart thing: presenting herself as an inoffensive moderate while adding her own attacks to our circular firing squad. And she's been doing this more or less unopposed for the last six months. While there's almost no polling data on this race to examine, my experience on the front lines is pretty damning: Ayotte is almost certainly in the lead right now. Which is why I'm reporting this to you guys. Text and phone bankers, don't skimp on New Hampshire! It may be relatively safe at the federal level, but our state-level prospects are deceptively tough.

(Refer to my post above - from the tax [foundation.org](http://foundation.org) and based on US Govt reporting)You can clearly see the numbers support my argument - it is plain as day.  A 62,5% increase in Cap Gains collected  just prior to a higher tax rate going into effect.And this is even further reinforced that even after a market increase in 2013, that the Cap Gains receipts barely went up at all!  In fact, when you adjust for the gain in the tax rate - they didn't actually go up at all in a year that the market was up 30% (the year after the tax savings selling took place).This shows massive levels of selling in 2012.  Exactly what I am predicting would be the case now.I think you are one of those people that think the high income tax rates after WWII when the rest of the industrialized world was destroyed and we were the only industrial country still standing and producing for the entire planet - that the growth was a result of high tax rates and not the reality that we didn't have any competition in rebuilding literally the entire planet and the entire planet was buying hand-over-fist from the USA.The rising cap gains rates in 2013 caused the market in 2012 to suffer and brought forward much selling in 2012 to avoid the higher tax rates in 2013.And knowing and understanding both the market and our economy from 2009 to that point and the muted market returns, very slow economy-wide recovery from the recession - that the market was destined to start to work again as our economy finally reached parity with the pre-crisis era.If there is going to be a high risk of Cap Gain rates increasing by 40% over current for high income people - you will see stocks being sold at far higher levels than normal in Q4 of 2024.

For example, the most recent war was pretty far back in 1999 between India and Pakistan (the Kargil war). The problem is that Pakistan only became democratic at 2003. Before that (1995) we see the Ecuador-Peru (Cenepa war). But Peru became democratic only at year 2000. Before that the list mention the Yugoslovia wars, but these ended when Serbia became democratic. Before that we see  the Turkey invasion to Cyprus which was the result of a coup by a greek militia (ie the moment democracy failed there was war). To summarise, the list is a shit show.Your second part, if I understand correctly, is to address the conquering of indigenous land by democratic countries. I think you are referring to attacks by Canda and the USA on native americans (eg the trail of tears). And in a way you are correct, both countries were at the time of the attack democracies. But it was only an early version of today's democracy. For example, in the USA only white males with properties were allowed to vote. This isn't thus a true democracy as it doesn't have equal rights to all its citizens (it is more akin to plutocracy). Interestingly, during the rule of Andrew Jackson these wars on native americans ended and the USA started the process of giving voting rights to more sects of the population.","title":"CMV: The wars of the arab world with Israel are the result of autocracy vs democracy, and not because of Israel staling arab land."},{"text":"Well, hes paid to be nuts.

The data showcase how every state has borrowers, including educators, that are part of the $69.2 billion for nearly 947,000 borrowers that have seen relief through this program. By contrast, at the start of this Administration only 7,000 had been approved for PSLF.  \\n...  \\nThis announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is embarking on his 2024 Back to School Bus Tour with stops in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This years theme, \\"Fighting for Public Education,\\" highlights how school communities are using the Biden-Harris Administrations historic investments in public education to implement evidence-based, promising, and innovative strategies and accelerate academic success and support students of all ages and backgrounds. The 2024 Bus Tour is celebrating public education as the American system that opened the door for so many of our nations success stories: from astronauts to astrophysicists, writers to engineers, musicians to mathematicians, innovative entrepreneurs in the private sector to great leaders in the public sector.Regarding the grants:**Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) grants**To support efforts to recruit, prepare, develop, and retain a strong educator workforce, the Department is awarding $28 million in 18 new TQP grants. The TQP program funds teacher preparation programs in high-need communities at colleges and universities for the undergraduate, fifth-year level, and for teaching residency programs for individuals new to teaching with strong academic and professional backgrounds. The central feature of all TQP grantees is a strong partnership between the teacher preparation program and the school districts they serve, which is often facilitated by mentor teachers that coach and prepare incoming educators. In addition, numerous awardees responded to an invitational priority, focused on the establishment of Grow Your Own (GYO) and registered apprenticeship programs for teachers. These programs encourage members of the community C from high school students to paraprofessionals and other career changers - to pursue teaching careers while also enhancing educator diversity, reflecting the Departments interest in learning from applicants proposing GYO projects.The Biden-Harris Administration has increased annual funding for this program by 34 percent, or nearly $18 million per year. At the same time, the Department has worked with States and the U.S. Department of Labor to grow the number that have approved registered apprenticeship programs for teachers, from 0 in 2021 to 38 States, D.C., and Puerto Rico today, and, in total, hundreds of millions in Department funds have been invested in Grow Your Own programs.Regarding the PSLF:**State-by-State PSLF**The new PSLF data shows the breakdown of borrowers approved for PSLF by state following additional PSLF discharges announced in July 2024. The approvals contained in the data are representative of the Administrations unceasing efforts to fix the broken student loan system and restore the promise of forgiveness programs. The Administration has helped fix longstanding problems with PSLF through the limited PSLF waiver, while the payment count adjustment has also ensured that borrowers get accurate counts of progress toward forgiveness. Additionally, Congressional districts across the country have been approved for $87 million in relief.  Outside of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the Congressional districts with the largest number of borrowers who have been approved for debt relief are New Yorks 20th, Marylands 5th, Virginias 8th, New Yorks 25th, and Floridas 2nd district.In addition to fixes to the PSLF Program, such as the limited PSLF waiver, the Biden-Harris Administration has also implemented long-term improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 1, 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department through StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single, specialty loan servicer. That means that, for the first time, borrowers can manage all aspects of their PSLF journey on StudentAid.gov, including submitting their PSLF form and tracking their progress toward forgiveness. These updates will simplify the process for borrowers and allow for faster processing of PSLF forms. These improvements have been in the works since day one of the Administration as part of the Departments efforts to overhaul loan servicing and implement significant improvements to all of its loan forgiveness programs, including PSLF.Regarding borrower assistance:**An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance**The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grantthe largest increase in a decade and finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. The Administration continues its work to issue debt relief regulations under the Higher Education Act, with regulations expected this fall.In addition to the relief under PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: * $51 billion for more than 1 million borrowers through administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment payment counts. These adjustments have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers.\\n* $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. \\n* $16.2 billion for more than 571,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. \\n* $5.5 billion for 414,000 borrowers through the SAVE Plan.     List of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:Nothing matters more in public education than making sure every child has access to great teachers, and that means well-prepared, well-supported, well-compensated, and fully empowered teachers, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. Todays announcement is the result of the Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to making record investments in teacher residency programs, Grow-Your-Own programs, teacher apprenticeship and other comprehensive, high-quality, locally-driven, evidence-based educator preparation initiatives. If we want to Raise the Bar for our students and create an educator workforce that reflects the beautiful diversity of this country, we must expand and support new pathways into the teaching profession.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $28 Million in Grants to Recruit, Prepare, and Develop a Diverse Educator Workforce | U.S. Department of Education Additionally Releases New Data on Public Service Loan Forgiveness Approvals in Every State"},{"text":"The person to which youre responding literally just made up a fact","title":"White House: Biden has not called family of American citizen killed in West Bank by Israeli troops"},{"text":"\\"?I'm saying there's a viable path to limiting the division of Kamala wins,?\\"Sure, if the Democrats dropped half their platform.

The populist part IS mostly based on religion, not economic reform or human rights. First off, I'm using the term Christian Nationalist for someone that is okay in mixing church and state but obviously there are different levels of this. They aren't all \\"white evangelicals\\" like the media goes on about. For example, the Supreme Court is mostly Catholic, and some Catholics nowadays are moving hard right too. Some of these religious people take it to another level (mysticism/prophecy about American politics, strong misogyny, undemocratic tendencies, tolerance of violence) but my point is not that most of them are diehard Christian Nationalists (although they do make a considerable percentage of the population) but that a lot of them are sympathetic enough so they add up. If you don't believe me just look at their influencers, related media, public speaking events like Turning Point and CPAC. Almost all is driven by religion. A lot of Trump supporters don't have critical thinking skills and then add on years of religious indoctrination and social influences. It is true that lots of conservatives have issues with Trump's character and exact words, yes, but not necessarily his policies.Most of the so called RINOs, which is more of a \\"Reagan position\\", (like the Cheneys, Nikki Haley, Mitt Romney, etc.) seem to be fairly few and far between. Obviously many of them are fairly comfortable financially. I'm struggling to understand how anyone could still think they are significant at this point. If they made up  a significant percentage of the population, they would be winning more arguments and challenging more elections, but they don't. Trump has mostly ignored Nikki Haley despite her almost begging him to add her to his team because he knows his base hates her as a corporate Republican. A lot of RINOs have even publically endorsed Harris or simply said they won't vote for Trump- but do you see any change in the polls from that movement? He can hate on RINOs all day long and still win elections because they obviously don't matter in terms of shifting the vote. Taylor Swift could probably bring out more votes than them.","title":"CMV: America will not be less divided after the 2024 election"},{"text":"I saw the correct response to this particular hypocrisy once!Go bake a gay wedding cake and bring it to the discussionHehe","title":"Trump Melts Down Over State of His Campaign With Wild Biden Fantasy"},{"text":"Tonight's debate expectations:\\"Trump may have shit himself, but he didn't take his diaper off and throw it at Harris so he did better than expected\\"Meanwhile \\"Harris didn't give enough details about the Israeli Gaza war and how she would personally end it, so she had a terrible night \\"","title":"Trump will not prepare for debating Kamala Harris.

The key of unintended consequences is \\"Are the unintended outcomes worse than what would have happened?\\". A lot of people look at unintended consequences on Chile, where the US instilled a military junta, and it began a justified, horrific retribution campaign against its own population.What occurred was Chile had a left leaning party take over, after the lefts and the communists formed a coalition government for a \\"moderate\\" leftist.Turns out he wasn't a moderate and over his term, broke the government and began a campaign of rape, torture, and murder; for anyone against his government.The actions were so great, the American public started to take notice, and popular calls to return Chile back to democracy were starting to resonate. At this point, the US and USSR formed a secret coalition to find a solution. Why would bitter enemies do this? The US was going to declare war, it was just a matter of time. If the US declared war directly on a communist nation, the USSR would be forced to come in on the side of Chile. The rub, the USSR hated Chile and it's leadership, and didn't want to possibly end the world over Chile.Instead, they decided the best option was to mutually (but under the guise of US) support a coalition of military leaders. The military had widely been saved from the atrocities and was trying to keep its head down (to minimize any direct atroicities on their soldiers). Three military leaders were selected, two to hold minor roles and one to lead the council. The major role, later become the dictator. Neither USSR or US thought this would happen, he was thought to be a pragmatic reformer, instead he held deep hatred. It was known his wider family had children killed, women raped, and members tortured; it was thought he would put water under the bridge, he did not.After the coup, the retribution began, if you ratted 10 people out that led to torture, killed family members, worse; it was returned to you in full. If you had too many people affected, you were upgraded to creative retribution. Divisions in the military were assigned via the atrocities they had to endure, allowing them to return it back to the people who did it to them.Was a family member tortured? If yes, then you would torture the people who caused it. What they did was horrific, however it's hard as a human to see how someone who endured such hatred and given the chance of retribution wouldn't just accept it. The retribution took a long time, but when the blood price was paid, they stopped and declared both sides caused this.The reason why I bring this up is that this is the definition of unintended consequence. The difference is if we never did it, WW3 would have started leaving far more dead and triggering a nuclear war.","title":"CMV: The US shouldnt interfere in other countries internal problems"},{"text":"*By Gothamist reporter Giulia Heyward*Attorneys general from 42 states, led by New York's Letitia James, are urging Congress to place warning labels on social media sites because of what they call serious psychological harms\\" to teens, including \\"depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.This problem will not solve itself and the social media platforms have demonstrated an unwillingness to fix the problem on their own, they stated in a letter sent to Congress on Tuesday and exclusively obtained by Gothamist.The letter asks Congress to act on a call from the U.S. surgeon general in July?to place warning labels on social media sites.?","title":"New York AG James calls for social media warning labels as 42 states demand federal action"},{"text":"I don't know how old you are, but after Obama was elected and Dems had the senate and the house, they started breaking down into factions and infighting became a real problem.

It wasn't until 2013 that the market had finally clawed back to where it was in 2007 and 2008.  The S&amp;P had a return of 29%.2013 was also the year that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were made permanent.  There was a lot of concern that the tax rates were going to be raised in 2012 for 2013 - and when the prior administrations tax cuts were made permanent - this propelled the economy to accelerate.You'll also note that in 2011 total Capital Gains taxes collected was $56,000,000 (which was the highest in 3 years by the way)In 2012, the last year before the Cap Gains tax rate increase, Capital gains taxes collected was $91,000,000 (a 62.5% increase over the prior year, even when the market didn't do anything exceptionally well).  Which shows that a lot of gains/taxes were pulled forward in 2012 vs. waiting for 2013.In 2013, even with the market up nearly 30%, the Capital Gains taxes collect was only $98,000,000 (less than a 10% increase over the prior year).  When the market is up 30% in a year, Cap Gains tax receipts should explode higher - even without a higher tax rate!And if you go back and look at 2012 - you'll also notice that the second half of the year, when investors knew the new tax rate on Cap Gains would be going up - you see that the market stagnated and even dropped.  This was the result of selling to lock in gains at the lower tax rates.  And we're forgetting, that shares owned before the 2009 financial crisis weren't even back to a point of showing a gain in many, many companies.  So that means less selling of those holdings - which reduced total selling of shares to avoid the higher taxes.The difference then vs. now is that at that time, our economy was finally picking up speed and momentum (remember, it was the slowest recovery ever from a recession in the USA).  The economy now is in a much more precarious situation.  We're hoping for a soft landing vs. a recession.  We're hoping that stagflation doesn't end up being the final result.So we have several significant factors - locking in gains at a lower rate in a market that is stretched in terms of multiples in an economy that is teetering between at best a soft landing and the alternatives being worse.As a nation we are over stretched in terms of our national debt and as consumers, we are carrying way too much personal debt - in a very high rate environment.This isn't a political statement - but knowing how things are right now and where we stand - I think (and I surely admit it's my opinion) that this will be a very big negative for the markets.  I know my personal reaction will be that if we elect a person who promises to raise capital gains taxes by 40% over where they are now, that I will move out of stocks and into other investments (money market, bonds, etc. . . ) and then buy back in after any notable pull back.  Not for avoiding capital gains (I don't make $1M/yr), just for anticipation of what I expect the market to do in such an event.  So in the worse case scenario and I am wrong, and I move out of equities and into bonds/MM and the market goes up 5% between the election and the end of the year - I've still locked in suitable gains for the year and have only forgone a small amount of additional gains had I stayed invested - noting that I would still see gains on my alternative investments.In my book for risk management at my age (proximity to retirement), this is simply a better risk management approach than hoping that after an inevitable Cap Gains tax rate hike the following year, that there isn't massive selling to lock in gains at the lower rate.","title":"Bernie Sanders: Harris' 28% capital gains tax proposal should be higher"},{"text":"Yeah, totally makes sense.

All the work that goes into tracking + maintaining voter registration each election cycle? Done, could be rolled into that system.And now *everyone* is automatically registered to vote, with no additional overhead. There could be a centralized system / service to track mailing addresses, which eg. USPS could now hook into to both reduce their own overhead and make mailing more accurate and efficient. Citizens / users could set security policies to determine who has access to what information. This doesn't have to be a security / privacy hell (though given the govt and our elected legislators GLHF with that)SSNs exist for 3 reasons, and assign a serial number to everyone born in / registered in the US for 1) tax filing, 2) social security, 3) military conscription.State drivers licenses are de-facto IDs, and are *already* de-facto federal IDs as described above with the Real ID act and full implementation as of 2014-25.In fact scrap all this, if you just want to implement trivial, easily verifiable voter ids at election booths just use realids (ie driver's licenses / state id cards) and write a state / federal app that can scan those cards and display the information on them (full name, picture, date of birth, citizenship status) using the already existing realid databases / webservices.And then agree to implement that - in this manner - in exchange for other concessions, like immigration reform, increasing funding for or mandating access to realid registration services, or what have you. Literally anything that dems care about.Maybe somewhat dubious that republicans would actually agree to this, but there is absolutely sane, bipartisan legislation that could be agreed upon here, that would *remove* a republican talking point, and demonstrate (I'd imagine) that no voter fraud actually exists.Note also that if Dems adamantly insist on opposing this concept, period, republicans probably *will* implement this the next time (if ever) they get a full govt trifecta, and dems will probably *not* like that implementation and may wish they'd agreed on bipartisan legislation instead.*Not*, to be clear, in exchange for just shutting down the goddamn govt, but in level headed talks and policy proposals that could be hashed out over several years.edit: And oh, but mail in ballots! No, you could definitely just use existing cross referenced realid records + voter registration records (and maybe additionally USPS records) to verify street addresses. And if you want to placate any of the particularly paranoid, just require a one time in person visit to your local DMV or whatever to verify / confirm that, and to this automatically as an opt-in service for all DMV visits and realid registration.But would make law enforcement - and ICE - a heck of a lot more effective.My point there - in case I was being too subtle about this - is that any modern and centralized ID system is / should be digitized. It is / *should be* pretty trivial to build sufficiently secure and restricted services / phone apps for use by law enforcement to at a minimum accurately look up individuals by stated name + DOB, and at most by facial recognition. This would have many real benefits - CHP would have this, and you'd no longer need to carry around *physical* (or on-your-phone) physical drivers' license cards, for fuck's sake. Actual / full verification of identity would be done in person w/ fingerprint readers, using information that, again, all exists on file under the realid system.This would also make ICE more effective. Though maybe they're doing this already so that's a moot point. Regardless that's probably the other half of dem's opposition to this.The other half ofc is the historic and ongoing efforts to suppress voting from african americans and/or young people.That said, the data you'd need to implement this is again all there. I stand corrected on my original comment: realid would be fully implemented as of 2025, and there's *no* additional registration or data collection that would be necessary to implement this. Probably by as soon as 2026-28 if you had to, and whatever software contractors the feds / states hired weren't completely incompetent.The main hazard of implementing this in a way that could be compromised for partisan interests would be leaving implementation details up to the states. Which is why pushing for a bipartisan implementation of this, with federal standards, backend services, and bipartisan (and fully open to the states / congress) auditing would all be a good idea.","title":"GOP opposition appears to doom Speaker Johnsons plan to avert shutdown"},{"text":"Snopes did an article this years - when the latest trove of Epstein information came out - that had a headline that made it sound like there was no information about Trump in the new data.If you read the article, it said that the data showed that Trump had flown on Epstein's plane six more times than were previously known.

It seems the current three-party system is unsustainable and will coalesce back into a two-party system, though a PN/BN merger will have difficulty absorbing the Islamist wing in a merged party.As for France, no I can't agree at all. France is firmly divided into three blocs with either bloc genuinely incompatible with the other two. Even if RN has detoxified their brand among voters, politicians even on the traditional right still identify them with the Nazis/Vichy. Macron's centrist (fiscal conservative, socially moderate) bloc will disintegrate in 2027, but his voters won't have a natural home to turn to, and so they will coalesce around a new party of the centre (maybe Edouard Philippe can build that). And as for the Left, they've never been united but were historically led by the Socialists. Mlenchon's radicals became the undisputed leader in 2017, but has since lost steam. Who will lead the Left going forward is an open question and the Socialists are obviously anxious about it. The median leftwing voter is more than willing to ditch the Socialists for Mlenchon if they smell treachery (such as joining forces with Macron). It's possible Macron's right flank will go back to the Rpublicains, while what's left of his left flank will go back to the Socialists, but I doubt that. And even if the Socialists return to the pre-dominant position to lead the centre-left, Mlenchon still has a hardcore base in the *banlieues* that isn't going away.And yeah I do hope for PR to come back. Ironically it's Le Pen calling for PR right now which is odd because she has a much better chance of winning a majority under the current system than she would under PR.","title":"Despite nominally using ranked choice voting, Alaska's 2024 House general election will actually be yet another two-person race between a Democrat and a Republican.

Its all tied to religion. Ive slowly realized that they are part of a fascist cult, and its safer and healthier for me to be as far away as possible and have no contact. Being that you are younger, and possibly still living with or near them, I would be VERY CAREFUL. Safety planning is unique to each individual person and situation- maybe google safety planning (domestic violence resources online may have some starting point questions to ask yourself.) without knowing you / or much about situation, I would consider anything from avoiding them/separating yourself IF that feels possible and safe to do, or playing along if that feels safer. You may know about fight or flight responses, but there are others (freeze, fawn, etc.) if running or fighting arent options, see if you can find ways to keep yourself safe while also preserving your wellbeing as much as possible and ability to vote. Id even consider lying to them that you changed your mind, IF that feels like an option that would work for you. Wishing you the best. Its such a hopeless situation. I dont believe ppl can change unless they want to, and it doesnt sound like your family wants to change. They are in too deep. (Sunk cost fallacy, etc.) stay safe! So glad you got out mentally. Be kind to yourself and patient while you figure out how to extract yourself from aspects of family that feel unsafe. Sometimes ppl get uglier after folks leave.

The top 1% owns 50% of all shares of stock traded in the market.  It is far smarter for them to realize their gains this year when the rate is 20% than to wait until next year when they are going to be taxed a LOT more (nearly 50% more in taxes to be paid).So, now the owners of 50% of stock shares are going to be selling them between the election and the end of the year.  What do you think happens to the markets?  Tons of selling - who's going to buy all those shares? You surely understand supply and demand factors.Now you're a 55 year old with $500,000 in your 401K.  The stock market drops 25% as a result of this massive selling.  You now have $375,000 in your 401K and need to get a return of 33% just to get you back to where you were today!  Yet, you're approaching retirement quicker than you realize.This actually has the potential to hurt the middle class investors (note that 62% of Americans own shares of stocks) more than the wealthy in the grand scheme of things.And trust me on this, the hedge funds and family funds that also have huge stock holdings will clearly see the same thing - so not only do you have the wealthy selling, but you also have a lot of the institutional investors selling - a 25% pull back may be a best case scenario.And it won't take long for the better informed middle income households that actually pay attention to this, the markets, etc. . . to do the same thing - move their investment selections out of stocks and into money market accounts just to protect their retirement savings.So now you've been told how this can affect the 61% of the population that owns stocks but don't make a million dollars a year and just how much this may impact them and their financial/economic conditions.","title":"Bernie Sanders: Harris' 28% capital gains tax proposal should be higher"},{"text":"Thank you for posting the actual video.
