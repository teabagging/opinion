It got everyday people saying \\"Yeah that wasn't good, lets not do it again\\"For a vibe to be good it needs three things: It's a benefit everyone shares, it's visible, and it's easy to communicate.  The vibe really just needs the last two and the first is really just dependent on who is broadcasting it (I.E. someones trash is another mans treasure)So vibes are broadbased and are simple to digest. They are conversation starters, much like the weather.Items that pass the Vibe Check* Higher or lower Gas Prices\\n* Higher or lower Groceries\\n* Higher or lower Housing costs\\n* Higher or lower TaxesItems that don't pass the vibe check* Higher or lower Wage Growth\\n* Higher or lower GDP Growth\\n* Higher or lower Unemployment\\n* Higher or lower Student Loan ForgivenessI think you get the point. Dems are the worst at messaging because they speak in conceptual language that no one outside of their bubble uses and when they push policies its specifically targeted to a small segment of society (I.E. Student Loan Forgiveness) that just make it easier for the opposition to pit one class against the other. Dems need to start talking about concrete things that everyone can relate to and understand and they need a media apparatus that is constantly talking about it on every platform that gets consumers. It's vibe economy ya'll and if we don't figure out how to use it, the republicans have shown us they already have.","title":"Matt Yglesias: A tale of two machines: Democrats need to stop shrinking the tent"},{"text":"Only reason true liberals are losing in places is because of aipac a genocide promoting superpac.","title":"Tlaib got 70% of the vote - Harris underperformed her by 12 points.

That's when the early March trump contradictions of his own administration on the widespread impact it would have. \\n   * From January through the end of February, CDC was trying to get emergency funds released and to get a head on tests, but Trump stymied testing because he believed reporting numbers of cases made him look bad. \\n   * Feb 25 - directly contradicting Nancy, Trump and his allies said it's completely contained\\n   * Feb 28 - Trump said the coronavirus would just disappear\\n   * March 2 - Trump said vaccines were imminent contradicting Fauci's estimation of 12-18 months\\n   * March 4- Trump insists there's enough tests directly contradicting Pence's comments on the need for testing and that the US doesn't have enough tests\\n   * It wasn't until March 9 that the world started to cancel events\\n   * In a world in which events are stopped a full month sooner, say end of January, you cut down the transmissions\\n   *  March 17 - Trump is publicly bashing blue state governors while behind the scenes the feds aren't coordinating and not giving the governors needed supplies and aren't giving governors the real briefings\\n* The white house paid $52m of taxpayer money on tests that didn't work.\\n   * [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air)\\n* Jared Kushner lead a team that had a centralized plan so states didn't compete with one another for supplies and kits and helped with regulatory red tape that got killed because Trump liked that blue states were impacted\\n* Non government groups like the Rockefeller Foundation had to step up and provide solutions that normally one would expect from Trump\\n* Trump would co-opt supplies going to blue states (which have more people) and re-route them to red states when transmissions of the virus impacted red states\\n* Trump was not in favor of a mask mandate\\n* April of 2020 - the mayor of Phoenix the 5th largest metro in the US, asked the feds for help and they said Phx didn't have enough enough reported cases but the mayor believed that's because the feds also didn't send enough reliable tests and tests weren't available. Meanwhile hospitals were slammed and there were 13 hour waits to just get a test\\n* We know these stories have credence because Trump said in May of 2020 that helping the blue states would be \\"unfair\\" to the red states [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-says-bailouts-unfair-gop-states-needing-aid-run-democrats-n1200116](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-says-bailouts-unfair-gop-states-needing-aid-run-democrats-n1200116)\\n* When states issued lockdowns to prevent the spread, Trump tweeted to his followers to protest and \\"liberate\\" themselves from the lockdownsSo I am really baffled that a person could be alive that would question his handling of the virus","title":"CMV: A bird flu pandemic worse than COVID is inevitable and imminent."},{"text":"I feel like women wised up and raised their standards for men and now straight Gen-Z men are in a crisis unable to date them- so they just get hateful and incel-like and towards the right.

Sadly Obama didn't have to go up against such a partisan government and people.  He had moderates like McCain and Romney that made up the Republican side and compromises could be made.  Today's government is so partisan that Obama wouldn't even be able to win and compromises are a thing of the past. In order for Dems to win back rural communities, simple direct talk will work best. Give direct examples of \\"capping this will reduce egg and milk prices to this. doing this will do this to you.\\" Dems focused too much on talking about how their plans affect the rich and corporations (while campaigning in urban areas) and not enough about it affects you this exact way out in \\"Bumrush, Kentucky.\\" They need to do what Pete Buttigieg did and sit across from them and talk directly to them.  Large crowds and podiums with the same speech won't get the job done.  Get dirty, go to small town halls and talk directly to them.  Get the VP doing the same in other places.  Start in states she should have won like PA, MI, WI. Maybe have policies that not only phase out coal, but bring the new forms of energy to those exact towns if possible.  So many small rural communities only have that type of industry keeping it alive.  So maybe replace the coal mines with a solar farm, or a wind farm, or if they are near rivers, hydro power.  Bring in some people who can really run it, and then give those people the ability to learn and replace that life.  Dems almost need to start back at square one.  They need Millennial and Gen Z votes (and start work on Alpha), Boomers are who they are and won't change, Gen X won't change and you won't find a person to really run from that generation.

No, Democrats would not be wise to support this:Take the [1912 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election): Roosevelt served as president from 1901 to 1909 as a Republican, and Taft succeeded him with his support. Taft's conservatism angered Roosevelt, so he challenged Taft for the party nomination at the 1912 Republican National Convention. When Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed, Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third-party bid. The Republican split enabled Wilson to win 40 states and a landslide victory in the electoral college with just 41.8% of the popular vote, the lowest vote share for a victorious presidential candidate since 1860.Or the [1860 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Democratic_National_Conventions): The Democratic convention reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, but many Southern delegates were either excluded from the convention or refused to participate. The convention adopted a platform in which it pledged to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon questions of Constitutional Law regarding slavery.[1] Douglas was ultimately nominated for president on the second ballot (the 59th ballot overall)[...] The Southern Democrats who had boycotted, or walked out of, the Baltimore convention held their own separate convention and adopted a pro-slavery platform, and nominated incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge for president, with Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon as vice president[...] James M. McPherson suggested in Battle Cry of Freedom that the Fire-eater program of breaking up the convention and running a rival ticket was deliberately intended to bring about the election of a Republican as president, and thus trigger secession declarations by the slave-owning states. Whatever the intent of the fire-eaters may have been, doubtless many of them favored secession, and the logical, probable, and actual consequence of their actions was to fragment the Democratic party and thereby virtually ensure a Republican victory.[6]When historians argue that members of a party may have intentionally split it in order to help the other side win, it's pretty clear that modern-day Democrats probably shouldn't support it, given our current political system.","title":"Should Democrats explore a message that the country needs more political parties?"},{"text":"Normal, mature move.

I think it's a byproduct of increasingly polarizing politics and it's not just limited to progressive spheres of influence. There is a growing trend among both progressives and conservatives of \\"here are our talking points and if you challenge them, you're the bad guy.\\" This is, in turn, a product of 21st century sensationalized journalism and click bait gotcha headlines. I think the lines between genuine artistic expression and rage bait are sometimes blurred, and hell maybe it's possible to be both. I don't envy the teachers and administrators at these schools who have to balance making the school feel like a welcoming place for all of their students against encouraging the creativity and expression of other students. It's a process that usually has no right answers. What I would caution people against is taking isolated incidents that are reported and highlighted in order to generate web traffic and then extrapolating it to the greater whole. Seeing one art show shut down by one school, or even 100 by 100 schools, is hardly representative of \\"progressive institutions\\" as a whole. There are over 5000 universities in the United States, most of which could at least arguably be called \\"progressive institutions\\".I think the *biggest* problem in politics and political discourse today is that we tend to identify the \\"side\\" that agrees most closely with our views by looking at ourselves and those close to us, and then look at the \\"side\\" we disagree with and characterize them by looking at the most extreme example that the media propaganda machines can find to slap a headline on. Most conservatives aren't represented by the Westborough Baptist Church, Project 2025, or the Confederate flag-waving extremists often shown on liberal media channels. Most liberals aren't represented by Antifa, eco-terrorists, or the overly cautious university staff who sometimes make bad calls and end up as headlines on conservative media.The fewer generalizations we make about the \\"other guys\\" based on sensationalized stories cherry picked from across the country, the closer we can get to bringing the country back together. The people in power want us fighting each other so we won't notice how badly they're fucking us.Edit: randomly perfect example of the counter point:https://www.reddit.com/r/NotHowGirlsWork/s/aPcRxaXrGJThis is hardly evidence of universities endorsing radical conservative ideology.","title":"CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism"},{"text":"Her and Casey had ads showing stuff they agree with Trump on.

Its fine that people use the term differently, but using the state to deliver hundreds of billions in benefits (often targeted at supporters like unions or post secondary graduates) is really not *neoliberal*. I thought deliverism fundamentally came out of progressive dissatisfaction with Obamas gradualism and this idea that big, splashy social welfare and industrial policies would win back voters. Second, I dont think theres really any evidence Democrats didnt pitch their policies well. The article cites Sherrod Brown as doing a good job of pitching the child credit, though of course we now know he also lost. The Democrats outspent the Republicans, surely they extensively tested what messages polled well and which didnt. Its simply an extraordinary claim at this point that this was a framing issue. Third, the focus on organizing and movements seems backwards. Nobody wants to sign up to dyspeptic organizations and collective struggle ffs. North Americans complain if their DoorDash order is late. There is zero appetite for collective struggle! Like, this entire quote about how effective BLM is just seems terminal left-grad student: Political scientist Deva Woodly shows how the Movement for Black Lives has developed a politics of care and specific practices, like healing justice, that connect personal pain and trauma to collective struggle.","title":"The Death of Deliverism"},{"text":"Truth is derangeder than fiction.","title":"I dont think Ive ever read a dystopian novel that feels as deranged as this moment.\\n"},{"text":"Maybe democrats should hold a primary and not strangle the clearly popular candidate with a moderate super team up, which is what happened to Bernie both times.

Where were those words before when they thought they were in the majority. I question the motivation. I personally hope that Trump looks deeper into Biden for the documents case and maybe others that went out of their way to persecute him. Think Letitia James and Alvin Bragg. Not necessarily to exact revenge but to set the precedent that if the left does it to the right, the right will do it to the left. I also hope 51 intel officials lose their security clearances.

There would be no leadership change at the RNC to supercharge our GOTV and election integrity efforts, and our nominee would have most likely been Mike Pence, the most milquetoast politician to ever live. Sure, Republican opinions of him wouldn't have soured because there would be no J6 in this timeline. But if Trump wins in 2020, we almost certainly take a beating in 2024 and revert back to the old Romney-era neocon Republican party and never win an election again for the foreseeable future.Losing in 2020 and then taking back the white house in 2024 gave Trump a clean slate to get better people into his administration and choose a VP who's more likely to carry the torch to a 2028 win.

(2 years being when voting happens again and we could lose the senate or something.) Even if we get all 4, they just aren't going to do everything in that project. I have not read the project but was able to gather info about it regarding women. One BIG concern they have is not being able to get the abortion pills. Personally I'm ok with a morning after, but after several weeks it is too hard on a woman's body. They don't want women to know that it isn't like birth control.

At Trumps rallies he was also hammering her over the clip from the View where she said nothing comes to mind when thinking about what she would have done differently over the last four years. To be fair, thats a very difficult question, butshe really had no response at all??And then the word salad thing one of which was the 60 Minutes response to a question about Israel where she said something like because of what weve done and the steps weve taken, weve been able to move Israel toward doing the things that should be done by pushing them forward step by step. Its a nothing answer that is also a bit winding and kind of circles back on itself.

At least be able to concisely answer questions with some specifics to project competence.

I'm not saying this is reality.  But this is definitely how it can look.  It's kind of like the Dems forgot they need regular white dudes in their coalition.  Walz was kind of a good choice to counteract this perception, but the Democrats really need to find some redneckish, progressive-enough white guys downballot.The Dems have a real problem not looking or sounding like the people they need to reach.  Or taking their social status and security issues seriously.  The tone is kind of \\"don't be such a baby that you don't make as much as you used to in this service job, this is what women have had to put up with forever.\\"  Which I don't take as their actual message, but again, perception reinforced by media outside the party.  That perceived message is DOA with the young white men the party really needs if it's ever going to fix the political gender gap.  \\nEDIT:  In media (music anyway) there's been such a huge focus on music by women, LGBTQ and nonwhite performers that you hardly even see white American guys in bands anymore outside country/Americana or obscure punk/metal stuff.  And they obviously aren't the leading pop stars or rappers.

Let Jack Smith do it and tell the world everything over the next 60 days, Biden can pre-emptively pardon Jack Smith for leaking the documents before he leaves office to make sure republicans don't go after him, but I have no doubt they will anyway. That's been done before and upheld. Maybe Biden can release the documents himself, he's old and may not give a shit. He is one of the few people in the world who know the full truth about what Trump did and is probably fucking pissed and full of rage right now.Giving out the evidence won't ruin any court cases because they will never happen anyway. They may sway voters in 2026/2028 or help people realize that they've been swindled. Maybe it does nothing.

If we don't learn it before Trump takes office, everything gathered during the investigations will be destroyed and history will always be debating whether Trump was actually a traitor to America or not.

The Western depopulation agenda (NSM 200, Jafe memo, the \\"overpopulation\\" issue being quietly shelved with the last UN conference on it taking place in the 1990s, Club of Rome in the 1990s declaring humanity to be the enemy, anti-natalism pushed in corporate media, etc.)2. A significant segment of the ruling class, especially among establishment \\"liberals\\", favors eugenics (dig into \\"effective alturism\\", for example, and you'll find an underlying eugenics agenda)3. The post-Occupy \\"woke\\" cooption of progressivism much more aggressively promotes lifestyles less likely to lead to reproduction while demonstrating the threat, to the non-\\"woke\\", of a society decoupled from traditionThe ruling class in many societies, whether \\"capitalist\\" or \\"communist\\", are willing to kill very large numbers of fellow humans to advance their agendas. And the ruling class pretty much universally have little regard for what the Nazis deemed \\"useless eaters\\". Ergo a depopulation agenda with a eugenics strategy of some sort (either \\"positive\\", to breed a strong society that can conquer others, or \\"negative\\", to breed a weak society that can be more easily controlled) shouldn't come as a big surprise.Aldous Huxley got a lot right in \\"Brave New World\\" about the future we were headed towards. His father was notably the president of the UK Eugenics Society. Planned Parenthood, as many know, originated from eugenics ideology.

People are unaware that Covid is still a very serious threat, just a different kind at this point in time: the threat isn't death, it's disability. Covid should be viewed as a toxin akin to cigarette smoking  it (likely) won't kill you if you get it a few times, but it does serious damage to practically every organ in the body. The neurological effects are so severe that a recent studied indicated driving with Covid is equivalent to driving at around the legal BAC limit. A single bout of mild Covid leads to the equivalent of ~7 years of brain aging and a 3-point IQ loss. If that effect is cumulative (and there's no reason to think it's not), then that means that after 3 Covid infections (which is not unusual), IQ would drop 9 points. I would imagine there is a limit as to how much Covid can harm IQ, but that's just speculation. A 9-point IQ drop can put some people in the lower end of normal into the intellectually disabled category. And none of this even touches on the absolute decimation Covid brings to the immune system, which is why people are getting sick more often, why mycoplasma pneumoniae is a trending search right now, etc. And then there's carcinogenicity, cardiac damage, etc. If bird flu hits a population that has weakened immune systems from the ongoing Covid pandemic, is so tired of pandemics that they don't take it seriously, and is experiencing neurological side effects that reduce their capabilities to intelligently deal with threats, we will be in a very bad place.EDIT: Surprised I'm getting upvoted.

But compared to 2020, Trumps margins this time were 11 points better among young voters, 12 points better among rural voters, 25 points better among Latino voters and 33 points better among Latino men. Those stats go a long way toward explaining where Trumps margin of victory came from.As for Harris, the exits show her improving on Bidens 2020 margin among white, college-educated voters by seven points. Among college-educated white?*women*, her margin was 11 points better than Bidens. But that wasnt enough to offset Trumps gains among voters without a college degree  particular non-college voters of color  which helped him narrowly flip the suburban vote and lose by less in key cities like Philadelphia.How much of this had to do with Harris being a woman of color? No idea. Probably some. But given Bidens historic unpopularity and this years terrible right-track/wrong-track numbers, I suspect Democrats might have lost this election even if the incumbent vice president had been a white man.","title":"We are reporters from five newsrooms covering the 2024 election results.

Jeff Jackson has won North Carolinas attorney generals race. The Associated Press called the race for Jackson at 11:32 p.m. on Tuesday, just over four hours after polls closed in the Tar Heel State. Jacksons GOP opponent, U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, addressing supporters at an election night watch party in Monroe shortly after 11 p.m., thanked his campaign staff and conceded to the Democrat, who will ensure his party maintains control of the powerful attorney generals office for another four years.Republicans hoped Bishop, a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus who was elected to Congress in 2019, could reverse a 128-year drought for the GOP in North Carolina attorney general races. Even as the party took back control of the General Assembly in 2010 and won the 2012 governors race, it continued to struggle in contests for attorney general.It was close, but we won, Jackson said late Tuesday night, at the N.C. Democratic Partys election night party in downtown Raleigh. Jackson thanked voters, his small but mighty campaign team, and his family, who joined him on stage. The incoming attorney general thanked his Democratic predecessors Josh Stein and Roy Cooper, both of whom went on to win races for governor. In particular, he mentioned Steins work to hold opioid manufacturers accountable and Coopers leadership. Speaking with reporters after his victory speech, Jackson said he planned to work with the General Assembly to strengthen our defenses against scammers who rely on artificial intelligence. He also said there would be a transition period leading into his new role, and said he expects to meet with Stein, who just served two consecutive terms as attorney general. Hell give me a sense of issues that are still ongoing, and well have a number of candid conversations about that, Jackson said.# Bishop concedes and addresses his political futureTonight, our run of success has reached its end, Bishop told supporters who had gathered at the Hilltop Fish Fare &amp; Steakhouse. For the thousands of friends Jo and I have made across North Carolina and America, for our volunteers and donors and campaign team, and for the millions of North Carolinians who cast their vote for me: Im disappointed to have fallen short. Bishop said he was eager to lead the restoration of law and order in North Carolina. To be a champion for the men and women of law enforcement, who richly deserve one, he said. And to reinvigorate the North Carolina Department of Justice to pursue the law and justice rather than ideology. Still, Bishop said, he was grateful to have been in the arena not for ambition or pride but for the privilege of fighting on your behalf for the state and country that we love. Bishop went on to say I want the last words I likely say on a public stage as a candidate for office to be this: I praise a mighty God whose plan is perfect. He said hes considering some work in the private sector after the election loss. MOST EXPENSIVE ATTORNEY GENERAL RACEThe attorney generals race was already expected to be one of the most competitive on the ballot this year, but it received even more attention after the governors race was upended by a scandal involving racist, sexually graphic, and antisemitic online comments allegedly made by GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, who already trailed in the polls, and in fundraising. As Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein cemented a substantial polling lead over Robinson for governor, additional resources poured into what both attorney general campaigns expected to be, by contrast, a much closer contest. At 11:26 p.m. and with 86% of the states precincts reported, Jackson held a 52%-48% lead. Jackson, the first-term TikTok-savvy congressman, raised a total of $15.4 million as of mid-October, while Bishop, a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus who has been in Congress since 2019, raised nearly $9 million. Spending by allied groups was expected to bring overall ad spending in the race closer to parity. The two campaigns and the political action committees supporting them expected to spend at least $31 million on both TV and online ads through Election Day, the Associated Press reported last week, citing data from the firm AdImpact, which tracks political ad spending. That sum is believed to make this years attorney general race the most expensive in U.S. history, according to both campaigns. The 2020 race, by comparison, saw Democrats vastly outspending Republicans, roughly $12 million to $2 million, according to AdImpact.GOP HASNT WON AN AG RACE IN NC IN MORE THAN A CENTURY The GOP hasnt won an attorney general race in North Carolina in 128 years, but managed to come close in other recent contests, which were decided by razor-thin margins. Stein defeated Republican Buck Newton to win his first term in office in 2016 by 24,613 votes, or 0.54%. In 2020, Stein won reelection while running against Republican Jim ONeill by an even closer margin of just 13,622 votes, or 0.26%. As the states top law enforcement official, the attorney general leads the N.C. Department of Justice and represents the state in all legal matters. The attorney general can also intervene in court proceedings at both the state and federal level, and handles criminal appeals from state trial courts. Jackson has identified combating the fentanyl crisis as his top priority if elected, while Bishop has said he will prioritize helping law enforcement across the state restore law and order.","title":"A Bright Spot for Democrats"},{"text":"Interesting take.

We used to worship men of caliber; men of character held that office.\\nIts always had the back room deals, and politics. Im not pretending people like Jackson and Hoover didnt exist. But you had to be a person of *substance* to be president. Some of the most intelligent men of their times have held that office. And we just reelected the least intelligent of them all.Was it the Covid checks? Do people think those are coming back? How about the tariffs, the things that literally only have and can raise OUR prices and not hurt others. Do they think he can bring back jobs? He cant. The president, even his twisted ghoul of an office, simply cannot unilaterally order a company to bring all its manufacturing back to the U.S. its impossible! The mechanism simply doesnt exist!Was it the two wars started under Biden that we have no troops involved in? How is any of that his fault?So I have to lay back on the one thing that is always true in this place. The other has to be punished. Immigrants are about to be rounded up like cattle.

Roy Cooper and Josh Stein, who replaced Cooper as attorney general in the 2016 elections and will now replace him as governor.Jackson, 42, currently represents a Charlotte-area district in the U.S. House of Representatives as does Bishop. Before that he was a member of the state Senate.Jackson ran as basically a normal person, as he said in one ad, seeking to paint Bishop as an extremist who should not be trusted in the role of attorney general.Bishop is best known as the lead author of the 2016 law colloquially known as HB2 that banned cities from enacting pro-transgender local ordinances and led to a national boycott of North Carolina.The state has not elected a Republican attorney general for more than 125 years.\\"I'm disappointed I have fallen short,\\" Bishop said in a statement to supporters. \\"For them, I was eager to lead the restoration of law and order in North Carolina, to be a champion for the men and women of law enforcement who richly deserve one and to reinvigorate the NC DOJ to pursue the law and justice rather than ideology.\\"Jackson, now a major in the Army National Guard, enlisted in the U.S. Army after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He served in Afghanistan at a remote desert outpost with about two dozen Americans, he said, where as a low-ranking soldier he participated in missions into pretty hostile parts of Afghanistan in 2005 and 2006. Jackson said there was lots of civil service work, as well  drilling wells, building schools and passing out supplies.He said that service has influenced his political career.Serving in the military is about working in small teams in order to accomplish a mission, Jackson told WRAL previously. And you get so much practice with that, that you become pretty good with being thrown into a team, figuring out what peoples strengths are and how to use those strengths and then being very mission focused after that.Jackson attended law school on the GI Bill and worked as an assistant district attorney in Gaston County from 2011 to 2014. Jackson said he started on speeding and drunk-driving cases but worked on murder, sex offense and drug trafficking cases before he left for the state Senate.He was elected to Congress in 2022, but his Democratic district was recently redrawn by state lawmakers into a safe Republican seat, won Tuesday by state House Speaker Tim Moore.Stein has campaigned this year by pointing to his record as attorney general, including using the office to target pharmaceutical companies over the opioid epidemic, big tech companies over antitrust violations and vaping company JUUL over marketing to children.Consumer protection actions such as those are a large part of the offices duties, and the attorney general has wide latitude in choosing which companies to target  or not  for alleged violations.The office also manages the state crime lab, which analyzes drugs, DNA, ballistics and other evidence. It also handles all appeals in criminal cases.And the office has the ability to engage in political lawsuits.Stein went to court multiple times to fight the Trump administration on issues such as health care and a travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. Republican attorneys general across the country have fought the Biden administration on issues such as student loan debt forgiveness and climate change efforts.Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton also filed a lawsuit in late 2020 attempting to help overturn the results of that years presidential election, which Bishop signed onto with a supportive brief.\\"","title":"A Bright Spot for Democrats"},{"text":"Operation Northwoods","title":"Let me know if this is too far out there and Im just crazy,but I absolutely believe this"},{"text":"Damn, do I have to download til tok for the comments v_v","title":"Democrats this morning"},{"text":"It's over for the Simpsons if they astroturfed this","title":"Simpsons prediction fails - for once - as Kamala Harris loses presidential election"},{"text":"Plus Biden said in an interview that they had the most elaborate vote fraud setup ever.

Trying to explain economics to a college student vs a midlife homeowner is pointless.\\nThis is why as people get older they slide right.Once you have real world experience an wisdom not from a text book it changes your world view.I was liberal in college... I slid right after learning how the world works in practicality not hypothetically. I'm an educated veteran that is a registered independent.\\nI vote policy over party.My views tend to land more conservative.Trump spoke about real world things that need changed.Dems talked fear how the world was gunna end an that america is great right now..if you disagree with them Your a nazi an support hitler.We need a good border \\nWe need to enforce laws on immigration.I belive in a woman's right to choose let them do what they want..\\nIm also fine with let  the states decide.\\nWhat is controversial about leting people vote thats the entire point right..no one is baning stuff there voting on policy..go vote an change it.I believe in LGBT freedoms who cares. I also believe you should not shove it in people's  face an call people names that disagree with you.The left constantly name calling an fear mongering is what lost my vote.Post after post on reditt an the media calling people every foul name you can think of for not agreeing with them.. lost my vote.An ill be downvoted for this here on reditt because it's mostly a liberal site..I know this.But I hope some of you read it an maybe just maybe stop calling people names that don't agree with you. Try an understand there issues not just ram home your own interests..politics is about compromise not demonize untill you get your way.Listen ..the otherside is not demons or nazis there your friends an neighbors.\\nNot everything is racist or sexist an ist ect..just because someone does not like your ideas.Because you chased away this vote ..an I hate that I had to vote Trump but you left me no other choice.An no the lawsuits an all the other crap throw at Trump did not matter to me.\\n It was very clear that it was political mud slinging. Just the fact that people chant 34 felonies..when it was 1 charge that was multiplied is a joke.The sexual shit..read the lawsuits.\\nDig in an read about the cases not just the headlines.\\nThe stolen election lawsuits..read about it.They would not even hear most his cases because of the implications they didn't want the public to get about our elections.The left claims to be so educated. But so few of you read or watch his speeches to see for yourself.I watched the hrs long speeches on YouTube  an then saw how the media would misquote him an bam reditt would go nuts ..That was really shocking to me ..to actually watch his speech an then see it misquoted an swallowed in real time!\\nThat had a big infulance on me. I saw with my own eyes an ears things he said taken out of context.\\nYou should go back an do some research not just swallow the headlines  an chant along.Hopfully in 2028 there will be fresh young candidates..\\nAn hopfully the left will stop being the party of hate an identity politics.Im sure this is filled with spelling an Grammer issues..the left like to be pedantic on reditt.\\nIf your saying  something they don't like.\\nIf my writing is to bad for you to understand it doesn't matter..you didn't make it this far down anyway lol.Goodluck to everyone","title":"Kamala Harris to Concede Election to Donald Trump"},{"text":"This was the leftist goal the whole time anyway","title":"Let Trump's victory end liberal America's naivet"},{"text":".11. misogynyplease continue this list","title":"Top 10 Reasons the Democrats Lost the Election (in Their Own Minds)"},{"text":"You'd rather have Trump and possibly lose the Republic entirely?","title":"How Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid"},{"text":"I truly hope Trump follows through on his mass deportation plans.
