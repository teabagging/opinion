I don't get the point. They spend forever talking about how bigotry is a real driving force behind Trumpism thanks to social media, and how bigotry is not just a white thing and how Trump tapped into those anxieties. Then they just jump to saying Dems need to listen to these voters. So Dems should be more racist and xenophobic? That's not really a solution. They don't explain what Dems should be saying instead.Also this section struck me as kind of ridiculous:Several days before the election, I watched a shoplifter run out of a discount retail department store. It was 1 pm. The mans hands were full of clothes and other things he had stolen. He then got on a bicycle and rode away as a woman security guard tried to catch him. The shoplifter mocked and laughed at her. They were both Black. All of us watching this fracas were Black. My eyes met the eyes of an older woman who was standing next to me. She looked at someone else. Their eyes met. As a group, we just shook our heads in disgust. I heard some choice expletives and this has to stop come out of my mouth followed by that fool had better pray that Trump doesnt win. So one shoplifting incident means Trump should win? As if shoplifting has never happened before? How did this one incident effect them? Obviously stealing is bad, but we'll never have zero crime, even if we go with Trump's crazy ideas. This is an irrational position and is why it's so hard to listen to the \\"working class,\\" whoever that is. Dems should not try to emulate the GOP by suggesting shooting shoplifters. They can be tougher on crime, but simply copying the GOP isn't going to work. There has to be an alternative presented, and the most obvious one is a more reasonable approach.

Global policies talk about how worldwide trends in economics work. Globalism is a word whose definition tends to nebulous but I would argue that the most coherent definition is the permission given through the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions and the US securing the seas that employers can offshore labor to countries where labor is cheaper, hollowing out the American manufacturing sector and driving down economic resiliency for low-skilled and semi-skilled laborers. Notice how these are both related to \\"worldwide policies\\" but one of them is specifically about the fungibility of labor when transportation becomes a vanishingly small cost and the other is about everything that happens in the world as a combined system.Second, I would point to u/Irish8ryan 's comment (which has numerous specifics) explaining exactly how Biden has actually done more to prevent employers from using offshore labor than any previous president. The inflationary cost rises were primarily a result of the pandemic recovery and had nothing to do with Globalist policies, which, as I pointed out, Biden opposed.Third, I would point out that a large-scale economic downturn has only ever been exacerbated by the introduction of trade barriers. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which is one of the most protectionist tariffs issued in US History is agreed by most economists to have worsened the Great Depression by encouraging retaliatory tariffs from other countries, which crashed demand for US products. A global solution when it comes to trade is essential in combatting long-term inflation and such a solution does not require offshoring labor but rather making American products more competitive such that foreigners can afford them.

When you look at the bigger factors for inflation - it had to do with the covid lock down caused tightness in the labor market. [https://epicforamerica.org/the-economy/uncovering-the-true-causes-of-inflation-during-the-biden-harris-administration/](https://epicforamerica.org/the-economy/uncovering-the-true-causes-of-inflation-during-the-biden-harris-administration/)And that's why people show that it was a world wide phenomenon. That's to say that no one policy maker is primarily responsible when every advanced economy had the same impact. That is a pretty easy logical chain from: Biden didn't cause therefore you can't blame Biden's policies for having caused.?free trade, high immigration, not enforcing laws against illegal immigrationTwo things here: First, none of these are the causes of inflation. We can just look at free trade, which has existed for decades, and we haven't had decades of inflation. We know that X can't cause Y if Y predates X. Simple logic. Second, even if there was \\"no enforcement\\" of \\"illegal immigration\\" that doesn't cause inflation either. But regardless, it just isn't true that Biden is in favor of \\"high immigration\\" and/or \\"doesn't enforce against illegal immigration.\\" and handwave the consequences is absurdNobody was \\"handwaving\\" the consequences. What they're doing is following a simple cause/effect on these issues. If you wanted to talk about inflation, for instance, then looking at the consequences of policy proposals would disqualify Trump for the \\"we care about inflation\\" people. Why? Because we all know what tariffs do to consumer prices. It creates costs that increases prices. That's just easy. What we also know is that tightness in the labor market causes inflation. And when you deport populations of people without any plan for replacing their labor in the market, you'll cause more inflation.","title":"CMV: saying it's a global phenomenon isn't a valid excuse when you support globalist policies"},{"text":"..and they don't keep it all for themselves.

Furthermore, can you articulate why you believe isolationist policies would alleviate inflation in any way?  In short, if you think recent increases to cost of living now are bad, imagine what would happen if fruit and vegetables all of a sudden need to be picked by legal workers who must get paid at least minimum wage and, theoretically, have at least some protections around workplace safety and overtime wages.  Same goes for housing in the construction industry.  Its hard, demanding work, and getting legal workers to fill all of those roles would cost a lot of money in higher wages. Georgia famously tried cracking down on illegal immigrants working on farms years ago and [it didnt go well](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/ga-immigrant-crackdown-backfires-057551).[Georgia created] a program to link the states 100,000 probationers with farmers looking to fill positions, the vast majority of which pay less than $15 per houras many as two-thirds of probationers who have tried working on the two farms in the last week have either walked off the job or not come back for a second day.That was in 2011 when then economy was still recovering from the Great Recession. If less than $15/hr didnt work then, even for probationers desperate for work, then its definitely not going to work now.For an idea of the impact an extreme labor shortage and rapidly rising wages in the food industry can do, look no further than Russia. Theyre reportedly short by 5 million employees, and the central bank interest rate is up to 23% to try and slow inflation. For comparison, the US Central Bank topped out at 5.5% to control inflation before recently dropping it back down below 5% as inflation has slowed, with further rate cuts likely to come.","title":"CMV: saying it's a global phenomenon isn't a valid excuse when you support globalist policies"},{"text":"Obviously I know about the NED, if I'm posting about western imperialism  and I already said I wouldn't be surprised if they were involved in 1998.You're conflating the Beijing Spring of 1979 with the Beijing Spring of 1997-98.

All other things equal, if after a certain arbitrary amount of time you see country A is impacted by Y phenomenon, while country B isn't, you can safely conclude that policy X caused Y. This is the same logic proper to scientific experimentation: given two identical groups, treat one and not the other, and see what happens afterwards. In so far as both groups remain the same, except for the treatment, you'll know any change in the treated group will be due to said treatment.In the same way, if identical countries A and B implement different policies, but both suffer the same effect, then the effect was probably not caused by their policies but some other common trait shared by A and B. This is what people are essentially referring to when they talk about inflation being a global phenomenon: only the USA is governed by Biden/Harris, but most of the world suffered from inflation, therefore the inflation was probably not caused by anything Biden/Harris did in particular but some other global phenomenon (like the after shocks of the war in Ukraine, or the pandemic). This is not necessarily valid reasoning, but that's not relevant right now (for instance different policies may cause the same result, and identical countries don't exist), the point is that this is not an excuse but an argument.An argument you seem to agree with at that?

You did not signal flaws. That commenter had pointed out an example in which forced or undercompensated labor were not employed yet someone still ends up a billionaire sue to their product being massively succesful (which does happen)...and you cynical leftoids had to immediately dismiss the example and arbitrarily make it exploitative. We call that confirmation bias, since you're not even willing to acknowledge cases that go against your narrative. You started out claiming you did not uphold the labour theory of value...only to use it as a base of your argument to try to morally shame us. That's just the typical weasel gaslighting leftoids use in these conversations. Libertarianism was never a morally bereft philosophy until it was co-opted by modern conservatives who found that label distasteful and heard \\"individual freedom\\" as a call to ignore the exploitative nature of capitalism. Right wing libertarianism existed before you were even around to bitch about systems you don't even understand yet choose to demonize. My argument isn't that wealth creation is a zero-sum game. Clearly, it's not. It's that at every level, the people actually involved in the creation of that wealth do not receive just compensation for their part. For this to be true, you should prove that every single billionaire's fortune was made by undercompensating everyone else in the line of production, which is false. There's cases of all kinds. The onus isn't necessarily on Rowling and Kamprad, but on everyone along the way who had an opportunity to provide more for others but decided not to. \\"Greed is good\\" up to a point, but after that, it's just greed, and it's not good. Then you concede that billionaires can make their fortunes ethically? Awesome, because it happens way more often than bitter, jealous, terminally online whiners claim. Even Adam Smith wouldn't argue that the inequality in today's world is just. To argue that it is, again, isn't part of libertarian philosophy. It's just ignorance and moral disregard.\\nOh dear, if you think the world today is unequal and that modern billionaires are too rich, wait to see how big the fortunes of Indian, Native American, Chinese and Roman emperors were and how much power they had over others lives: The equivalent to  hundreds of billions up to trillions of modern dollars and real armies under their command. Private citizens could barely even dream about ever reaching those heights. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have nothing on those royals, but they show a significant change for good in our world, as flawed it may be: you no longer need to be a noble to be wealthy. The gap between the top and bottom is rather closing irregularly, but still closing. Even if we go to more recent examples like J.D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, those guys still dwarfed the richest men of nowadays.We still have a long way to go, but its most likely Adam Smith, even if he did not like everything, would rather praise our advances. He lived in a world where mass famines that killed millions were still a thing common people had to worry about, after all....and that's not the worst. \\nYour accusations of demagogy, zero-sum fallacy, and moralist gaslighting sound like common retorts to criticisms of capitalism that don't necessarily address my argument. I adressed and demolished all your points, you just can't read anything you don't like. Well, maybe demogogy, but I don't think raising moral objections to an issue is grounds for dismissal. I could just as easily accuse you of hegemony, but in good faith, I wouldn't dismiss your argument because of it. Good faith? You? Lol, mate,? your points were fully loaded bad faith from the start and you didn't even  bother to consider my points. No moral superiority nor playing the victim for you fella.

It usually doesnt get it perfect, so I take what it gives me, and I just use it as a reference as I remake it by my own hand.Also, is not always right, and it makes mistakes about 10% of the time, which I think forces the user to become more familiar with what theyre doing so they can correct its mistakes. If i just let AI do everything for me, then nothing would really turn out the way I want it to.","title":"CMV: there is no ethical use of AI  by students"},{"text":"I really wish more people understood this. ?Deflation isnt happening. ?Prices arent going down.?Former fed chairman Ben Bernakie suggested the government should throw money out of helicopters to prevent deflation, thats how bad the federal reserve views deflation. ?","title":"Centrist Democrats should stop blaming progressives for Harriss loss: Whether to use he/she pronouns in emails wasnt a factor in the Harris-Trump race."},{"text":"Thats not really the point, discussion is always very welcomed.

I am as inclusive and non-bigoted as they come, and I know the reality of the Dems positions on these issues, but I also know how these issues were perceived by the masses of low information votersand these culture war issues ABSOLUTELY were a factor in the GOPs favor. There is no doubt. And its not about whether the Dems did, or did not, actually take these policy positions, its about how it appears to average Americans after being manipulated by the rights propaganda machine. I personally know dozens and dozens of people who are/were disgusted by what right wing propaganda told them the Democrats wanted to do with respect to issues like trans people, gay people, religious rights, etc. And the fact is, whether its culture war issues or actually-important issues, the underlying problems for the Dems is that they did, yet again, exactly what they always do (and dont do), which is - 1) A terrible, horrible, no-good job of messaging; specifically, they did NOT clearly communicate on ANY of the issues that were a factor in peoples voting choices in 2024and sometimes they didnt even attempt to address thembut when they did try, not only did they ignore the use of the correct mediums (legacy news networks vs social media, podcasts, etc), but when they did make an attempt, it was in a bland, weak kneed, ineffective fashion which not only didnt reach the target audience, but also left them wide open to ridicule &amp; attacks. For instance - Im sorry, but Id bet you that the vast majority of Americans do NOT think biological males should be competing in womens sports. And I perceive the majority of Dems also dont support that. So rather than hem and haw, or worse, appear to be defending it, or worst of all - supporting it - STOP worrying about hurting the feelings of .001% of the voting population and clearly and concisely and powerfully concur with what mainstream America wants, and dont worry about hurting the feelings of those 3-4 trans athletes per state who think they should be able to compete. On a non-culture war front, the Dems ALSO sucked at messaging on the Afghanistan withdrawal, support for Ukraine, inflation, the economy, the infrastructure bill, etc. etcand in each and every case they actually DID what was right, but they were abject failures when it came to telling Americans about it. 2) Unforced Errors - whether w/ Identity politics, Gaza, etc. Closely related to the above, but this is the actions aspect of it, versus the messaging part. For instance - I dont care one bit if Biden wanted to hire a trans person to a public facing, important role, IF that person were the best person for the job, but the reality is that the way Biden went about it was terrible, because it looked to everyone like he was hiring a trans person to an important departmental, public facing role, purely because he wanted to hire a trans person, periodand honestly? That was probably the truth!! Because then that person turned out to be a petty criminal and Fox News made hay for weeks and weeks. Thats just 1 of many, many examples. Other examples of unforced errors would be Bidens over the top, way-too-long and-too-much military support for Israel, or perhaps worst of all - NOT pushing, publicly, hard, and FAST - for the prosecution of Trump after Jan 6. I know Biden doesnt control the Justice department, but I also know he could damn well have been at the podium daily for the first 3 months talking about how he hoped the Justice Department would IMMEDIATELY hold the guilty parties accountable in order to protect our democracy. But nothey just ignored it. Aside from incompetent messaging and shooting their own feet off, I will also add - a very large part of America is sick and tired of identity politics and their perception that the Dems are more interested in pandering to every single ostracized minority group, and more interested in protecting the not-critical sensibilities of tiny portions of the population here and there (human rights  pronouns - they are not of the same importance!).than governing for the masses. I dont buy into this at all as its not accurate IMObut what I think, as someone who closely follows current events and politics, is the outlierthe average low voter information voter is getting the wrong message, because the Dems cant message effectively themselves, and there is a massive right wing propaganda machine custom built to exploit all of the Dems messaging failures and unforced errors. Man Im so frustrated. Im just an average guy w/ no career experience in public relations or politicsbut I have no doubt that if the DNC called me today and said wed like to hire you to run our public relations / messaging.I could do a 200% better job than the nincompoops who have been in charge for the last 8 years !!!","title":"Centrist Democrats should stop blaming progressives for Harriss loss: Whether to use he/she pronouns in emails wasnt a factor in the Harris-Trump race."},{"text":"God is he stupid","title":"Will There Be a Bird Flu Epidemic Under Trump?"},{"text":"They gameplanned exactly what would happen as guise for an MTX they even had media head discussing how they would report on it.

He was granted a position on this board in 2014 when his father Joe Biden was the vice president and completely in charge of US foreign policy interests in Ukraine (Obama had given Biden authority to take charge in ukraine during his presidency).

Which is it? all AI companies are for-profitAre you saying that for-profit operations are unethical? If so, why? Simply pointing out the monetary incentives isnt enough to claim: unethical! AI is extremely expensive to operateWhy is this relevant to you? High operating costs  unethical. No AI company is currently profitable.Why is this relevant to you? Not profitable ?unethical. free AI is offered as a loss leader. There must be some external motivation for doing so.You nailed it. Companies are motivated by things. What specific potential motivations are you actually worried about? if a generation of workers cant work without AI, the AI host can demand any price for access to it, from either their employer or the worker.You ignore the THOUSANDS of AI companies existing today. While pricy, any individual can train their own AI without depending on an AI company. An AI company with a comparable model in the market would not be able to price gouge effectively. If they demanded an outrageous price, a company or individual would simply switch to a more cost-effective solution. Unsure if you implied this, but I dont see any case where an employer requires the use of a 3rd-party AI that the employee would pay for. The company would foot that bill in 99% of cases with no burden to the employee. Any disruption of generational skill transfer by AI risks creating this AI dependence and thus creating dictatorship.I dont see a relevant connection between generational skills and dictatorship. Youre assuming a monopolistic system is at play, yet the AI market seems to be booming with competition and everyone is trying to keep up.

I have no doubt that a Trump administration will withhold information or not take it as seriously as it should.  If it becomes a serious epidemic, based on our American dietary habits, millions will be hospitalized and many will die.  If Trump and his administration get on tv and tell people to not drink milk or eat any chicken, or turkey for an extended period of time, most people wouldnt take it seriously.  Hospitals didnt have the ability to handle COVID patients and they certainly cannot handle bird flu, especially since a lot of hospitals have closed since 2020-2021.

Such as blatantly showing the people there is, in fact, a multi-tier justice system. Taking away social protections for self enfranchisement of the elite. Etc.

There is a trend that I expect to take place where local ai models will be replacing much of the assistants we have on our phone, in our cars on our PCs.This lessens a company's percieved liability, rumors of data manipulation or scraping data because the model is pretrained and a fixed size. Google is already doing this with some functions like gemini nano (i think it's called) the local text summary/replacement and so on features will be offloaded to the local models that will run on your phone.Those tasks will only take 5 to 6 seconds max, because people won't tolerate much longer tbh. This can be accomplished with very small models.Meta released a 405B (405 billion parameter model) but also released a 1b version that is still very capable. They also quantized this model with a Qlora making it run even faster on local devices. So you can clearly see this is a goal of companies that aren't OpenAI, to let you run these things on your own devices, reducing required power and reducing reliance on companies that provide the computing.The speed of these models depends on their size. I can run a 70B model on my laptop but it would output at 1token a second or something which would be nearly unusable.The 14B model I was using is still very capable and did about 40 tokens per second I believe, this is just faster than I can read so as i'm reading it's response it's generating fast enough to not cause any delay to me. The 32B model i mentioned is a bit slower but still totally usable, and just because this model is \\"smaller\\" doens't mean it's weaker, benchmarks are showing it beats chatgpt. In a year or so these models will likely be improved and our PC hardware will be enen faster on average making all of this far more accessible for the average user.These older models will still be free and available and if your computer in 3 years is overall more powerful you'll still be able to run very very capable models on your own PC.","title":"CMV: there is no ethical use of AI  by students"},{"text":"Not likely, More like slowly tightening the nose on what information people get and focus even more dividing urban and rural by class.

The ICCPR, [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights), (signed in 1966) is one of those many UN treaties that the USA preaches but doesn't follow.  Part 3 talks of the \\"right to vote\\" which is hardly followed in the USA.  The US \\"opts out\\" of several articles.Snider is correct about why the US was hoping for \\"liberal reforms\\", but he -- like you -- conflates the very contradictory meanings of \\"social liberal\\" with \\"economic liberal\\".  The ICCPR isn't really a \\"liberal\\" document in the very narrow definition of what \\"liberal\\" means that most people ascribe to.  \\"Economic Liberalization\\", which is what the US government is actually selling under the guise of promoting democracy, is the free movement of capital which is just another way of describing \\"globalism\\" or neo-colonialism often referred to as neo-liberalism.  Only when the veneer of \\"Social Liberalism\\" is stripped away, can one truly understand the American Oligarchy's pursuit of hegemony and empire and their duplicitous support of the ICCPR.Part 5 clarifies this, especially when one understands that \\"all peoples\\" really means just the Oligarchy.  After all, how much capital do you and I have to move globally?

LLM's are going to become an essential part of wedding through or navigating all of the information produced and creating more. Learning how effectively use that tool is already becoming an important part of the global workforce. And Basic education is meant to prepare students to be part of the workforce or to move on to higher education. So not only would I say that students using AI (LLMs) is completely ethical. I would say it essential for them to be prepared for their exposure to it as members of the workforce in adulthood.

Let me break this down:1). Profit Motive and AI CompaniesIts true that AI companies are for-profit entities and that their current operations are often not sustainable. However, this isnt unique to AIeducation relies on plenty of for-profit entities, from textbook publishers to online learning platforms. The ethicality of using AI in education doesnt hinge on whether the provider is for-profit but on how its used and the outcomes it produces.2). AI Dependence and Skill TransferThe concern about generational skill transfer is valid, but its not unprecedented. Similar arguments were made against calculators, spellcheckers, and even the internet when they first became widely used. These tools didnt erase fundamental skills but shifted the focus to higher-order thinking: understanding when and how to use tools effectively rather than doing everything manually. The same can apply to AI.For example, students using AI to help draft essays or solve problems might learn how to analyze and refine AI outputs, a skill that could become more relevant than rote memorization in the future workforce.3). Potential for AI DependencyYoure right that an over-reliance on AI could create vulnerabilities, such as exploitative pricing or reduced resilience in the face of AI outages. However, this isnt a reason to avoid AI altogetherits a reason to ensure AI is implemented thoughtfully and ethically. For example:* Encouraging students to understand how AI works rather than treating it as a black box.\\n* Promoting open-source or publicly funded AI alternatives to reduce monopoly risks.\\n* Teaching hybrid skills so students are not entirely dependent on AI for basic tasks.4). Ethical Student UseFraming all AI use by students as unethical seems overly broad. The ethicality of AI use depends on how its used. If students use AI to cheat or avoid learning, thats unethical. But if they use it as a tool to enhance learning, refine their ideas, or tackle problems more effectively, it can be a valuable asset.The goal should be to teach students ethical AI use: recognizing its limits, verifying its outputs, and ensuring it complements rather than replaces critical thinking.","title":"CMV: there is no ethical use of AI  by students"},{"text":"Unfortunately I think the article is wrong about her and Obama and Shumer being on their way out the door.

So it's fine /s\\nCongressional pension is a pension made available to members of the United States Congress. As of 2019, members who participated in the congressional pension system are vested after five years of service. A pension is available to members 62 years of age with 5 years of service; 50 years or older with 20 years of service; or 25 years of service at any age. A reduced pension is available depending upon which of several different age/service options is chosen. If Members leave Congress before reaching retirement age, they may leave their contributions behind and receive a deferred pension later.[1] The current pension program, effective January 1987, is under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which covers members and other federal employees whose federal employment began in 1984 or later. This replaces the older Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for most members of congress and federal employees.\\nThe FERS program takes into account the years served and the average pay for the top three years in terms of payment. For example, a member elected before 1984 and thus qualifying under the CSRS plan, who worked for 22 years and who had a top three-year average salary of $154,267 would be eligible for a pension payment of $84,847 per year.[4] A member elected after 1984 would have been enrolled under the FERS plan, and their pension payment under similar conditions ($154,267 top three-year average salary, but with only 20 years of service, rather than the 22 in the CSRS example) would be $52,451.In 2002, the average congressional pension payment ranged from $41,000 to $55,000.[6] As of November 2014, senior Members of Congress who have been in office for at least 32 years can earn about $139,000 a year.[7][source ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_pension)Edit to addThere were 619 retired Members of Congress receiving federal pensions based fully or in part on their congressional service as of October 1, 2022. Of this number, 261 had retired under CSRS and were receiving an average annual pension of $84,504. A total of 358 Members had retired with service under FERS and were receiving an average annual pension of $45,276 in 2023\\ncrsreports.congress.govA pension after 5 years.....must be nice.","title":"With The Election Over, Republicans Are Suddenly Interested in Cutting Social Security: We've gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"Had bidets for years on all toilets.

No AI company is currently profitable.Because they're investing a ton of resources into training better models, not because the models can't be operated profitably. Free AI is offered as a loss leader. There must be some external motivation for doing so.They're exploring the business model. I started off using free AI. Now I pay $20/month for ChatGPT because I think it's worth it, and I also pay to use their API in some software I'm developing. The free AI was a marketing cost to get me paying for those other products. Training their models is a fixed cost - they do it once and can use the resulting model for as many customers as they like. Each customer who signs up for premium ChatGPT or their API represents a marginal cost. While they're not making net profit, I'm pretty sure their margins for premium subscriptions and API sales are such that they're not taking a loss on each additional customer.

If one of them starts abusing their position, people will take their business to a different one.

Thus, students participating in this disruption by using AI, for any reason, cannot be acting ethically.It's definitely not a given that using AI for *any* reason leads to the dependence you're worried about.

Whether it would be wise or set a good precedent is a separate question, however.Joe Biden is a father, and I think most Americans would understand that a father would have a particular concern for their children's well-being. He did originally say he would not pardon Hunter Biden, but circumstances have since changed. Trump was re-elected, this could raise new concerns about Hunter Biden's treatment in the criminal-justice system with Trump in power. I am not necessarily agreeing with that line of reasoning, but it is a change that doesn't have to do with corruption; if one anticipates a risk of \\"retribution,\\" using the pardon power as a preemptive defense could be seen as a logical choice, not corruption.While there are probably many fathers across America with sons in similar circumstances who happen not to be President and, in that sense, this pardon may not be fair, it doesn't necessarily make it corrupt either because of the aforementioned.The Constitution provides a check against a president's abuse of the pardon power, and that would be for Congress to decide it rises to a level to draw up articles of impeachment.Again, I am not necessarily agreeing with this pardon, but there are reasons it might not be considered corrupt.","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"I don't believe communication had anything to do with it.

I don't give a shit about Hunter Biden, none of us should. It is obvious and undeniable that the only reason he faced these legal charges were because of Republicans nakedly political and corrupt attempts to target him to score political points against his dad. They literally plastered embarrassing nude pictures that were stolen from his phone all over the internet and on the actual floor of Congress. They published private voicemails the president left on his son's phone in a desperate attempt to get him help as he was in the depths of a drug binge. The whole thing was so disgusting, it embodies so much of what is wrong with our current politics, but for some reason the supposed lofty defenders of principle and precedent are choosing to ignore all of that, and instead pretend like the real problem is that the president signed a pardon to make it all go away as one of his final acts. GTFO.It's not about excusing anything just because it was done by a Democrat, it's about recognizing the actual we fight we are in and not pretending to be stupid so we can virtue signal about how we are the real defenders of democracy and principle. Go ahead and say it's generally bad for the president to pardon immediate family members, but there's absolutely no reason any of us should be treating this as a serious issue. It's not. No one is ever going to give anyone credit for adequately condemning the pardon, Trump is not going to somehow be even more corrupt because of the precedent it sets, it really does not matter. If we react to this as if it's somehow close to the level of bullshit and corruption Republicans get away with every single day, it doesn't prove that we are the ones who really stand for something and care about principle, it just makes us stupid. And we have to stop pretending to be stupid to try and score points in a game that no one else is even playing.","title":"Bidens pardon of son sparks calls for granting more clemencies"},{"text":"And some should stick to Governor, and not run for office when they won't win.

If one company is pricing customers out, another steps in to cater to that market.  Everyone will agree that Verizon is damn expensive for a cell phone company but that doesnt mean Verizon is the only avenue for access to that technology.  Cricket Mobile exists and sells those services for a fraction of the price, and both can coexist in the marketplace.Any disruption of generational skill transfer by AI risks creating this AI dependence and thus creating dictatorship.*Dictatorship*?

Biden didnt run for a second term in the end, after all, and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers will at least pay lip service to the idea that something should be done about the border and prescription drug prices.But despite its unpopularity, Republicans somehow keep coming back to the idea of cutting Social Security.In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., suggested it was time to make some hard decisions to trim the federal budget. Weve gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, said McCormick, who represents the wealthiest congressional district in Georgia. Theres hundreds of billions of dollars to be saved and we know how to do it. We just have to have the stomach to actually take those challenges on.In a speech at Trumps Madison Square Garden rally during the campaign, Musk said he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which would amount to about 30% of spending. Since Social Security is the largest single program in the budget, that would seem to indicate it might be a target, especially since Musk also said that everyones going to have to take a haircut under his plans.Continues at [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-social-security-republicans-elon-musk-rcna182711) ","title":"With The Election Over, Republicans Are Suddenly Interested in Cutting Social Security: We've gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare"},{"text":"No need for whataboutism.

Liquid fats such as olive oil, peanut oil and canola oil are primarily unsaturated fats.While saturated fats have been demonized in the past, eating certain kinds or small amounts might not be as harmful as previously thought. In tallow, some of the saturated fat is a specific type known as stearic acid. Stearic acid appears to not raise cholesterol in the same way as other saturated fats.Tallow also contains monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are considered healthier.Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is one polyunsaturated omega-6 fat found in animal fats and linked to potential health benefits such as preventing plaque buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis). However, more research is needed about the effects of conjugated linoleic acid.In addition to fat, beef tallow contains fat-soluble vitamins that are vital for various bodily functions, including immune support, bone health, cellular function and skin health.

And no one is hurt or robbed of justice because Hunter received this pardon. At the end of the day, it was the right thing to do.

The reality is that the Democratic Party lost the unions, minorities, women and other key demographics that used to be solidly in the Democratic tent. Thats partly because MAGA convinced these demographics that they are better with the economy. Now that Trump and MAGA are in complete charge, they will do whatever they want to help their billionaire friends and corporations. This will not be for the benefit of the working poor, or the lower and middle class Americans. It will be for the benefit of Wall Street and institutional shareholders and wealthy American shareholders. It will require further pain in the lower socioeconomic tiers of American society plus a well crafted Democratic strategy to retake that chunk of the American electorate and get folks to vote for their own self-interests. When that happens, Democrats can retake the House and maybe Senate in 2026 and start the strategy for a 2028 turnaround.","title":"I Watched the Democratic Collapse in Florida.

In the UK alone, 300 million was printed over covid to furlough staff, which did go to the average person needing to cover necessitates but it would would end up in the pockets of HNWI through dividends through shares because they owner the companies selling the necessitates, but its the UK tax payer that has to foot the bill for government printing money and covid was a massive transfer of wealth upwards. The MMT-er in me, would add with a fiat currency, tax signifies the debt to the central bank is paid, so the wrong group was taxed. However,\\"the most common field for billionaires to enter was sales and military service\\"\\\\- wikiAnd who pays for the military?\\\\ Billionaires shouldn't exist because they don't need all that money, Other people need it more.\\\\ Economically billionaires shouldn't exist. It's better if they don't.Its more the wealth inequality created. At that level of wealth, what are you going to do with it? A rough average for expensive luxury cruises is about $20K for 2 weeks, 50 years of that is $26,000,000, so what's a billionaire going to do with the rest? immediately we are looking at stocks, shares &amp; equity or lobbying and political donations. And that does have an effect on affect your wealth. Either, you can't compete with what they are offering for assets, or they'll just buy equity in houses and people will buy into shared ownership, where the risk is on the resident not on the owner of equity (yes, government interference is a factor in the housing issues, but lets not give a free pass to HNWI that buy significant potion of the market share). Major share holders become effective 'voting' blocks for the companies which means you're $100s of shares in a company that you believe in and vouch for, don't really matter to the owner, they will listen to the highest bidder. Billionaires obviously will have they favorite politician (Musk &amp; Trump) which means you have unelected officials deciding policy to infringe on your liberty, or large donations that enable a political parties to infringe on your liberty or, for example in the UK around 2006, buy seats in houses of parliament (Cash for Honours Scandle) to infringe on your liberty themselves.\\\\ At that level they don't work for itAt least we can agree that we're talking about wealth not income, \\"money making money\\" undermines Capitalism, we're meant to be creating goods and services to be bought and sold at a market, the \\"money making money\\" benefits the 'rent seeker' over the 'wealth creator'. Since the 70's we've shifted from a healthy form of commodity production to financialisation, where the inflating price of an already existing asset is greater than creating new assets. So what's the incentive to innovate when it is less risky and better financially, to sit on an assets than create a new one and the new value that comes with it? And who has a vast stake in already existing assets? Billionaires.

It wasnt difficult to trace the source behind the sudden public approval for the project, which is one of several rezonings that fall within the controversial 500-block Broadway Plan. On Reddit, Russil Wvong, a member of a YIMBY group that advocates for more housing construction, Abundant Housing, had posted a call for others to weigh in. He flagged three other projects going to public hearing, and he included a lengthy argument on the need for more high-rises, particularly near transit.Mr. Abbott does not believe the YIMBY movement, active in cities like Vancouver and San Francisco, fairly represents the diverse demographics of a city.Its yuppie millennials who are pushing this build housing everywhere, destroy neighbourhoods, displace tenants. You will never find a single mother working two serving jobs living in one of these three-storey walk-ups whos a YIMBY.

Authorities in Romania have revealed details of what appears to be a major attempt to interfere in the countrys presidential elections using the social media platform TikTok, and with a series of cyber-attacks. Romania's domestic intelligence service says there are signs the effort was \\"co-ordinated by a state-sponsored actor\\". Calin Georgescu, a far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Vladimir Putin, was almost unknown in Romania until he won the first round of voting in the presidential elections two weeks ago. Now Romanian intelligence says his sudden and surprise surge in popularity is down to a \\"highly organised\\" and \\"guerrilla\\" campaign on social media, sharing identical messaging and using influencers. They say it was conducted from \\"external locations\\" to bypass controls. A separate intelligence assessment says that Romania has been identified as an \\"enemy state\\" by Moscow and a priority target for what it calls \\"aggressive hybrid actions\\". The politically explosive information C which has landed just days before the second round of voting - comes from declassified documents published this evening by the outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. They reveal how paid content supporting Georgescu was promoted on TikTok, without being marked as election campaigning C in violation of the platforms own rules and of Romanian electoral law. Other candidates content was subject to closer controls. Georgescu has always said he spent \\"zero\\" on election promotion, denying he was even campaigning. But the intelligence documents identify one TikTok account which they say made payments of $381,000 (299,819; 361,872) in just one month from 24 October C to users who were promoting Georgescu. Georgescu claims the release of the documents is a coordinated attempt to block his candidacy. I think its the first time in the history of the world when a state is organising an action against a candidate to stop him from running, he said in a TV interview on Wednesday. He also denied knowing any of the influencers or funders mentioned in the reports. The documents released in this highly unusual move were all papers drawn up for a meeting of the security council following the first round of the presidential election. They also reveal that access data for electoral websites was stolen from legitimate users and published online on cyber-crime platforms originating from Russia. Separately, the intelligence agencies report some 85,000 attempted hacks in an attempt to access electoral data and change content C including on election day. The report says the cyber-attackers used advanced methods to remain anonymous, working in a way and on a scale \\"typical of state-sponsored actors\\". An investigation is ongoing to discover who was responsible and whether there was any impact on the election. Russia has denied any interference in Romania's election process. Far-right frontrunner Georgescu is due to face reformist candidate Elena Lasconi in a second round vote on Sunday. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu C who came 3rd in the presidential race C has now announced he will \\"fully endorse\\" Elena Lasconi. But thats assuming the vote goes ahead. The prosecutors office is now examining the new documents. \\"I hope that, based on the evidence published today, the state authorities will take appropriate action, and all those responsible will be held accountable,\\" Ciolacu said. He added that people's votes have shown they want the \\"continuation of Romania's European development path\\". A pro-EU protest has been called for Thursday evening. Commenting on the protest, Georgescu warned against possible unrest, citing the \\"Maidan\\" in Ukraine - the revolution of 2014 that ousted a pro-Russian president. \\"Please stay at home with your family. We need social tranquillity. God will not let Romania down, Georgescu said.How many more events like this is it going to take until people get their heads out of their asses and realize that unregulated social media* has become an extremely effective weapon for hostile actors (both state, internal, and individual) to spread their propaganda and destabilise countries?

The entire fee for service model is broken; there are reasons insurers are skeptical of claims because hospitals have almost no incentive to take a holistic view of their patients, and every incentive to do as much billable work as possible. Much of this is often to the detriment of the patient.There is a promising alternative developing with value-based primary care that emphasizes preventative care based on (roughly) a flat per-month payment to a care group that then assume liability for the patient. However, this is essentially only available for Medicare patients, and preventive care at 65+ isnt going to have the long-term savings that care at half that age would have. Then *again*, the model really doesnt work on timescales much longer than a year; value based care practices are incentivized to find the sickest patients that can still have interventions; healthy people broadly dont fit into the model. Its unclear how this approach will scale.At any rate, the insurance model that we have now in the US is wholly unprepared for the aging population it is starting to receive. Insurers taking 15% off the top is a massive inefficiency, as is the balkanized risk landscape, but the system is entrenched. ??Im not really sure where Im going with all this, besides a vague sense of urgent doom around the whole system.

Thinkers like Hayek and Smith envisioned liberalism as part of a broader social fabric.\\t2.\\tShift in Liberalism: Post-WWII, liberalism became dominant but increasingly associated with technocratic, meritocratic, and individualistic policies. Economic liberalization, exemplified by rolling back New Deal policies in the U.S., led to inequality.\\t3.\\tCultural Liberalism: There was a shift towards regulating social norms, such as language and representation, with less emphasis on economic balance.\\t4.\\tConsequences: This has created mistrust in liberal elites, as they are seen as detached from public needs. Examples include disillusionment with higher education and rising authoritarian trends.\\t5.\\tProposed Solutions: To address this, liberal democracies should refocus on community-oriented governance, equitable public policies, and fostering inclusivity in decision-making.If youd like further specifics or a deeper summary, let me know!","title":"Acemoglu lays out a new liberal program"},{"text":"under the incoming Chinese/Russian hegemony?lmao, both states have severe internal problems that will be hard to overcome, even if Russia secures its maximalist goal of getting all their wanted territory and Ukraine does not join NATO, it's a phyric victory.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I dont see him doing much fighting for anyone or doing much at all in the month or so he has left.","title":"Biden Isnt Done Fighting for Vulnerable Workers"},{"text":"For a moment there I forgot non-mod posts, unlike comments, can be pinned.

She could have come out against providing more offensive weapons for Israel without some strings attached, but she didn't.  She also said \\"nothing comes to mind\\" when asked if she would do anything different than Biden.  So, she's not Joe Biden but she owns his legacy.After that, the question becomes how bad would she be for Palestinians? Around as bad as Biden seems to be the presumption.That's a pretty bad baseline.  Tens of thousands of civilians dead from direct war violence, and no one really knows how many more dead from indirect causes.  About half the buildings damaged or destroyed.  Something like fifty to a hundred thousand tons of bombs and munitions used on Gaza.  Not enough food, not enough medical supplies being let in.  Huge masses of people living in tents with no real safe place to be.  Netanyahu is wanted by the ICC for targeting civilians and using starvation as a military tactic.Then ask how bad would Trump be? There's a lot of information on how that would go.Trump probably won't be great either, but we really don't know what Trump will do.  It could go either way.  He might keep giving weapons to Netanyahu and not even bother to push back on Netanyahu's worst ideas, or he might think that we shouldn't be giving billions of weapons to Israel and getting nothing in return for it.  Whatever Trump does we can take it for granted that it'll be done with corrupt intent, but as far as actual results, who knows?Realistically, the war is probably going to wind down regardless, just because that's how these conflicts usually go.I don't care if Harris personally punched them in the face, everyone who's being honest about their supposedly good intentions should have been voting for Harris.You're basically arguing against people who were placed in a trolley problem and didn't pull the lever.  No matter what you think people ought to do, some people just won't do it.There were polls last spring that showed that a majority of Democrats thought that what Israel was doing in Gaza was a genocide.  You can reasonably argue about whether it was or wasn't, but presumably most of those Democrats voted for Harris anyways.  I did.Biden's hands weren't tied.  He could have withheld offensive weapons to Israel unless they did more to protect civilians and allow food and medical supplies in, and more to stop settlers from terrorizing Palestinians in the West Bank.Harris was in a more difficult situation as Vice President but she could have said she'd pursue a different policy than Biden.  She didn't. Pro-palestinians are not right-wingers...There are some conservative Arab Americans out there.  Dearborn Michigan famously went for Trump despite usually going for Democrats, and part of the reason is that Trump actually showed up and talked to the people there and listened to their concerns.  Even so, Jill Stein picked up a bigger share of the vote versus 2020 results than Trump did, so I think most of the Trump voters were probably just already Republican-leaning conservatives, and a significant portion of the Democrats voted third party or not at all.  Which is understandable in a community where it's common for people to have lost family or know people who have lost family to U.S. foreign policy decisions.Some voters are going to judge one candidate more harshly for what they've actually done than what some other candidate for what they might do.  (Granted that Harris isn't Biden, but she was part of his administration and she declined to say she'd do anything different, so she owns it.)","title":"AOC mulls run to be top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee | \\nThe progressive lawmaker is one of many younger members challenging more senior colleagues for top committee roles"},{"text":"Your so right it is all about the context","title":"Liberals still going with the HITLER! meme."},{"text":"Matt Damon for president.

Because Donald Trump is a notorious and serial shitstirrer, because his constant absurdity has magically rendered him benign, because corruption, malfeasance, cronyism, obstruction of justice, the endless incoherent ramblings and emotional tirades at rallies, public events, during interviews, press conferences, etc, because his violent rhetoric and unconditional threats are just another day for Donald Trump, we've practically sane washed and normalized his misconduct.So the bar for Trump remains perpetually low, while his opponents are held to such a high standard that they're expected to be flawless and irreproachable.","title":"Pardon Backlash Reflects Fraught Breakup Between Democrats and Biden"},{"text":"Unlike with the Boston Bomber, Reddit doesn't seem supportive of having the killer found.

FDR trying to fight the good fight, even if it did not succeed everyrime is one part of many of why he was so popular and got reelected 4 times (also the war obviously). We needed a new FDR for the 21st century and Biden ran against candidates who very well could have been. Overhead failed to show he would be willing to radically fight for America and be the leader we needed. He kept playing ot save based on precident until it was way too late, and the only exception he is making is a corrupt pardon. It's a failure of a presidency only made palatable by the horror show that precided and will follow it.\\nHe tried to end the filibuster. He tried to pack the court. He had such a majority Dems had to sit with Republicans because they ran out of chairs on their side. He couldn't pack the court. Know why? Because if they had, ending the filibuster and packing the court, Donald Trump would walk in with his majority Republican Senate and house, and he would pack it even more. It would never be ending. And it would ultimately accomplish nothing.Here's the problem with this counterfactual: we played it safe and still lost everything. Those that seem to fight radically muster the enthusiasm and support from their base to overcome. I truly believe that the attempt to fight fire with fire if fought honestly for the people would have been popular with the left and would have drum out voters in mass.

Trump.doing it was heinous, and bidens doing it is marginally less heinous (didn't make him the ambassador of France and all that nonesense)There is nothing Biden could do to road bump Trump that Trump couldn't turn around and undo. Obama ruled by EO's, he watched Trump undo them by the stack with a pen stroke. EO's are toothless unless your replacement is willing to keep them. Biden reversed most of Trump's on day one.Obama is infamous for playing it safe. He and Michelle are literally the origin of \\"when they go low, we go high\\" trying to shame the GOP with acts like McConnell filibustering his own bill and all that versus fighting fire with fire.

Because many of the workers within that chain of production are fairly easy to replace, low skilled laborers.  The billionaire and high ranking executives, designers, technicians, engineers, programmers investors and managers, on the other hand, are far harder to substitute. The printing press workers who printed Harry Potter books can thank people like JK Rowling  for being able to write a story they would have never come up with themselves. A country as worker friendly like Sweden still produced men like Ingvard Kamprad, whose vision surpassed that of every competitor. As questionable as folks like Kamprad and Rowling may be, they make the difference between an average business that crashes or gets sold after a few years, and a venture that trascends eras and borders. Nobody makes it alone, but they still need to be quiten exceptional to make it. The more goods and investments they put into the market, the more wealth they create and deserve. Their decissions matter far more.Trying to veil labour theory of value as moralist gaslighting won't take you far here.","title":"Why are billionaires bad?"},{"text":"You're allowed to make changes when you get new information.When Biden said he wouldn't pardon his son, it was during the trial and before Trump became president elect.Trump has picked people who have stated they want to essentially abuse their position in Trump's cabinet to hurt Hunter while he is in jail.So Biden made an effort to prevent that injustice.

Hayek fled Nazi Germany and hung out in Chicago with Ayn Raynd and a bunch of crudely educated businessmen who felt shutout of the \\"establishment\\" and they came up with this whole theory about how a small group of really talented people are what really makes things happen. They hated hippies and populism because they had a pretty low opinion of the common man. There was also this revolution in economics happening that you're alluding to as \\"market fundamentalism.\\" They wanted to glom onto that and say it justified them. There was also a philosopher named Levi Strauss who taught a lot of the hawks that ended up in Dubya's administration. So that's a little group. They loved Goldwater and Reagan. Clinton and Obama come from this other strain that interprets the Chicago School of economics very differently and in my opinion more validly. So it's two different schools. Now, what to call them, I guess that's a semantic argument, but it is two distinct groups. \\nLook up an economist named Deirdre McCloskey, e.g. the book The Rhetoric of Economics. She was a Chicago School economist who rebelled against the conservatism and moved to the University of Illinois.

I'm not trying to interfere with anyone's success but if you look at most of the examples of billionaires, they had significant help from government subsidization or unfair government rules that they capitalized on.

That's one reason I'm not against the anti trust efforts since these companies already haven't operated in free markets. The games the US plays with banks set the financial sector up to push more wealth into their pockets but it's really just money printing behind the curtain.I also think there are markets like healthcare that are problematic as for profit. But even with a for profit system, public funding of research gets exploited by companies that use patents to shut the door behind them. That kills the ability to let markets balance costs.

The economy and political landscape is vast and complex. Often times, that person making that $5 product will use their political capital to stifle competition or purchase influence amongst politicians. Is that ethical?

Taxes, government contracts, most of the defense industry, welfare recipients, government employees, post office, etc etc etc. Anything revolving around receiving money and wealth from involuntary methods.Productive classes get the majority of their income using market means. They provide goods and services that people actually want. Construction workers, plumbers, truck drivers, private business owners, etc etc.Parasitic classes are a called 'parasitic' here because they are a net drain on the economy. When you are talking about the state and its adjuncts... they don't produce wealth. They seize wealth and redistribute it for political ends. Not only is their income based on seizing money or money printing they spend that money to complete for resources from the people they are taking it from. Where as productive classes are responsible not only generating the wealth that they need they are also required to provide for the wealth consumed by the parasitic classes.That is people who work privately have to pay for everything done politically. This means military, roads, towns, medicaid, foreign aid, busses, sewage... everything. Every nut and bolt and dollar that goes into anything is paid for by the productive class. They pay for the war on drugs and the drugs that are being warred against, etc\\nThe problem with this type of classification, unfortunately, is that everything is very mixed mode. Especially when you start to get into billionare territory. It is difficult sometimes to know who is who. And they tend to get money from both the state and free market.However it is still valid division, if not exact.Which means that billionares that make most of their money through the political means are bad.

The influence of money in politics.\\n2. The acquisition of wealth itself.I think (1) is a legitimate concern. For example, regardless of where someone stands on climate change, it's unsettling when big corporations fund research to *specifically* challenge scientific consensus and then back politicians who push agendas that serve their own interests. It's just not healthy for democracy.As for (2), there are definitely cases where people get rich through questionable means like political connections. This is especially rampant in developing countries, where relatives of politicians set up dubious companies to land lucrative government contracts. Even in more developed nations, we see industries maintaining monopolies through tactics like laws requiring car dealerships in many states (which goes back to issue #1).However, I believe wealth earned through entrepreneurship in general is entirely legitimate. While there are always going to be individuals who engage in shady practices, we live in a free and open society. Making blanket statements like \\"society must not allow billionaires to exist\\" feels like we're punishing people just for being financially successful. If someone breaks the law, we have due process to handle that, not sweeping moral judgments.Some argue that billionaires must have \\"exploited\\" others to amass their wealth, implicitly basing their arguments on the old Labor Theory of Value (whether one is aware of it or not). This theory suggests that profit inherently exploits the working class. But I don't think this really fits with how economies work, where value is created through innovation, efficiency, and voluntary exchange, providing value that didn't exist before.","title":"Why are billionaires bad?"},{"text":"The best part about capitalism is that even if you're greedy you help others in the process.

Billionaires do have more wealth than what should be natural, in a pure capitalistic system, but thats not the fault of billionaires, its the fault of government for stepping in doing things like giving them tax benefits, and over-regulating small businesses. In a truly capitalist system, big and bulky companies would actually have a really hard time competing against lean and efficiently run small/medium-sized businesses, but thats why big companies NEED big government to help step in and control them.And yet, rather than recognize the real problem, people will blame capitalism, and say that we need EVEN MORE government to step in, in order to help control billionaires.

Thatcher and Reagan are the key examples of this, being vital in bringing forth the Washington 'neoliberal' consensus we are arguable still in.However it's also obvious that it's become a lot more complicated than this. Principally how do groups like New Labour and the New Democrats play into this, as well all the other leftwing parties that have 'betrayed' their history and embraced neoliberalism.Broadly I categorise them into two forms. 'New Right' neoliberals and 'Third Way' neoliberals. The key difference being whether their neoliberalism snuggle up to conservatives or social democrats/liberals. You also have the factor of whether they embrace it unapologetically, or simply accept it without complaint.This sub easily fits into the unapologetic Third Way category, having a love for technocratic market fundamentalism while being highly progressive in social policies. Meanwhile, both Thatcher and Reagan easily fit into the unapologetic New Right category, having the same love for technocratic market fundamentalism while holding onto highly conservative social policies.One of the issue I have with using the 'neoconserative' label is that, more than the economic focus of neoliberalism, it is associated with rightwing hawkism in international relations. While it's clear why that wouldn't matter in an economists context, it matters a lot in a wider political one. Such an association doesn't really exist with the New Right label, which pretty much coincides with the neoliberal takeover of much of the right (and then soft left) of the 1960s-'80s.","title":"Quick!

I've had pharyngitis twice before and I can assure you this wasn't it, I had never felt so bad, so sick, so weak and as if close to dying in my entire life.
