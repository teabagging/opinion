Michigan looks like its going to be incredibly close, so this could very well be the thing that decides it.You have two options:-Do nothing\\n-Report itPros/Cons of Each:Do nothing\\n-Pro: your family stays the way it is, no possible legal trouble, etc\\n-Con: Your sisters vote counts for Trump when it probably shouldnt have. Your parents may be motivated to exploit her like this again if theyre not held accountable. In addition, this may build resentment between you and your parents if this continues, which could impact your family in the long-term. Sharing things like this, but doing nothing about it, may just reinforce distrust in elections.Report it\\n-Pro: if this is in fact, a case of voter fraud, the ballot will be disqualified. Your parent and others in similar situations would be less likely to do something like this in the future. Reporting it flags it for election officials to make sure its legal.\\n-Cons: On the possibility that this is considered voter fraud, there is a chance that your parents may be criminally charged. REPORTING THEM DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY WILL GO TO JAIL. If this is found to be voter fraud, they may have to pay a fine, community service, or whatever the punishment in Michigan is for that crime.If I were in your shoes, recognizing that I dont know what that looks like, I would report it. I would call your local election board, and your state election board, and explain the situation. Theres a chance that your parents are not doing anything thats against the law, but if you reach out, at least youre doing your duty as a citizen. I would HIGHLY encourage you to at least do this: reaching out to your board(s) of elections. If you believe that their actions are against the law, I would also encourage you to report them to law-enforcement. The Department of Justice has a complaint site, where you can share what you shared here in more detail, and if they believe its illegal issue, they may investigate. (You can do that at Justice.gov/voting) in addition, state law enforcement probably has similar tip lines.I would highly encourage you to report it. If it is, in fact, illegal, reporting it is the only way to ensure that ballot is not counted. If their actions were legal, reporting it just helps authorities ensure that the election is fair no harm, no foul.","title":"Im pretty sure my parents just committed voter fraud for Trump!"},{"text":"More like 4 decades.","title":"Sen.

Another several states made abortion rulings that were more restrictive than Roes 24 weeks, and more in line with some more moderate European country limits at 6-15 weeks, represent another 20% of the U.S. population.Of the 13 states that severely limited restrictions, only 6 do not have exemptions for rape.Of those 6 states, plan B is available in all of them - making the carry rapist baby line hugely hyperbolic.

We are more prone to recognizing negatives than we are positives, so this is a likely explanation.It's also possible that furries are generally nice to most people, but something about you draws out their bad behavior. Therefore you have poor experiences while others have positive ones.Finally, people who make something the core part of their identity tend to be very intense and often socially awkward. I'm quite Catholic, and there are Catholics who only ever think about being Catholic, to the detriment of their social skills. They come across as rude, and they stick out as Catholic because they make SURE you know that they're Catholic. So people who come across them are likely to associate the negative experience with them being Catholic, even though I'm a nice guy and also Catholic but they won't associate my positive experience with my Catholic identity. Why? Because it's sometimes hard to know if I am or not based upon a single interaction.

So usually being called names, or even slightly anti-furry without a cause is usually an automatic sign to be defensive since, like literally everyone else ever, when someone challenges their life and style, they'll be rude and defensive or upset since it's common for people to hate on furries and stereotype us as things we aren't.personally i've only had good experiences with furries while with anti-furries, I've seen people who hate furries call furries slurs, harass them, beat them, literally end the furries life, tackle them, insult them, and more and more.so personally, i think your only getting bad experiences because it's where your looking, there's many places where furries are that are purely nice area's and nice people and others, but a hint of being anti-furry will yield results of others being upset or rude to you for being even slightly anti-fur.saying you've only had bad experiences will make us think that your against us, saying you've only had bad experiences is again, the exact reason you have bad experiences, because usually (not always) anyone who says stuff like that is usually (well reasonably) disliked, for very obvious reasons, especially with what those who are against furries have done, so saying you've only had bad will very obviously result in defensivenessmaybe try not saying it, and you'll have nicer conversations since they don't automatically assume you hate them due to your other bad experiences","title":"CMV: furries are not usually nice people, at least, not unless you ask them if theyre nice people."},{"text":"This election is not about making Trump supporters change their minds, its about getting normal people with normal views to actually vote.","title":"Sen.

They think progressives want to tax the rich because we personally resent them, not that we dont want the population to pay for everything either by giving industry tax breaks or cutting and privatizing services so we pick up the cost. And this progressive move while only going after the personal income of rich people (which tends to get hidden) and not industry and Wall Street is still HIGHER, than the tax rate after Ronald Regan cut taxes in half for the rich.

Yes. Is it making it harder for dems to win? Yes. Is it illegal? Yup, probably, but also, because of the nature of the situation (your sister's potential incapacitation/incompetence is something that would need to be proven, and the courts would have to determine that before even weighing in on the election tampering charge), there's not even a guarantee they would be found guilty of anything...but there's also a high degree of chance that they would be found guilty...do you really want your parents, yourself and your family to go through the ringer over this?If you turn them in for tampering with an election in Michigan, they could be charged with voter fraud, likely for \\"impersonating a voter\\" (which is a *felony* with a $5000 fine and up to **5 years in prison**) or conspiracy to commit election fraud (which is an even stronger punishment - a *felony* with a $10,000 fine and up to **five years in prison**). If they're convicted of either thing at their age and the judge decides to throw the book at them to send a message, they're going to prison for five years...it will ruin their lives, and though you may not realize it, it could ruin your life as well...and all because they just didn't think something through?There will be people in this thread who advocate for you turning them in for all kinds of reasons - the moral aspect, the legal aspect, the \\"fuck anyone who votes for Trump\\" aspect even, but I urge you to remember that none of them have to deal with the fallout from your decision. None of them will lose any family members, or have to deal with the potential feelings of guilt from turning your parents in, or have to be known the rest of their lives as the person who sent their parents to prison over what most people will likely consider something inconsequential. It's not inconsequential, but most people won't think of it like that. They'll just say \\"You sent your parents to prison over THAT?\\"I'm not trying to justify their actions - there's no doubt about it in my mind that what they're doing is wrong - I just want you to think about the very real potential consequences and decide for yourself if you think their actions deserve the likely punishments and the fallout that will happen after the fact - your sister and other disabled sibling will lose their primary caregivers, which means either you or other family members will need to take that care over, or you or other family members will have to pay for their care. Your parents will become convicted felons and if they're still working, they'll likely lose their jobs...and of course, they may even serve time in prison, and though you absolutely have the moral high ground, many people in your community and even family will judge you heavily for sending them there - and trust me, it won't be the judge they'll blame, it will be you.As a dad myself, I would never want my kid to be in this position but I'd want him to consider all the potential outcomes before making a decision, which is what I want you to do - please think long and hard before you commit to turning your parents in for a crime that, in the grand scheme of things, is a relatively small thing, but if they're convicted of it, it will end your family as you know it.","title":"Im pretty sure my parents just committed voter fraud for Trump!"},{"text":"tf are you talking about","title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Calls Out Trumps McDonalds Cosplay: 'They Are Making Fun Of Us'"},{"text":"And the more likely money gets invested.

What matters is that he directly and significantly contributed to the process that rendered abortion illegal in that state. Im simply objecting to hyperbolic statements that blame every single downstream decision on one upstream one.Whether or not a downstream outcome can be attributed to an upstream decision depends on the proximity, significance, and relevance. In this case, Trump's appointment of the supreme court justices was proximate (see causal chain above), significant (if Trump hadn't acted in such a way, Roe v Wade would not have been overturned), and relevant (the appointment of anti-abortion justices resulted in anti-abortion ruling). We're not talking about a butterfly flapping its wings causing a tornado, here.But pro-life is not a major part of Trumps rhetoric, hes a more passive supporter of it.A supporter is a supporter.

His numbers were out of scale.  Clinton thought Obama cheated, when in fact he motivated a whole bunch of young and unlikely voters that the models had a hard time picking up.  Yes that was a democratic primary, but it was also a legendary upset and something very few saw coming.  There could be other strange analogies here since the amount of time Harris has been running is so historically short, it's almost as if this is both her primary and her general.  There could be unseen enthusiasm that the polls don't know how to factor.Harris county (name is just a coincidence) had 125k early votes cast yesterday.  In 2016 67k were cast on that first day of early voting.  TX population has increased by 15% in the past 8 years, yet the 1st day turnout is double?  I don't know how you account for this except to say... blue wave.Harris county covers Houston and is the most populous county in the state.  It also leans solidly blue, Biden won Harris county in 2020 with 56% of the vote.I think the Harris team has picked up this data through their own internal polling of the state.  Of course with any poll depending on how you mix the secret sauce will determine a wild possible range of outputs, but they would certainly model for the unlikely voter scenario.  Yesterday was tangible confirmation that something is going on.

Like, Biden can come up with as many possible plans as he wants, but he has no control over whether either party agrees to and implements the plan. Like, Biden can either support the genocide of the Palestinian people, or he couldn't. He has full control over that.And you bring up callousness, which you exhibit by claiming there is no hope for a peaceful resolution, but you (again) fail to understand that if there truly is no hope, its because Israel and/or Palestine refuse to accept workable solutions. There is \\"no hope\\" because both the Democrats and the Republicans fully back Israel and it's campaign.But, if we agree that there is no hope for a peaceful resolution under either party, then why is this an electoral issue?Because if people don't want to vote for a party that supports genocide then they shouldn't have to. That's how democracy should work.Perhaps you believe there is that hope with a third party presidentNope.so we come back to the question of why is this even an issue?Why is genocide an issue?Because I think genocide is bad.

There have been plenty of historical times when conservatives have moved to a more liberal, moderate position to chase the constituency.

We have no problem finding deer infected with SARS2 that was passed to them from humans, we found animal versions of SARS1 in civets and MERS in camels, hell look at the recent Bird Flu spillovers not only do we always find infected animals with each case, we find infected animals with random inspections and see the virus in raw milk.   \\nSo out of the 40k plus wet markets across China it appears to only have spilled over once, and the the virus no longer seems to be circulating in any animals with the closest viruses found to date are less than 97% similar having shared a common ancestor decades ago.

Colorado has a population of about 6M and Texas has about 30M. I think that may have something to do with how long it is taking us to flip.The rural population in Texas is stagnating or in decline while the metropolitan areas are booming. There is rapid urbanization of rural counties along the freeways connecting the cities to accommodate the growth.The I-35 corridor that connects San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas has become known as the *Texas Blue Spine*. It will be interesting to see how much bluer these counties have become since the last election.Texas Monthly - [The Balance of Power in Texas Politics Runs Along I-35 (2020)](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/balance-power-texas-politics-interstate-35/)And as the I-35 corridor grows in political influence, the Chronicle notes, voter registration numbers in East Texas and the Panhandle have dropped.Texas Democrats are excited about the political balance of power shifting to the I-35 corridor. They envision a blue spine that would help them, eventually, carry statewide races.Houston Chronicle- [Voter registrations growing at faster rate along I-35 than rest of the state combined](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Voter-registrations-growing-at-faster-rate-along-15029581.php) (2020)Over the last four years, Texas has added more voters in the 22 counties along Interstate 35 than in the states 232 other counties combined.Since 2016, Texas voter rolls have grown by almost 2 million voters. More than 1 million of those voters live in communities along the I-35 corridor, sometimes likened to a blue spine.Houston Chronicle - [What is the Texas blue spine, and why is it so important this election?](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/2022/article/What-is-the-Texas-blue-spine-and-why-is-it-so-17566289.php) (2022)Population growth in Spine counties was robust between 2010 and 2020. According to the Census, those 21 counties added 2.18 million people, nearly half the total population growth of the entire state.In 2014, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn won these counties by almost 350,000 total votes. But in 2018, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz lost the same counties by 440,000 votes.Then in 2020, it got even worse for Republicans when President Trump lost those counties by 493,000 votes. Thats about an 800,000-vote swing in the electorate in just six years. If that margin continues to grow, Republicans have a real problem on their hands.Houston Chronicle - [Democrat Beto ORourke exposed a blue spine across the middle of red Texas](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Beto-O-Rourke-exposed-a-blue-spine-across-the-13399110.php) (2018)This is a major structural problem for the GOP going forward, said Jay Aiyer, a political science professor at Texas Southern University in Houston. Texass population growth has been dramatic in the urban and suburban communities along I-35, while areas that the GOP has long relied on in West Texas and East Texas are losing both population and voters. In other words, the Democratic base is expanding significantly, while the GOPs base is growing less or even shrinking, Aiyer said.Whats changing I-35 is whats changing the state, said Aiyer. The state is growing more diverse and more urban. As major cities become more crowded and more expensive, people are moving to surrounding counties for cheaper housing and taking their political views with them, he said.","title":"Texas sees record early-voting numbers, particularly in Democratic-leaning areas"},{"text":"boy is irony dead","title":"Nolte: McDonalds Has No Record of Kamala Harris Working There"},{"text":"My sister took my mom to vote in 2016.

Take Texas for example. It is a traditionally right leaning state under solidly Republican control. The big cities are largely Democratic and make up nearly all Democratic votes cast in the state. They are also the highest concentration of people so naturally would need more locations to vote. Because Republicans dont win the popular vote, it is imperative they limit voting in these areas. The easiest way is to simply reduce the number of polling places, driving up long wait times. Youll notice there are never issues in Republican areas or smaller population centers that lean conservative.The U.S. has piss poor labor protections compared to most of the developed world. Election Day isnt a federal holiday and it is up to an employer if they grant time off to vote. Many people in urban areas simply cannot afford to take time off for voting because they need the money or risk losing their job. To compound the issue, this is also why Republicans rally against early and mail-in voting. They want everyone who plans to vote, to do so in person and be forced to jump through hoops. This isnt a big deal to old people who are foundational to the party because they dont have a job to show up to (generally).

Biden and his administration have been working in the region to help move towards a resolution, but what you people continually fail to understand is that nobody except Palestine and Israel, can enact and adhere to a ceasefire or any other resolution. Like, Biden can come up with as many possible plans as he wants, but he has no control over whether either party agrees to and implements the plan. And you bring up callousness, which you exhibit by claiming there is no hope for a peaceful resolution, but you (again) fail to understand that if there truly is no hope, its because Israel and/or Palestine refuse to accept workable solutions. But, if we agree that there is no hope for a peaceful resolution under either party, then why is this an electoral issue? If you believe both parties will lead to the same outcome, why do we care (in the context of the US presidential election)? Perhaps you believe there is that hope with a third party president, but the statistical chances of a third party candidate winning are 0, and thats just a fact. It is outside the realm of possibility that would happen, so we come back to the question of why is this even an issue? One of the two parties will win. You believe both candidates will get to the same result for Palestine. There are likely other issues that concern you (like the status of Palestinian refugees in the US) for which one candidate is clearly better than the other. So what is the utility of teaching the democrats a lesson or being apathetic? And to be very clear, Trump has already implemented a Muslim ban on entry before and has targeted Muslims for deportation. If Palestine is *really* an issue you care about, why even risk Trump winning so Palestinian refugees are sent back into a warzone to certain death? Why risk Trump refusing entry to Palestinians who have family in the US?","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Meshstatic.

But the bare fact that there is *a* reason is enough to break your claim, because of how strongly you made it.I feel like this is classic lesson. IRL, making your claim as strongly as possible is sometimes useful because it activates emotions, and IRL arguments are mostly won with feelings not facts.

Is there a time when the Republican will not be at least slightly worse than the Democrat? So why would Democrat ever genuinely adopt progressive positions if we have no choice, if Democrats face no protest or electoral threat from the left?All they need to do is be less bad that Trump to get out vote. And this is why the US had continued going to the right politically even as popular option has gone to the left. In fact I think the role of the Democrats is to try and co-opt and subsume popular demands of their base in ways that will not threaten Wall Street or US imperial interests.Regarding the Palestinian solidarity voters who cant bring themselves to vote for Democrats - having Trump in office might be worse but Democrats have openly stated that the alternative wont be better and that the Democrats have no sincere intention in entertaining any anti-war demands. Cities in blue states with Democrat administrations and likely very liberal institutions like universities have come down on student protesters to the point of UCLA and LAPD allowing Proud-Boy type adults beat up their students on live TV for like 4-6 hours as if these liberals were 1920s social democrats letting the Freicorps (ie proto-nazis) attack labor strikes and leftist bars. The one Palestinian in congress was called an antisemite and censured by a large chunk of Democtats.So the Democrats have made it clear they will never be on the side of the genocide protesters this happened in the War on Terror too, so I did not expect any different.The Republicans will most always be worse that the Democrat. The Left has been debating this since the 1930s when the left generally abandoned attempts to create a Labor party and joined with the Democrats during the New Deal and to try and push the Democrats to an anti-nazi position (Congress was anti-antifa in those days and had hearings with the Studio heads and filmmakers accusing them of being too biased towards British and Jewish people and too bigoted towards Germans.)This has been a failed strategy for the left and is one of the main reasons for the marginalization of left-wing ideas and policies - even when those become popular among the population.I distinctly remember asking a Democrat in 2004 what it would take for the Democrats to not be the lesser evil anymore and be just as evil as Bush they said, if the US was ethnically cleansing people in Iraq well, I bet that person is still going to vote for Harris anyway. The left has no leverage or strategy for this election so I am not telling people how they should vote - its too late and doesnt matter - people should organize in opposition to both parties and prepare for street protests and labor stoppages. But in the long term the left needs to build a real opposition build on a working class and multi-racial basis or else the US will continue to go to the right and the Democrats will only come around on seeing Gaza as ethnic cleansing years from now when they are doing Palestinian land acknowledgements while vacationing in a resort in Gaza.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Woohoo!!

First, these people don't necessarily think trump is going to destroy the country in 4 years. This is more of a long term play. Basically, you can use the same logic that the Democrat candidate is closer in progressive policy than the Republican candidate. This will be the case for every single election and it's a two party system. And democrats know this. They know that they don't necessarily need to appeal to the far left to win because who else is the far left going to vote for? That's why the democratic candidate always spends more time appealing to moderate voters. Progressives can protest against the democrats like with the Israel protests we've seen, but these protests are pretty meaningless if the progressives still vote for them. The only real way they can make the democrats listen is simply not voting for them.I can guarantee you that 4 years from now, you'll see people making the same arguments about how progressives should vote for the democrat because they're closer to progressive policy than the Republican or because the Republican is evil.

Entry level does not need you should need babysitting to do your job. Training, yes. But not babysitting.Some offices, everyone in the office has a very specific job, that has a very specific time limit allotted.Yup. We have that. Which lends to what I said: if you are still getting your work done in the time allotted and meeting your deadlines and producing work that is up to snuff for those deadlines then that's what should matter, not where your butt is sitting while you do it.In the time it takes me to open up my email, type it up and hit send, I could have walked an office over asked and had my questions answered, and gotten back to work, instead of having to wait for a response which could be minutes or could be an hour.Sure. But it's the same with me. When we were in the office I ran into the problems of: walking my butt over to ask someone else ran the risk of the time it took to get there, are they even their office and not in a meeting or on a phone call, interrupting both of our work in order to do this in person, etc. Now it's: I can IM them and get an instant response even if they're on another call or in a meeting, I can keep going with something else having to do with the task while I wait for their response, and they can keep going with what they're doing while they give me the response. I can also call them if they're available over our IM system and talk to them 'face to face' via video if need be. Anything I have to email over, I would have to email over in the office as well because those people were already in a different state than I was. You can see when one of your coworkers is busy or not with something more important in the office, not so much at home.Not until you walk over there you can't. Whereas on line, I can see by their marker if they're busy or available instantly. If they are, I can also just IM them and they'll see it flashing there when they're able to. I can see at a glance if they're OOO or if they're in a meeting or any of that. Without having to get up and walk across the room or the building. Communicating verbally is faster than text ileven in real time typically. At the office you don't need to set up a time for video call.Actually, in a lot of cases when we were in the office, we *would*. Here, at a glance, we can see if the other person is available and if they are, and its something too complicated for text, a quick 'lets hop on a call' suffices and we do. Instantly. I can see if someone is available for a call and get on that call with them generally in less time than it would have taken me to walk to their office before. And if they're in a meeting, I would wait. Just as I would have to if I walked to their office, saw they weren't there, find out they'd gone to a meeting, and walked back to wait for that meeting to be over.At lunch time, coworkers might be gaining friendships, which is a good thing for the employer.Ah, the employer. Telling that its good for the employer, but not the employee. I do have a couple friends at work, who I have literally never seen face to face. But I do not go to work to make friends and socialize. Of course its better for bosses when their employees have 'work friends' and that makes up most of their socialization, because they can exploit that.It gives people a reason to want to stay at the job, to maintain those friendships.Exactly. It's exploitative. It's giving very 'we'll tie you up in certain ways to make it harder for you to leave *even if you have good reason to* such as we don't pay you enough or treat our workers poorly'.The friends that I have at work that I *want to maintain a friendship with* I would do so even if one or the other of us no longer works there. I do not need a job (or a particular job) to maintain a friendship with anyone. Work from home essentially negates that.Yes, work from home essentially negates employers manipulating their employees in this way. Absolutely. What it doesn't negate is the actual friendships. Which I still have even though I'm now 100% work from home, with people who aren't even at the company any more. All it negates is employers trying to use that as leverage to get employees to stay when they otherwise wouldn't. You want employees to stay? Get rid of the 'otherwises' that would cause them to leave (like non-competitive wages, poor working conditions, etc).However, for those who are looking for friends or significant others, that social aspect can be important, and can therefore be a reason that the person wants to stay there at the company.I say this as a happily married person: I would never, and *have* never, looked for friends or a significant other *at work*. I have *made* a couple of friends at work, but work is not even in my top ten sources to find friends, and was never in my top thousand sources to find a SO. People manage all the time to find friends and SOs outside of work and build meaningful, long-lasting relationships outside of work. Going physically into an office may be *one* option for finding these things, but its hardly the *only* option. It's not even an necessary option.It can be a matter of babysitting for some peopleTo which I say, if someone needs to be babysat to do a job, why are they in that job?It's more like some people work better under pressure and being in the same area as your boss is pressure.TONS of people I work with work better under pressure. We have plenty of pressure in our deadlines and quality/revenue checks. We make a mistake it can cost the company or our clients literally millions of dollars. People working better under pressure does not mean that pressure must come from someone literally breathing down your neck, and it certainly doesn't mean that *more* pressure is better. I've had micromanaging supes in this job who were down-your-neck breathers, and you know what happened? Everyone did WORSE, AND resented our boss and our job. The particular kind of pressure of a micromanaging boss is not the only kind of pressure in the job, and its arguably not a good kind of pressure. If the person cannot handle the job's normal pressures *without also* a neck-breathing boss, they shouldn't have that job. If someone *needs* a neck-breathing boss to do the job to begin with, they shouldn't have that job. Why would I, as a boss, pay someone to do a job that they can't do unless I take more time out of my day to breathe down their neck, when I can hire someone who can and will do that job *without* this added stress on us both?","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Isn't China beating you guys in human development index?

While it also depends on other factors like congress and the Supreme Court, Trump winning quite likely means the further reduction of the rights of women, especially for abortion, the reduction of lgbt rights, worse healthcare for middle and lower class, less workers rights, worse taxes, education cuts, backwards progress on climate change and environmental protections, a more right Supreme Court cementing any damage for much longer than trumps term, and more.__Is that worth it?_All of this is true.

And importantly, why is this being laid at the feet of the single issue voters and not at the feet of the politicians?And if the expectation is for people to vote for the Democrats even if doing so provides tacit and explicit support for how they have currently and will continue to support Israel, then how precisely is change meant to happen?How are voters meant to pressure politicians if the most potent tool in the toolbox is not allowed to be used?","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"More like WWIII and the Slitheen fart monsters - comically cringe worthy, absolutely monsterous intentions.and anal emissions.","title":"Doctor Who Wrote Goldwater Rule Says He Would Recommend Dementia Tests For Trump"},{"text":"At what point does hoarding wealth while not fairly paying the workers become a major problem?

What about medical ethics? What about any of the other physicians responsible for his care, can they speak up? Where is the accountability for this mans health and oversight of his care? Who is ultimately responsible for his well being? This is concerning in so many ways (more than the obvious).

The government sent the military in and it took about 400 deaths for the military to luckily side with the people and overthrow the government.But in a country whos military has unmanned drones and weapons that just take the click of a button you dont even need a whole standing force to suppress the people.So I can garauntee itll be more than 400 deaths before the military sides with the people.But Im talking about not a civil war but a scenario where the people actually get tired and rise of against the government.The illusion of this even being a two party state is falling apart and not to long after that illusion fades in the eyes of Americans and they can no longer blame the other side but only have the establishment itself to blame people will rise up in some fashion.But like I told another person if you remember the bombing on the civil right group in Philadelphia, a whole residential block with children and women inside. If they are willing to do that. They are willing to do much worse to us which is my point. It wont be to protect the people but It will be to protect their interests.And if you have a military whom is desensitized to committing such horror, horrors will be bestowed upon you with impunity.\\nYou are saying there is no evidence for a revolt yo happen but the evidence is the 99.999% of all empires/nations that have fallen due to revolution and its people rising up.Nothing lasts forever and America is no exception.

There very likely won't be a democracy in the US anymore, palestinians and other muslims in the US will be be in danger in the form of hate crimes and deportation, and that too sickens me. As for Jewish people, Trump and his ilk only care for those in Israel wielding the power to slaughter, and those domestic willing to kiss the ring or with fortunes to grift with. The rest will be in danger from the uprise of the far right, neo nazis that we may never get back into the box again if fully unleashed.LGBTQ+ people like myself are also in grave danger, women are in grave danger. Black people, brown people, immigrants legal and not, all in danger of losing civil rights. All in danger of hate crimes, just like the surge in hate crimes we saw under Trump. They felt emboldened the first time... this time they'll feel right at home.I see so many times people demanding that the situation in Gaza can't get worse than it already is, and I truly cannot understand how a Gaza completely wiped from existence, given wholly over to Isreal for the taking, isn't worse. The situation is horrific beyond horrors, but the thought of wholly giving up on the chance to save those people and their homes to \\"teach the democrats a lesson\\", when there won't even be a lesson to teach. How can they be taught a lesson to rectify it next time if there won't be a next time?Bibi is just as fucking evil as Trump, actually I'd say more so than Trump, since Trump will claim to be anti-war to avoid getting his prissy hands dirty. He still passes his violence onto others and props up dictators. He and Bibi are still of the same little pod.The domestic safety of US minorities, non-christians and women are all at stake, as is all of Gaza... and electing Trump would as well sentence Ukraine to suffer wholly the same fate, a genocide of their own,  possibly leading more of Europe into war. I'm sympathetic to the devastation and the hurt knowing you'd have to vote for the very side that Bibi has unleashed hell under and knowing loved ones and their homes have been so utterly assaulted, but the monster wants Trump. He wants the full power to be unleashed to destroy it all, and for that, he preys on the narrative and refuses any and all talks with the only side in power willing to push cor a cease fire and humanitarian aid. He sabotages and manipulates to turn people away from the side at least *trying*, even if it's not near enough, to *stop him*. To reign him in. He *wants* the American Dictator to win so these extremist despots can bring about their bloody Utopias.So is it truly worth doing what Bibi Netanyahu is pushing for, to make unwitting allies of you to act in his favor? Hurt and loss are powerful, and can bring short sightedness in the heat of their fervor. To refuse to stop and see that is as tragic as it is dangerous, and those who seek to oppress push it, knowing that an appeal to that pain aids them. I am begging people not to sacrifice everything while it can still be saved.Progress is often slow. Perfect can't be the enemy of Good. The GOP understood that and has worked quietly behind the scenes to get to where they are today, undoing everything. It sucks, and it's vile, but we have to be a part of the system to start fixing it from within.

However I don't think it's the case that devauling life in one context means it's inherently devalued in all contexts.The big thing missing from your analysis here is the in-group out-group dichotomy. You briefly flirt with the concept when you say \\" one day you may be the enemy\\". But you didn't truly consider how this lens leads to a subtly different conclusion than what you arrived at.Notably that, yes, the important concept here is the risk of becoming \\"the enemy\\". Of being peeled off from the in-group and placed in the out-group. This is the real risk.Humans are perfectly capable of treating the in-group consistently better than the out-group. We're wonderful at excluding our empathy from the latter while caring deeply about the former. Devauling the lives of the out-group doesn't imply the lives of the in-group will also be devalued. It just increases the consequences of finding oneself suddenly part of the out-group than the in-group.The important subtlety here is that citizenship is not a guarantee of being on the in-group. Marginalized populations within a country therefore have very good reasons to worry about the devaluation of the out-group, because they're arguably part of the out-group already, and even if not they are still more at risk of such an eventuality.However elites and people with multiple majority identities have much less reason to worry about becoming part of the out-group.So it is not the case that  if ones own government is okay with atrocities committed against another people it is okay with doing the same to its own people.But rather  if ones own government is okay with atrocities committed against outgroup members, then this means it will be okay with committing atrocities against its own people (if those people become part of the out-group).The moral takeaway here is to be careful how you treat the outgroup. Not just the citizens of other nations, but the out groups within our own population as well. E.g. don't ask for prisoners to be treated badly because one day you could end up in prison","title":"CMV: If ones own government is okay with atrocities committed against another people it is okay with doing the same to its own people."},{"text":"They should speak to which policies will be better or worse for the economy though..?","title":"Jamie Dimon Privately Supports Kamala Harris.

You've seemingly cherry-picked the data that makes your point more extreme.Overturning Roe V Wade *has* prevented people from accessing abortion services in the first-trimester. Based on these polls, many people wanted stricter rules on second-trimester abortions, but instead lost their right to abortion entirely. It's not remotely inconsistent that 61% of people would argue it was a bad thing.I dont see how this is indicative of being against the will of the people in those statesIn May '22, one month before Roe V Wade was overturned,  67% of people supported first-trimester pregnancies.Following it being overturned, many states enacted trigger laws, or quickly passed new laws that outright banned abortion. At what point did the people vote for these laws? To me it seems as though they were hastily put in place without any interest in what the people of the state wanted.Furthermore, given that 45% of those polled say that abortion is just one of many important factors when it comes to voting for a candidate, it is reductive to argue that they simply need to vote to change these laws. The laws should never have been passed in the manner that they were.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"The enthusiasm is showing up in early voting across the country.After Elons encouragement for social proof, I put up two lawn signs for Trump for the first time ever, to the chagrin of my kids.

Then you walk it over to the scantron (usually a poll worker is there to make sure it goes into the machine smoothly) and once it processes, you get your sticker.I get how your in-laws are feeling, I was concerned about filling in the bubbles while sitting at a table instead of being in a private voting booth when I first walked in.

He played a (big) part in enabling states to kill abortion, but that did require consensus of prior Supreme Court justices and appointees and the senate and the states that did it.And abortion remains quite available in states that want and support it.Its perfectly fine to object to Trumps role in pro-life agenda, Im merely calling for accurate and non hyperbolic statements. Im asserting that the hyperbole does not appeal to centrists, no matter how loud you yell. Trump proudly proclaimed he ended Roe VCorrect. Trump says a lot of things. He takes credit and blames all the time. Women know that Trump and the GOP are a direct threat to their access to abortion Thats true-ish.Again, framing the issue as women vs men is mostly wrong and doesnt really get you anywhere.Mens support of abortion is like 50-50, and women is 60-40 or 65-35 depending on how you phrase the question. There is gender imbalance in the support but its not as massive as you claim.That support is highly regional. In places where abortion is illegal, more women are more in the pro life camp than not.I dont think liberal women in blue states hyperbolizing about abortion access in the places that dont want it is the best election strategy, coming back to the thread / topic.Yall downvoting me are seemingly triggered by some pro life position that I dont hold personally and call for accuracy in statement (which you dont seem to like).

Nearly 50 million people over the past decade have had coverage through the Affordable Care Acts Marketplaces, and the law has protected more than 100 million people with preexisting medical conditions. Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration, Affordable Care Act coverage is more affordable than ever with millions of families saving an average of $800 per year on Marketplace coverage.The Affordable Care Act has also helped millions of women save billions of dollars on contraceptionan essential component of reproductive health care that has only become more important since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. As part of President Biden and Vice President Harris steadfast commitment to reproductive rights, the Biden-Harris Administration has further strengthened contraception access and affordability under the Affordable Care Act, through Medicare and Medicaid, through the Title X Family Planning Program, through federally qualified health centers, and for federal employees, Service members, veterans, and college students.Today [October 21st], the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule that would significantly increase coverage of contraception without cost sharing for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance. Building on the Affordable Care Acts requirement that most private health plans must cover contraception without cost sharing, todays proposed rule from the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, and the Treasury would:* Expand coverage of over-the-counter contraception without cost sharing. Under the proposed rule, for the first time, women would be able to obtain over-the-counter (OTC) contraception without a prescription at no additional cost. As a result, more women would be able to access and afford critical OTC medications such as emergency contraception and the first-ever daily oral contraceptive approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use without a prescription that is now widely available across the country.\\n* Make it easier to learn about coverage for OTC contraception. To help ensure that women understand this new benefit, most private health plans would be required to disclose that OTC contraception is covered without cost sharing and without a prescriptionand take steps to help women learn more about their contraception coverage.\\n* Strengthen coverage of prescribed contraception without cost sharing. The proposed rule would make it easier for most women with private health insurance to obtain contraception without cost sharing that is prescribed by their health care provider. Health plans would be required to cover every FDA-approved contraceptive drug or drug-led combination product without cost sharing unless the plan also covers a therapeutic equivalent without cost sharing, eliminating barriers that some women continue to face in accessing contraception prescribed by their provider.This proposed rule, if finalized, would be the most significant expansion of contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act since 2012, when contraception was first required to be covered. Also today, the Biden-Harris Administration is issuing new guidance to help ensure that patients can access other preventive services, such as cancer screenings, that must be covered without cost sharing under the Affordable Care Act.The Biden-Harris Administration is issuing this proposed rule at a time when reproductive rights are under attack, and Republican elected officials remain committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act. Following the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, dangerous and extreme abortion bans are putting womens health and lives at risk and disrupting access to critical health care services, including contraception, as health care providers are forced to close in states across the country. At the same time, Republican elected officials in some states have made clear they want to ban or restrict birth control in addition to abortion, and Republicans in Congress have attacked contraception access nationwide by proposing to defund the Title X Family Planning Program. In contrast, President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that women in every state must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family.Abridged bullet point list of the following, more on each in the press release:Todays announcements build on actions that the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to expand access to affordable contraception, including to implement the Presidents Executive Order on Strengthening Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception and Family Planning Services from June 2023. The Administration has taken action to:* Expand contraception coverage and affordability under the Affordable Care Act. \\n* Bolster family planning services through Title X clinics.\\n* Support family planning coverage through the Medicaid and Medicare programs.\\n* Increase contraception access through federal health centers.\\n* Support contraception access for federal employees and their families. \\n* Promote contraception access and affordability for Service members and their families and certain dependents of veterans.\\n* Support access to affordable contraception for college students.\\n* Enhance contraception access through technical assistance and public-private partnership.\\n* Promote research and data analysis on contraception access.In addition to strengthening access to affordable contraception, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to implement President Bidens threeExecutiveOrders and a Presidential Memorandum directing federal agencies to protect access to reproductive health care issued since the Court overturned Roe v. Wade. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to protect access to abortion, including FDA-approved medication abortion; defend access to emergency medical care; support the ability to travel for reproductive health care; safeguard the privacy of patients and health care providers; and ensure access to accurate information and legal resources.The Vice President has led the White Houses efforts to partner with leaders on the frontlines of protecting access to abortion, highlighting the harm of abortion bans to womens health at more than 100 events in more than 20 states since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and meeting with hundreds of  state legislators, health care providers, and advocates. On what would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Vice President launched a nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour to continue fighting back against extreme attacks throughout America.President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law to ensure that women in every state are able to make their own decisions about reproductive health care.Related press releases:* [Interested Parties Memo: Biden-?Harris Administration Expands Coverage of Contraception Under the Affordable Care Act as Republican Elected Officials Continue Attacks on Reproductive Freedom](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/interested-parties-memo-biden-harris-administration-expands-coverage-of-contraception-under-the-affordable-care-act-as-republican-elected-officials-continue-attacks-on-reproductive-freedom/)* [Statement from President Joe Biden on New Action to Significantly Expand Contraception Coverage Under the Affordable Care Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-new-action-to-significantly-expand-contraception-coverage-under-the-affordable-care-act/)* [Statement from Vice President Kamala Harris on New Rulemaking to Expand Access to Contraception](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/statement-from-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-new-rulemaking-to-expand-access-to-contraception/)","title":"Fact Sheet: Biden-?Harris Administration Proposes Rule to Expand Coverage of Affordable Contraception Under the Affordable Care Act"},{"text":"I love people who think white people in white countries are a protected minority - will no one think of the white man! ??","title":"The Democrat Party is the racist as fuck.

Jews and Zionists and Israelis alike criticize Israel every day, youre not doing what they are doing You wouldn't be called antisemitic if you guys didn't use Nazi symbolism to try and make your point.  You wouldn't be called antisemitic if you didn't constantly use holocaust inversion.  You wouldn't be called antisemitic if you didn't share the same chants as those who *are* antisemitic.  You would not be called antisemitic if you weren't promoting the \\"Red hand.\\"  You would not be called an antisemite if you didn't align yourself with the kind of people who chanted \\"Gas the Jews\\" immediately after October 7th.  You would not be called an antisemite if you weren't vandalizing Jewish owned businesses.  You would not be called an antisemite if you stopped calling bomb threats to synagogues and JCC centers.  You would not be called an antisemite if you weren't tokenizing anti-zionist Jews and saying \\"see?  not all Jews are zionists\\" But more importantly, you would not be called antisemitic, if you didn't *constantly*, for a whole year, dismiss people's concerns about antisemitism, writing it off as \\"it's not antisemitic\\" despite an entire group of people who are finding this stuff offensive!  How dare you sit there and try to dictate what a group should, or shouldn't find offensive?  That is shameful, bull shit, loser behavior.   If you don't want people to treat you like a loser, then you need to either 1) stop acting like a loser, or 2) stop hanging out with people who are losers.   Whether you want to admit to it or not, you are swimming in that pool of shit, and people smell the shit coming off of you.  Nobody is confused.And you know what, I would bet everyone $5 that your response to this is going to be some variation of \\"Oh, of course I know antisemitism exists....\\" because you guys *always* say that.  But funny enough, for a whole year I have been asking the \\"we know antisemitism exists\\" people of what would constitute antisemitism.  So much god damn gatekeeping of antisemitism from non-Jews and yet they will not give you any examples of when something counts as antisemitic.  Just the other day, I saw people defending the Hamas Charter article 7 about killing Jews, as not antisemitic.  Someone who smeared shit on a statue at a synagogue was \\"not antisemitic.\\"  At this point, I'm convinced that you guys would see someone go to a temple in full SS gear and you'll still find some reason for why it's not antisemitic - but thank god you \\"know that antisemitism exists\\"And if you don't like the \\"label\\"  I really, truly don't care - and neither does anyone else.  People have important things to worry about, they have real problems.   If *your* problem is \\"people keep calling me antisemitic\\" then you need to sort yourself out, and come back when you have a real problem.  Because complaining about being \\"labeled\\" as antisemitic is about as lame as when an incel complains about being called an incel, or when a Trumper complains that their All Lives Matter commentary is flagged as racist.  You might as well just stop complaining about it, because people don't care about those problems.EDIT:  One more point. Even though if you actually cared about the people that are Israeli, you would see they are not served by this horrific violence of forever wars. Just a tip - you do not need to \\"weigh in\\" and speak for an entire group of people as if you know what's best for them.  You do not know what is best for Israelis, and you sure as shit do not know what is best for the Jews.  People really ought to learn the art of shutting their mouth every now and again.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"esp. black men","title":"This is the most tyrannical and evil thing that Kamala Harris has EVER been caught on camera saying."},{"text":"This is one reason why I havent bothered donating to Dems this cycle.

Let me break it down the way I see it. Just breaking it down point by point: I'm working with you to design some test system to measure pollution of the factory runoff. I have no knowledge of your specialization, you have no knowledge of mine.This is an email with a government spec sheet and probably tailored specifically to California's spec in 99% of scenarios. California's regulatory spillover means that in 99% of the time if you want to participate in California's economy you're making your product, method or service in service to doing business with California because it's the largest, most prohibitive economy to participate in. But yes, this is indeed an email and not a conversation. You can do more actionable work with that spec sheet than trying to build out a bunch of insights about my job.\\nTo get this job done, your ideas need to be tempered by what is actually manufacturable.Again this is an email not a meeting or a cross functional team. I emailed you that spec sheet earlier, and I go \\"What is the most feasible way for you to achieve an outcome for as close to this cost given Y constraints?\\"I have no knowledge about what materials are acceptable to expose to the environment.That's why they make spec sheets.I don't know your input and output needs, you obviously don't have the knowledge of systems design. We have to work together on this.We don't. I fully grant that I may be starting to sound like an exception at this point in the conversation and if so you can say so. But this is also more data sheet information that can be emailed with a 5 sentence or less explanation.This is just two people so far, but maybe we need an electrical engineer to design the electrical system, maybe the system is large enough that we need the team that will build it to have a say. As the team grows, it gets harder and harder to have exclusively remote meetings. Being in the same space makes everyone more flexible, collaboratively.This is probably where the fundamental disagreement is and as a systems engineer I'm a bit floored that this was the hill you're choosing to die on. You're advocating for adding error rates into the system of cross-functional communication by including fallible human memory. You're not thinking of the purpose of communication as *data transmission.* It is vastly superior to keep recorded data on record through textual chat than it is to have a conversation, and introduce additional points of failure based on miscommunication or understanding. In fact seeing text makes it FAR easier to identify areas of misunderstanding because if you write something down that is obviously incorrect I can more easily correct the record than doubling or tripling back to points we discussed but didn't write down, type or record. So the more complex the project the MORE essential it is to reduce human inputs down to a binary because each person adds infinite complexity vs documentation which at most adds a binary. If you think of teams as a system unto itself, it's a more efficient system to add clarity and reduce errors by removing the imprecision of human elements as much as possible. Contextually rich textual data is worth a thousand meetings.","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"Troll.

Automotive margins, besides light-duty and pickup trucks, are razor thin and they rely on volume.  Apple dumped billions trying to enter automotive and gave up precisely because their business model would fail in an industry with low margins and high production costs.  If you compare within industries, GM had an amazing quarter.  If you compare to GM historically (accounting for inflation) they're nearing record highs.  There's really no single metric to judge a company by, but EPS, ROE, Operating Cash Flow, etc all are as important, or more, than simple margins.  The closest thing to a single metric is EBITDA but even that's more important for startups not established, borderline dividend, companies like GM.If you believe only executives were respectively for GMs amazing earnings report this quarter, then that justifies them receiving raises and bonuses while the workforce doesn't.

I dont think they have caught up with inflation though. I can imagine they will at this rate, but it hasnt yet.I think the real explanation is that all this inflation  we have experienced is primarily a result of enormous deficit spending. I would say most of the blame for that (say two thirds of the blame) is on congress, with the remaining one third on the president since he has veto power. But the enormous deficit spending started under Trump, and is fizzling out under Biden, but still not as low as it should be. So I think Trump shares just as much of the blame for the inflation as Biden does.Another, Somewhat snarky explanation I could give is that when Trump first became president in 2017, he inherited a strong economy with an upward trajectory from Obama. By the end of his presidency the economy was on a downward trajectory. Then Biden inherited an economy with a downward trajectory from Trump in 2021 but under the Biden administration it is now back on an upward trajectory (which Trump is somewhat likely to inherit.

Well, Obama thought that perhaps he could appeal to their better nature by nominating someone uncontroversial, utterly milquetoast; the kind of SCOTUS pick that a functional Senate should have no problem confirming. One GOP Senator mentioned Garland, and that was who Obama went with. He trotted Garland out before the media and made some big flowery speech about bipartisanship and compromise. \\nHis hope?

Warren: Trump is telling us loud and clear he wants to destroy our democracy"},{"text":"I disagree on a lot of your points and will do my best to organize my thoughts. Starting off, your option 4 seems like a non-starter. If a voter deeply care about what is going on in Gaza, it is baffling to suggest they give up their voting power and settle for a candidate that is anathema to their cause, under the naive idea that this will somehow curry political favor with Harris and she will bend to their pressure when they can do nothing at that point beyond ineffectual protests. Also, the issue of Gaza is time sensitive and not something we can kick down the road until the next administration. 4 years is a long time in a genocide and there might not be people left to help by then.Next, is Harris even a progressive? She is incredibly hawkish when it comes to foreign policy and the military. She is going tough currently on immigration and crime. She has basically stated she has no intention on making progress on green energy or environmentalism and is for the use of fracking. One of the only and best things Biden did was his policies and aid towards the labor unions, but Harris has said zero in regards to it. There is almost no chance that she would help codify roe v wade, since it is primary wedge issue keeping democrats elected. Lastly, she was not elected in a populist movement nor has any real voter base, she was chosen and is an extension of the political elite and will be a representative of their interests.Another thing to consider, is that a president's unique power is in regards to foreign policy and military usage. It should be one of the most important factors when voting for a candidate. Domestic policy is also important, but is tangental to their power. If you want progressive domestic policy you should be focusing on local senators, governors, mayors, etc. whom will have a much larger impact in your day to day life then any president will.Lastly, when it comes to foreign policy regarding Israel and the Middle East, Harris seems like a known quantity at this point and a bad one. She is currently in an administration that is protecting and arming the atrocities happening in Gaza and she has made no effort to distance or differentiate herself from the decisions made by the administration. She has made incredibly hawkish statements regarding the conflict and the military in general. And when ask who America's greatest foreign threat is, she said Iran. Which is a terrible answer in general, but is probably reflective of her mindset and a good indication of how she is going to handle the looming regional war in the Middle East.I agree that Trump is not generally different in regards to Israel and Gaza. He has stated that he openly supports Israel as well. I do think that Trump is a lesser known quantity though. I think there is a good argument to be made that he will be worst than Harris in regards to the Middle East, since he is far less restrained by his political base. But I think there is an equally good argument that Trump could be better than Harris as well. Trump only cares about himself and has demonstrated that he will throw anyone and everyone under the bus if he thinks it is advantageous for him. He cares nothing about Israel and I don't think he wants his legacy to be embroiling America into another 10-20 year long war in the Middle East. He also doesn't care about America and its larger strategic interest in the Middle East 20-50 years in the future, but rather the daily political theater of his own presidency. I could foresee him strong arming Israel to curtail the war early, or if negotiations don't go his way, creating the worst nightmare for Netanyahu ... an American president posting and speaking non-stop about how awful Israel and or Netanyahu is.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"OPs reading comprehension is subpar.","title":"McDonalds has no record of Kamala Harris working there, contrary to the Harris's campaigns delusional statements"},{"text":"Alert! ??

At all. You're ignoring a good deal of his argument around this and kind of morphing it into a different argument. Xs biggest issue with northern white liberals (which as you said, he changed his tune on near the end) had to do with the fact that while they were very much in favor of the civil rights movement, they continued to segregate blacks in their large liberal cities via refusing housing loans in white neighborhoods and things of that nature. It was less overt segregation. However, he was somewhat misguided, as that was big business more than local politics (the two were still separate back then). While the local politicians offered no true solutions for this, they weren't the architects of it either.This entire argument also kind of overlooks the fact that the Dems literally have a woman of color as their nominee currently, as opposed to the GOP who haven't had anything other than a white male nom. Is that a ploy of some kind? How about Obama smoking Hillary in the primary in 2007? Another political ploy? Come off it, man. One is fine with people of color, one isn't. Are white liberals perfect in their understanding and support of people of color? Of course not. But let's not try to pull a \\"both sides\\" or add nuance that really isn't there.

Theyre not really hiding it like they were in the past. Contrary to that, I actually think Harris voters are the silent voting bloc this time around. I have actually had to hide the fact that Im voting for Harris this election around certain people, because Im just going to be met with disgust or people trying to explain to me why thats a bad idea and think theyre above everyone else.

I think these do sometimes hurt the media's credibility. But they can also have serious consequences. Especially when he double's down on these statements. Are you aware of why he set up the McDonald's stunt? I think you're missing the point of the McDonald's photo op,  this was Trump's attempt to troll Harris. Harris has previously mentioned she worked at a McDonald's in college. Trump is claiming that is a lie based no no evidence. It's juvenile and based on a lie, but it still supports a harmful narrative. The narrative in conservative circles is that \\"Trump has worked 15 more minutes in a service job than Harris.\\" The fact that you either aren't aware of this, or failed to mention it, kind of proves the reason why giving Trump the benefit of the doubt is dangerous.Giving Trump the benefit of the doubt is partly how he got elected in the first place. He has an unserious personality, but with serious power. That's been kind of the problem, he treats the office like his own personal plaything. Giving Trump the benefit of the doubt is why his quotes are sane-washed in the media. Accepting that the McDonald's stunt was just Trump having some fun makes him seem relatable and normal to the undecided voters, rather than the petty, mean and vengeful propaganda piece that it was. And yes, it's funny to us in a certain sense. It's funny cuz that he is so petty and ridiculous. It's funny because he looks like a doofus and we know he couldn't actually do the job. But conservatives think it's funny for a different reason. They think it's funny because he \\"one up'd\\" Harris and called her out...even though there is no credible reason to believe his claim. And of course the underlying irony is that they don't respect service workers, their rights, or their job. It's a mockery of service jobs and in turn a mockery of Harris. What benefit is there to supporting him mocking Harris?The problem is that Trump is joking and funny is ultimately dangerous. Let's not forget that when he gathered his supporters on Jan 6th and directed them to the Capitol to create a distraction for his coup attempt, the excuse was that they were just messing around....\\"touring\\" the building, stealing podiums, and ultimately just having a little fun trolling the government. The reason he is still able to run such a close race is entirely thanks to the fact that most of his supporters don't think Jan. 6th was a real coup attempt...to them it was just a Trump rally that got a little too rowdy. But I assure you that people behind the scenes are very aware of the plan, they are preparing for this November, and they need Trump to keep up the fun facade.","title":"CMV: Democrat Voters Recognizing Trump can be Funny is Beneficial to the Harris Campaign"},{"text":"it is horrifying.

I think if you look at the candidates, if you look at the overwhelming majority of their supporters, Democrats win on the \\"kind and compassionate\\"-front. Democrats who shout something equally crazy as \\"Jews will not replace us\\" will be shut down, not amplified by the candidate. (I know this was in '20, but you and I both know that it hasn't become more civilized over there in the last 4 years.) We're not perfect, and sometime when we're frustrated we overstep the line when we jokingly refer to 1/6 insurrections as the run-of-the-mill undecided voter of 2024, but you just agreed that we don't have to perfect.The reason why online interactions are so unlikely to change anyone's votes is that I don't you very well, you don't know me very well, and neither of us is really invested in this discussion. I am happy to engage with you on the policies if you want to do that - but since we don't know each other yet and since neither of us is inherently invested in this conversation, there is a high chance that you don't want to do this right now, and that's fine. What some people \\"between the parties\\" are missing is that there are voters on the other side of the party, too. Yes, mocking you personally (although I find it unlikely I would ever find that particularly funny) does make it much less likely that you will agree to even listen to what I have to say. But pretending everything is fine is also just as toxic.  \\nThink of the following hypothetical ad: \\"This is Dave. Dave voted from Trump twice. When Trump announced the '20 election was stolen from him, Dave believed him. Dave is now highly relevant to both campaigns because he is one of the highly sought after undecided voters for the 2024 election. He is only relevant because millions of voters will not vote. Don't let Dave decide the election. Make your voices heard, and vote!\\"  \\nWhile I don't think the campaign would ever write or air such an ad - because the campaign has been very precise in not attacking former or current Trump voters - in my community, that would probably be a successful one. As always there isn't much room between being kind an compassionate on one side, and sane-washing insanity on the other.","title":"CMV: Telling People That They Are Stupid Is Not Smart"},{"text":"His responsibility is to shareholders.

If Harris loses, there will be lots of ink spilled on what they should do, but the direction will be determined based on how the base reacts in future primaries, not on any sort of top-down planning. If there had been a full primary this time around, Harris probably would have ended up being the compromise candidate between the establishment and the progressives, it just would have been a bloodier fight to get there. That said, other than her (somewhat unfair) baggage from her role in Biden's administration, I'm not sure you could design a better compromise candidate, and she's run a great campaign. If she can't win this election, I think maybe the the Democrats should just throw their hands up and say that this election was unwinnable, Trump's personality cult just warped the poltical landscape too much, and (assuming he isn't on the ballot in 2028), whatever lessons you attempt to learn from this cycle won't apply next cycle anyway.","title":"If Harris loses, expect Democrats to move right"},{"text":"Didn't happen after Kerry in 2004 or HRC in 2016.

In short, they needed 2020 to figure out if 2016 was the new norm. And, 2020 confirmed that so the entire industry reshaped itself: [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/)But what all this does is there's fundamental assumptions made about how opinions of the people who they reach and how like the electorate it is. In short, the pollsters can't tell you who will win, but they will tell you how close the race is. They were right both in 2016 and 2020 that the race was close.For these reasons, I think DJT is very likely to win in a few weeks.All four of your points essentially can be grouped in the hypothesis that narratives explain outcomes. I think with the 24/7 pace of the news, people have to give on the spot analysis and so narratives are good default ways to explain a complex world. But when the dust settles, what really matters is who voted. It matters who the electorate is. For as important as elections are in terms of media narrative, most Americans aren't that political, and millions are unreliable voters. [https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/)The electorate isn't static and that's why the grand narrative hypothesis fails because for it to be true, you'd have to have a static electorate.So, what drives drastic changes in the composition of the electorate? Voter turn out, which yes, narrative and negative partisanship can help. But what really makes the difference in tight elections are the ground game. That's where Clinton fucked up in 2016 - the Obama operations of 2008 and 2012 weren't in the DNC, they were back in tech or the private sector or his foundation. Clinton's people had to scramble to replicate that and her in-fighting amongst her advisors really scuttled how messed up their ground game was. They were having canvassers knock on the doors that other parts of her campaign knew such person was a more likely Trump supporter. It was that bad. In equal measure, the reason Romney (and people laugh at this now) was confident in his in in 2012 was that the Obama ground game essentially got so many otherwise non-voters to vote that it defied political convention.So in 2016 and 2020 both, Trump's campaign had horrible ground game. In large part in 2016, Trump didn't run a campaign like a guy that actually thought he was going to win. His campaign presence wasn't really there. What bolstered him is the RNC in the aftermath of getting outmuscled by Obama put resources there. So the down ballot and RNC were able to carry Trump (and he got some inadvertent help by Clinton). In 2020 was the COVID years.This is why Lara Trump's takeover of the RNC, and how they've funneled money to Trump is really going to hurt them. They also have decided to show how smart they are in outsourcing GOTV to consultants outside the RNC, who likely are fleecing them for their money. Like the consultant groups are claiming they're doing canvassing that we know they're not.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"Kid rock, Hulk Hogan, Ted Nugent, MyPillow Guy, Rob Schneider, Fabio, Pauly D, etcthese are Trumps fan boys LOL","title":"Eminem to Appear on Campaign Trail With Barack Obama Tonight"},{"text":"What does that even mean?","title":"The Lincoln Project on Instagram: \\"Democrats, stop panicking and start organizing.

Modifying your language doesn't make this statement any less true.But you just outlined four distinct steps all of which had different actors, of which Trump did the first one and not the other three.This is poor reasoning. You can still be held accountable for an outcome even if you do not undertake the action that immediately results in that outcome. There is a proximate, causal relationship between Donald Trump's decision to stack the court with anti-abortion judges and those same judges enabling legislators to outlaw abortion.You can say that Trump is generally supportive of pro life policy but saying he made it illegal is just incorrect.Nobody is saying that Trump *personally* passed the laws that made abortion illegal. What's being explained is that Trump enabled the passing of laws that made abortion illegal, which means that he participated in the process of getting abortions outlawed. We can hold him responsible for the actions that he took that ultimately resulted in this outcome. It's no different than holding any other decision maker responsible for their decisions. https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspxNone of these poll suggest majority-female opposition to abortion. In fact, the large majority of the polls you linked - and virtually all of the recent polls - show that it is a minority that is opposed to abortion. They are elected by women. Women are 51% of the vote, and their vote cannot be cracked or packed because its evenly distributed.That's not how any of this works. What? The fact that the majority of the electorate are women does not mean that women alone determine who wins in an election. If 75% of men support a candidate, only 28% of women need to share that support to give the candidate a majority. That does not mean that women elected the candidate. Women broadly opposed the candidate, but the candidate won because men overwhelmingly supported the candidate.Women vote for these people.Yes, a minority of women vote for these people. That does not mean that \\"the vast majority\\" of women oppose abortion, as you claimed. It means that some percentage of women - usually in the 25-40% range - are opposed to abortion alongside a larger percentage of men.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is highly likely to win the upcoming General Election in a couple weeks"},{"text":"A scripted \\"Town Hall\\" should be, all that you need, to tell you that you have a pathetically weak ass candidate. ??","title":"Kamala Harris 'Town Hall' With Liz Cheney Blows Up on the Launch Pad, and Just Gets Worse From There"},{"text":"Don't forget about Billy Ray Cyrus and Lil' Pump /s","title":"Bruce Springsteen to headline Thursdays Harris-Obama rally in Atlanta"},{"text":"A thirty caliber round has uniquely persuasive powers in that realm.Or was it 5.56?

And if the \\"pet issues\\" are minority issues --- like thinking we should Return to the Gold Standard -- you cannot pander to that person; you will lose votes.Maybe I won't vote because I want \\"online poker legalized again\\" and only Andrew Yang has heavily endorsed that, and I hate all candidates. .... Okay, will anyone know that by me not voting, or voting for Jill \\"Kunty\\" Stein? ... No, they won't. And they won't care. They'll be focused on winning the next election.You're simply being stubborn &amp; think you're \\"mattering\\" - you aren't. .... The Gaza thing -- if Kamala would win the election by going Full Gaza, she would do that. She cannot. She'd lose just as many Jewish voters as she'd gain pro Gazan voters.... So seems like you're completely ignorant of politics and prefer Trump wins the Presidency (or have no preference at all) because due to immaturity, you want to \\"burn it all down\\" to teach \\"someone\\" a lesson in a fit of powerless rage. .... Well, you sound exactly like a MAGA Trumper at this point.The good news is you might get your wish. And burn everything down. It still won't help Gaza though.(Oh and by burn it down I don't mean get rid of our current flawed systems, I mean let Trump become Cheetoh Mussolini and install a fascist dictatorship that rounds up brown people in America).","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"I'm not a fan of political rallies but as a big Springsteen fan I'd consider going to this one.","title":"Bruce Springsteen to headline Thursdays Harris-Obama rally in Atlanta"},{"text":"Another scum company treating its employees like scum.","title":"GMs profit nears a record a year after saying it couldnt afford its workers pay demands"},{"text":"We are bearing witness to this in real time.

Offering free vaccines makes people who are likely to be vaccinated more likely? to choose the plan. These measures may line up with public health objectives that try to maximize health per dollar of regulatory expense/subsidy, but more likely they just maximize discrimination power or reduction in adverse selection problems.\\nI think insurance regulations should be narrowly focused on providing a framework for letting markets survive adverse selection problems and information asymmetries to let consumers hedge their risk.

The GWB admin and the Obama admin both increased the presence of CDC staff in China significantly because of this.  Trumps administration cut that staffing from 50 to 20 people.  That significantly decreased their ability to assist with containment.  Trump himself almost certainly had no direct role in this, but his admin did.  Also a major element of his presidency was cutting regulations, decreasing government staffing, and decreasing the global presence of the US; clearly all three of these things would be considered reasons why the CDC-China branch was cut so severely.  So it is not a big jump to say that Trump contributed to this Covid issues at the very start of it.

The graph below shows voter registration stats for this state from 2009-2024. It plots registered dems (blue), registered repubs (red), and those registered as unaffiliated (which is Coloradoese for \\"no party preference\\") in green.The data speaks for itself- both parties have **lost** membership since 2016. All the growth since then has been taking place in the ranks of the Unaffiliated, which utterly dwarfs the membership in both parties. In 2016 and 2020, the Bernie debacles certainly cost the dems. But it should be remembered the CO Republican party also royally pissed off its base in 2016, by not having a primary and simply throwing their support behind whoever was leading at the convention- i.e.,Trump. That led to a number of the rock-ribbed repub faithful leaving that party *due to their Trump support*, as well as those of us who dumped the dems, never to return. Colorado also went to open primaries after 2016, so party membership is no longer a necessity.Food for thought. If *either* party thought that they were in some sense \\"growing\\" here in CO, they would appear to be mistaken. The effort to look up this sort of data and graph it is trivial- folks in other states should give it a try. It can be informative.https://i.ibb.co/FBnVh6q/COregdata02-24.jpg","title":"Dems continue to collapse with their own actual base, at the same time they hit lows with white working class voters and men at large"},{"text":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/early-vote","title":"Registered Democrats Hold Early Voting Advantage as of 9am EST Oct. 22 - Get Out There and Run-up Those Numbers!"},{"text":"Pure evil","title":"BREAKING: Voters in Tarrant County, Texas are reporting that the voting machines are flipping their votes from Trump to Kamala Harris"},{"text":"This may be a dumb question but would not a company having record profits every year be normal if the company is financially healthy?

My employer DID track the numbers, and found them inconclusive, because we were just as productive as home. WFH is not in opposition to getting our job done. So what it becomes is control for control sake. Like if my employer made me and all the office workers wear uniforms even though it had no impact on us doing our jobs. We absolutely SHOULD be pushing back when employers try to change our work conditions in ways that aren't best for us, that's what unions and labor movements are all about.?\\nIf we had stronger labor protections here in the US, I think we'd be more likely to be able to bargain for things like this.?","title":"CMV: there is no reason to RTO unless your job can only be accomplished from your place of work"},{"text":"It was a great Troll.","title":"Trump's McDonald's Stunt Is Going to Cause More Problems on the Left Than Kamala's Campaign"},{"text":"Meanwhile truthsocial stock and the trump watches are entirely money laundering funnels or foreign bribes.","title":"Texas AG goes after Democratic fundraising as GOP outspent in key races"},{"text":"This is a big fucking deal.Lots of white boys might be influenced by Eminem.","title":"Eminem to Appear on Campaign Trail With Barack Obama Tonight"},{"text":"Trump is the one who talks about how Putin is so smart and loves dictators. ??","title":"Kamala Harris beats Donald Trump on disaster response: New polling"},{"text":"A town hall with predetermined questions.

They do care about votes. That's why all the relevant legislation gets passed just before election cycles.?\\nVoting third party indicates that there is someone who WILL vote, but that you need to win over. Voting for Harris indicates that you're properly in the lesser evil fold - no matter what they do, as long as they aren't as completely awful as Trump, you'll vote for them. So they need to make 0 policy adjustments to guarantee your vote.?\\nLook at all the recent rhetoric about the \\"migrant crisis\\" from Harris. Or Walz saying we need to build the border wall. When Trump said these things, progressives were mortified. When the person saying it is wearing blue, they're cool. Lesser evil voting makes sense. The question is - is there a point at which rubber stamping your approval of a regime is too far?\\n?For many voting third party, genocide is that line. If the Democrats know that their voter base will turn up if they are anti immigrant, anti LGBTQ, and funding genocide, why would they EVER go for progressive policies? It's not like that'll change the number of votes. As long as they inch towards fascism more slowly than the Republican party, they'll get the vote.?\\nIt's easy to ignore the genocide because it's happening far away. But if say, Hitler, has fantastic domestic policy, and the only caveat is incinerating 6 million undesirables in a faraway place, out of sight, would you elect him??\\nThere are two scenarios: 1) you vote 3rd party, everyone votes lesser evil, Kamala wins. You haven't contributed anything bad. 2) enough people vote 3rd party to swing the election - in the next race the Democrats have an incentive to actually make progress to win the percentage of people who are \\"voting, and not Republicans\\"?\\nBasically, it's a long-term play. Every election of my adult life has been the same - Trump vs Democrat that you must elect because otherwise the fascist gains power. They've had 8 YEARS to prepare. But they're still using the \\"vote for me because I'll only genocide the brown people\\"?\\nOf course, in the latter case liberals will immediately attack the left, instead of the right, or instead of the Democrats for not stopping funding genocide, because that's what they do.?\\nBut that's something I can be fine with. Aside: slightly spitefully - I also really dislike the? vote blue no matter who folks, who are also responsible for memes like \\"Kamala is brat\\" etc. it just gives me a deep distaste to see someone meme-ified who defends a regime, after seeing that regime burn a child with an IV in a hospital alive. So guilt trips from them don't really work.\\nEdit: from an accelerationist perspective - if Trump is the one making the bad policies, instead of the Democrats, vote blue no matter who liberals might finally think they're bad, and do something about it. With the border wall - now that Biden / Harris are campaigning for tougher immigration, liberals are all on board and jeering at the Republicans for vetoing.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"\\"Youre not, unfortunately, we have some pre-determined questions, the former Dateline correspondent replied.?Hopefully Ill be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head, Shriver added.","title":"Kamala Harris town hall host Maria Shriver shuts down Michigan voter hoping to ask a question"},{"text":" This country is structured around manufacturing everything to fit some sort of agenda I recall when the country was structured around manufacturing *of goods* and the democratic party was the champion of the working class who kept this structure going.

I get the sense that some people's \\"badness sensor\\" can get similarly saturated in a way that prevents them from distinguishing between possibilities.

However, the remaining human survivors, few though they may be in those scenarios, would likely disagree, and their opinions should count.I can accept that people experience this sort of saturation, but I cannot think of an issue or position that would cause this sort of saturation in myself. The system of checks and balances in the United States means that many elected offices have varied powers, and it's important to consider the totality of how the person will use these powers, no matter how odious they may be in one aspect or another.This is all to pedantically point out that not *everyone* has issues like this.

Rather, what we are seeing, and what should be addressed is Harris failing those voters. She refuses to do anything of substance, and so she failed to earn the votes of those people. Everyone seems to have forgotten votes are earned, and we should not be blindly and feverishly supportive of a candidate. If the democrats are truly scared of fascism, and truly want to ensure they win at all costs, instead of trying to convince people to be okay with a genocide, they need to apply that pressure to Harris. We should all be in an uproar over this waste of human life and taxpayer money anyway. So stop targeting the people on the fence or wont vote for her, target Harris to change her policies to win them back. At this point I dont believe they can be bullied or threatened back to the party. This is also the time when I believe the anti-war, anti-Zionist sentiment has the most leverage. After Harris has won, she will have far less reason to change her policies, she absolutely will not go well those anti-genocide voters came around and voted for me so Ill listen to them *now*\\nBidens ultimatum expires after voting is over, which should also be a clear sign they are starting to pay lip service, but have no intention of changing the status quo in the slightest.","title":"CMV: Progressives being anti-electoral single issue voters because of Gaza are damaging their own interests."},{"text":"Pretty much every company since covid has been \\"struggling\\" yet miraculously making record profits.

Excerpt: College education is becoming a bigger factor than race and ethnicity, said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist and senior fellow at the University of California, Irvines, School of Social Ecology, who reviewed the Journals findings. This divergence around education in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods persisted during the 2022 midterm elections, the Journal found, and mirrors a familiar pattern among white voters, where educational attainment has become a political fault line. The findings help explain polling trends that have shown support slipping for Democrats among Latino and Black voters. While majorities in both groups still support the Democratic Party, Journal polling shows the GOP has made inroads among these voters in recent years. A nationwide Journal poll from August shows that 83% of Black voters and 59% of Latino voters prefer Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump. But in 2020, Biden ran 10 points better among Black voters and six points better among Latinos. Carlos Odio, co-founder of Equis Research, a Democratic-aligned firm that focuses on Latino voters, cautioned against oversimplifying the role of education in voting. Odio noted that among Latinos, lower educational attainment often correlates with being less partisan, making these voters more susceptible to swings between parties, rather than indicating a firm shift toward Republicans.","title":"College Divide Erodes Democrats Support From Black and Hispanic Voters"},{"text":"When you have a candidate who very loudly proclaims that any election he doesnt win is rigged then shit like this happens.","title":"Democrats prepare to wage legal war with GOP over election"},{"text":"A spot of hope in a see if womens blood.","title":"Nebraska Democrats hope Omaha will be a blue dot on the states red electoral map ? and their lawn sign is a vibe"},{"text":" pass the CA barWatching her rallies, I think she stops in all the bars.","title":"Kamala Harris Got Into Law School Via a Program She Didn't Quality For"},{"text":"cypher?","title":"Eminem to Appear on Campaign Trail With Barack Obama Tonight"},{"text":"The idea that most people operate with hidden ulterior motives behind their actions is wild.","title":"CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal."},{"text":"I wonder if the workers who were told to stay home and miss their 8 hour morning shifts were paid?","title":"They hated it in Biden but love it in Trump how pathetic"},{"text":"Yeah this is concerning.
