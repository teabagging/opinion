If your polling place is normally prepared, you'll have full access to the voting booth without having to tell anyone your party or voting preference - that's private and nobody's business but your own.  This not being a primary but a general election as well as state stuff, your party registration is not likely listed on anything the check-in folks will see.  You MAY see folks hanging around outside the polling place (or 50 or 100 feet away - borders outside of which partisan tables are allowed).  The ones smiling are sane.  The ones who look intimidating are trying to intimidate voters, which may or may not yet be illegal in your state (We have new federal legislation in the hopper).  While many voting officials give up their party registration to avoid even the appearance of being partisan, we do know of instances of MAGA agents inside election offices.  In theory, bipartisan eyes on everything makes for accurate voting, but MAGA does work at physical information transfer points, generally using some rule or loophole to delay votes from being counted.  But that's not your problem.  As we now, Georgia (and perhaps some other Lost Cause states) passed legislation banning the offering of food or water within some distance of polling places.  One piece of advice:  Don't wear partisan stuff - no Go Dems t-shirt or Biden 2020 cap.  They'll likely order you to take it off.  Bottom line:  Just get everyone you can to vote before or on Election Day, and we'll defeat MAGA and begin the process of rebuilding national unity.

Trump wants to spend loads of money building and protecting a border thats gonna get crossed anyways, rather than focus on getting illegal immigrants to naturalize and work, pay taxes, etc. however all of this immigration talk for example does distract from the policies which actually impact everyone (often both in and outside of america).Both presidential candidates but especially trump is playing a media game talking about controversial topics to get views rather than important (but likely boring) issues that plague America, as they both know that in a two party system the media influence is the deciding factor in the election.","title":"Kamala Harris is winning over Republicans from Trump, polls suggest"},{"text":"The media is super left leaning and doesnt represent the opinion of the nation properly.

Look at most polls. They poll at most 2000 so-called 'likely voters', and try to discern all 150 million Americans who will vote this coming election's choices based on finely slicing the 2000 people into groups. Let's start with that term \\"Likely Voter\\". That term is defined as a person who will likely cast a ballot in the next election. It's not enough to be registered to vote. They want to predict if you'll actually turn out, because you might say you're gonna vote Harris, but then spend all of 5th November playing Counterstrike and never show up at the polls. They really want to catch those kind of voters and remove their influence from the polls, because historically, a person who registerred to vote for the first time has been an unreliable voter. So at best, they weigh your response lower, if not completely throw your response out as soon as they figure out you've never voted before, or didn't vote in the last election. That might turn out to be a bad choice if all these new Swifties turn in their ballots...I hear there were over a million of them that registered. Another way this could go wrong is if you get your sampling wrong. Sample 1000 people in Denver, CO, and you'll get different responses than if you sample 1000 people in Cheyanne, WY, or even Colorado Springs, CO. But what happens if your random sample includes a lot of Whackadoodle GQPers and none of the guys like Mr. Sykes? You overestimate the Trumper element in the electorate, and underestimate the Never Trumpers and the other people in the coalition. And if you massage your numbers enough, assuming EVERY Republican will vote for Trump despite a handful saying they won't in your sample set, you can make a doom and gloom prediction.

Freeing the Republicans to say anything they want.  Currently, the democrats are speaking up (finally).  But back in the day I wrote a letter (before email) to a popular democrat to ask them why they let their republican opponent lie so much and actually take credit for all of the achievements that the Democrats achieved.  I never received a response, but I honestly think we look at Dems and Republicans as different.  But that they actually look at themselves as colleagues.  That would explain the Clinton years where he controlled the house, senate and the presidency.  Almost all of the Dems started talking about reaching across the aisle, aka voting for republican causes.  Supposedly this would make republican lying dogs votes for dem causes.  What really happened?  The republican pieces of shit laughed at the dems, made them look weak and many life long Dems became independent voters.  And then we got cocaine Bush Jr, an illegitimate president that got in with his bro cheating in Florida, Hillary Clinton planning to be president in the future so she took support away from Gore, and Roger Stone helping to steal the vote.  Future warning when you see Democrats talking about making friends with republican trash, most likely that democrat has already sold us out.

That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, theyd got the better end of the deal. As the Republican consultant Susan Bryant pointed out, Democrats do so badly among men that the fact that we dont do quite as well among women becomes irrelevant. And thats more or less where it lies.The entrance of women into politics on terms that are, fundamentally and constitutionally, unequal to mens has produced a politics of interminable division, infused with misplaced and dreadful moralism. Republicans cant win women; when they win, they win without them, by winning with men.https://srpubliclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/JillLepore.pdf","title":"Democrats fear Harris losing too many male voters to Trump"},{"text":" Equality helps both sides in the endBut inequality hurts one side more than the other.","title":"Democrats fear Harris losing too many male voters to Trump"},{"text":"Youre still dodging the question for a second time.What level of proof would you accept that Trump is a pedophile?if it takes a verbal admission or a sex tape then youre not a reasonable person and your feelings didnt care about facts.

I honestly have no idea what to make of those numbers, though.To say the obvious, they're not Pennsylvania numbers.  But voting by mail in Florida was really Republican-heavy prior to 2020.  The Florida GOP used it to make sure their senior voters took part in every election.  And after 2022, a new law completely cleared their VBM list and forced everyone to re-apply.  And on top of that, they're dealing with two major hurricanes and tons of displaced people, where voting probably isn't on their minds right now.So I'll take the current lead, and accept that we don't have much context to go on here.  In other Florida races post-2022, Dems built a lead in mail and early voting, lost it on Election Day, and won by racking up ridiculous margins with NPAs.

And there is a lot of Russian amplified misinformation. Now, I don't know which misinformation you believed so some of that may just be frustration with the loss of life in Appalachia and trying to make sense of it. I think the main reason is simple, most U.S. landfalling Hurricanes drop the bulk of their rain in the flatter coastal plains, so things like landslides and flash floods washing peoples communities away is very uncommon even if some significant flooding has occurred (e.g. Harvey in Houston).  But, mountainous communities are especially vulnerable to tropical cyclone flash flooding.  I mean over 10,000 people died from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras &amp; Nicaragua in 1998, mostly a result of landslides and flooding.  I think most in the U.S. are not informed enough about how life threatening that situation is, so many people in Appalachia did not evacuate their homes.  Also, while the storm track of Helene was well predicted over the Gulf of Mexico there was a distinct miss in the track forecast overland expecting a more westward trajectory, so rainfall forecasts would have been impacted by this.  I don't know when and where evacuations in western NC were issued and how they were communicated, but improving that will be key to preventing loss of life in future storms.Finally, people are saying Harris has no role in the response, but also blaming her for it?

Biden, in my opinion, was a great politician who had been a politician for too long--he was too worried about maintaining the status quo and working across an aisle that had absolutely no intention of working with him. He was not forging ahead despite that, but more just continuously trying to make them see reason, and everything I see from Harris is that she, by her own admission, is working on solving issues now and in the next 20/30/40 years, and she isn't afraid to shake things up in order to get there. She sees the bad-faith actors for what they are, and Biden simply did not see that, and that's going to be a huge strength for her over him. That's just one of the directions she's taking differently: a less \\"political\\" approach to dealing with an obstructionist opposition party. Another big one is her casting the spotlight more on promoting industry growth from within smaller businesses; Biden had a somewhat unfortunate habit of rewarding businesses that were already \\"doing the work\\" on climate initiatives and clean energy while foregoing incentivizing newer businesses to find reasons to do the same. Harris has a lot more focus on rewarding small-scale entrepreneurship and incentivizing them to be greener vs rewarding larger established industries that already were. The third that comes up off the top of my head is the housing issues. Here, again, Biden struggled a bit with trying to play politics while also returning to the carrot of rewarding corporations for \\"good behavior\\". Harris is considerably more of a hard-line approach on this, where she is planning on raising taxes (more than Biden himself wanted to) on the companies that are buying up real estate and turning it into rental properties to basically impact their reasoning for doing so (money/greed) but here again is that new approach: targeting smaller, newer businesses with construction loans, business support, tax breaks. If I had to assign an approach I would call Biden's a top-down system to either punish or reward those businesses already large and established where as Harris is an inverse of that idea and rewarding and incentivizing the underdogs so they can compete with fresh ideas and new technology against industries that are kind of already cemented in place by their standards and traditions, and gets fresh faces into those job markets who (hopefully) aren't already bought and paid for by their stockholders. That's my two cents anyways, hope it helps!","title":"Voters question Harris' pitch as agent of change: POLL ; Most Americans want her to take a new direction from Biden's policies"},{"text":"Their desperation is starting to stink.

A sign of a good campaign is knowing your weakness and working to mitigate them. My question is how poorly is Trump doing with women? I know he's doing something on Fox to appeal to women voters, so it seems that both campaigns know they have work to do with their respectful demos. I'd argue that Trump's task is much harder, since his track record is one of being a misogynistic shit that deprived women of their bodily rights, and his running mate thinks the only thing that matters about women is their ability to bear children. Meanwhile Harris can work to appeal to men, and she has surrogates like Walz, Obama, Shapiro, etc to help her out. Trump doesn't have any such surrogates to do the same with him reaching out to women voters.Edit: the article notes that Pew found Trump and Biden pretty much evenly divided among men, but [*The New York Times*, using data from Edison Research and the National Election Pool, had Trump winning men 53-45](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html).","title":"Democrats fear Harris losing too many male voters to Trump"},{"text":"They are all confused on why he's doing a blue State tour which he's probably trying to help get some competitive house races to swing red which makes sense if you are using your brain.

Invading Iraq was the USs own idea: which leads to a conundrum. If you believe that the us invasion was right, then that means that in your view Iraq was already ruined to the point that dropping a bunch of bombs on it did not ruin it further. Alternatively if you believe that the Us invasion was a mistake, then you believe America ruined Iraq. After the Iraq war, there was ISIS which was not aligned with Iran. \\nIran is definitely exploiting the power vacuum and I do not believe that it is positive force in Iraqi politics. I just believe that saying Iran ruined Iraq is dishonest and seeks to whitewash the actions of the coalition to invade Iraq.\\nAs for Palestine, you have got to be kidding me. Iran has not been the one who ruined it. If anybody did, its Israel. Again this is an attempt to whitewash the Israelis and blame Iran. Look at the Israeli behavior in the West Bank and tell to my face that it is Irans doing.\\nI am not defending Iran to be clear. I have no sympathy for the Iranian republic. Im just saying that saying that I ran is the primary and paramount source of the problems that are now plaguing this countries is pretty dishonest and is less of a tally of the problems that Iran created and more of a whitewashing of America and its allies behavior. I honestly would like to continue this conversation. As a person who has been assigned in the Middle East I would not be against hearing from you in more detail.

Where I would disagree and I guess how I would phrase it as.While it is true that all human life is valuable, not all humans are equal, some are born better than others, some make themselves better than others through the choices they make in life. I like to believe that we are all born with the same theoretical potential, maybe those potentials are of different things, but theoretically it exists for everyone to be great or excellent in some way or another. The choices people make in life, dictate their worth as an individual, and some people are worth more than others. Some people are more valuable than others.that doesn't mean their opinion should be worth more than others simply that they as a person are more valuable to society than others. The value of an opinion should be based on how true it is, how it is based in reality.Just a simple clear cut example to illustrate the point, the fireman that spends his whole life running into burning buildings and saves many people from a certain death is worth more to society than a cho mo.The ER surgeon that works twenty hours shifts and still manages to perfectly and deftly save someone from certain death, even if that person is not worth saving,  is worth more to society than the thief that steals and the criminal that murders and deprives society only to sate himself, the criminal is of little Worth to society because he only takes, he does not contribute anything but a bad example and even that contribution is of dubious worth.but his life is still worth saving by the doctor if for no other reason than he is witness to kindness that he does not deserve.Do you return the shopping cart to the corral even if no one is looking or can see?Because the way I see it, we are far too forgiving and kind to those that would spit in our face after saving their life.","title":"Offended?

Not only are they the source of most bullshit talking points, but they encourage and give social proof to the crazier online conspiracy theories even if they won't directly acknowledge them.Major cable companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast have no obligation to broadcast these things. It's not covered by free speech. They've had plenty of excuses over the years to drop Fox, including the encouragement of violent overthrow of the government as well as deadly health misinformation resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.Yet the executives and board members at AT&amp;T and Comcast insist on keeping going, adding even more extreme networks like Newsmax who are very obviously setting the table to help steal the next election. These guys are no different than Musk using Twitter as a right-wing disinformation machine.And while Democratic Party politicians will make big noise about social media and big tech, and do things like drag Zuckerberg in front of congress for theatrics, they never breathe a word about big cable. Heck Joe Biden launched his 2020 campaign at a Comcast executive's house. And as we've seen, the rest of the \\"mainstream\\" media has slowly over time begun to follow Fox's lead as far as trying to appeal to far-right lunatics, and focusing on wholly fabricated issues from the  right-wing and misrepresentations. As well as employing outright cynical propagandists thinly disguised as journalists, which used to be something you'd only find on Fox. Leading to further public mistrust of all commercial news.As for what could be done about it? AT&amp;T and Comcast have major government contracts.

Now they're as low as pre-COVID in many many parts of the US. Thank you Biden.3. Trump himself is a sex trafficker himself lol. He was good friends with Epstein AND Diddy. He also has bragged about how he walked into teenage girl's changing rooms. He said he's \\"going to be dating [a ten year old girl] in ten years\\", what did he see in that young girl that made him say that?

Ugh the border again. I hate all the misinformation on this. The border is not wide open. Immigration decreased year over year for Obama and Biden. It increased every single year Trump was in office. Biden's administration turns away both a higher percentage and a higher raw number of immigrants than Trump did. COVID policies also acted like a dam, when those policies ran out of course there was a flood of immigrants. The Biden administration has been trying since 2021 to pass legislation for it. They had a great bill that Trump stood in the way of. Biden then took executive actions and now we have less encounters and crossings than the average under Donald Trump's. Imagine how few we'd have if Republicans were at all interested in actually helping.And there's only a handful of jurisdictions that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections. They cannot vote in state or federal elections anywhere in the US. Per an audit in Georgia, in the last 25 years less than 2000 non-citizens attempted to vote, all of which were unsuccessful. And not to mention a large amount of the immigrants come from conservative countries, so even if they could vote it'd probably be a wash or maybe a detriment to the Democrat party.","title":"Kamala Harris lands second Vogue cover: The candidate for our times"},{"text":"And this is why the conservatives will continue to use to vote against any immigration bill put forward by the Left.

But you can't enact changes if you're **not** elected. And even if you **are** elected you're not going to be able to enact every change. In particular, you're not going to be able to enact the changes that are least popular with the electorate. I think gay marriage is instructive here: Democrats didn't get into office in 1993, or 2009, and immediately launch a campaign to legalize gay marriage, since that would have been totally quixotic. And in fact they sold out gay people in some ways that may have been the wrong move, like DOMA. But they still made things better for gay people than they otherwise would have been, and all the while they appointed judges who were more sympathetic to gay rights, including four of the justices who eventually gave us legal gay marriage. So the change was enacted, whereas if Clinton had run in 1992 on \\"let's legalize gay marriage,\\" he would have gotten stomped and Bush would have gotten to pick more Supreme Court Justices, and then no Obergefell.\\"Why do you think immigration polling is worse in 2024 than in 2018?

Youre totally right that there are a ton of polls that have their own degree of error, but when people talk about the same error happening in two consecutive elections, theyre not talking about individual polls, theyre talking about the polling averages. While there are lots of individual polls every cycle, there is only one average national level polling average. Each poll misses by some amount due to random sampling and factors unique to the poll, while the average miss is the result of systemic error. There are multiple factors that go into systemic errors and one of them is changes in demographic behavior that hasnt been accounted for in polling data yet, such as in 2016 when pollsters didnt know to account for the divergence between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters. Polling is a dynamic science and its ultimately really hard to predict the systemic error in advance.","title":"The Case for Kamala Harris (The Atlantics endorsement)"},{"text":"He is!","title":"Barack Obama Laughs at Trump Adult-Diaper Joke as Trump Proves Hes a 78-Year-Old Baby"},{"text":"She doesn't understand that's the point.

This led to some scholars discussing the possibility that a combination of The Guarantee Clause and the Electoral Count Act establishes the framework for some to argue that a fraudulent 2020 election result can successfully be challenged during congressional certification. Unfortunately, there's been no framework for this constitutional issue.However, adding the possibility of foreign influence to the mix (this is where voting machines connected to the internet comes in), The Guarantee Clause puts the jurisdiction in the hands of the political bodies, executive branch, and legislative branch to decide the merit of any state vulnerability in their election outcome. There is little, if any, place for the judicial branch to play a role.In Luther v. Borden (1849), the Supreme Court held questions involving the Guarantee Clause nonjusticiable, meaning that any remedy for a violation would lie with Congress or the President, not the federal judiciary. Nearly one hundred years later, the Court sweepingly declared that the guarantee of a republican form of government cannot be challenged in court. Colegrove v. Green (1946).So in theory, if foreign interference in the election had been discovered, and if the argument could be made the states with the contested (dual sets) of electors were subjects/targets of that interference; then a foundation to nullify the electors from the contested states is laid in congress.In this approach the electoral nullification argument would appear to rest on The Guarantee Clause, where the state election outcome was not valid as it is not representative of a republican form of government, and the majority vote requirement was manipulated.","title":"Top Democrats Won't Commit to Certifying a Trump Victory"},{"text":"My fav was when they compared housing plans.

Obama did that in 2014 and kept that conflict down to weeks as a result.Regardless of what she currently says publically, we know Democrats keep a fairly tight ship and those aiming for higher don't publically contest the party leader's policies.Biden did not publically contest Obama's decision despite us knowing what his own policy would be in hindsight.Obama in Presidential solidarity publically supported Biden despite Obama never publically regretting, let alone repudiating, his more successful policy in 2014. Aka lip service in solidarity to the current president.Harris has similarly publically supported Biden. Once *she's* the party leader however.....could be different.Biden out and Harris getting in is by far the best outcome so far.

The recent fabricated story against Haitians in Springfield was ridiculous and racist. However, the political reality is that scaremongering minorities into voting D simply doesn't seem to be working anymore, therefore adjust your strategies.It reflects a deeper failure on behalf of intellectuals, which is that the anti-racist movement is out of touch with reality and the masses. The idea that minorities can't be racist because racism requires bigotry plus power is simply not how the masses view racism. For most people, if they see a Mexican mock a Chinese person's culture, they'd consider that racist instead of getting into some silly debate about power differentials. The idea that the bar to prove racism is disparate impact in some graph is not how the masses, and quite frankly rational people, view racism. White people aren't in first place in income, life expectancy, and having the lowest incarceration rates in the United States, so if there is widespread systemic racism, then clearly white people must suck at it because they'd be losing at their own game.The left likes to raise the salience of race, especially in politics, and it's funny that minorities are increasingly ditching the Democrats.

He tried to fight fire with fire, threatening his own filibuster of Mr. Nixons nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court. The nomination eventually failed, but Mr. Bayh had lost precious time. The Southerners managed to delay the amendment with various tactics throughout the summer. By September, those tactics had been exhausted, and the filibuster began.Mr. Bayh needed 67 votes to end the filibuster, known as invoking cloture. (A few years later, the Senate dropped the threshold for cloture to 60.) As September wore on, he was having trouble getting out of the mid-50s.This double-supermajority hurdle infuriated Mr. Bayh and his staff. We already needed a two-thirds vote! Mr. Berman said, referring to the requirement for all constitutional amendments. This was like, in football, a 15-yard penalty for piling on. Only there was no penalty.Still, Mr. Bayh was confident that if the amendment could get a full floor vote, it would pass. The dispute over the Electoral College wasnt partisan, as it is today. The paramount issue, said Senator Howard Baker, the Tennessee Republican, is the fundamental right of every citizen to cast a vote that has no more weight nor no less weight than that of any other citizen.On Sept. 29, 1970, the Senate voted on whether to end the filibuster and move forward with the amendment. The amendments supporters fell five votes short. No effort to switch to a national popular vote has come anywhere near as close since.https://archive.is/6NXgMThis other History.com article gets deeper into why the southern senators opposed it (to dilute black peoples votes in their states) and how they surprisingly got help from some liberals in the north, including NAACP and Jewish leaders, who were convinced they would lose power under a popular vote. https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-nearly-abolished-thurmondI think you can understand how, for someone who opposes the EC today, the way the amendment went down in 1970 might seem kind of tragic in retrospect, a real missed opportunity. Its easy to say the constitution should be hard to amend (although I think most agree the US Constitution makes it too hard), but thats why none of this is a bullshit narrative, its interesting and important history.","title":"Republicans, Democrats united to kill Electoral College 55 years ago; filibuster kept it alive"},{"text":"Would you do the job for him","title":"Psycho Liberal goes batshit crazy on trump supporters in Florida"},{"text":"\\"The right is losing its grip on woman voters\\"dosent give the same amount of clicks I guess","title":"The left is losing its grip on ethnic minority voters"},{"text":"I read it.

Polls suggest that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are virtually tied in a fight for the states 19 delegates. Both Democrats and Republicans are pouring millions into messaging through advertisements, town halls, and large rallies. Last night in Pittsburgh, Harriss most powerful surrogate, former President Barack Obama, delivered his first major campaign address of the season, just 24 hours after Trump held two Pennsylvania events in one day. Their rhetorical styles couldnt be more different. But each former president landed on a similar, aggressive line of attack: They dont care about you. [https://theatln.tc/AEaiHQyj](https://theatln.tc/AEaiHQyj)?Trump spoke to a not-quite-full arena in Reading, Pennsylvania. He painted a dark, chaotic portrait of America. Migrants, Trump said, have been coming from places all over the world into your cities and small towns, changing them forever, and I have to say: ruining them. Trump positioned himself as Americas savior, sounding rather autocratic: I will liberate Pennsylvania and our entire nation from this vast migrant invasion of murderers and child predators and gang members, terrorists, drug dealers, and thugs. He referred to his predecessor as Barack Hussein Obama and repeatedly attacked Harriss intelligence, deeming her not smart and a dumb person. He droned on for nearly 90 minutes, finding no shortage of synonyms with which to denigrate her. Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent, she cannot be trusted, and she is totally ill-equipped to do the job of president of the United States of America, Trump said.Last night, on the other side of the state, Obama addressed a packed gymnasium at the University of Pittsburgh. The 44th president remains the closest thing the Democratic party has to someone with Trump-level appeal. Before Senator Bob Casey could even finish introducing Obama, attendees began craning their necks and prepping their phone cameras, as though a celebrity was in the building. Many Democrats savor any chance to relive the energy of his 2008 campaign. (A banner in the crowd read YES SHE CAN.) Obama played a few of his old hits, referring to himself as the hope-y, change-y guy and repeating his latter-day mantra: Dont boovote! As was the case at this years Democratic National Convention, he also seemed to enjoy laying into Trump.With just over three weeks left in the race, each side seems convinced that they fundamentally cant trust the other with the countryor with the election. At both events, speakers talked about the need to win in November by large margins. If enough of us make our voices heard, we will leave no doubt about the election, Obama assured. Trump had his own vision: Were gonna make this a landslide. We want to make it a real referendum, he said.

There were 2 significant things that were different in America during this time. The highest marginal tax rate was between 70% and 90% (depends on the year), and racist policies were the law (Jim Crow officially ended in 1965, but in practice lasted even longer). If we taxed the wealthiest people back at those rates, we would have the funds to maintain the our decaying infrastructure, and likely have money to incentivize American manufacturing.What's clear is that the Maga crowd thinks the reason America was great is the racism, not the investment in the future of the nation.

Tim Walz, embarking on a male-driven media tour that includes an interview about football with former NFL star and ABC host Michael Strahan.Sounds gay, wrote the Republican Partys gay coalition group on X.Democrats have accelerated efforts to reshape American expectations of masculinity once Harris became the de facto nominee. At the partys nominating convention in August, CNNs Dana Bash said Harris husband, Doug Emhoff, represented the Democrats attempt to put forward male figures who can speak to men out there who might not be the testosterone-laden, gun-toting type of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan.In addition, Bash said, Emhoffs representation of masculinity is supposed to send the message that its okay in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman.Hogans performance at the Republican National Convention (RNC), in contrast, offended the sensibilities of Harris-supporting men such as New York Times columnist David French. In July, French typed up an estrogen-fueled op-ed admonishing the entertainment wrestler over what he characterized as a form of toxic masculinity built on anger and grievance.Emhoff, on the other hand, was recently accused of slapping an ex-girlfriend after he cheated on a past wife and allegedly knocked up the nanny.","title":"Democrat Ad Featuring Beta Males For Harris Gets Universally Mocked Online"},{"text":"I wonder how their presidential immunity claim will hold up. /S","title":"Top congressional Democrats told Axios on Thursday they would not commit to certifying the 2024 election if Donald Trump wins."},{"text":"Simply based on my own experience listening to and watching the actions of the left as of late, white leftists have adopted a certain white savior mentality that I dont think they are conscious of.

Biden was on the beach and Kamala was in California at a ritzy fund raiser while the hurricane was going on and neither of them were leading on the issue or showing that they are laser focused on recovery. This is a massive difference from when Hurricane sandy hit right before the 2012 election and Obama was at fema headquarters October 28 &amp; October 31. Also Obamas famous Chris Christie hug was October 31. Sandy hit NJ &amp; NY on October 29. And then the fema money running out for illegal in migrants is pretty straight forward. Correct me if Im wrong but I dont believe Trump said there was not enough money to help with hurricane helene because they gave all of the money to illegal immigrants. The complain was that the HHS secretary said we wont have enough money to deal with what we have now plus the coming storm without more funding &amp; if instead of having a separate program for funding illegal immigrants food and housing they had allocated all of those dollars to fema storm recovery, they wouldnt be running out of money so quick.","title":"CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility."},{"text":"It is true that voters in safe states will benefit without changing their own laws but Californians can agitate to return to their old method because freeloaders in other states aren't following suit.

Here's a couple examples:Though the 12th Amendment describes the counting in the passive voice, the language seems to envisage a single, continuous process in which the vice president both opens and counts the votes. And if counting the electors votes is the vice presidents responsibility, then the inextricably intertwined responsibility for judging the validity of those votes must also be his.?-University of California Law School Professor John YooDespite [the Twelfth Amendments] ambiguity, or perhaps because of it, the peculiar passive-voice phrasing of this crucial sentence opens up the possibility of interpreting it to provide that the President of the Senate has the exclusive constitutional authority to determine which certificates to open and thus which electoral votes to be counted. This interpretation can derive support from the observation that the president of the Senate is the only officer, or instrumentality, of government given an active role in the process of opening the certificates and counting the electoral votes from the states. The Senate and House of Representatives, on this view, have an observational role only. The opening and counting are conducted in their presencefor the sake of transparencybut these two legislative bodies do not actually take any actions of their own in this opening and counting process. How could they? Under the Constitution, the Senate and the House of Representatives only act separately, as entirely distinct legislative chambers. They have no constitutional way to act together as one amalgamated corpus. Thus, they can only watch as the president of the Senate opens the certificates of electoral votes from the states and announces the count of the electoral votes contained therein.-Professor Edward Foley, Director of the Election Law Center at Ohio State University Moritz College of LawPence himself stated in [this](https://twitter.com/i/status/1688640553808801792) interview The President specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me, **to literally reject votes, which wouldve resulted in the issue being turned over to the House of Representatives,** explained Pence, adding that, if he had rejected the votes, literally chaos wouldve ensued.So, I wonder how Pence could know it'd go to the House specifically.","title":"Top Democrats Won't Commit to Certifying a Trump Victory"},{"text":"I love the look on Obamas face.","title":"Alleged Blacks for Trump member is very upset that Obama, who is only half black, is encouraging black men to vote."},{"text":"Shifting coalitions doesn't mean polarization is ending.

Following Hurricane Miltons impact on Florida, the Biden-Harris Administration is working alongside State and local officials to carry out life-saving response efforts. As conditions on the ground begin to improve, first responders have begun assessing damage and assisting communities. The top response priorities include search and rescue, power restoration, route clearance, and debris clean-up.President Biden and Vice President Harris have been regularly briefed about the initial impacts of Hurricane Milton, as well as the Federal governments ongoing support to State and local officials for their rescue and response efforts. This morning, President Biden spoke to Governor Ron DeSantis and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell about the initial impacts of Hurricane Milton. The President reiterated that he will provide any Federal support the State needs to speed response and recovery.**President Biden directed FEMA to immediately open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities so there are one-stop-shops for residents to learn about all the Federal support that is available to them and apply for assistance in person.**Additionally, the Department of Transportations Federal Aviation Administration authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess the damage to the power grid, so ground crews can restore power more quickly.The President directed Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assess how fast they can re-open the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and basic goods flowing into the area again.More than 50,000 workers from 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada already are dedicated to the power restoration efforts, beginning that work as soon as it was safe to do so. Additionally, three U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Temporary Power teams are staged in the region to provide temporary power to critical facilities, such as hospitals.FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground in Florida since last night, and today she surveyed the damage alongside her State and local counterparts. She will continue working closely with them to determine any unmet needs. She is joined on the ground by more than 1,000 Federal responders.Since last night, the President has spoken with numerous Florida officials, including: Senator Rick Scott; Representatives Gus Bilirakis, Kathy Castor, and Anna Paulina Luna; Gainesville Mayor Harvey Ward; Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson; Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings; Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer; Pasco County Chair Ron Oakley; and Sarasota Mayor Liz Alpert. The President told each of them to call him directly if they need additional assistance on rescue, response, and recovery efforts. The President also emphasized that he will be with them and their communities before, during, and after the storm. The Vice President has also spoken to officials from impacted areas.These urgent efforts are in addition to the expansive Federal response and recovery efforts underway across the Southeast and Appalachia following Hurricane Helene.Emphasis theirs.","title":"Fact Sheet:Biden-?Harris Administration Supports Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Response Efforts following Hurricane Milton"},{"text":"Well done, you found something I'd actually want to put into an ai prompt!","title":"Alleged Blacks for Trump member is very upset that Obama, who is only half black, is encouraging black men to vote."},{"text":"Did you know there is a film called \\"The Art of the Insult\\"? 95 minutes of heaping praise upon Trump and his elementary school playground level insults.

That began the era of polarization which solidifed with the Gingrich years, and it's stayed practically the same since then. Trump, of course, resulted in some odd polarization, but the politics during the Trump era (of which 2016-2024 is a part) have started a trend of depolarization. Suburban voters have started to shift towards Democrats, and minority voters are drawn towards Republican populism.
