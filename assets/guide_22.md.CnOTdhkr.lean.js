Competing needs and narcissistic tendencies should eventually drive them apart.  Money and power may be the thing that keeps them in this relationship.  Neither is stupid, but are morons in many areas.Musk should be smart enough to be the silent and hidden puppeteer behind the puppet in power.  But, no he needs to be seen and is using his money, which trump needs, to leverage a position as a visible power player.  And visibility means risk.  And leveraging this position to increase his personal wealth is safer if he could stay hidden.I do not see trump leaving office early (and has even made statements indicating he could attempt another term even though many see this as against the law, that legal argument no aversion thing).  But, giving Musk enough power, visibility, and increasing wealth to keep him satisfied with the possibility to gain more power could be enough.  And there is always the possibility trump may need to leave office early for one reason or another.  And when trump does leave he may need legal cover (for him, his companies, and his family) from those he leaves in power.These are just some of the dynamics we find ourselves facing in a complicated administration.","title":"These 38 Republicans voted against the Trump-backed spending bill"},{"text":"No one who voted for Trump pays *any* attention to what he does post election.","title":"38 House Republicans Give Trump the Finger in Shutdown Vote.

Section 01 of the statute sets out its legislative findings on the law. The NY supreme court ruled on it and discussed the legislative history in interpreting the vague meaning of that first prong of coerce/intimidate citizenry.That article dicusses the different ways we treat domestic vs international coded terrorism. It sounds like a weird claim (it surprised me when I first learned about it) so I cited that in order to demonstrate there is an actual distinction in the law.Here's the cite: People v. Morales, 20 N.Y.3d 240, 982 N.E.2d 580 (2012). I'll get you some snippets.Specifically, the statutory language cannot be interpreted so broadly so as to cover individuals or groups **who are not normally viewed as terrorists** (*see generally Hedgeman,* 70 N.Y.2d at 537, 523 N.Y.S.2d 46, 517 N.E.2d 858) and the legislative findings in section 490.00 clearly demonstrate that the legislature was not extending the reach of the new statute to crimes of this nature. This is apparent in the examples of terrorism cited in the legislative findings: (1) the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon; (2) the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; (3) the destruction of the Oklahoma City federal office building in 1995; (4) the mid-air bombing of Pan Am Flight number 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988; (5) the 1997 shooting from atop the Empire State Building; **(6) the 1994 murder of Ari Halberstam on the Brooklyn Bridge; and** (7) the bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993 (*see* Penal Law  490.00). The offenses committed by defendant and his associates after the christening party obviously are not comparable to these instances of terroristic acts.  \\nWe must also consider the **sources that the legislature consulted in drafting the new statutes.** The definitional provisions of Penal Law article 490 were **drawn from the federal definition of international terrorism**  (William C. Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Laws of N.Y., Book 39, Penal Law  490.10 at 299; *see also* Richard A. Greenberg et al., New York Criminal Law  39:1 at 1738 \\\\[3d ed 6 West's N.Y. Prac. Series 2007\\\\] \\\\[explaining that the legislature was able to act **six days after September 11th** because of the model provided by existing federal antiterrorism legislation\\\\] ). The federal antiterrorism statutes were designed to criminalize acts such as the detonation of bombs in a metropolitan area **or the deliberate assassination of persons to strike fear into others to deter them from exercising their rights**^(2) conduct that is not akin to the serious offenses charged in this case. Similarly, a statute extending federal jurisdiction to certain crimes committed against 249 Americans abroad with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or retaliate against ... a civilian population (18 USC  2332\\\\[d\\\\] ) was not meant to reach 'normal street crime^(3) (*see e.g.* 586 666 *Linde v.

An assumed goal of common law is making laws which induce behaviors reducing societal costs. With self/property defense, we want people to protect themselves from harm, but not so enthusiastically that they unnecessarily kill or harm people.\\"Castle doctrine\\" spells out that if someone is using force to enter your property, you are allowed to use force to prevent them or stop them from harming you -- provided you face *reasonable danger* and act on a *duty to retreat if possible.* For instance, a catburglar's mere trespassing only permits \\"brandishing\\" (ex. rattling your spears at them). Your violence also won't be justified if you provoke the intrusion, provoke their use of force, are there illegally, are aiding fugitives, or are acting against an agent of the law (qualified immunity).If you *do* kill a person after you attempted to retreat in order to protect yourself, you will still likely be arrested and tried -- you have to prove that it was lawful to kill them, and the burden of proof is upon you to justify this. The goal here is to disincentivize needless violence, and restrict it to those cases where the costs are justified.\\"Stand your ground\\" takes all the above, and throws it out the window. In an absolute sense, you don't have a duty to retreat wherever you are (in some places, you may off your property). Provided you *fear for your safety* ( =/= reasonable danger), that is justification for the use of deadly force. It also reverses the burden of proof: now, the state is obliged to prove that you *didn't* believe killing someone was necessary.All in all, SYG doesn't improve on Castle Doctrine, and just changes the incentives towards deescalation and lowers the threshold to \\"costly\\" (deadly) violence, where agents are able to act without facing the true costs of their actions -- you can kill someone unnecessarily, and get away with it.","title":"CATO's Freedom in the 50 States: Positions of Orthodox American Libertarians"},{"text":"AKA, give the billionaires another couple of trillion.","title":"Trump calls for abolishing the debt ceiling"},{"text":"All hail president musk","title":"Trumps Ego Explodes as Dems Call Musk President, Forcing His Team to Reassure Hes in Charge, Not Elon"},{"text":"Kangaroo court incoming.If I were Liz, I would start my defense by showing every instance Trump publicly called them the unselect committee, spoken and written, and deny ever being on the committee.","title":"After investigating Jan. 6, House GOP sides with Trump and goes after Liz Cheney"},{"text":"Ped-o-Lago","title":"Musk joins Bezos and Trump dinner at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Year over year inflation yeah.

Mitch came up with the bright idea to try and shift blame for not fixing it onto the Democrats by introducing a bill which said the President could unilaterally raise the debt ceiling all by himself.His thought were that he would never accept giving a Democrat president that kind of power, so of course the Democrats in the senate would be just as blindly partisan as himself and wouldn't want a future Republican president to be able to raise the debt ceiling.  Therefore they would vote down his bill, and he could say that they continuing crisis was their fault.He miscalculated though and the Democrats in the Senate said \\"That sounds like a great way to stop having these recurring debt ceiling problems.  Let's vote on it right now!\\"That's when he had to filibuster his own bill so that Obama couldn't raise the debt ceiling.Meaning that with one bill, he managed to fulfill the trifecta of Republican policy positions all at once: gaslighting, obstructing, and projection.","title":"38 House Republicans Give Trump the Finger in Shutdown Vote.

Dont bite the hand that feeds you. And Im not referring to their constituency. Whichever way they voted on this bill will be long forgotten by the midterms should such a vote be displeasing to their base. Should these no votes work to please their base come midterms, these politicians will be quick to remind them of how they voted, but it was actually about the money all along.

Isn't reacting to something perfectly normal and fine? Why is it then, that you must attack one side for reacting to the other side's reactions to the elections. Let me lay it out, any elective outcome would've ended the same, one side will freak out while the other side reacts. This is how it goes almost all the time, so how is this any different? I don't think you're looking at this very diplomatically. This problem, though not as widespread and looked at as today, has always been a think. Look at Obama for example, everyone thought he wasn't born in the United States although and his birth certificate was shown as proof. Look George W Bush's victory where there had to be a recount because people suspected fraud and the Supreme Court decided. So, it's not one party or the other, it's just people being people, hateful, non-researching, indoctrinated people. What we need to do instead, is choose people to get into power that choose to show their policies and have the better policies. One mistake Kamala and the Democrat party had this election was the fact that Kamala didn't outline her policies. She just compared what Trump did compared to what the Biden Campaign did while they were in the house. This isn't a good strategy to win the seat. Instead what she should've done was what Trump did, outline what SHE would do in office if she's elected. Trump outlined what he would do in office, he didn't compare himself as being better than the other party, sometimes he did though but not during every questioning. So the problem is not the candidate or the party, parties are just large interest or pressure groups, no, it's just the people that follow the candidates which are the issue.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"Why does one preclude the other?  \\nYou can troll somebody with the truth, especially if they are a corrupt lying scumbag.","title":"Dems Troll Trump by Saying Elon Is in Charge"},{"text":"Perfect opportunity for the Inglorious Basterds movie theater scene.","title":"Musk joins Bezos and Trump dinner at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Those workers will just do the same jobs but now for a more domestic market.And you are seeing those jobs as a negative.

These people all think being that right isn't just okay but that they deserve to be that rich too and it's just a matter of time until the have private jets and stuff or they already are and are okay with the current system. In order to get both sides together, you'd have to get them to admit a. Being a billionaire is wrong, and b. Their specific billionair is also a bad person. Both of those things are going to be pretty hard to sell to one side of the aisle. Then, on the other side, you have a team that supports politicians that also support the ultra wealthy even though they say they don't and it's an open secret that they do. And these people point at the ones who don't like either and say they have to vote for their terrible candidate because look how insane the other person is and tries to make people feel bad for not liking the choice that's shoved down their throat. So you really would need to change how people view their politicians before you can convince them of anything else.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Kindly sod off","title":"Fani Willis disqualified from Trump's Georgia election interference case"},{"text":"President Musk President Musk President Musk","title":"Trump team affirms hes leader of GOP amid President Musk barbs"},{"text":"Mr. President, I understand that Emperor Musk has blessed your tongue with his seed.

Trump was receptive to a Campaign national security advisers (George Papadopoulos) pursuit of a back channel to Putin.2. Kremlin operatives provided the Campaign a preview of the Russian plan to distribute stolen emails.3. The Trump Campaign chairman and deputy chairman (Paul Manafort and Rick Gates) knowingly shared internal polling data and information on battleground states with a Russian spy; and the Campaign chairman worked with the Russian spy on a pro-Russia peace plan for Ukraine.4. The Trump Campaign chairman periodically shared internal polling data with the Russian spy with the expectation it would be shared with Putin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.5. Trump Campaign chairman Manafort expected Trumps winning the presidency would mean Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance Deripaskas interests in the United States and elsewhere.6. Trump Tower meeting: (1) On receiving an email offering derogatory information on Clinton coming from a Russian government official, Donald Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer; (2) members of the Campaign discussed the Trump Tower meeting beforehand; (3) Donald Trump Jr. told the Russians during the meeting that Trump could revisit the issue of the Magnitsky Act if elected.7. A Trump Campaign official told the Special Counsel he felt obliged to object to a GOP Platform change on Ukraine because it contradicted Trumps wishes; however, the investigation did not establish that Gordon was directed by Trump.8. Russian military hackers may have followed Trumps July 27, 2016 public statement Russia if youre listening  within hours by targeting Clintons personal office for the first time.9.

During the presidential transition, Jared Kushner and Eric Prince engaged in secret back channel communications with Russian agents. (1) Kushner suggested to the Russian Ambassador that they use a secure communication line from within the Russian Embassy to speak with Russian Generals; and (2) Prince and Kushners friend Rick Gerson conducted secret back channel meetings with a Putin agent to develop a plan for U.S.-Russian relations.14. During the presidential transition, in coordination with other members of the Transition Team, Michael Flynn spoke with the Russian Ambassador to prevent a tit for tat Russian response to the Obama administrations imposition of sanctions for election interference; the Russians agreed not to retaliate saying they wanted a good relationship with the incoming administration.And yes, Trump obstructed the investigation in several ways.

There's no problem paying for $20,000 through a mixture of cash on hand and some credit.  Mom and Dad have a huge credit limit but decide together that this $20,000 can be paid by carrying a $2,000 credit card balance - which doesn't even come close to maxing out.  It's a responsible amount and they have no trouble paying the bills each month.  That $2,000 that Mom and Dad agree should be the credit card balance IS the debt ceiling, not the credit limit.However, life happens.  A car repair here, an emergency room visit there, spending some extra money to make sure the lonely, elderly neighbor has enough to eat, etc. Mom and Dad decided together that although these things were not in the budget, we still do it - that's Congress authorizing additional spending.  In order to pay for the non-budgeted stuff that Congress declares we need, it would require carrying a $3,000 credit card balance rather than $2,000.Now it comes time to pay the bill for all the stuff that was budgeted and all of the required extras that Mom and Dad voted on and decided was needed.  Here's what happens.* The debt ceiling is lifted - Mom and Dad give themselves permission to increase the allowed balance to $3,000 so we can pay the new current debt/monthly payment.  If it was a $2,000 balance then it would be a $120 monthly payment, but now it's $150 for the $3,000 balance.  But since Mom and Dad gave themselves permission to pay it, it's handled.  THIS IS HISTORICALLY WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS PRE-2010.  IT WAS ROUTINE AND NORMAL GOVERNANCE.* The debt ceiling is not raised - Mom and Dad, after doing the non-budgeted stuff anyway then decide \\"no, we're not going to pay for the stuff we bought and we are not borrowing the extra $1,000 on the credit card....we're going to default on our payment in a hissyfit\\". THIS HAS BEEN THREATENED A COUPLE TIMES, IT'S THREATENING ECONOMIC SUICIDE AS A HARDBALL TACTIC/FISCAL TERRORISM/POWER PLAY HOSTAGE SITUATION.* The debt ceiling is suspended for the short term - Mom and Dad are still discussing what we need and how we'll pay for it.  They don't agree on the nifty gritty but aren't that far apart, so they decide \\"let's not worry about the exact arbitrary number we decide will be the credit card balance, we'll get to the end of the month and be ok with it.  It's probably in the $2,800 to $3,500 range, we'll just take care of it as usual.  THIS WAS PART OF THE CONTINUOUS RESOLUTION PASSED TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FUNDED THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR.* The debt ceiling is suspended long term - The family voted and said \\"Fuck you, Dad.  Mom has full control of all of the decision-making.  She says we're not going to cap the credit card balance at all with an arbitrary limit - we'll do what she decides and then reconcile it 2 years later.  If we have $3,000 on the credit card, then I'm ok with $3,000.  If it's $5,000 then I'm ok with $5,000.\\" - THIS IS WHAT TRUMP AND MUSK ARE PUSHING - NO CHECKS ON SPENDING BEYOND THE BUDGET FOR 2 YEARS, ANY TIME WE NEED MORE WE'LL JUST BORROW MORE ANYWAY, MONEY PRINTER GO BRRR.

While this perspective identifies a genuine problem (the concentration of wealth and power), it is also flawed due to an oversimplification of political and economic realities.1.  The False Dichotomy of Class vs. Culture: The argument presents a false dichotomy, suggesting that class issues and political/moral differences are mutually exclusive. These issues are often intertwined. For example, conservative stances on deregulation and tax cuts often directly benefit the ultra-wealthy. Similarly, left-leaning policies on social programs and environmental regulation can impact the distribution of wealth. Simply abandoning these issues in favor of solely focusing on class issues ignores the core reasons for wealth disparities.2.  Defining the Enemy: The statement claims that the focus should be on \\"taking down the ultra-wealthy\\". This phrase, undefined, is a problem, but you clarified that it meant not separating due to infighting and instead uniting to peacefully protest. However, billionaires are not a singular entity. They have varying interests and political stances. Focusing on an abstract concept of ultra-wealthy overlooks the need to address specific policies and structures that allow the accumulation of extreme wealth. Furthermore, it risks alienating individuals who might support specific economic reforms but hold different political or moral beliefs.3.  The Problem of Unity: The idea that the left and right can \\"put aside\\" political and moral differences is naive. Political and moral disagreements are often deeply ingrained and rooted in differing values and worldviews. Attempting to suppress these differences for the sake of unity is not only impractical but also potentially counterproductive. It can create an unstable coalition prone to infighting and ultimately, it invalidates the individual goals that people are fighting for, which prevents long-term unity.4.  Ignoring the Nuance of Political Change: The assertion that focusing solely on class issues is the path to societal reform ignores the complex reality of political change. Successfully challenging wealth inequality requires addressing a wide range of issues, including campaign finance reform, lobbying regulations, and tax policy. These are inherently political issues that demand addressing through different perspectives. Dismissing these political nuances in favor of a simple, unified approach to class struggle is not only impractical but also hinders the creation of effective solutions.5. Strategic Misdirection: It is also worth noting that a common tactic in politics is to distract from the core issue through culture wars and the like. While it is important to focus on class issues, the argument that cultural issues should be put aside may in fact be what the \\"ultra-wealthy\\" want. They use culture wars to divide and misdirect from the issue of class inequality, and saying that we should stop focusing on these cultural issues may be exactly what the wealthy want. There are multiple sides to every issue, and there is often a lot of nuance that is left out if the primary focus is the economic.In conclusion, while the concern about the influence of wealth on politics is valid, the proposal to abandon political and moral arguments in favor of a singular focus on class issues is not a viable solution. This viewpoint ignores the complex interplay between economic structures, political power, and cultural values. It also underestimates the deep-seated nature of political and moral disagreements. A more effective approach requires engaging with the full spectrum of these issues, promoting dialogue across different perspectives, and pursuing policy solutions that address the root causes of inequality.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"His DMs are probably full of Saudi princes and Russian operatives though.","title":"Trump team affirms hes leader of GOP amid President Musk barbs"},{"text":"its only a change in name only. 3-month probation.","title":"How will Presidential Assistant Trump react when he eventually learns Shadow President Musk is making him look bad?"},{"text":"Vice fluffer.","title":"38 House Republicans Give Trump the Finger in Shutdown Vote.

Add in that you just lost the House and Presidency and it seems like being a sore loser and risks shutting down the country when they will have the votes to push through a worse deal and blame you for the shutdown. If Democrats said, were fine with eliminating the debt ceiling, as they proposed less than 12 months ago themselves, in return for the rest of the stuff in the bill, knowing Republicans would never agree to that, and you will win the narrative battle. Suggesting, as Hakeem Jeffries just did, that under no circumstances will they eliminate the debt ceiling, a policy they recently proposed, looks like being a bitter loser when Republicans can do it anyway without you in 4 weeks. Politics is about winning the optical battle. Democrats seem to have zero clue how to do that which is why they continue to keep losing elections. And many keep suggesting anyone will see through that as if those same people didnt just vote out Biden and the Democrats from the Senate is both an overestimation of voters and a losing strategy. Ultimately, youre holding out for what? You arent going to get a better deal. So, if the country shuts down because you reverse course on a policy because Trump wants it AND you still get a worse deal, you look super inept. If you propose to compromise, knowing Republicans wont want to appear to concede anything to Democrats, you both get the advantage of calling their bluff, blaming them for a potential shut down and you dont look hypocritical. And, if they now cant eliminate the debt ceiling within their own party, they look inept. The only risk is if they call your bluff. But Ive dealt with many narcissists. Narcissists like to control the narrative. If you give a narcissist what they claim to want in return for what you want (ie a compromise), you watch them melt down and its easy for everyone to see theyre a narcissist. Because narcissists dont feel like theyve won unless you get nothing and they get everything; its about control, not what they claim to want. If you let them make you emotional and you play into their hand (fuck that, they changed the deal at the last minute, Im not playing ball), you make them seem like the normal ones because they say, See. I told you this person isnt reasonable.Again, this isnt hard. It requires understanding human behavior and its clear to me democrats neither understand basic human behavior, how to engage narcissistic bullies, or how to control the narrative. They get played every. Single. Time.

There's a huge core of ego at the heart of the GOP's worldview: if we aren't winning, then either the other side cheated or we made a huge misstep somehow. Because otherwise, the answer is that they were *always* destined to lose, on account of just being a bad party. So in 2020, the immediate reaction to Trump losing was \\"The Left is cheating!\\". And in previous elections, the vibe was less extreme, but still \\"We fucked up by *letting them win*, because we weren't united enough!\\" Their fragile egos assume that any loss is a catastrophe, because frankly the GOP's platform falls apart under basic scrutiny on multiple levels.And because they view their world that way, they assume the same is true when the Democrats lose. And they try to rub it in their faces: \\"You lost! This means that everything you ever stood for was bad and you should just sit down and accept it!\\" But in reality, the Left is at least somewhat more resilient than this. They're at least aware that there are multiple opinions and levels within the Left-leaning ideologies, and while they can argue about how or why they lost, it's rarely based on fear that the entirety of leftism and liberalism was wrong and doomed to fail. So we get these \\"look at the Left crying!\\" responses, when nobody was really crying, because the Right knows *they'd* be crying right now if it were them. It's not that they're treating the Left differently than they treat themselves; actually it's that they're treating the Left *the same* as they treat themselves.","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"You're absolutely correct about campaign finance reform.

Beyond starting off with a lot of (blood) money to float his failures, all of Musks successful companies have succeeded in spite of him.**PayPal** - Musks first successful company. He also wanted to name it x.com, his partner and the board said absolutely not. He wanted to be a coding engineer so bad that he kept messing with the code at night and breaking the site forcing the actual engineers to constantly have to fix it. He was in fact fired as CEO by his board at PayPal and the board made the company a success without his nonsense to muck it up - he still made money off the sale because he helped fund the founding of PayPal but he almost destroyed the company before it took off.**Tesla** - he purchased an already successful company. The company ran at a loss for **years**. Again the engineers at the company have made it a success and every time Elon gets too involved he fucks shit up - see the Cybertruck. And all the unreported and underreported crashes and deaths from the autopilot malfunctioning. **SpaceX** - he again purchased an already successful company. This is the company he has his hands in least and again all the engineers and scientists at SpaceX make it a success. When Elon gets too involved pushing up launch dates and unattainable goals, disaster hits. **Twitter** - he purchased the social media company that historically broke even and never properly found a way to monetize the site in an effort to turn real profit, but it was operational. Since he has been so actively involved in this one he has pushed coding engineers to essentially break the site repeatedly. It now functions as his own personal communication platform, is filled to the brim with Nazis, and he chased away all the big money advertiser dollars. Oh and his core team he brought over from Tesla to fix Twitter repeatedly asked employees to knowingly break the law in a multitude of ways. I dont have the list of all the companies and ideas that failed but Hyperloop wasnt the only one. Elon Musk is not the genius he portrays himself to be. Hes not a complete moron, but hes also not real life Tony Stark either. He also sexually harasses his employees, treats his employees like garbage- blames them for failures, takes all the credit for success, and fires people on a whim or just because including very crucial people to his organizations.

Trump has zero interest in balancing the budget or lowering the debt, he just wants to spend on everything he wants without worrying about what it costs, as the ensuing inflation will be a problem for the next president to worry about, just like it was for Joe Biden these last four years.

So sending a millionaire to jail for murder is a violation of his property rights? That's not how justice has ever worked in the history of the concept. That would also be the opposite of what I said.You're going to have to show me where this has been applied by conservatives.The abolition movement, the civil rights movement, the prolife movement.The conservative supreme court has at least two justices who've taken gifts, some of them lavish and continuous, from people with business before the court. The law does not apply to them.The law does apply to them, and that's bad. The conservative president had enough evidence and testimony presented before congress to convict him in two impeachments but conservatives wouldn't let that happen.Because the cases presented were insufficient to convict him.Historically conservatives have been the stalwart defenders of denying equal rights to minorities and the people wearing swastikas and waving confederate flags are voting for Conservatives to express their views and write them into law.Correct. Because all are equal under the law. The government cannot decree what a symbol means to people. Throughout the nation the law is applied unequally to minorities and whites. Conservatives consistently deny this in spite of the evidence and where they don't deny it the celebrate it. In my experience, conservatives are suspicious of such claimed, but they don't celebrate when it does happen. Many support police reform to some extent. Of course, in my experience, democrats and their allies actively push laws and systems that sort people by race when determining punishment or requirements.Assuming you are not wealthy, you don't enjoy the same system of justice wealthy people do. A millionaire who kills people or destroys millions in property through willful negligence through the operation of his corporation suffers no consequences under the law.Indeed. Much work has to be done.His rights under the law are more than equal and Conservatives in government, want badly for it to stay that way. To be fair, Neoliberals in government don't want much of that to change either. There are too few liberals in government anymore to change things.That much i agree with.

Generally speaking, the right and left are divided by different views on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, sexual identity and other issues. The UNH CEO killing has brought classism to the fore. And while it's true that people of different walks of life can unify under a banner of anti-classism, I've been seeing a disturbing pattern emerge in the discourse where certain people, largely straight white males, are proposing that classism is the biggest or even only problem in the society of the US. And that the elimination of classism is going to make the clashing views on the other foregoing issues magically disappear.That's a profoundly naive speculation. While it's true that prejudice based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, sexual identity and other grounds is used to divide people by class so that they don't unify against a wealthy minority, those prejudices DO exist separate from class.This means that they'll remain present even if classism is degraded or eliminated.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"They weren't freaking out because a billionaire might be controlling the government.

Immigrant labor reduces inflation in the US, the GOP thinks that immigrants create inflation. Immigrants do less crimes in the US, the GOP blames them for crime. Ironically, I think that a lot of Democrats would actually be on board with some immigration reforms that make it harder for certain people to enter the country but the GOP isn't interested in that. 'reduce immigration' is functionally a dog whistle for 'I want to kick all the Spanish speaking people I don't like out of the US'. As an example of a logical reform to [FEAR interviews](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-credible-fear-screening) (these are interviews for people who claim asylum in the us to verify if they possibly have a semi-reasonable case and aren't basically terrorists or human rights abusers):People that took a commercial flight to exit the country they are claiming asylum from should see extra scrutiny and maybe have a 6 month waiting period in the country they were in if they crossed the boarder irregularly. Reasoning: Chinese immigrants have made up an [increasing number](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/07/nx-s1-5032835/chinese-migrants-southern-border) of irregular boarder crossings. Chinese people fly to Mexico (often via Ecuador because of visa reasons) to then cross into the US. Fundamentally, I think one can be reasonably dubious as to if these people have valid asylum claims. If a person chose to fly from X country to Y country then they should be reasonably expected to be comfortable in the destination country (they chose to fly there). If their life is really under threat then asking them to stay 6 months shouldn't be an issue.","title":"Republican voters are finally going mask off with their racism.

Equal rights under the law.You're going to have to show me where this has been applied by conservatives.\\\\~ The conservative supreme court has at least two justices who've taken gifts, some of them lavish and continuous, from people with business before the court. The law does not apply to them.\\\\~ The conservative president had enough evidence and testimony presented before congress to convict him in two impeachments but conservatives wouldn't let that happen.\\\\~ Historically conservatives have been the stalwart defenders of denying equal rights to minorities and the people wearing swastikas and waving confederate flags are voting for Conservatives to express their views and write them into law.\\\\~ Throughout the nation the law is applied unequally to minorities and whites. Conservatives consistently deny this in spite of the evidence and where they don't deny it the celebrate it. \\\\~ Assuming you are not wealthy, you don't enjoy the same system of justice wealthy people do. A millionaire who kills people or destroys millions in property through willful negligence through the operation of his corporation suffers no consequences under the law. If the deaths enhance shareholder value, he gets a bonus and if they don't he's dismissed with millions in severance pay. His rights under the law are more than equal and Conservatives in government, want badly for it to stay that way. To be fair, Neoliberals in government don't want much of that to change either. There are too few liberals in government anymore to change things.","title":"CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead"},{"text":"Fuck FOX News and fuck YOU for posting this.","title":"5 lies Biden used to break the border  and how Trump can fix it"},{"text":"MAGA has been openly racist and misogynistic for at least the last year... they've been full mask off, saying it in the open.?And the media just sanewashed it all and refused to acknowledge it. ?","title":"Republican voters are finally going mask off with their racism.

Cutting the debt ceiling doesnt cut the debt- as evidence by us being $36 TRILLION in the red despite staying under the debt ceiling . As Trump stated, the debt ceiling should be discarded because its confusing and generates an opening for bad politics.Instead of passing a proper budget and debating expenses, Congress sets a debt limit that expires in 90 days and then plays brinkmanship games so they can shovel pork past the finish line. Trump is 100% proper to call bullshit on this whole mess.If we dont get rid of the debt ceiling- or at least set it high enough so the government can function while Trump takes office and makes badly, BADLY needed cuts- were setting ourselves up for the Democrats to fuck it all up with the same brinkmanship bullshit that got us $36 TRILLION in debt!We need cuts and a sustainable , austere budget.

You can tell *a* truth even if its not *the* truth. And if that thing youre saying is correct, even if its not your actual reasoning, you will still win the narrative battle. Democrats saying that they wont agree to negotiate over a policy they literally just proposed 12 months ago is a losing position. Especially when theyre on the way out and Republicans are on the way in. The optics look like sore losers stone-walling and, to some degree, thats exactly what it is.

In the past, a man was elected and sat in his house, met with potential cabinet members, and courteously, carefully kept out of the news except to make a statement announcing a new nominee. The incumbent was president until Inauguration Day. Thats the way it was even in 2016; Barack Obama was still seen as president after Mr. Trump was elected. All that has changed.Mr. Trump is the locus of all eyes. He goes to Europe for the opening of Notre-Dame. The protocols they put in place for his arrival were those of a sitting president, not an incoming one, a Trump loyalist and former staffer said by phone. He holds formal meetings with Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron. There he is chatting on a couch with Prince William. Why not the prime minister? Because the British know Mr. Trump is enchanted by royalty and doesnt want to be with some grubby Labour pol. Mr. Trump talks of new tariffs on Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rushes down to Mar-a-Lago. After their meeting, Mr. Trump refers to him, on Truth Social, as governor of the Great State of Canada. (The Babylon Bee follows up with a headline: Trump Tells Trudeau He Wont Annex Canada if They Admit Their Bacon Is Just Ham.)The government of Syria suddenly falls and the world turns to America for its stand. Naturally it comes, quickly, from Donald Trump. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. .?.?. DO NOT GET INVOLVED! The next day, Joe Biden characterizes the moment as one of risk and uncertainty for the region. Was there ever a moment that wasnt one of risk and uncertainty for the region?Mr. Trump tells Vladimir Putin that now that hes abandoned Syria, he should make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The world is waiting!Mr. Trumps cabinet picksespecially the highly questionable ones!dominate the discourse in a country that hardly ever notices a cabinet nomination below that of secretary of state. His representatives, most famously Elon Musk, are greeted on Capitol Hill with a rapture comparable to past visits by heroic leaders of allied nations.Donald Trump hasnt overshadowed Joe Biden; he has eclipsed him. A former senior official in Mr. Trumps first term told NBC News a few days ago that Mr. Trump is already basically running things, and hes not even president yet.To some degree the status shift is expected. Mr. Trump is the future, Mr. Biden the past; Mr. Trump wide-awake, Mr. Biden sleepy. The 46th president is a worn tire, the tread soft and indistinct. With the pardon of his son he lost stature. Also, Mr. Trump makes other leaders nervous, as he enjoys pointing out. They can neither predict him nor imitate him, so they cant take their eyes off him. And Mr. Bidens been rocked by something he knew in the abstract thats become all too particular: after 50 years at the center of public life hes been dropped, cast aside, because it was about power all along, and not about him.A president, however, still has the machinerythe National Security Council, the State Department, the nuclear football. I can hardly believe our biggest adversaries dont capitalize on this split presidency, this confusion. For all our woes you sometimes forget what a lucky country we are.Here I mention a part of the amazing interregnum that I think is important, one that his friends and staffers speak of. Mr. Trump is calmer and more confident than he has been in the past. It is a commonplace to say that his surviving a shootingthat a bullet came within an inch or so of his brainwould change anyone, even a man in his eighth decade, even a man with fairly brittle ingrained views, even Donald Trump. But all of his friends go back to this as they speak of the Trump theyre seeing now. They think it took time for it to be absorbed and settle in. They see him as at least presenting himself in an altered way.The former staffer said by phone, Right now he is extremely relaxed. It isnt only the assassination attempt. Everyone thought he was gonna change in a way that would be normal for most people to changean outward reflection, more humble. I laugh when people say, Normally, a president would. Dont use normal with him.But, he said, after the second assassination attempt was thwarted, at Mr. Trumps golf course, it had real impact. Trump began to recognize, not in an unappreciative way but in a reality way, that hed been spared. It gave him a stronger sense of confidence, some extra level of relaxation and of determination. He feels the American people are in trouble and if he can be a small part of fixing that, he must.The former staffer said Mr. Trump feels that this wasnt an election, it was a vindication. The court cases, the indictments, the impeachmentsall these things against Donald Trump, and he doesnt just come back, he roars back in a way that defies logic, reason and history. Few can fathom this. He meant the history, but also its effect on Mr. Trump.Something else, he said. When Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, his policy priorities and intentions werent fully clear. They are now, and have been popularized. He knows the mission he laid out to the peoplesane border policy, unleash energy, monetize the liquid gold, make the tax cuts permanenttheres an air of confidence about his mission now, and an understanding of the systems in place. He is living something few get to live: If I could do it all over again.A different observer, whos seen Mr. Trump up close, said this week, This is the best version of Donald Trump we will see.Back to the former staffer: The gravity of this historic moment cannot be overstated. He has a level of swagger, a new level. People say, Can I get the policy without the personality? No, you need a certain level of I dont give a damn. If you think he had it the first time, Katy bar the door.He had a prediction: This has the potential to be historic in a way that only a handful of administrations have been. We remember some administrations with a level of history-altering moments. This ones gonna have a lot.What about the potential for wrongdoing, such as using government to suppress or abuse foes? Hes said a million times his revenge is going to be success. When Trump wins, he lets bygones be bygones.He paused. Some of the people hes hired arent that way, so theres a chance some people may take it upon themselves to do some stuff. I dont know.","title":"Biden Gets Lost in Trumps Shadow - The president-elect acts as if hes already in charge.

Now you know one person. The Constitution makes no specific provision for the imposition of martial law by the President. When Lincoln sought to unilaterally imprison John Merryman for destroying railroad bridges, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the authority to suspend civil courts and the writ of habeas corpus rested with Congress, not the President -- and this was during a time of actual war.
