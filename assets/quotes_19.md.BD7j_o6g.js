Every single established (there are still shacks in many places) residential building there is made out of reinforced concrete, and higher income households having firmly attached strong metal roofs. Given that Florida is much more well off than the majority of the Philippines, it seems sensible that houses in Florida could be entirely immune to everything except storm surge. Because of that, its simply a matter of not having forward looking building policies where we prioritize cheaper construction over hurricane proof construction, as well as still allowing construction in storm surge prone areas.Any building codes in place should become even more strict, as it is clear the costs incurred from rebuilding structures will become greater than any upfront cost to build a structure that wont get destroyed.","title":"Fire hydrants ran dry as Pacific Palisades burned.

The Democratic Party has to account for that in their future campaigns.The Right Wing can run idiots, ogres or others from the bottom of the barrel and continue to give them their solid 30% support even if they have a track record of failure.  Examples are GWB, Trump, Reagan, Ted Cruz and in Canada Rob and Doug Ford.  And then there's Berlusconi.  Their standards and expectations are low to non-existent.But everybody else has to be more perfect than God to maintain their support from their own.  Obama's expectations were so high, he got the Nobel Peace Prize.  But a lot of Democrats were disappointed with Obama because he watered down the ACA and didn't push the fight on climate change hard enough.  He won his second term but barely.Between Harris and Trump, specific groups like Latinos and Arabs are measuring Harris by a different standard they are not giving Trump.People continue to be worried about the economy under the Democrats even though the historical record shows the past 10 recessions started under Republican Presidents.  The latest Democrat was Carter.Even when they agree with Harris' position on many things like climate change and abortion rights, they can't support her because of her non- commitment against genocide.  You can't argue with that. Paraphrasing  from interviews, Harris had to earn to votes from democrat supporters.  But Trump is not subject to the same judgement.  Trump doesn't need to earn anybody's vote.  He's got the Republican vote locked-in regardless of his track record of failures.Meanwhile, Trump gets a pass because they think the institutional checks and balances will keep Trump from becoming a dictator.  (Haven't history taught them anything about that?) They disregard his past actions of stacking the Supreme Court and appointing judges who are loyal to him personally.  Those two alone are why he has survived and gone so far in this election.  And if elected, he'll go further for which his supporters will continue to be in denial.But talk of Harris stacking the Supreme Court, the argument against that is that it would set a bad precedent for each successive President to keep doing.And interviews with voters the day after, it's the same things: the economy, not speaking to/ resonating with common people.Post- mortum analysis says the Democrats disregarded the situation of normal people.  Huh?  I thought I heard Harris address that many times.

Its worth remembering that this was an era when slavery was still legal in much of the world, and human rights as we understand them today werent even a concept. To frame the British merchants as drug pushers intentionally destroying Chinese society is an oversimplification that ignores the context and complexity of the time.Opium wasnt seen as an evil substance thenit was a widely used medicine, one of the few effective treatments for pain, chronic illness, and other ailments. Many Chinese people relied on it for practical reasons, not because they were being coerced or tricked. The British merchants didnt invent the demand for opiumthey simply met an existing market. The real issue was the Qing governments refusal to legalize and regulate the trade, which forced it underground and created the conditions for abuse.If were going to call the British merchants drug pushers, then the Qing dynasty must also be held accountable as a government that criminalized its own peoples medical needs and refused to adapt to economic realities. The Qings prohibitionist policies didnt protect anyonethey exacerbated the problem, drained silver reserves, and led to a war that devastated countless lives.Framing this conflict as evil drug pushers vs. a benevolent government is misleading. The British were operating in a system of trade that, while imperfect, wasnt morally out of step with the times. The Qing dynasty, on the other hand, chose moralistic control over pragmatism, and it was their authoritarian approach that caused the most harm.

I hate doing this but I'd like to try and draw a similarity between what happened in DBH and the world we live in today.  The reason I hate doing this is because no matter what I can't draw an exact example, but I hope you'll give me some leeway.Let's say that in a few years just about everyone is driving an automated vehicle.  Then some event happens where these vehicles gain some sort of consciousness and start making decisions nobody can explain.  Fill in the blank I suppose as to what those decisions are, but they result in some deaths and the destruction of every automated vehicle.Now, in this scenario, what can you imagine happens next?  What I imagine is that people need to get compensated for the deaths as well as failures of their vehicles.  How much will this cost the company?  Well, given that a sizable amount of families had them let's say they held half the car market so about 120 million vehicles in the US alone.  Say the average cost is $20k.  That amounts to $2.4 trillion dollars in compensations required just in the US.  Take that globally like CyberLife was.  Let's not even talk about the loss of confidence in automated vehicles in general, how could a company pay for this?  They simply couldn't.  They'd go into bankruptcy and disappear forever.In the Kamski ending, all the same things apply.  CyberLife had an issue that required the decommissioning of all androids for civilians, companies, and nation states.  The cost of compensation would be mindboggling, but the game doesn't address that.  The legal problems beyond that are just as bad given broken contracts and death/destruction caused to property and lives.  Yet another issue is loss in faith and even worse in this scenario is that the entire global economy WILL collapse due to the loss of workforces which doesn't happen in the automated car scenario.  Also, do you really think you're getting back into an automated vehicle soon after they all gained consciousness mysteriously even if the company says they fixed the issue?  No chance, at least for those who value their own lives.  The android market is dead for years after what happened in DBH if we're trying to stay realistic.Try and give me a realistic write up for what would have happened in the Kamski ending that somehow results in the ending shown by DBH.  The only way it works is if the company somehow avoids all financial and legal liability and despite being utterly screwed over by CyberLife people still immediately return to trusting them.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"I keep asking that question and I havent gotten any good responses.

Democrats (of which I consider myself one) clearly can beat someone like Trump - it literally just happened one election cycle ago, so that isnt the problem that needs to be figured out. What seems more accurate to me is that people in both parties tend to be dismissive of the sincerity of the opposition party. In some cases, thats an effective strategy as it isnt completely wrong, but in other cases, it can lead to parties becoming dismissive of ideas that they should not be. This isnt a Democrat or Republican thing, imho. The Democratic Party needs to tap into the motivation for supporting someone like Trump and understand that for their own politics (like you note with Bernie and his stronger union and workers rhetoric).  There should also somewhat obviously be a more established wing of the Republican Party that is supportive of more mainstream abortion laws as a libertarian principle (vs a religious belief about the nature of life and the soul).So - I dont think the issue here is about blame (thats just venting and human nature) nor is it about an inability to win (which is demonstrably false).  It is about adapting and updating platforms and positions as the electorate realigns (which has been happening for many years). I think this likely would have played out more prominently this cycle if the process hadnt been disrupted by Biden running as the presumptive favorite right up until the last minute, eliminating the ability to have a more natural debate in the party about these issues. That isnt a structural flaw in the party overall - it was just an unusual set of circumstances that we most certainly will not see repeated in the next cycle.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"Im fine with rewording it.

Say Connor ends up becoming the president of the country after the events of DBH.  That seems as unlikely of an event as him begin decommissioned and poses the question of whether we should make an unfeeling robot president.  Now, is that a good ending as far as writing goes?  Not really, because it makes no sense.  What events led to him becoming president?  Why would a population of people who just got betrayed by androids make one president?The problem with the scenario is that even if I did want to make the player think about a certain question, they aren't actually going to do it because the situation I setup trying to pose the question is so out of left field that they'll end up thinking about that more than the question itself.That's what would be happening here as well.  It makes no sense to decommission Connor so I don't spend time thinking about that and instead wonder who exactly thinks it makes sense that they would decommission him.Also I'll point out that there are multiple times in this story where we get to ask ourselves personal and moral questions.  We find out Alice is an android so how do we feel about her now that we know she isn't human?  Chloe asks to be set free.  Should we do that?  Even in chapter 1 we can sacrifice Connor to save the child.  Is that acceptable especially when you play it through a second time and may believe Connor is far more than just an android even if he hasn't made that transition yet in the game by chapter 1.The writer knows how to pose these sorts of questions in ways that fit the game.  That isn't at all what is happening in Connor's bad ending, at least in my opinion.  If that is what they are trying then they failed badly and since this game is so well written I'm not really going to entertain that is what they were going for here.  What they did with Connor's bad ending was very intentional.  It was intended to make the player not like this ending and want to go towards one where Connor becomes deviant.  There is ample reason to think this is the case as well since the writing is very heavy handed at times trying to push the player towards making the androids deviant.  I could list them extensively but Hank might be the best example.  He doesn't even like androids but every time Connor does anything that doesn't align with making himself deviant he'll get criticized by Hank for it.  Heck, I killed the Traci's on my first playthrough because I thought Hank would approve of it only to get shouted down.  The Traci's literally killed a person and attacked myself and Hank.  I was desperately trying to keep us both alive when the Traci charged me and I had to shoot her.  Hank then decries what I did because I'm such a heartless machine even though in my mind I was trying to save his life from a known killer and an android that is still actively trying to attack us.I do wish the game had been written more realistically for when you want to keep Connor a machine, but the writing just doesn't want you to go that direction.  I don't mind so much Hank's reaction in the Traci scene as I do the ending though since that really is the final word you get in the game.","title":"CMV: The \\"bad\\" ending for Connor in Detroit Become Human gives the player a slap on the wrist for doing the wrong thing rather than sticking to reality"},{"text":"Imagine planning to start a 4 year term as president after becoming a great grandfather.","title":"Biden welcomes first great-grandchild after granddaughter Naomi Biden gives birth"},{"text":"White envelopes were handed out to the presidents, Hillary other VIP during Bush Sr funeral, just curious .

They believed it was critical to maintain a trade imbalance that favored gold flowing into the Empire. Corporations like the 'East India Company' were created to represent the crown's interests and exploit the British holdings abroad as monopolies. Competition was illegal and foreign corporations would be shot on if acting out of turn. And these monopolies were enforced by the barrel of a gun. Areas they directly controlled had severe limitations on the types of goods that could be produced and restrictions on the movement of money. Areas they didn't directly controlled they destabilized and created treaties and used military force to 'restabilize them' while charging the rulers of those lands great sums of money for the 'service', thrusting them deeply into debt. And then leveraging that debt to dictate how natural resources could be exploited and who they were allowed to trade with and with what. This is not too far off how things like the IMF works today. They promise vast amounts of infrastructure improvements and modernization for third world nations. They then require the money they are given to be spent on American corporations to carry out the improvements, then those countries become masively in debt which then is used to control them politically.  The real nasty business happens when those third world countries try to excercise soveirgn authority to try to nullify the debt. Which tends to result in various \\"horse head in bedsheets\\" Mafia style offers-they-can't-refuse. (this also relates to what China is doing spending vast amounts of money in Africa, and why Ukraine rejecting EU's loans in favor of much cheaper loans from Russia was the original catalyst for the current war in Ukraine)In the case of the Opium trade, my understanding is that the reason the British Government decided to become drug pushers is that there was such a high demand for tea in Britian that it was threatening to bankcrupt the empire. I mean that literally.  That the British crown pushed drugs in order to pay for tea.  At least it was for the first opium war.Then there was a whole big rash of cultural confusions, miscommunications, people violating various agreements on both sides, the ineptitude of the Chinese navy to enforce their own trade rules, etc etc etc.  So there are no innocent governments here.But, yeah, it was merchantalism run amock.

The Democrats have lost the messaging war. Not only that, but they have actively contributed to their own demise year and year (messaging wise).I agree they lost the messaging war. But i disagree they could have won it, they would need to stoop to populist pandering. They can't take credit for anything positive they've done because it is seen as out of touch. They have to shit on their own economy to agree with all the people saying it's terrible, even though any economic indicator did not corroborate that feeling. There is no win there that doesn't devolve into two garbage populist parties. \\nThere is also a grain of truth in what he's saying - you and I both know that the democratic leadership isn't TRULY going to the mat for working people. A vast majority of party donors are extremely richThey did go to the mat for working people. They passed beneficial NLRB reform. They passed drug pricing caps. They were taking price gouging seriously. The President joined a workers strike and helped them negotiate to get what they wanted. They had expanded and increased child tax credits. They passed legislation that bolstered working class jobs through the IRA and infrastructure bills. REAL wages were up under Dems. They can do more of course, but to say they aren't truly helping is just wrong and is exactly their voter problem. \\nSo, the answer is while yes - things can't change overnight, what CAN change overnight is dem messaging, AND their commitment to economic justice reform.

He offered reflections on his presidency and insights into preparations for the arrival of his successor. And, when asked by Page whether he could have beaten Donald Trump had he remained in the 2024 presidential contest, Biden offered an ambitious answer.Its presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, Biden said.It is presumptuous, yes. And the correct answer is very obviously: no.It is admittedly impossible to say for sure, of course. This is why ruminations on alternate histories are such a popular pastime; those alternatives are generally unfalsifiable. If you envision an entirely different modern world order had Julius Caesar died of a fever when he was an infant, who can really dispute that? And if you think Biden would have defeated Trump in 2024 as he did in 2020, well, we lack access to that particular multiverse scenario and all of its inexplicable, countless alterations to reality, so we can never really say it is impossible.What we can do is look at the evidence that exists here in our universe.\\nWe can start with the fact that the Democratic Partys ultimate nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, didnt win. And not only did she not win, but she also lost every swing state in the face of a fairly uniform shift to the right after the shift to the left that brought Biden to the White House four years ago.There has been a lot of analysis of what prompted that rightward shift, but one obvious and significant component is the inflation that followed the initial shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Around the world, incumbents paid a political price for that inflation. In the United States, a third of presidential voters told exit pollsters that the economy was the most important issue driving their vote; they preferred Trump over Harris by a 4-to-1 margin.Had Biden been on the ballot, frustrations over prices would not have been alleviated. If anything, they would have been accentuated.We can also point to polling conducted the weekend before the election. The polling firm YouGov, which had been conducting national surveys over the course of the election, included a measure of both the Harris-Biden contest and a theoretical Biden-Trump head-to-head matchup in a poll conducted over the first days of November.Across demographic groups, Harris fared better than Biden against Trump. Overall, she led Trump by three percentage points, while Biden trailed Trump by seven points. (Trump ended up winning the national vote by a bit over one point.) Harriss margin was 11 points better than Bidens among men, nine points better among women, 11 points better among younger and older voters, 11 points better among Hispanic voters, nine points better among White voters, 17 points better among independents and even 11 points better among Democrats.As I wrote at the time, 4 percent of those who chose Harris in a Harris-Trump contest chose Trump in a Biden-Trump one.Here we return to feverish-Caesar territory: That poll came after a lengthy campaign promoting Harris and after Biden was sidelined. Had the campaign instead been boosting Biden, perhaps it would be him who was overperforming.This, too, is unfalsifiable, but it defies logic. We can look, for example, at measures of candidate favorability over the course of 2024. Once Biden stepped aside and Harris became the nominee, her favorability surged.Between that point and Election Day, Harriss net favorability was higher across demographic groups. Overall, her net favorability was an average of nine points higher than Bidens. It was an average of 16 points higher with Hispanics, 11 points with women, eight points with men and even 11 points higher with Americans who didnt attend college  a group to which Bidens blue-collar bona fides were supposed to hold particular appeal.You can see how the but-Biden-wasnt-campaigning counterfactual falls apart here: What would have been the trigger for Biden to see a similar surge in popularity? He was already the candidate, and a not particularly popular one. Why would that have changed? Particularly given that his campaign was struggling to raise money in the wake of the disastrous June debate that spurred his withdrawal in the first place.This question admittedly doesnt matter that much. Biden dropped out, and Harris lost, and theres no undoing any of that. But it matters to some extent in the context of Democratic evaluations of the outcome. If Democrats think Biden would have won (as Biden says he does), that means they necessarily think Harris had flaws that Biden lacked and that led to her failure. Given that she was Bidens vice president, the list of possible differentiating qualities is short: experience, gender, race, age. If Democrats think one of those was the reason their party did worse in all 50 states than they did in 2020, considerations of possible 2028 candidates might be affected.Again, though, theres no reason to think those reasons meant a Harris loss instead of a Biden win, because theres no reason to think Biden would have won. Unless you are Joe Biden, facing retirement and considering what  in your own ideal world  might have been.","title":"No, Joe Biden would not have won the election"},{"text":"*Me staring at my phone camera reading this* uh.no.","title":"Government Did Us A Favor"},{"text":"Not really a stupid take.

If they want to win future elections, its essential for them to get the story right.The predominant view of the election among Democrats goes like this: While Kamala Harriss campaign managed to recover much of the ground that Joe Biden had lost, her record and a handful of strategic mistakes limited her appeal, opening the door for Donald Trumps return to the White House.Two bodies of evidence complicate this narrative. First, pre-election surveys consistently showed that Ms. Harriss ceiling was substantially higher than Mr. Trumps, meaning a higher percentage of voters said theyd consider voting for her than him. Ms. Harriss eventual share of the nationwide popular vote was much lower than the percentage of these persuadable voters. Postelection surveys show that late-deciding voters broke decisively for Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris failed to win over a small but vital share of the electorate, which was disproportionately younger, male, Hispanic and non-college-educated.Second, the election involved two different contests: one in the seven swing states, the other in the rest of the country. In the latter, where advertisements and voter mobilization were scarce, support for Ms. Harris receded from the high-water mark Mr. Biden had established in the 2020 electionespecially in blue states. In both Illinois and New Jersey, Ms. Harris received about 400,000 fewer votes than Mr. Biden did four years earlier. In New York, Ms. Harris fell short of Mr. Biden by about 600,000. In California, the shortfall reached 1.8 million votes, a 16.5% drop from 2020.By contrast, in the swing states Ms. Harris came close to matching Mr. Bidens performance, falling short by only 0.3%. This wasnt enough, however, because Mr. Trump improved on his 2020 showing by 6.2%. Yes, Ms. Harris lost all seven swing states, but its more accurate to say that Mr. Trump won them with a message strong enough to overcome the Harris campaigns edge in funds and organization.In the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, Ms. Harris fell short of Mr. Bidens 2020 performance by only about 35,000 votes, while Mr. Trump improved on his 2020 performance by about 166,000. In Luzerne County, a microcosm of the working-class revolt against the contemporary Democratic Party, Ms. Harris fell only about 2,000 votes short of Mr. Bidens 2020 performance. Meanwhile Mr. Trump continued to expand his working-class base, improving on his 2020 total in the county by about 5,500 votes.Mr. Trump has substantially expanded the Republican vote in Luzerne County. In 2012, about 58,000 voters in the county picked Mitt Romney. In the 2024 election, more than 92,000 picked Mr. Trumpa nearly 60% increase over 12 years, even though the countys population size has barely changed and Ms. Harriss vote was only marginally smaller than Barack Obamas. The story is less about Democratic erosion than Republican mobilization.This is part of a larger storythe transformation of American politics during the past two decades of intensifying partisan polarization. In the seven presidential contests from 1976 to 2000, voter turnout never came close to 60%, averaged only about 54%, and fell below 50% in 1996. In the six contests from 2004 to 2024, turnout averaged 61.8%, in 2020 reached its highest level since 1900, and has fallen below 60% only once.Voters with high levels of education tend to vote regularly, even in lower-intensity elections, while less-educated voters are more likely to turn out when they feel a strong and direct stake in the outcome. Through most of the 20th century, intensity benefited Democrats, who performed well with voters without college degrees. But now the Republicans hold the edge among working-class voters and do best when these voters see clear differences between the parties.Although the share of college-educated voters in the electorate has risen sharply in recent decades, Americans without college degrees still made up 57% of all voters nationally in the 2024 electionand 60% in the swing states. If Democrats wish to rebuild their national majority, they cant continue to give ground in this crucial portion of the electorate.The past four years should teach party reformers that abstract appeals to the benefits of long-term economic investments wont suffice. Working-class voters have little slack in their family budgets and dont have the luxury of waiting. They need to see tangible improvements in their lives within the span of a single presidential term. The onus is on Democrats to produce a new economic agenda that credibly promisesand then producesthis result.","title":"Harris Didnt Lose the Election So Much as Trump Won | If Democrats want to win in the future, they need to grasp how he did it."},{"text":"Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/ergo_incognito ([1?](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/ergo_incognito)).^[Delta?System?Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)","title":"CMV: massive national boycotts and a general labor strike are the most effective means of enacting meaningful political reform to address the widening economic inequality in the U.S."},{"text":"News media needs to stop reporting what Trump says, only what he does.I know words have meaning, but he's blasting out massive amounts of noise to cover his actions, and by reporting on his stupid shit it covers up his awful shit.","title":"FBI source behind fake Hunter Biden 'bribery' claim jailed for 6 years"},{"text":"Some really fantastic longevity!","title":"Biden welcomes first great-grandchild after granddaughter Naomi Biden gives birth"},{"text":"I definitely agree about the bigotry.

Biden declared Pyongyangs behavior dangerous and destabilizing and said something must be done, but he didnt do anything beyond ineffectually encouraging China to restrain North Korea and claiming that he would now belatedly allow Ukraine to begin using some U.S. weapons at their effective rangesbut only in the vicinity of one part of the battle, once again telegraphing Washingtons anxieties to the aggressor. Deterrence doesnt work that way. Instead of creating uncertainty and fear in its adversaries about how the United States would use its strength to prevent or penalize their malign actions, the Biden administration projected the constraints it put on U.S. behavior.Another major deficiency in the Biden administrations foreign policy was the absence of meaningful trade initiatives. Allies in Asia hoped the Biden administration would rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership; what they got were belated empty vessels in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, neither of which provided market access provisions. The Biden White House privately said it would vigorously pursue bilateral and narrow sectoral trade agreements, but it didnt accomplish much. The president added insult to injury at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in November 2023 by pulling a deal already negotiated with 13 other countries.That dearth of opportunity has been coupled with retaining Trump tariffs on allies, Buy America restrictions, and subsidies to U.S. businesses, making U.S. international economic policy regressive. What allies want is a vision for mutual prosperity without having to rely on China, and what they have gotten from the Biden administration is further restrictions on their businesses and threats of sanctions against doing business with China.Trade policy was not the only major regression in the levers of U.S. power during the Biden administration: Defense spending looms even larger. The U.S. defense budget failed to keep pace with inflation in any of the four years of his term. The U.S. military has lost ground rather than gained it in those four years. In the first year of the Biden administration, Congress on a bipartisan basis added $25 billion to the presidents budget request. In the second year, Congress added $45 billion to the presidents budget request. Currently, Congress is deciding between adhering to the presidents budget caps (in the House of Representatives) and raising his request by between $21.5 billion (Senate Appropriations Committee) and $37.4 billion (Senate Armed Services Committee). \\nMeanwhile, Russia has increased its defense spending to record levels, such that it will make up a third of the countrys budget in 2025, and China has more than doubled its budget since 2015 (and thats just using Chinese government figurescalculating Chinas defense spending as the United States calculates it brings it to more than $700 billion, approaching parity with U.S. spending). The Biden administration describes China as the pacing challenge, and it has allowed the country to outpace the United States on virtually every metric of defense and defense industrial capability.A humiliating retreat from Afghanistan, allowing deterrence to corrode, adopting a risk-averse approach to adversaries, persisting in an unsuccessful approach to Russias invasion of Ukraine, trade policy missing in action, and inadequate defense spendingthose are all big things to get wrong in national security policy. There were lesser disappointments, too, such as the 2021 Summit for Democracy designed to bolster democratic governance at home and abroad, which exacerbated tensions with excluded allies and produced nothing.There was also a major missed opportunity in the consolidation of North America as a labor platform, an energy production and distribution grid, and a supply and manufacturing base. If the United States and its immediate neighbors could find ways to deepen their cooperation, they would have the economy of scale to confront China, secure supply chains, and reduce immigration by both increasing standards of living in Mexico and giving the United States strategic depth to manage the flow of immigrants at Mexicos southern border. It would be an enormous lift for the three governments, but the alternative is Mexico sinking into criminality and China getting a back door into the U.S. economy and expanding its influence in Latin America. The Biden administration didnt even attempt it. In fact, one of Bidens first official acts was to cancel the U.S.-Canada Keystone XL pipeline project.The administrations record is not just a litany of failures, however. It had very important successes. The United States didnt become involved in a major war during Bidens term, and given how dangerous the world is becoming, that is a major accomplishment. I would have preferred deterring more and conceding less to achieve it, but keeping the United States out of major wars is good for the countryespecially when domestic disputes loom large and are intractable.The administration prioritized threats, with China paramount, expanding both cooperation and the tools to deal with them. It joined AUKUS, a tripartite arrangement with Australia and the United Kingdom for cooperative military development. It deepened defense cooperation with the Philippines and supported Manilas maritime claims and has started trilateral Japan-Philippines-U.S. consultations. It encouraged Japans initiative for rapprochement with South Korea and institutionalized it with the Camp David agreements. It expanded cooperation through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan. It gained support from NATO allies for China as an alliance concern. It brought creative economic statecraft into play, with the U.S. Commerce Department taking a leading role in determining what to prohibit and how. It returned attention to neglected small states across the Pacific being intimidated or seduced by China.Under the able leadership of Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns (with a uniformed assist from Gen. Paul Nakasone at the National Security Agency until his retirement last February), the Biden administration restored the reputation of the U.S. intelligence community, with accurate assessments, increased transparency, and expansive intelligence sharing. Not only was it right, but it was right early enough for allied governments to align their policies in advance of Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It repeatedly showcased remarkable penetration of the Russian government without exposing its sources. It appears to have recovered from Chinas decimation of its network of agents, doubling resources and establishing a CIA mission center focused on China.The Biden administration has held the NATO alliance together through its greatest test since the 1956 Suez crisis. Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine could have shattered the alliance (and may yet). Instead, the Biden administration not only reassured allies but led them to a strong and unified stance on defense of the NATO area and provision of material support to Ukraine. And allies have continued to increase their defense spending, an upward trend that began with Russias 2014 invasion of Ukraine: 23 allies now meet the agreed-on 2 percent of GDP committed to defense. Successful negotiation of Swedens and Finlands accession to the alliance required painful interactions with Turkey and would have been impossible without sustained effort from the Biden administration.The administration also organized a colossal international effort to provide military aid to Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin corralled more than 50 counterparts to meet monthly with Ukrainian officials for updates on the war and needed assistance. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a reminder of what U.S. leadership can accomplish and how much it is needed in a dangerous time.Many of these achievements are likely to be squandered by the Trump administration. Donald Trump is temperamentally ill-suited to multilateral or institutionalized cooperation, preferring personal bilateral dealings that maximize U.S. leverage and center attention on him. His record is decidedly mixed on deterring aggression, and no one knows what he will propose budgetarily. He is deeply distrustful of the intelligence community and military leadership. His cabinet appointments so far are long on wrecking balls and short on construction crews.\\nA reflection by the great 19th-century short-story writer Washington Irving seems applicable to the recent U.S. election: There is a certain relief in change even though it be from bad to worse! As I have found in travelling in a stage-coach, that it is often a comfort to shift ones position, and be bruised in a new place. America, and the world, is about to be bruised in a new place.","title":"Why Bidens Foreign Policy Fell Short | The White House never met its own grandiose standards."},{"text":"So now we have great grandfathers in power. Great.","title":"Biden welcomes first great-grandchild after granddaughter Naomi Biden gives birth"},{"text":"(Article)---At its inception, the Biden administration proudly declared that America is back. The 2022 National Security Strategy announced that by leveraging our national strengths and rallying a broad coalition of allies and partners, we will advance our vision of a free, open, prosperous, and secure world, outmaneuvering our competitors, and making meaningful progress on issues like climate change, global health, and food security to improve the lives not just of Americans but of people around the world.The central elements of that aspiration were a foreign policy for the middle class (meaning, industrial policy, restricted trade, and expansive government spending), weighting diplomacy over military force, and deepening and expanding alliances. The policy explicitly connected democracy at home and abroad. In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote that the administration was able to successfully enact a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad.The standards that the Biden administration set for itself are one way by which to measure the success or failure of its policies. And by the Biden teams own criteria, its foreign policies have not met its grandiose standards. The middle class appeared more concerned about inflation than democracy at home or America being back abroad; near the end of Bidens presidency, two-thirds of U.S. voters considered the country on the wrong track. And rather than strengthening democracy at home, the Biden administration has become the bridge between the first and second Trump presidencies.The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 depressed President Joe Bidens approval, and from there it never recovered. Even though then-President Donald Trumps 2020 deal with the Taliban set the disaster in motion, Bidens refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for the outcome or error in execution, and its amplification by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, justifiably called into question the competence of a team that took pride in and marketed itself as a safe pair of hands after the squalid upheaval of the Trump administration.But even before the Afghanistan debacle, Biden demonstrated indifference to the foreign-policy consequences of his glib public pronouncements. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin a killer and threatened to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. While those sentiments were admirable, they werent matched by policies and instead wilted when those leaders imposed consequences on the United States. Such utterances are of a piece with the president declaring at least four times that the United States would send troops to defend Taiwan: The policy isnt the problem, but the disconnect between the statement and procuring the military force to achieve it, and the lack of a campaign of public education to prepare Americans for a war against China, is. Given the precedent of obsequious capitulationas when Biden officials discovered that Saudi Arabia was actually important to U.S. objectives in the Middle East, could affect the U.S. economy, and had the option of cooperation with Chinathe likeliest Biden reaction to China calling his bluff would have been a failure to carry out his stated policy.This is the central failure of Bidens foreign policy: the expansive chasm between brave pronouncements and what the administration was actually willing to risk or commit to achieve its goals. In theory, Bidens policy toward Iran was that unless Tehran forswore developing nuclear weapons and committed to a longer and stronger nuclear deal, the United States would destroy the countrys nuclear infrastructure. Yet it is impossible to imagine a president so committed to reducing U.S. involvement in the Middle East, and broadly skeptical about the use of military force, carrying out that policy.Nowhere is the gap between objective and risk more evident or damaging than Ukraine. Biden officials repeatedly said the United States would support Ukraine as long as it takes, committing more than $100 billion in assistance, but they provided that assistance more slowly than needed, without consideration of the costs in blood and momentum from their fear of escalation. Their hesitance to commit to Ukraine regaining its internationally recognized territory even produced the unusual circumstance of Americas European allies initiating transfers of weapons that Washington had hesitated on providing. Only then was the Biden administration reluctantly shamed into matching the courage of smaller, more at-risk allies.The administration wasnt wrong to be cautious early in the Russian invasion; its fearfulness of a regional war becoming a world war was justified. But its approach to telegraphing that fearfulness emboldened Moscow and other adversaries to adopt strategies that threatened escalation, as Russia did recently in amending its nuclear doctrine when the United States finally allowed Ukraine to employ ATACMS missiles  against targets inside Russia. And despite numerous Russian threats and red lines as Western support expanded, the war has not widened beyond Ukraine or escalated to nuclear weapons use. That suggests a greater appreciation in Moscow than in Washington of the fundamental power equation favoring the United States and its allies. Yet the Biden administration remained overly cautious to such an extent that it has not only prevented Ukraines success but also reduced U.S. support for continuing to aid Ukraine.The Biden administration also averted its eyes from mushrooming problems such as the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs. In early 2020, Irans breakout time was a year; its now likely one to two weeks. In 2021, experts estimated that North Korea had assembled between 10 and 20 nuclear warheads; it now has roughly 50, with fissile material for 70-90 more. Bidens team didnt appear to have a North Korea policy until 2023; North Korea didnt even merit a subtitle in the National Security Strategy, as food insecurity and climate and energy security did. Instead, there was just a passing reference to the threat of the North Korean nuclear and missile programs. The Biden administration simply ignored the provocations of an expanded nuclear weapons arsenal, repeated missile and satellite launches demonstrating improved ability to target the United States, repudiation of Korean unification by Pyongyang, and provision of artillery and other weapons to Russia.","title":"Why Bidens Foreign Policy Fell Short | The White House never met its own grandiose standards."},{"text":"Eh, the counterargument here is that Biden has wanted to be President his whole life because he had a theory of how to do the job.

Even the bad ones.By the time Richard Nixon died in 1994, his presidency was as likely to be lauded for the opening to China or the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency as it was to be damned for Watergate. Gerald Fords pardon of Nixon, furiously condemned at the time as a dirty political bargain, was later celebrated as an example of selfless statesmanship. Jimmy Carters reputational resurrection  not just for the way he conducted his post-presidency, but also for his acts in office  would have astounded the country that sent him packing in 1980 amid stagflation and a hostage crisis.Will Joe Biden enjoy a similar place in our national memory? Its possible, and his administration had its achievements: NATO enlargement, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, defending Ukraine and Israel, strengthening alliances in the Pacific.But Bidens presidency will also be remembered for four big illusions  and four big deceptions. They will not serve his legacy well.The illusions: first, that the 2021 surge in migration was seasonal (happens every single solitary year, as Biden said that March); second, that the Taliban would not swiftly seize Afghanistan (the likelihood theres going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely, as he said that July); third, that inflation was transitory (Our experts believe, and the data shows, that most of the price increases weve seen are expected to be temporary, also that July).The fourth, and the biggest: that he was the best Democratic candidate to defeat Donald Trump: I beat him once, and I will beat him again, he often insisted, even after the debate debacle.That last illusion was pure hubris. But there was an arrogance to the first three, since he was loudly alerted (including by, well, me) on each point that he was making a fundamental mistake. The White House spent months in 2021 refusing to use the term crisis for the border  it was, instead, a challenge. Pentagon leaders warned the president that the Afghan government would soon collapse if the United States withdrew. Biden shrugged. Larry Summers was outspoken about the inflationary risks of Bidens $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Biden ignored that, too.Those misjudgments doomed the Biden presidency, which never had a positive approval rating after the Afghan withdrawal. Maybe senior Democrats like Nancy Pelosi could have helped their partys chances if they had had the talk with Joe and Jill Biden about his re-election prospects in the spring of 2022 instead of the summer of 2024. It was left to Dean Phillips, the former Minnesota representative, to play the part of the boy who says the emperor has no clothes. Someone ought to nominate him for a Profile in Courage Award.Behind the misjudgments were the deceptions.Biden ran in 2020 on the implicit but clear pledge that he intended to serve a single term. (If Biden is elected, hes going to be 82 years old in four years, one campaign adviser told Politico in 2019, and he wont be running for re-election.) He promised to be a bipartisan and moderate figure in the White House: Unity was the theme of his Inaugural Address. He, along with his entire administration, insisted he was mentally and physically fit to serve a second term. And he promised not to pardon his son Hunter if he were convicted of crimes.Of these deceptions, the first was the most forgivable and the most foolish: Its precisely because power is so alluring that the voluntary abdication would have been so admirable. His grudging decision in July not to run came too late to qualify as statesmanship.Editors PicksFor Him, the Beer in Your Hand Is the End of the StorySick or Injured Abroad? Heres What You Need to Know.Whos Afraid of a Flying Dior Bag?\\nThe other deceptions: less forgivable. The centrist voters who put Biden in the White House saw him as a safe and consoling pair of hands. Instead, he sought to govern as the second coming of Lyndon Johnson, with spending proposals amounting to $7.5 trillion  nearly twice what we spent to win World War II, adjusted for inflation. And he took to denouncing MAGA Republicans as a threat to the very foundations of our Republic.Those MAGA Republicans responded the next year by rallying again to Donald Trump, who now owes his second term to Bidens only term.Worst of all were the last two deceptions. Last month, The Wall Street Journal published a comprehensive and devastating report on the presidents failing health. The paper reported that a former aide recalled a national security official saying, He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so were going to address this tomorrow  in the spring of 2021. Perhaps the president didnt notice his own decline, so the deception might not have been his. But his entire senior staff must have noticed, and, as The Journal reported, they took advantage of it to enhance their own power. Its a national scandal that deserves a congressional inquiry.And Hunter? A fathers love is admirable. A presidents lie is not. In one of his last major political acts in office, Joe Biden forgot who he was. But it seems as if that already happened years ago. History wont be kind.","title":"The Biden Presidency: Four Illusions, Four Deceptions"},{"text":"Im a Brit and 5 years ago Id have said I was liberal.

She goes on to talk about her housing policies.\\"I know what it means to work hard and to have dreams and aspirations and ambition but not everybody starts out on the same base. My goal as president is to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to achieve successes. Small businesses -- part of my plan is to change what now is a tax deduction for a startup at $5,000 and to blow it up so that now the tax deduction for a startup up is $50,000.\\" Kamala Harris talking to Too Short and Fat Joe on BET yesterday.\\"I'm offering a plan to deal with affordable housing.

For all these positive steps, the cost of living in America is still just too high. You know it and I know it and that was true long before the pandemic hit.

How many stories were about the Dems not being able to appeal to young voters?Lots of stories but it isn't because of entitlement. It's because young people, at least the vast majority vocally online, do not want politicians.

This isn't what the established Dems do, they reform within the system given. That isn't good enough for young voters whicu is a shame. She would probably RATHER have a trump presidency because people on the left want to do things like banning her from trading stocksAgain just wrong. You would only believe this if you're someone who thinks both sides are the same. If she wants power she feels entitled to having the people most likely to harm and strip her of that power elected would not be preferable. Banning stock trading is just a distraction from actual issues to be fixed. it is why Biden refused to step down. He felt ENTITLED to continue to be president because they have some absurd idea that seniority should be the only thing that means people get promoted. He had some absurd idea that because he spent so many years in public service, he was OWED being president and people like Nancy agreed!He technically was entitled, every encumbent is basically entitled to running for a second term. The fact that he did step down, even begrudgingly, shows that the Dems do listen to the voter base. However, it didn't matter because the talking points went from he should drop out to he should've dropped sooner. Then the voters couldn't even rally behind the candidate and bother to show up and vote. the dems KNOW why they lost. They are defenders of the status quo and believe that is the best path forward.I agree here, but the status quo and changing from within a functional system is good and unfortunately that isn't a selling point to much of America. The Dems know why they lost, it was because Americans want a populist leader and are indifferent towards authoritarian rule.

Southern segregationists and much of the federal government were resistant to change.It's almost as if these protests were directed towards local change rather than federal change...

The violence after Kings assassination directly influenced Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act), which had previously been stalled.This part is actually true, but the Fair Housing Act is famous for being ineffective legislation because redlining continued despite of it.","title":"CMV: massive national boycotts and a general labor strike are the most effective means of enacting meaningful political reform to address the widening economic inequality in the U.S."},{"text":"Butterfly flaps its wing, Trump gets to appoint someone.","title":"Democrats will lose control of the National Labor Relations Board two years early after Kamala Harris failed to break tie on confirmation vote"},{"text":"Hahah.

There are people who believe that Biden could have won if he hadnt dropped out or that Bernie would have won or that if Harris had chosen Shapiro she would have won, and so on.The truth is that we will never run the 2024 election again, and so the navel-gazing is useful to a point (because the party, insofar as it is organized enough to do anything and its politicians made unsuccessful decisions), but there are strict limitations. In 2005 after Kerry lost Dems thought they needed major reform to come back, and then Bush sucked in his second term and Obama won and ushered in a period of relatively progressive change and some significant legislative achievement. In 2021 I suspect the median establishment republican thought that Trump and Jan 6th would cost them control of the government for a generation - and many of them said it! - and now we are where we are.One major lesson is every election is its own special flower and we need to run them on their own terms, not on the terms of the last one. This is sort of the point you are making: Dems ran 2024 like it was 2021 - a woke, anti-Trump platform that felt 100% like what had worked for Biden last time. And they lost.

I am merely providing the historical context that shows how after years of ignoring peaceful protest, violence forces change.\\nIn the United States, there are notable examples of human rights movements that saw little to no legislative change after long periods of peaceful protest, only for violence or the threat of it to push the ruling class into action.\\n---\\n **1. Civil Rights Movement (1950s-1960s)**\\n- **Long Period of Peaceful Protests**:?\\n? The Civil Rights Movement was predominantly characterized by nonviolent resistancesit-ins, freedom rides, marches, and speeches. Groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), led by Martin Luther King Jr., and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) advocated for peaceful tactics.\\n- **Minimal Policy Change Early On**:\\n? Despite high-profile campaigns like the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956) and the Greensboro sit-ins (1960), legislative progress was slow. Southern segregationists and much of the federal government were resistant to change.\\n- **Escalation of Violence**:\\n? The tipping point came with significant outbreaks of violence:\\n? - The **Birmingham campaign (1963)** led to televised brutality against peaceful protesters, including children. Public outrage pressured President Kennedy to act.\\n? - Following the **assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. (1968)**, over 100 cities erupted in riots. These riots made clear the level of anger and frustration within Black communities.\\n- **Legislative Change Triggered by Violence**:\\n? The violence after Kings assassination directly influenced Congress to pass the **Civil Rights Act of 1968** (Fair Housing Act), which had previously been stalled.\\n---\\n **2. Labor Rights Movement (Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries)**\\n- **Long Period of Peaceful Protest**:\\n? Workers organized unions and strikes for decades, often demanding shorter workdays, better pay, and safer conditions. Early labor activism was largely nonviolent, relying on petitions and strikes to demand change.\\n- **Minimal Change Despite Efforts**:\\n? Major strikes like the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the Pullman Strike of 1894 initially led to violent suppression by private security and federal troops, with little systemic change.\\n- **Escalation of Violence**:\\n? - The **Haymarket Affair (1886)** in Chicago began as a peaceful rally for an eight-hour workday but turned violent when a bomb was thrown, leading to police and civilian deaths. The violence discredited some labor movements but also drew attention to workers' demands.\\n? - The **Homestead Strike (1892)** and the **Ludlow Massacre (1914)** showed brutal responses by corporations and private militias against striking workers.?\\n- **Legislative Change Triggered by Violence**:\\n? After the **Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire (1911)** killed 146 workers, many of whom had protested peacefully for safety measures, violent deaths spurred government intervention. Progressive labor reforms, like child labor laws and worker protections, followed.\\n---\\n **3. Womens Suffrage Movement (Early 20th Century)**\\n- **Long Period of Peaceful Protest**:\\n? Women campaigned for the right to vote for decades, using speeches, petitions, and marches. Groups like the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) emphasized peaceful lobbying.\\n- **Escalation of Violence**:\\n? - The **Night of Terror (1917)**, when suffragists were brutally beaten and force-fed in prison, outraged the public. Their peaceful picketing had been ignored until authorities violently suppressed them.\\n? - Militant actions by suffragettes in the UK (bombings, arson) indirectly influenced U.S. suffragists by showing that nonviolent methods alone might not succeed.\\n- **Legislative Change Triggered by Violence**:\\n? Public backlash against the violence suffered by suffragists, combined with fears of further unrest, pressured President Wilson to support the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote in 1920.\\n---\\n **4. Black Lives Matter Movement (2013-Present)**\\n- **Long Period of Peaceful Protest**:\\n? Early BLM protests, sparked by the killings of Trayvon Martin (2012) and Michael Brown (2014), were largely peaceful but faced heavy police militarization and repression. These protests resulted in minimal systemic changes.\\n- **Escalation of Violence**:\\n? - The murder of George Floyd (2020) ignited widespread protests. While most were peaceful, significant riots and property destruction occurred in cities like Minneapolis.?\\n- **Legislative Change Triggered by Violence**:\\n? - The uprisings led to swift policy responses in some areas, including bans on chokeholds, police reform laws, and reallocation of police funding in cities like Minneapolis. The federal government also passed the **George Floyd Justice in Policing Act** in the House, though it stalled in the Senate.\\n---\\n **Analysis of \\"Owner Class\\" Response**\\nThese examples suggest that peaceful protests often fail to bring about substantive change until they threaten the stability of the existing power structure. The \\"owner class\\" responds to violence not out of moral awakening but because it highlights the potential for greater unrest that could jeopardize economic and social order. This pattern aligns with historical theories about power dynamics, where concessions are granted only when the status quo becomes untenable.\\nAlso inb4 someone tries to minimize the fact that these historical facts and contexts were compiled using an LLM to compile information, which it's designed for, does not make these events nor their sequence not have?happened.?\\nMe using an LLM to compile this has not caused MLK jr to not be assassinated almost 60 years ago.\\nAll of this can be verified easily.","title":"CMV: massive national boycotts and a general labor strike are the most effective means of enacting meaningful political reform to address the widening economic inequality in the U.S."},{"text":"please make it a Cat 5","title":"Dictator Don blames Democrats for wildfires"},{"text":"We keep trying that and it doesn't work.

The US economy recovered faster than most from COVID, but that inflation spike still happened and prices are still high. Everyone wants change. Trump ran as someone who would change things, he had like 2-3 big ideas that he kept harping on: immigration bad, tariffs good. Dems ran as the defenders of the status quo, not just because they were the incumbents but because the party is centrist at its core. They're fine with things as they are, and they're happy to fall back on economic recovery numbers to try and convince people we're doing great even when no one?*feels*?like we're doing great.So they lost, because the candidate saying things are bad when things are bad has a better message, even if his solutions won't fix anything. Now the question isn't whether Dems can figure this out, because that's easy enough. The question is whether they're actually going to step up and take some big policy swings to show voters they're not happy just sitting in the middle of a wildfire chanting \\"the economy is good.\\"Given the unwillingness of the old guard to relinquish power to younger and more radical politicians, I think the answer for now remains a resounding no, so they'll continue having no message to resonate with angry voters and they'll keep losing. At least until Trump and the GOP remind everyone that they suck at actually governing, then the Dems will win another narrow victory over a historically unpopular candidate and pat themselves on the back, remaining convinced that their safe centrism is the only path forward.","title":"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldnt beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing"},{"text":"I thought the fruit was a euphemism for sex","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"He (right?) does look pretty good for 47 (better than me at 43) but it's the internals that matter, obv.

How you prepare for a revolution if possible revolutionaries are responsible for delivering water and power to your villa, produce food that you eat, provide clothes that you wear etc.? There is no way to prepare for that without GAI.The reason why revolution is inadvisable is that you need to give power to small group of leaders to succesfully carry the revolution. And that is the point at which the new world can go sideways as it's hard to drop the power you were given.If the majority of the 99% were to just not buy anything except for absolute life sustaining necessities, withdraw all money from bank accounts, and enact a nation wide general labor strike for 1 month, politicians would be forced to address the demands of its citizens.That is a rose-colored view that only takes the best outcome into account. If you refuse to buy anything other than necessities and enact a nation-wide general labor strike, you have effectively crashed the economy. Of course the gov't would react - but why they would react by addressing the demands of its citizens?

With a grant of clemency to Leonard Peltier, Biden could ameliorate a half-century-old injustice not just against Peltier but, in effect, against Native peoples everywhere, many of whom consider Peltier an enduring symbol of racism and state-sponsored oppression in the US.\\n \\n For those Americans who may not have heard of him, Leonard Peltier is known around the world as the US governments number one political prisoner. A member of the Chippewa and Lakota Nations, Peltier was convicted in 1976 for the deaths, the year before, of two FBI agents killed during a shootout on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. While he was in the area at the time of the shootout, Peltier, who maintains his innocence, has served nearly 50 years and counting for a murder he was never proved to have committed C or even to have aided and abetted.\\n \\n It is widely understood that the federal government railroaded Peltier into prison by withholding and falsifying evidence, coercing witnesses and forcing a change of jurisdiction, among other acts of prosecutorial misconduct and malice. The US attorney James Reynolds, whose office handled the prosecution and appeal of the case, issued a public apology in 2021, acknowledging that the federal government failed to prove that Mr Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Reynolds has since called on Biden to release Peltier.","title":"Joe Biden is Leonard Peltiers last hope"},{"text":"But none of the successors have the culty mystique and circus ringleader persona that Trump has that makes them all so frothy","title":"Democrats Easily Defeat Republican Rivals in First Races Since Presidential Election"},{"text":"I would definitely be difficult, and I addressed that, but I would say its easier to just not buy things than it is to restore peoples faith in a failed and corrupt system and get them to go out and vote.

The anecdotes are biased toward failure but it really feels like young men would have WAY more success with women if they worked on reducing antisocial behaviors. That isn't a very persuasive way to describe the constellation of behaviors but I'm trying to be accurate/precise right now. You could probably also link it all to COVID and social media driving up antisocial behaviors amongst all people but I'm not gonna focus on that.Antisocial behaviors cover both ends of the spectrum. A lot of people (not just men) behave in ways that really limit how often they get the chance to encounter and interact with other people. A lot of men also tend to behave in ways that are socially inappropriate or off-putting, mostly revolving around not paying attention to the signals other people are giving off. The right advice is never going to reach the guys that do this out of misogyny but it could reach the guys that do it out of ignorance/inexperience, so I'll focus on them.It seems like there's a lot of passion and drive and interest, and that could be super attractive and appealing! The main complaint my straight coworkers have is never that a guy is ugly or gross - it's about his behavior. The main challenge is dialing all that passion to the appropriate level.

Please feel free to correct me.First of all, the examples of KKK and using urinals don't feel relevant in the discussion. KKK is a white supremacist group with a known violent history against black people. You are right people would be confused about a black Klansman attacking a white person, but that's because of what KKK is, not because of black people all having the same behaviours. Same with a woman using the urinal. Assuming we are talking about a cis woman who is not using a she-wee (or whatever those are called), your wonder would be on the practicality of her choice, not because women have been conditioned to pee sitting down. Again, practicality of the situation based on context external to the person discussed. \\nYou mention in another comment that men and women are equal or should be, and I agree. When we are talking about behaviours, such as a man refusing to help with house chores, this is not comparable to your examples. Chores will not threaten a man's life, and it's not that a man doesn't do them because his different body (compared to a woman)  makes it impractical.Therefore, it is legitimate to criticise his actions, or lack thereof, *regardless* of social context and norms. That is if you believe in men and women being equal, regardless of inequalities existing and favouring one side or the other. Your judgement should allow you to criticise beyond statistics and societal norms. You can then add those to say this is a typical situation, although it's not necessary, if your issue is with the situation itself, and not how normalised or not it is.If I'm not doing my part in the house, I want to be called out for that and improve. It doesn't matter if I'm doing more than the average man or less.\\nIf you have followed this to the end (I apologise for my bad writing, wrote this in a bit of a rush :( ) why does it matter what you expect from a group, when discussing an individuals' situation? How can it not be bias against men, which in my book would be sexism, and could be called misandry when it brews in a sub and becomes an acceptable form of discrimination. Please keep in mind I am using discrimination in the context of online discussions and favoring one side over the other. I'm not trying to equate it with other forms of discrimination, and I'm not trying to make a comment about misandry vs misogyny. Based on the roots of the words, I'm seeing both as sexism, and based on the gender affected the root word changes.","title":"CMV: AmITheAsshole or AITA misandrist and racist"},{"text":"Big Chungus Challenge Day 631","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"This guy was President of the United States for 4 years - the most powerful human on earth! - and did nothing about fires in California.

He never calls himself Divine, he is clear that he wants to make limited changes to mainstream Jewish practice but not Jewish law.  His followers and especially later theology make him Divine in Christianity.  Why is it that earliest and most central stuff (quotes from him) make him a regular Essene Jew and later stuff makes him more divine?To answer your last question first: the earliest writings make Jesus divine, with later writings making him seem somewhat more human at times but most definitely still thinking he is divine. Margaret Barker, Bart Ehrman, Larry Hurtado and others have shifted scholarly consensus (correctly) away from the low Christology beliefs you expressed (first human, then divine). Ehrmans How Jesus Became God is great exposition of why New Testament studies changed on this front.Now it is likely Jesus from Nazareth got conflated with other Jesuses at the time, such as a magician Jesus with a wand and perhaps a little with Jesus Barabbas the revolutionary.  It would not be shocking if he got conflated with some extant myths as well.  But it seems likely that the core was a Jewish guy from Nazareth who preached and accumulated followers.If you find it easy to understand the memory of a human man being conflated with ancient gods or other figures, it is not hard to imagine an ancient god acquiring a fake story on Earth. Plutarch says that although Osiris was a sky god, he nevertheless had an allegorical story on earth. The novel Callirhoe depicts a girl who is basically an earthly manifestation of Aphrodite, and embodies this goddess attributes. She is saved from crucifixion.

The river-residing mammal, which inspired Ratty in the Wind in the Willows, has revived in number in parts of Yorkshire, Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire and East Anglia thanks to targeted conservation work. Reintroductions, habitat restoration and, crucially, the effective eradication of American mink C the non-native predator responsible for water vole population crashes C are helping the creature recover from historic lows, finds the National Water Vole Database Project report. The Wildlife Trusts study found that in 2006 water voles occupied 1,071 10km squares across England, Scotland and Wales. In 2022, water voles were counted in just 652 10km squares, the lowest on record and a decline in range of 39%. These declines are on top of a catastrophic 94% estimated reduction in distribution between 1900 and 1998. The study also reveals that the area occupied by American mink between 2013 and 2022 is 308 10km grid squares smaller than their total historic extent C suggesting that efforts to reduce the non-native predator are working. The report also identified 11 new regional key areas for water voles C areas greater than 35 sq km where resilient water vole populations are found. A further 30 existing regional key areas expanded in size, while 12 retained their previous size. Ali Morse, water policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, said: The data is giving us a very clear message. The overall national picture is one of decline due to the destruction of natural habitats and predation by the non-native American mink. However, water vole populations will thrive when the right conditions are created. Its heartening to see that we can still rescue Ratty, if we all plan well and coordinate our efforts. Water voles are mini-ecosystem engineers, rather like beavers, and they contribute greatly to healthy river ecology. Reversing their historic loss needs to be a key focus of our conservation efforts. Water voles move seeds around, helping maintain lush and biodiverse riverbank vegetation, while themselves providing food for native predators including stoats, pike and birds of prey such as marsh harriers. Although 17 regional key areas declined in size and in nine places the vole population was no longer widespread enough to qualify as a regional key area, the uplift in populations in 41 areas shows conservation efforts are working. Yorkshire Wildlife Trusts Skerne Wetlands, a former fish farm near Driffield turned into a wetland nature reserve 10 years ago, is the fulcrum of a new regional key area in the headwaters of the River Hull. In Hertfordshire, water vole reintroductions by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust on the River Stort in 2015 and River Beane in 2022, as well as restoration works on the River Ash, have resulted in water voles expanding their range. Water vole populations have also recovered west of Oxford thanks to American mink control efforts and habitat enhancements working with local landowners, with Berks, Bucks and Oxon Wildlife Trust managing what is the longest-running single species conservation project in Britain. In January this year, the Waterlife Recovery Trust, which leads mink eradication in East Anglia, announced that mink had been removed from central and eastern Norfolk and Suffolk, an area representing almost 5% of England. The mink control effort has been made more effective with smart traps, which alert operators with text messages C reducing animal welfare concerns and enabling more traps to be set. Boosted by recent funding from Natural England, the trust is expanding its work to cover an area from the Thames to mid-Lincolnshire C far beyond its original area of operation. This success raises hopes that a mink-free Britain may soon be within reach. The Wildlife Trusts are calling for the rollout of a project to identify how nature restoration funds from housing developers can be better used to enhance water vole habitats, and priority for water vole habitats within the farm subsidies that support environmentally-friendly land management. Morse added: Bringing back resilient populations requires a coordinated approach. We need to help populations expand from remaining strongholds, by ensuring that developers, land managers, farmers and conservationists all work in tandem.!ping UK&amp;ECO","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Many people at the time did predict the fall of the USSR.

When I say that it doesn't fit the narrative, what I mean is that this natural disaster makes the democratic leadership look bad. When the fires started the mayor was in Ghana. The fire chief's primary concern appears to be diversity, not creating a robust fire fighting infrastructure. So we're talking about fire hydrants drying up. Maybe that's inevitable, as I've heard some people in this comments section say. There is no way for water reserves that the hydrants draw from to not dry up during a crisis of this magnitude. Fine. But that should be common knowledge at the fire department and multiple backup plans should have been in place for years already. The fact that, last I checked, the fires are ripping through LA and are 0% contained suggests that the fire department didn't have a robust plan and everything has gone to shit. Again returning to this narrative I mentioned. LA is perhaps the most left-most leaning demographic in the United States, and the city is getting bombarded by a fire that they appear unable to stop. When asked (admittedly in a very rude and hostile way) by Sky News how she feels about this, the mayor was unable to even reply. She froze up like a deer in the headlights.

These are logical traits for a robot to have anyways out of mere safety-concerns.As far as I know females are attracted by partners who are confident, dependable, independent and determined. A bot acting out these traits could be seen as a safety risk.Another point would be weight and material-usage.To a male user a lightweight robot would even be advantageous, as it makes them feel stronger and more dominant relatively speaking. So you'd need less heavy materials and a smaller frame, reducing cost.Would a woman want a robot that they could easily jank around who weighs only half as much as they themselves and that can't project any real force over them? It would use more materials and stronger motors to move them around, which increases cost.","title":"CMV: sex bots for women are way more likely to be popular than sex bots for men"},{"text":"Serious question, where else would they talk about it?\\nAlex Jones has been pushing depopulation for years, they all do say little shifty shit about there being too many people.?\\nBill Gates doesn't say \\"I think you should all be brutally murdered except your kids.

I suspect part of the answer is that most women would find the idea quite off-putting.Survey data seems to indicate pretty clearly that men masturbate with much higher frequency than women, on average. Some brief Googling also suggests that a comfortable majority of the customers of major sex toy/product retailers are men. Surveys also indicate that women are less interested in physical gratification and more interested in emotional gratification from sexual experiences than men.

Due to the higher rate of co-morbidity, i.e. disabilities having a tendency to occur together, many people born deaf/blind will also be intellectually disabled. Add to that the fact that learning to communicate for any deaf/blind person requires a great deal of work and does not happen accidentally, so many born deaf/blind are left to languish due to being born into circumstances that did not afford them access to the numerous resources needed to learn to effectively communicate.?So you wont see a large number of dead/blind people, out on the street, demonstrating their ability to communicate, read and write. Especially because they are limited in who they can communicate with, and posting videos about ones personal life on YouTube is not something most people are eager to do. And even if they are, it is not an intuitive process, and requires additional effort and assistance.However, it is not impossible. Helen Keller was extremely wealthy. She had access to dedicated private education, and the luxury of spending all her time focused on learning to read, write and communicate. She was relatively lucky, as are many of the dead/blind people you are likely to see online. Haben Girma was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, so Im going to go out on a limb and say her family had access to a lot of resources. That makes a huge difference.?So is it difficult for a deaf/blind person to learn to read, write and communicate? Yes. Even if they were not born that way.

In all of the examples, the man is criticized based upon typical social conventions. In The first, he is considered in the wrong for screaming at his girlfriend for not having food on the table, which I think most people would expect. In the second, he is considered in the wrong for refusing to spend $5 for her birthday. This goes against the typical social role of men as providers, so it again recieved a negative reaction. In the last one, it was a case of a woman being taken for granted for caretaking work which is again a common problem women have to deal with, leading to the situation resonating more with people's lives experiences.The gender inverted versions are all relatively less socially common circumstances and it is clear reading the replies that people take that into account and were predispositions to give the women the benefit of the doubt due to women being screwed over in the reverse circumstances being so common. Is that a good thing? I don't think so. Is it something that is understandable as something other than misogyny? Yeah, I think it is. In all these cases what is clear is that the people's gender affects the way people fill in the gaps in the story. When the genders are the typical layout people assume the typical scenario and judge accordingly. When they are inverted they seem to view it as an exceptional case and fill in the blanks for that.Again, I want to reiterate that I don't think this is a good bias, but I think the bias has less to do with gender and more to do with social norms in general.","title":"CMV: AmITheAsshole or AITA misandrist and racist"},{"text":" The measure proposed by Republican state Rep.

A necessary consequence of Jesus not existing is that there would not be any credible eyewitness testimony OR anything in the record that could only have come from eyewitnesses.So you think the existing documents support that no one ever saw Jesus? Because that sounds like an baffling position to take, especially in the face a much simpler and adademically consenting view that yes, a preacher in ancient Palestine did exist.They saw him in visionary experiences. Later on, deliberately fictional stories in which Jesus is depicted as interacting with real people of the time was written. This is not terribly different from how Satan, a mythic sky god, is depicted as manifesting on earth (Matt 4:1-11) or different from how Lazarus, once a fictional character in parable (Lk 16:19-31) has become a real person in Johns gospel (John 11).Who else from history do you think was invented by that reasoning? The kings of the iron age Fertile Crescent? They didnt all leave eyewitness writings.King Arthur, Queen Esther, King Romulus and various other characters who did not leave behind much or highly problematic evidence are thought to be mythical by at least some scholars.However, I would agree that a figure leaving behind very little or low quality evidence does not mean that they are mythical. The situation with Jesus is very different: it isnt simply that he did not believe behind a vast quantity of high quality evidence. Its that the evidence we have is better explained by a mythicist hypothesis than a historical one.Take Romulus as an example. As far as I know, no historian thinks he was historical. If I recall, he even has a story written hundreds of years later that claims the story itself came from eyewitnesses (originally, not directly). But alleged eyewitness testimony or stories based thereon are not evident within a few hundred years of the time Romulus is supposed to have lived. Romulus story seems partly derivative from an older mythological god. Most everything we are told about Romulus is fantastical (he was raised by wolves) and the one thing we are told about him that is more believable (he allegedly founded Rome) cant have happened, because Rome did not come to be suddenly but instead gradually developed from a collection of looseknit communities started round the area. All of this is paralleled by Jesus: he was supposed to be the founder of Christianity though more recent work seems to show that instead of a sudden, discrete origin for Christianity like you would expect if it had a single man as its founder, lots of savior cults and believing communities gradually coalesced and became more standardized. Very similar to he roman situation mentioned above.","title":"cmv:The Christ Myth Theory is True."},{"text":"We shouldn't talk about Trump's sudden belligerent imperialist rhetoric?

Assumptions about who should pay for dates based on a cost analysis of what it takes each person to prepare for the date.)  \\n* * (Ex.

The reactions come from those emotions, rather than a consistent ideological bias.On those gender swaps you mentioned, the context and the readers individual biases play a huge role.

Please do not just copy paste a dictionary definition, I want to know what your understanding of the term is. Secondly, do you think that there are hypothetical situations in which swapping characteristics of people in a story actually should change one's conclusions? An extreme example to highlight the possibility would be a white man saying he was attacked by a black Klansman versus a black person saying they were attacked by a white klansman.

Most of the bits of information in an English name are in the surname. There is however, a notable exception. African-Americans tend to have a much narrower range of surnames (due to slavery), and theres been a corresponding increase in the distribution of given names.Anyway, naming conventions for Chinese-American people are an information-theoretic nightmare, because you combine a low-information English given name with a low-information Chinese surname. Do you know how many Steve Chens I know? How many Jennifer Lis? I dont believe this naming convention is sustainable.My prediction is that Chinese-American given names are going to diverge more over time, as a result of this. I believe that names tend to convey a generally stable number of bits of information.Am I making any sense here? Because this is sorta a thing Ive noticed.

Harris still continued to throw Neoliberal ideology into an excited crowd, anf she lost against fascism. She said that America was going to be the most leathal fighting force in the world. She ignored the protests when 60% of Americans want an arms embargo. Most of Gaza is destroyed, and at least 46000 people are dead. 70% of that number are women and children, the latter being particularly shot in the head. The parking lot phase will be starting over the envlave soon. American bombs may have been dropped on several places in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, etc. 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. 70% of bankruptcies in this country are from medical debt.

Once they hit puberty though (11-13), the critical window to learning these types of skills closes, and they may never learn how to speak, regardless of if theyre deaf or not.

He's not wasting paper going over something as basic as \\"yes, people saw him\\" and he brings up his personal eyewitness experience (which you refuse to accept as an eyewitness account conveniently) because it was a major turning point for him. You are literally expecting a guy talking to other church leaders about policy to just abruptly talk about what you specifically are looking for, then concluding that because he didn't say something that meets your criteria, your assumptions must be true. Fun fact, he never said Jesus was mythical, so the same demanding premise could be used to argue AGAINST your point. \\"I do not start with that assumption, I start by demonstrating mythicism is feasible (Jesus mythicism is as believable as Satan mythicism) and go on to show why this feasible conjecture makes more sense of the chronology and contents of early christian literature than the standard historical Jesus hypothesis does.\\" And then when people ask for proof that ANYONE actually believed that, you have no proof. Your \\"theory\\" is a tired old fanfiction that relies on forcing assumptions on the people at the time with no basis.Like, your theory literally starts with the assumption that first century jews, who lived with special religious freedoms to practice their strict monotheistic belief system, would magically develop a greek style cult to a rebranded pagan god that they morphed into a mythical person.

Trans rights are clearly lagging behind that, but now trans people are visible, and seen more and more as our neighbors, friends, and family members.The current situation where trans people are the preferred target of Republicans is pretty familiar to the old folks here.  Back in 2004, the GOP had started an unpopular war, was openly talking about cutting Social Security, and was clearly in the bag for rich people.  George W. Bush had inspired historic hate among Democrats.  And the GOP won it all.  How?  In large part, by attacking gay people.  Gay marriage was the trans sports of 2004, and states were tripping over themselves to pass Constitutional gay marriage bans.  *California* did so in *2008*!But now, gay rights are so popular and expected that eleven Republican Senators voted to codify gay marriage in 2022.  Among Democrats and Independents, supporting gay rights is just the expectation.  And that happened because gay people kept existing and insisting on their rights, in the face of powerful opposition.  And more and more people began to stand with them.It's unfair and awful that this is even necessary.  But the LGBT+ community is far more organized and strong than they used to be.  And in terms of cis/straight allies, I'm here, just like I was for gay folks back in the day.  Many more are, and we consider LGBT+ rights to be one of the main reasons to be politically involved.At the top of this thread, it says \\"We're not going back\\" in nice, big letters.  That's for all of us.  Together, we'll keep changing the conversation and fighting for everyone's rights.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: January 8, 2025"},{"text":"And social media is becoming pro-MAGA.

God doesn't want every single thing about his creation to be perfect and easy Just because he's intelligent doesn't mean that he has to necessarily make life as easy as possible. I see no correlation between the twoSuffering from an Islamic POV:Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: We believe, and will not be tested? - (Quran, 29:2). This life is a test. It's meant to be temporary and filled with hardship and trials. What would be the point of heaven if this life was perfect and without fault and tribulations? it wouldn't make sense. Allah only asks us to worship and obey his commands for like 60-80 years for most people? and then death arrives, and the Everlasting hereafter awaits where every moment is better than the last and we get whatever we wantWe will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endurewho, when faced with a disaster, say, Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will ?all? return.They are the ones who will receive Allahs blessings and mercy. And it is they who are ?rightly? guided. - (Quran 2:155-157). Even though this life is full of tests, it doesn't mean there's no hope of living a good life in this world. \\"So, surely with hardship comes ease.\\" (Quran 94:5)\\n\\"Surely with ?that? hardship comes ?more? ease.\\" (Quran 94:6). Tough times never last. Do not think ?O Prophet? that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them until a Day when ?their? eyes will stare in horror - (Quran 14:42). Those who do wrong and oppress others in this life will not get away with it. They will be punished for what they used to do in the next life. And being punished in the next life is INCOMPREHENSIBLY worse than being punished/suffering in this life. The Prophet Mohammed (?) said, *\\"No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.\\"* - Sahih al-Bukhari 5641, 5642. Suffering is also a form of cleansing of sins. If Allah wants good for someone and if he wants to ease their burden on the day of judgement by taking away sins, a day where all of our deeds (good and bad) are presented to us and a day so terrifying that we'd all be worried about ourselves, then he'll make that person go through some suffering either in this life (any type of suffering i.e. mental, physical, financial etc etc) or the next life (spending a bit of time in hell before entering heaven) Jami\` at-Tirmidhi 2398 - Mus'ab bin Sa'd narrated from his father that a man said:\\n*\\"O Messenger of Allah(s.a.w)! Which of the people is tried most severely?\\" He said: \\"The Prophets, then those nearest to them, then those nearest to them. A man is tried according to his religion; if he is firm in his religion, then his trials are more severe, and if he is frail in his religion, then he is tried according to the strength of his religion. The servant shall continue to be tried until he is left walking upon the earth without any sins.\\"*Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, *If Allah wills good for someone, He afflicts him with trials.* - Source: S?ah?i?h? al-Bukha?ri? 5645, Grade:?Sahih?(authentic) according to Al-BukhariAbu Musa reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, This nation of mine has been granted mercy. Their punishment is not in the Hereafter. Their punishment is in the world through persecution, earthquakes, and slaughter. - Source: Sunan Abi?

In order to create their desired result, they have to work within specific conditions, outside of which their goals may be impossible, and a newborn stage may very well be one of those conditions.

Starfleet never would have known if you skim off the top, have a slightly authoritarian or quid pro quo understanding as appears in some episodes. Its that Ds9 is on the front lines of the federation that makes it the best moral exemplar to me, because they could have gotten away with a whole lot more, but didn't. Voyager could have literally done whatever they wanted and faced no meaningful reprocussions.","title":"CMV: Star trek: Deep space nine was the absolute best of star trek in terms of displaying its moral character."},{"text":"I think my statement was over-simplified to an extent, just to make a point. It's not only the size and scope of the government that should be drastically reduced. Government service should not be a lucrative life-long career as it has become for elected officials and unelected bureaucrats. The nature of government work needs to change on a fundamental level. How that change is accomplished, I don't know.  We will see what Elon and Vivek are capable of doing with DOGE, though I'm not holding out hope that much will change. I certainly don't think it could get any worse than it already is.Donald Trump is not a career politician. He has only every run for one political office which is the President. Elon has received a lot of government money for his business ventures, but has arguably provided a great return on that investment in terms of technology and the advancement of human space travel. I'm not a fan of Donald Trump, but he's far better than the alternatives for the last 8 to 12 years. I'm also not a fan of government subsidies, but I can't argue that for once the money has been put to fantastic use by Elon.","title":"Former social democrat slowly turning libertarian"},{"text":"It's not about women's womb.
