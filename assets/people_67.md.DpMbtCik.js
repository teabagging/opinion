Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voters showed similar results, with large numbers of voters believing a candidate could be for men or women but not both. It's frustrating because the truth is much simpler and also doesn't put these two genders at loggerheads: Harris is better for both men and women, and Trump is much, much worse for people of any genderThere's a simple reason people think this way (beyond base-level one has one set of genitals and the other has another).  And this article does a decent job of highlighting part of it - when you look through the examples of what the Harris is going to do for men given, they're pretty much non-existent.  It's just a lot of here is why Trump would be worse for the country.  Then there is outreach like this, as mentioned in the article:As Sarah Lazarus wrote at Off Message, \\"Kamala Harris will be a president for all Americans,\\" whether \\"theyre sports guys or tech bros.\\" Or the ads that basically told men \\"you know your penis won't fall off if you vote for a woman?!\\" And the Harris campaign website:https://democrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/Women, veterans, seniors, lgbtq, native americans, faith community, ethnic community, the disabled etc.  That's great - but if the Harris campaign is struggling with men, and they want to get their votes...you wouldn't know that.Same with the democratic party platform.https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_Democratic_Party_Platform_8a2cf8.pdf---I think the democratic party and the \\"left\\" in general have a blind spot when it comes to men.  They're so interested in fighting the patriarchy and male privilege, they're uncomfortable or just unable to deal with men as a group that actually has needs, and think and talk to them like they do other groups.  So that leaves a politically moderate male voter looking at a a choice between the democratic party that comes off cold, and a republican party that seems to be acting like the WWE version of masculinity as a counter-point.  It isn't a hard decision for most, but in a lot of case will lead to people staying home...which honestly, might be by design as the Harris campaign knows that less men voting will likely be better for her.","title":"Trump is terrible for women  but that doesn't mean he's good for men"},{"text":"Hopefully after Kamala losses, people will stop putting any weight into his predictions.?","title":"Allan Lichtman predicts Harris to win, Nate Silver disagrees,"},{"text":"When a problem comes along, you must whip it","title":"\\"I am scared every day\\": Experts say GOP men targeting no-fault divorce to keep women \\"trapped\\""},{"text":"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://variety.com/2024/politics/news/john-oliver-fights-back-tears-kamala-harris-vote-1236199366/) reduced by 62%.

Their goal isn't to get legitimate vote registrants but rather to get as many random people signed up as possible.

Polling of Hispanic voters has been all over the place - hard to tell. And we need to remember that Hispanic voters are not a monolith. Cubans view this election very differently than Mexicans, who viewed this very differently from Puerto Ricans. We know that Trump made some serious gains in South Florida and South Texas, lets see if he holds those together. And if he can find a way to continue eating into Democrats typical margin among Hispanic voters.I am skeptical if Trump has genuinely made gains with black men - which is the narrative - but we will get some ideas fairly early on Tuesday. Once again, polling has been all over the place on this issue.Florida returns will show us a lot. I dont anticipate Harris winning Florida, but Florida has some heavily Hispanic areas and some heavily black areas which could indicate if Trump gains with those two constituencies are real.To me, this election comes down to two things. First, Harris has made a full court press for white women in the suburbs. I will be looking to see if she outperform Biden in suburbs around major cities. Second, Trump has made a hard play for young men, especially minorities. I would be looking to see if Trump eats into Bidens 2020 margins with black voters, or expands the progress he made Hispanic voters in 16 and 20.Another place to watch early is Virginia. Harris will win Virginia. But I am specifically looking at the northern Virginia suburbs and the heavily black counties in Southeast Virginia to determine if either of those two trends is real. In northern Virginia, keep an eye on Loudon, Fairfax, and Falls Church city. In southeast Virginia, keep an eye on Hampton, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. If Harris loses ground among black voters in Virginia, but does not make additional gains in the affluent northern Virginia suburbs, that could spell trouble for other states with similar demographics, such as Pennsylvania. Alternatively, if we see that Harris has held the margins that Biden had in these two areas, it likely shows that she has held together the Biden coalition.Trump will overwhelmingly win white men. Harris will overwhelmingly win minority women. The two groups that will decide this election are white women and minority men. Specifically, women in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and men in the cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee.","title":"Trump will likely declare victory early.

Why can't other members just decide to filibuster other things in retaliation? I notice that talk of ending the filibuster ability in the U.S. Senate started after Democrats lost multiple elections after totally dominating in the 2008 election and blowing their lead in just 2 years.The filibuster can potentially empower people's movements with a small number of U.S. Senators and become historic heroes for it. They can do this for Medicare for All, for example, or ending the Patriot Act and domestic surveillance. It's a bad sign that in this era with tyrannical Democrats who've come down to witchcraft and hearsay about \\"Russians\\" being the cause for them losing elections, this is when the Democrats are calling to end the filibuster. I'm not convinced it's something to focus on.Gerrymandering of course is tyrannical and should be ended. There should be a principled and fair system for shaping districts. That Republicans haven't gotten this done proves how evil they are. Democrats sort-of made some effort to end it, with some judges ruling that gerrymandering is somewhat bad.

After nearly five years, and at a reported cost of $11 billion, the pipeline was eventually finished in September 2021. \\"\\"Opposition to the pipeline has been fierce. Russia and Germanys longstanding view has been that the pipeline is a purely economic project. However, the US, UK and the EU have all expressed concerns over its geopolitical implications\\"\\"Critics view the pipeline as a political project of the Kremlin and part of a broader geopolitical strategy to undermine the West by increasing European reliance on Russian gas supplies and potentially giving Russia leverage over security of supply.\\"\\"Nord Stream 2 has implications for Ukraine. Although not a huge importer of Russian gas, Ukraine is a major transit country of current Russian gas pipelines into Europe. Transit fees are thought to account for almost 3% of Ukraines GDP, which will bring an expected revenue of $2-3 billion annually over the next five years.\\"Congressional ReportsNord Stream 2 lies alongside the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, in operation since 2011. Nord Stream 2 (consisting of two lines) would double the total capacity of the Nord Stream system from 55 billion cubic meters (BCM) to 110 BCM per year. The pipeline is owned by the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. About half the cost was reportedly financed by five European companies: Engie,OMV, Shell, Uniper, and Wintershall.Although the European Union (EU) has articulated an ambitious energy diversification strategy, some European governments have not reduced dependence on Russian gas, which accounted for about 40% of EU natural gas imports in 2021. Factors behind reliance on Russian supply include diminishing European gas supplies, commitments to reduce coal use, Russian investments in European infrastructure, and prior perceptions of Russia as a reliable supplierNot Economic?  \\nWelcome to to weirdsville","title":"It's pretty gross to think about what the democratic establishment is going to take away from this election if Kamala wins"},{"text":"Rasmussen, AtlasIntel and Elon.

Zero-sum thinking is literally classified as a logical fallacy, and the reason why should be obvious given a moment's thought. If your neighbor buys a new car, for instance, it doesn't mean you can't have one. Trump's relentless repetition of the zero-sum fallacy, however, has sadly convinced many voters that two groups of people are at odds with each other: men and women. Trump has already done immeasurable harm to women's rights and will do significantly more if he's returned to the White House. And in the process, he will not do a single thing to make men's lives better.In a poll of swing states in early September, CBS News found many voters see this as a \\"girls v. boys\\" election. In Michigan, 77% of voters believe Vice President Kamala Harris is for women's interests, but only 55% believe she will work for men. A whopping 81%, however, believe Trump is for men's interests, though most  54%  correctly understand Trump is against women. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voters showed similar results, with large numbers of voters believing a candidate could be for men or women but not both. It's frustrating because the truth is much simpler and also doesn't put these two genders at loggerheads: Harris is better for both men and women, and Trump is much, much worse for people of any gender. As Sarah Lazarus wrote at Off Message, \\"Kamala Harris will be a president for all Americans,\\" whether \\"theyre sports guys or tech bros.\\" Financial experts of all political stripes agree that the issue of the economy, which a majority of voters rate their number one issue, isn't even a contest. Harris will continue Democratic policies that have brought down inflation and decreased unemployment, and her proposals could lower housing and medical costs. Trump, on the other hand, wants to slap a 20% tariff on imported goods, which would functionally be a massive sales tax that would send inflation spiraling. He also wants to deport millions of workers, which most experts believe would cause an economic crash. Even Trump's biggest booster, billionaire Elon Musk, agrees that Trump's plans would tank the U.S. economy, causing what, by Musk's own admission, sounds like a second Great Depression. He, as I noted in Standing Room Only, has embraced fascistic logic that crashing the economy would be a purifying ritual that would supposedly allow him and Trump to rebuild from the ashes, but of course, actual economists think that view is completely unfeasible. It should go without saying, but an economic crash doesn't just hurt women, but men. What Trump is offering men is not concrete or material improvements to their lives. It's just vibes. As Paul Waldman recently wrote in his newsletter, Trump tells men \\"you are oppressed.\\" The only \\"solution\\" Trump offers is permission to act out toxic masculinity \\"in the most belligerent way possible.\\" But in terms of what will actually make the lives of men better, Trump gives them \\"precisely nothing.\\" It's worse than that, as I argued last week. Being a misogynist boor may offer temporary gratification, but in the long or even medium term, it will just make men's problems worse. If they're feeling lonely or alienated, being a jerk results in being shunned even more, especially by women. This downward spiral of self-destruction isn't subtle; it is why there are so many \\"divorced dude energy\\" jokes about Trump voters. But voting for Trump won't make your wife come back to you. Trump is a con artist, as evidenced by the eye-popping half-billion judgment against him in New York for decades of business fraud. Tricking men into voting against their self-interest using cheap appeals to toxic masculinity is very on-brand for him. But, as Timothy Noah of the New Republic pointed out, this has been true of Republicans generally for decades. \\"Democratic officeholders are much likelier to do what voters want than Republican officeholders,\\" he writes, noting that GOP-controlled state governments \\"routinely ignore voter preferences\\" but Democratic majorities \\"work much harder to do what voters want.\\" Studies show Republican voters are often more ignorant of the policies their elected officials pass, suggesting that they are easier to manipulate with empty identity-based appeals. Trump's base of insecure and ignorant male voters isn't just useful electorally but offers up a steady supply of marks for shady MAGA-related hustles. Trump took time out of his \\"busy\\" campaign schedule in August and September to roll out a cryptocurrency scheme, with partners whose profiles were comically on-the-nose: Chase Herro, who calls himself a \\"dirtbag of the internet\\" and Zachary Folkman, who sells \\"how to pick up women\\" classes online. Herro doesn't hide what he's doing, either, calling cryptocurrency a \\"scam\\" and he doesn't care \\"if it goes to zero\\" because he'll \\"make so much money trading these f-ing coins in and out.\\" Crypto and MAGA are made for each other because both prey largely on male insecurity with false reassurances to their targets that they're secretly the smart ones for buying into this snake oil that normies  often portrayed as middle-aged moms  turn their noses up to. Some on the left are trying to compete with MAGA's empty pandering by arguing that real masculinity is rooted in the courage to reject bigoted nonsense. In a recent newsletter, Anand Giridharadas tried his hand at such an argument: \\"Men worthy of the word dont depend for their self-esteem on the crushing and marginalizing of Others. Men worthy of the word dont need women to be locked in the fourteenth century legally to feel whole. Men worthy of the word dont hand over the keys to the future to billionaires who pull the strings.\\"Certainly, a substantive group of men are stirred by the argument that \\"real men reject fascism.\\" The latest polls show about 45% of men say they back Harris over Trump. Harris is even 7 points up over Trump with college-educated men, though it's a full 27-point spread towards Harris with college-educated women. But it's also telling that, as with elections past, it seems women are turning out in larger numbers. Politico reports a 10-point gender gap in early voting, as women have cast 55% of ballots, and men only 45%. It's resulting in a major tantrum in right-wing media, with Republican pundits accusing women of somehow betraying men by voting for Harris. In reality, men voting for Trump are betraying the women in their lives, by voting against their basic rights. Perhaps this is why women turn out more than men: the stakes feel higher for women. It would be nice if both men and women understood the serious economic threat of another Trump presidency, but a confusing media environment has obscured that. But on the \\"culture war\\" issues, the situation is clear. Despite all the hysterical proclamations about emasculation, men have nothing to fear from President Kamala Harris. On the flip side, however, Trump has already done immeasurable harm to women's rights and will do significantly more if he's returned to the White House. And in the process, he will not do a single thing to make men's lives better.","title":"Trump is terrible for women  but that doesn't mean he's good for men"},{"text":"And considering his age and lifestyle, I wouldnt be surprised if he uses blood thinners that exaggerate any small cut.","title":"Trump was was injured in this collision.

But I can answer the specific, mathematical question you have.You're implicitly assuming the same people are voting, that the demographics stay the same size and/or that the chance someone votes is not related to the candidate they vote for.For example, if democrats are equally likely to vote, but republicans become much more likely to vote, then republicans could win even if there are fewer republicans in every demographic you look at.Another example, let's say 60 percent of elderly people are likely to voting republican, and there are a million of these. And 39 percent of young people vote republican, and there are a million of these. Now democrats win with 100000 votes.But 4 years later, 59 percent of elderly people vote republican, but there are now 1.2 million of them. There are now 0.8 million young people, and 38% vote republican. So both demographics have improved for democrats, but now the republicans win.Like I said, this is just the mathematical answer to your questions, I'm not looking at realistic numbers.

Many of the original settlers of Israel have been long gone or are very old, so this generation of Israelis (barring any recent migrants) is not the same as the ones from 1948, as in, they are native citizens. Im sure they would rather be dead than to be forced to give up their national sovereignty. In order to remove Israel off the face of the earth, you would have to force the Israeli people into permanent exile and to dissolve the Israeli government. I dont mind the government being done away with if it means that Netanyahu is arrested and barred from politics for the rest of his life, but the people will resist being forced out of the country that they lived for most of their lives. This would undoubtedly lead to conflict, countless deaths, and would be a straight up humanitarian crisis (the Middle East cant catch a break, can it?) on par with the Gaza conflict.And even if we assume that Israel was dissolved (which wont be the case), the US doesnt speak out against this (which they definitely will), and that there were few casualties (read: many casualties), where would the Israeli people go? Would the people and government of whatever country they end up accept them or would this just result in waves of xenophobic violence and antisemitism? What would replace Israel? I assume that it would be Palestine, but then what would its government be? Would it be Fatah? Would it be Hamas? Would it be PLO? Either way, this new Palestinian government would ensure to get rid of any and all Israelis that are still there. Also, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bhutan, the Vatican, and debatably North Korea are also theocratic ethnostates.

Lets roll back the clock.170 years ago, you could run a successful campaign on maintaining chattel slavery.  That could be your big wedge issue.  The right to continue to own and treat black folks like livestock.  But then there was this whole war, the slavers lost, and now trying to bring it back wasnt a winning issue any more.100 years ago, the biggest film in history was Birth of a Nation.  You could campaign not over removing black freedom, but removing black people from this mortal coil.  Youd need to be a a LITTLE subtle, but not by much. You could campaign on drug laws designed to ban drugs not because the drugs were dangerous, but because certain groups couldnt be trusted with them.60 years ago, you could still campaign on keeping brown people from getting within 100 feet of a white person.  You could campaign about Jim Crow.  Your identity politics could be all about how much you hate African Americans (though you would use a different word I will not be repeating).  But then they won equal rights and such things were impolite to say out loud.40 years ago, you could still run on how much racial minorities sucked, but you had to use different words for it.  Same groups of people, but you pretend it was about behaviors, not skin.  But then people got all politically correctNow, preserving the family unit against encroachment from homosexuals is the big hate campaign.  The AIDS crisis gave conservatives being forced to tone down the racism a great gift.  It made queer folk more visible, it got a lot of people worried about catching a then death sentence from a queer person.  And Im not going to get into the monstrous celebration of death tolls from people who were conservative thought leaders into the last decade.Times changed, as more queer folks left the closet, more people interacted with them.  More people realized they were just, at the end of the day, people.  As they had with racial minorities, people learned that the demonized other was just a neighbor.Now its not (as) cool to be anti-Semitic, racist, or sexist.  They still are all of these things, and the Trump campaign in particular lets the mask slip to the point its noteworthy when they keep it on, but its a little difficult to make ads around it.  TV hosts wont join in.But Trans people?  Thats like a single percentage of the population!  Thats still millions of Americans, but very few people know an out trans person particularly well.  And because its millions, they can be a plausible threat.  And, best of all, you dont need new dog whistles!  Just reuse the sexist and homophobic ones.  Most of the people who really respond to this shit dont really know the difference anyway (hell, they consider it synonymous with drag).Theyre the last minority target its still okay to openly hate.  With Trumps entire campaign about all the people his followers do/should hate, theyre the target hes gonna talk about the most.  Its why he spends so much time talking about Immigration.  Anxiety about immigration has been racially motivated since the nations founding.  In the time of the founding fathers, the anxiety was Germans.  No joke.  Germans.  These basically catholic, non English speakers were going to destroy America.  Ive jabbered enough, not going to run through the whole history here, but immigration has ALWAYS been a dog whistle.  Theres always been groups that them coming over is fine, even desirable, and groups whose arrival spelled doom.  But because its never been explicit, it remains a useful tool if all a politician has to offer is hate.And thats Trump.  In 2017, Swastika flying, one arm saluting Nazis celebrated his win.  And he has even less to offer outside of hate now than he had then.  Keep me out of prison, it turns out, is not a political message that really resonates with those suffering from economic anxiety.  (Maybe the anxiety is real, lord knows theres stuff to be anxious about.  And sure, a ton of people have been primed to blame everyone but the responsible parties, but at some level, that shits gotta be code.)","title":"Transgender issues arent a top voter concern.

Trump is +41 points among white men without college degrees, essentially matching his showing in this group in the 2020 ABC News exit poll, and also +41 points among rural voters.The shift toward Harris among likely voters relies in part on consolidated support among Democratic base groups, notably Black people and liberals.

When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. Its not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted. For example, were running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, that this isnt just words, its his actions. Thats a really big shift that were seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trumps impact. One other thing that we are seeing is that young voters are hearing audio from Trumps Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-wordtheyre hearing that for the first time this year, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, theyre hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, its just landing a lot differently in this cycle.It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we dont win in Iowa, its a signal that were going to do well in the upper Midwest. Its a great sign of whats to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesnt change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. The thing that doesnt necessarily get reported as much is that were doing it with such joy. Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harriss ability to drive joy in this final stretch.

It is baffling how people are so quick to lay the entire blame at their feet considering that.And I even understand and agree that its a little fucked to stay allies with a country who would even consider doing the things we had to stop them from doing - and have done the things theyve done - but its also a messy and complicated situation because basically every stable country in the Middle East wants Hamas gone making this is a surprisingly good environment for a Middle East peace process - weve quietly been pushing other countries to push Israel toward a two state solution with normalization of relations - a historic first for many of these countries with Israel - as a reward. These countries are not interested in that deal without U.S. backing and many see Israels proposed solutions that the Biden administration stopped as escalations theyd have to respond to. Every indication also shows that under a new administration Israel will act differently so were damage controlling and biding time.Its just more and more obvious the popular narrative is bullshit the more you learn about what actually happened lol. Right wing propaganda is great at exploiting fractures in voting blocs and its wild how effective this campaign has become. Israel sucks for sure, but it seems like almost the entire current administration agrees with that and has been working overtime to stop them without starting a war and I dont know what else we expect.","title":"'Trump is even worse': Bernie urges pro-Palestinian voters to back Harris"},{"text":"Another step on their path to revoking women's suffrage.","title":"\\"I am scared every day\\": Experts say GOP men targeting no-fault divorce to keep women \\"trapped\\""},{"text":"This reminds me of the fact that he WENT to Cancun with a big suitcase and came BACK with an overnight bag.

But what if we are witnessing one campaign and one slow-motion coup, whose organizers need to go through the motion of campaigning for the plan to work? Since winning at the ballot box does not matter, taking a break to listen to Pavarotti isnt a problem; conversely, a festival of racism and conspiracy theories, as at Madison Square Garden, is not about convincing any undecided voter, but motivating committed Trumpists to go along with another coup attempt.\\n \\n To be sure, this can also sound like conspiracy theory. The point is not prediction, but to call for preparedness. After all, there is an overwhelming number of reasons why, should Trump lose, he will once more try to take power anyway. His followers have long been primed to assume that evil Democrats will steal the election. The unchecked racism fits into a logic of far-right populism more generally: far-right populists claim that they, and they alone, represent what they call the silent majority or the real people (the very expression Trump used on January 6 to address his supporters).\\n \\n If far-right populists do not win elections, the reason can only be that the majority of the electorate was silenced by someone (liberal elites, of course). Or, for that matter, people who are not real people C fake Americans C must have participated in the election to bring about an illegitimate outcome. This explains the Republican obsession with finding proof of non-citizen voting.\\n \\n . . .\\n \\n Most worryingly, Maga members have been primed to resort to violence. Trump and his allies C including the worlds richest man, who just happens to be a rightwing extremist C have framed the election as an apocalyptic battle. If Democrats win, Musk has claimed, there will not be any proper elections ever after; they will bring in more foreigners to secure a permanent majority. It is already half forgotten that Trump held his first major rally this election cycle in Waco, Texas.\\n \\n Who knows whether Trump can really mobilize large numbers of people on the streets; it might be enough to prolong a sense of chaos. Vance has claimed that the 2020 election was problematic, because so many citizens had doubts about its integrity and Democrats prevented a debate which the country needed to have (never mind that Republicans had created the doubts in the first place). How long a debate would Vance like, exactly? Incidents like the infamous Brooks Brothers riot, where rightwingers in fancy suits stopped a recount in Florida in 2000, might accompany this debate.

If we let them take over everything for us - healthcare, student loans, news coverage, school choice, harsh Covid rules, etc - the less we have control in our lives. Reagan was right - the less government involved in our lives, the better. He famously said the scariest 9 words in America are - Im from the government, and Im here to help. Less regulations, less red tape, more choice, more freedom is the way to go. The bigger the government, the more money they need to run it. Look where we are right now! Where do they get that money? From us!! If Trump comes in, hell get Vivek &amp; Elon with a weed-whacker to these bloated government organizations, which are now responsible for nearly 30% of jobs in America, and they dont produce anything to the GDP!Anyway, enough ranting. Go Trump for making America Sane Again! And any Democrats still on the fence with their choice tomorrow, Ill leave you with a quote from Jane Austen:It isnt what we say or think that defines us, but what we doTake personality and speeches out of your decision.

But its really irrelevant. Trump is not fit or qualified to be the president again. So the choice is easy and obvious. Who knows she may shock the hell out of me. Lets see. If you think Trump should hold that office again, I question your judgment, motives and loyalty to the country as a whole. Do the right thing and prove this country is what I believe it to be. The country I swore to support the constitution of. Trump will be a historically bad choice. His whole shtick is vote for me out of fear. He makes up problems that dont exist and says vote for me because I will save you. Without actually saying how hes going to do it. He WAS the president for 4 years. Trump should be able to list all the accomplishments he made as president and specifically explain the things hes going to do to improve on those things. But he cant. Because he has no plans.

Nazis want to see Israel destroyed and the Jews put to the sword. The Palestinians want to see Israel destroyed and the Jews put the sword. Therefore, the Palestinians, by and large, are Nazis. Just look at the curriculum that's given to students in UNRWA schools. And the people who say, Well, theyve been oppressed by Israel for decades! and think its some kind of justification for mass murder are need to recalibrate their moral compass.Yes, those are the Nazis I'm talking about. The Nazis that want to see Israel destroyed, because they see Israel *winning* and think that automatically makes them the bad guy. The largest concentration of them in the country is in Dearborn, MI, the district represented by Hamas auxiliary Rashida Tlaib, **who has not denounced Hamas**. there is no punishment severe enough for the people who committed that atrocitySo we agree that Israel is justified in its prosecution of the war against Hamas. But the solution is not to turn around and slaughter 35x as many innocent Palestinians. Thats fucked.Blame Hamas for embedding their military infrastructure within civilian areas. Should Israel just sit on its hands and let Hamas attack with impunity because of the fact that hitting back will incur civilian casualties? What is the goal here? To wipe Palestine off the map?To remove Hamas from power in Gaza. Already, with Sinwar dead, Israel has made a statement that any Hamas fighter that returns hostages will be given amnesty. The Israelis are looking to draw down the fighting in Gaza so that they can pivot to beating the shit out of Iran, who is the real instigator behind everything. Which they are already doing to a decent extent; Israel's recent airstrikes have basically obliterated Iran's capacity to launch ballistic missiles for *at least* two years, and have stripped away all of the country's air defenses. Should Israel so please, they could airstrike the Ayatollah himself the next time he sets foot in public without having to worry about planes being shot down. We need two completely independent states that can just leave each other the fuck alone.If the Palestinians are allowed to have a military, they will use it, perpetually, to try and destroy Israel. They believe that land consecrated to Islam being ruled by non-Muslims is a grave insult. To that end, the reason for the settlements in Judea and Samaria is because it puts pressure on the Palestinians to accept a deal rather than try to hold out and wait for a favorable US administration that will stab Israel in the back, or for Iran to get the bomb and destroy Israel.Let me reiterate. There is no two state solution that does not place the military power completely and entirely in the hands of Israel that does not result in the Palestinians going to war with Israel. The best solution is a one state solution, where the Palestinian areas of Gaza and the West Bank are autonomous republics (basically), and have equal representation in a supranational government, though they will have no say in military actions taken by Israel, who will be beholden to protect them. Since the Palestinians in their republic will not have any say in what goes on in the Jewish parts of the Israel-Palestine federation (and vice versa) then the right of return is not an issue, so long as refugees go to the Palestinian republic rather than Israel.","title":"CMV: The election is as likely to be decided by the Jewish vote in swing states as it is the Arab vote in swing states."},{"text":"stop trying to make Jonald happen","title":"Herschel Walker just endorsed Jonald J.

I agree, they do hold their people hostage. SO BLAME THEM!!!!!!! NOT ISRAEL.2) They've killed 40,000 according to hamas - with no real distinguishment between millitary/civillian deaths. Additionally most major hamas leadership has died. Including sinwar, deif, haniyeh, issa. Hamas is a disjointed organisation which is a shadow of what it was a year ago.Furthermore Israel have been incredibly precise in their strikes. According to international law, the use of civllian infrastructure for millitary purpose legitimises strikes on those areas. Yet the number of gazan deaths is significantly less than the deaths expected given the ordinance dropped. Indicating Israel is being more precise than they are required to be so under international law.This final part annoys me. Because I think its rather insulting to the number of IDF soldiers who have died going into gaza to label this a genocide. Because the reality is Israel could just carpet bomb/shell gaza into the ground - which is exactly what any other country would do. Yet they put their own troops at risk in order to protect not just israelis, but gazan civllians. So if you're going to make genocidal claims, blame hamas.3) What about america/Britain that bombarded nazi germany/tokyo/whatever causing single night deaths that eclipse all deaths in gaza the past year?

What Hamas did on October 7th was unconscionable. It was one of the sickest acts of violence in a generation. To slaughter innocent civilians in their own homesthere is no punishment severe enough for the people who committed that atrocity. And the people who say, Well, theyve been oppressed by Israel for decades! and think its some kind of justification for mass murder are need to recalibrate their moral compass. But the solution is not to turn around and slaughter 35x as many innocent Palestinians. Thats fucked. What is the goal here? To wipe Palestine off the map? Because thats genocide, and if thats what you want to see, Id be very careful hurling the word Nazi around. Is it to eradicate Hamas? Well, then theyre doing a pretty shitty job of it considering Hamas grows with every child left maimed or orphaned or homeless by Israeli bombs - shockingly, when you destroy someones home and family and life, theyre are more likely to be sympathetic to the political group calling you evil. Continuing this was has no justification. People who are personally invest in Israel want to wipe out Palestine. People who are personally invested in Palestine want to wipe out Israel.

Will say what she needs to say to the American people and then ignore everyone again for the next 4 years. Then if shes up for re-election, she will pretend everything is on the up and up when its not.If Kamala was a strong person and real leader, she wouldve went on Joe Rogan. But no. All she does is listen and follow. Thats not a leader. While Trump is good at dodging bullets, Kamala is only good at dodging questions. A simple question and she starts folding faster than a lawn chair. She starts malfunctioning and then starts cackling.Heres what I pray happens There is going to be a state or two that nobody expects to flip red but will flip red on Tuesday. Iowa could be regarded a swing state. While Trump won both times, Iowa has voted blue 6 of the last 9 elections. Iowa is not a state Trump can afford to lose. I believe Trump can flip a state or two that may have voted blue the last two times but goes red this time.Here are the 7 swing states that everyone seems to be focused onPennsylvania (19)Georgia (16)North Carolina (15)Michigan (15)Arizona (11)Wisconsin (10)Nevada (6)I say Trump gets North Carolina again. Lets also not overestimate Florida. Its went red but Trump didnt win Florida by a lot. The Cubans help win for Trump. We also cant expect the states he won in 2016 and 2020 to always stay the same in 2024. Trump needs North Carolina and Florida locked up. And we cant assume Nevada flips red either since they havent voted red in 20 years. There are many California transplants in Vegas and we saw the blowup doll of a naked Trump on display. Its cities and towns outside Vegas that will support Trump but Vegas holds the highest population density. Nevada cacti ?? cant vote.I feel he can get back Arizona and Georgia who usually go red although Im sensing some doubt with Georgia as of late. Iowa can throw a monkey wrench into our equation if they shockingly flip blue. New Hampshire, Virginia, please shock the world and flip to red. Even Colorado has potential. When I lived in Colorado from 1996-1999, they were a red state. Ofc, I also lived in Colorado Springs which has Fort Carson and Fort Peterson. Then CO went California and have been blue since 2004.Theres going to be a few states that will shock the night and flip when everyone assumes they wouldnt. Im a little scared of Ohio going blue.

Thats a very real issue plenty of people face, and its certainly a disadvantage - even if its not the same as having to pay your way through school. Does that mean having your education paid for isnt still privilege? And equally, arent we behaving exactly like people do to mens issues if we act like this wealthier peers problems dont exist, rather than acknowledging that its possible to have privilege AND for that privilege to bring its own unique issues to the table?  If your hypothetical wealthy peer in this situation insisted having their education paid for wasnt a privilege that would probably rub you the wrong way, right? You probably wouldnt want to listen to their issues or help them by providing emotional support - and nobody would blame you for that. But they havent had your experiences, so they dont realise how it could be. If they talked to you without getting offended and listened to your grievances, and maybe offered a helping hand - to take notes for you in the seminars you missed because you were working or to be your roommate and cover a larger portion of the bills - youd be a lot more willing to listen to and understand their issues too.Understanding privilege isnt about the oppression Olympics or trying to bring others down, its a tool for helping us understand the experiences of others so we can lift each other up. Sure, our issues arent the same, but we can each bring something to the table to help the other - as long as we can recognise how our experiences differ, and that sometimes that means accepting what we think of as normal is actually a reflection of our own privileges.","title":"cmv: Male privilege does not exist"},{"text":"correct me if im wrong but wouldnt trumps odds come down because more people bet on harris ?","title":"Is Trump gonna win or what"},{"text":"Regardless of your good intentions, protest votes will only siphon off votes from the Dems.","title":"Not sold on Harris over Gaza yet anti-Trump, some Pa. activists are asking blue-state voters to cast protest ballots on their behalf"},{"text":"The New York Times has been almost unbearable this election cycle","title":"Why the Right Thinks Trump Is Running Away With the Race"},{"text":"Two options, tell a lie, or, be deemed sexist, racist, fascist, a Nazi, lose your job, lose your friends, lose your spouse, get shot and killed by a radical lefty, etc. Can't blame them for going with option A.","title":"I'm a registered Democrat and I'm voting for Trump this election"},{"text":"Are they though?","title":"Pelosi: Trumps Violent Comments Are Further Indication of His Cognitive Degeneration"},{"text":"Putin really hates life doesnt he?

The Right is confident because the polls show a tie and Trump generally overperforms by a few percentage points.

Nobody knows how this election is going to go. Based on 2016 and 2020, I'd say Trump has the advantage, but the Democratic turnout in 2022 was extremely impressive and essentially countered all Republican advantages.

But heres what I was able to see, for anyone that doesnt want to give NYT trafficThe torrent of polls began arriving just a few weeks ago, one after the other, most showing a victory for Donald J. Trump.They stood out amid the hundreds of others indicating a dead heat in the presidential election. But they had something in common: They were commissioned by right-leaning groups with a vested interest in promoting Republican strength.These surveys have had marginal, if any, impact on polling averages, which either do not include the partisan polls or give them little weight. Yet some argue that the real purpose of partisan polls, along with other expectation-setting metrics such as political betting markets, is directed at a different goal entirely: building a narrative of unstoppable momentum for Mr. Trump.The partisan polls appear focused on lifting Republican enthusiasm before the election and  perhaps more important  cementing the idea that the only way Mr. Trump can lose to Vice President Kamala Harris is if the election is rigged. Polls promising a Republican victory, the theory runs, could be held up as evidence of cheating if that victory does not come to pass.Republicans are clearly strategically putting polling into the information environment to try to create perceptions that Trump is stronger, said Joshua Dyck, who directs the Center for Public Opinion at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Their incentive is not necessarily to get the answer right.Last week, the right-wing influencer Ian Miles Cheong shared a survey with his 1.1 million followers on X. The forecast from a new polling company suggested, without sharing its methodology, that the former president would take 74.3 percent of the national vote  a landslide unprecedented in American history.-So the hypothesis here is that the skewed polls arent necessarily striving for accuracy, its all just a set-up for the post-election chaos. Because MAGA is so convinced that they are a massive movement and not a fringe cult, they dont realize that the massive crowds are inflated by curious onlookers who just want to gawk at the spectacle and say they were there. And even those crowds are dwindling.Scaramucci says Trumpism is dying. I hope he is correct.","title":"Why the Right Thinks Trump Is Running Away With the Race"},{"text":"Eh, Shapiro's support for school vouchers is just as much of a black eye as this is, IMO.

Tim Walz (D), predicted Saturday that women will send former President Trump a message on Election whether he likes it or not.  Now heres the good news, I kind of have a feeling that women all across this country, from every walk of life, from either party, are going to send a loud and clear message to Donald Trump next Tuesday, November fifth, whether he likes it or not, Walz said at a campaign event in Flagstaff, Ariz., on Saturday as the crowd then cheered and started chanting vote.  Walzs comment in the battleground state of Arizona comes just a few days after Trump said at a Green Bay, Wis., rally that his advisor told him not to characterize himself as a protector of women.  My people told me about four weeks ago, I would say, No, I want to protect the people; I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women, Trump said.  They said, Sir, I just think its inappropriate for you to say. I pay these guys a lot of money; can you believe it? the GOP nominee continued. I said, Well, Im going to do it whether the women like it or not. Im going to protect them. Im going to protect them from migrants coming in. Im going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things. The former president made a similar comment in September during a rally.   I am your protector. I want to be your protector, he said. As president, I have to be your protector. I hope you dont make too much of it. I hope the fake news doesnt go, Oh, he wants to be their protector. Well, I am. As president, I have to be your protector. Harris slammed Trumps remarks, calling them offensive. It actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies, Harris said on Thursday. And this is just the latest in a series of reveals by the former president on how he thinks about women and their agency. The GOP nominee has struggled with amassing more support from women during his as recent polls have shown him being behind Harris on that front. But Trump has been outpacing the vice president among male voters with surveys showing a big gender gap between the two candidates.","title":"Walz predicts women will send Trump a message on Election Day whether he likes it or not"},{"text":"This idea that there must never be any restrictions placed on it because it must be allowed to kill who it wants whenever it wants is nonsense.?\\nIs it??\\nIs that not the idea of democratic countries defending themselves??\\nThe amount of people Israel **wants** to kill in not big, and all of them are a threat to Israel itself and the west as a whole.\\nI think you fail to see Israel is under an existential threat and this war isn't in fact just a war in Gaza, part of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but rather a war on Israel, the beginning of Israel Iran war, carried out on Israel and all of Iran's proxy territories, Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, WB, and Iran itself, as well as on Jewish communities around the world.?\\nI'm well aware that people who support Trump don't think like I do.

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as \\"Zionism out of despair\\" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.What's more, Trump's \\"Middle East peace plan\\" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more of a political stunt than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This laughably insincere and ineffective plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is \\"what's best for me?\\"So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can sometimes alter his public mood. He's like a temperamental child really.And that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as \\"radicals.\\"Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said, Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, were going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they \\"have to have a victory.\\"Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is \\"absolutely losing the PR war.\\"Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gazas current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy. Gazas waterfront property could be very valuable, Kushner saidIt's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a \\"Muslim problem.\\" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.In 2015, he said he will \\"look at\\" closing mosques.He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.Trump once said he would certainly implement a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registryHe called for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\\"He's called Muslims \\"sick people.\\"Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that the Judeo-Christian west is engaged in a global war against jihadist Islamic fascism.Then there's Trump's first \\"Muslim ban\\", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of \\"radical islamic terror.\\"While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.And to add to this, let's not forget the recent \\"rally\\" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric and talking points.All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president? That's a rhetorical question by the way.","title":"'Trump is even worse': Bernie urges pro-Palestinian voters to back Harris"},{"text":"I wish I had money for daily pizza ??","title":"Harris and Trump will both make a furious last-day push before Election Day"},{"text":"Just sneak in across their border.  \\nSuper easy, barely an inconvenience.","title":"Be careful about conspiracies"},{"text":"also his middle and opening message too!","title":"Trumps closing campaign message is hampered by distractions, disconnect"},{"text":"Whenever Rs call something a psyop it makes me knee jerk react into criticizing them for not being a serious person.","title":"Famed Pollster Defends Shock Iowa Poll Showing Harris Trouncing Trump"},{"text":"It's because Elon has turned Twitter into a Nazi site that's full of Nazis, with an algorithm that prioritizes Nazis' posts.","title":"Has anyone else noticed that almost every Twitter/X post from someone voting for Harris is filled with MAGA comments?"},{"text":"This gets into what legally defines a \\"highway\\".Most people think \\"highway\\" and just think \\"Interstate\\".

This relative cared so deeply about Sanders' economic program, which could lift millions out of poverty; she saw Clinton as a hawk who had supported the war in Iraq. In a moment of anger, she argued that Trump winning would be better for the country than Clinton winning: maybe a Trump win would lead to Democrats realizing they'd have to stop running more economically moderate candidates, and the party would finally become truly progressive.I never asked how my relative actually voted in 2016. But she definitely voted for Biden in 2020, and she's voting for Harris in 2024. When I talk to her about politics now, she's still angry Bernie didn't win the nomination in 2016 or 2020. But she's *terrified* of another Trump win. Her partner is transgender. She saw Trump end Roe v. Wade. She saw Jan 6.Politics is about compromises over bitter, life-or-death issues. There are so many: abortion. Ukraine. Economic programs that lift people out of poverty. Israel &amp; Gaza. Climate change. And so on.If you only vote for politicians who agree with you on *every* critical, life-or-death issue, you'll often find yourself discarding your vote. That's just how it is in a representative democracy. You don't get to vote on each issue separately, you have to pick a candidate. In this case, I agree with Harris on most issues, and I agree with Trump on essentially none. He's against a woman's right to choose, against opposing Putin's invasion of Ukraine, against raising taxes on the wealthy in order to provide economic support for Americans who need it, *for* the mass deportation of millions, against democratic norms (and against basic human decency and honesty), against stopping climate change or even acknowledging it as a problem... and of course, he fully supports Israel's violence against Palestinian civilians.","title":"CMV: The election is as likely to be decided by the Jewish vote in swing states as it is the Arab vote in swing states."},{"text":"They were doing the same thing in 2020.

A 1-3% win for trump would be devastating. We are a predominantly white state here. Last statistic I could find was 86% in 2023. If this poll is accurate (she successfully called Iowa for trump in 2016 within 1% point and again in 2020 when all national polling was saying otherwise) then that means he is losing the white vote very, very badly. Ive read that Clintons first campaign went into deep panic mode in 2015 when Selzer released her poll showing trump leading in Iowa. Not just because of losing Iowa, but also because it implied that she was doing much worse off Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio etc. There isnt a realistic way for trumps campaign to make up the lack of white voters with any minority as hes largely insulted pretty much all of them. I know there are exceptions, but as a whole he does poorly with minorities in general. If this poll is correct, it likely means that wisconsin and michgan are going to be landslides for Kamala. I would even think that Ohio could potentially be on the table. Another thing to note is that Iowa was +9% Republican and Texas was only +6% Republican in 2020. If shes correct about Iowa, and this is indicative of a national trend, it makes republicans vulnerable in places they never imagined. It could legitimately be a landslide for Kamala.","title":"Famed Pollster Defends Shock Iowa Poll Showing Harris Trouncing Trump"},{"text":"Does it have to be automatically granted?

But in the wake of 10/7 the antisemitic parts of the DNC are loudly demanding that Democrat politicians openly support them in their antisemitism. The Democrats have played the numbers game and realize that they stand to lose more votes by throwing Jewish Americans under the bus (all while telling them that Republicans are Nazis, and if they never consume any media outside of the left-wing bubble they'll believe it) and hoping they at the very least don't vote for the opposition.Anecdotally, and I live in a very blue area (so blue that I've had people tell me in public that conservatives should be lynched), all of the Jewish people I've met have told me in private that they are voting for Trump.","title":"CMV: The election is as likely to be decided by the Jewish vote in swing states as it is the Arab vote in swing states."},{"text":"lol","title":"Boots on the Ground: Man goes to Trump and Kamala rally and talks about the differences"},{"text":"It's like buying a time share","title":"'Trump is even worse': Bernie urges pro-Palestinian voters to back Harris"},{"text":"Dude once I started reading kamala posts and articles I was SHOCKED how hard she came out swinging.","title":"2024s biggest gaffe?
