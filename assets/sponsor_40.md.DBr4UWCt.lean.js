The WSJ is sourced by anonymous \\"intelligence officers\\", and there are good reasons to be skeptical of it. For example, the section on Taiwan is bizarre and somewhat misleading. Why would China go through Russia in order to ask Musk not to activate Starlink in Taiwan? Musk does plenty of business in China and has direct content with Chinese government officials. Why wouldn't they ask him directly? Also, why would a former Russian intelligence officer leak this to the WSJ? That's an tremendous amount of risk to take on for no clear benefit. None of this makes any sense.Also, it's misleading because it's actually Taiwan that's currently preventing Starlink from being enabled. They have a law that prevents ISPs from operating in Taiwan unless they're 51% locally-owned. SpaceX requested that they change this law (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/07/07/asia-pacific/taiwan-musk-ultimatum-war-proof-internet/) but Taiwan refused. The article, however, tries to imply that SpaceX was about to enable Starlink in Taiwan but is holding off due to China's request.I'd recommend withholding belief in all of this until there's something more substantial. Also, I'm a bit skeptical of the timing of this article. Let's not ignore the elephant in the room: it's election time and there are plenty of incentives on both sides to shift the public's perception of Musk.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk has most likely committed treason"},{"text":"sure:  \\n\\\\- voter fraud happens  \\n\\\\- some mass shootings in the usa are fake  \\n\\\\- pedophile rings exist in high places (especially belgium and canada)  \\n\\\\- covid vaccines are unsafe  \\n\\\\- ufos are real  \\n\\\\- gov't exacerbates some disasters (see hurricane helene / hawaii fires)  \\n\\\\- Nephilim looked like clowns  \\n\\\\- unexplained history regarding the mud flood  \\n\\\\- 911 fake  \\n\\\\- Roosevelt knew pearl harbor would happen  \\n\\\\- chemicals in water increase non binary behavior in fish  \\nprobably a lot more though they escape me at the moment","title":"being a conspiracy theorists makes me wanna not be alive"},{"text":"\\"I'd show you pictures of my girlfriend, but they're on a different internet\\".","title":"Years ago there was a viral video compilation of Obama, saying he \\"hates America\\" now its scrubbed off the web."},{"text":"Should also be illegal for news organisations like Fox News to spread those lies.","title":"Biden was right."},{"text":"No what did he say?","title":"Suspect Arrested in AZ Campaign Office Shooting"},{"text":"People with opinions like this never wanna face the massieve godcomplex or alternatively simplemindedness they reveal with these opinions.\\n\\"Deciding for others if they would want to live?

Musk initially supported Ukraine heavily in February but change positions substantially by September of the same year.

Meanwhile, Russian military has been using smuggled starlink equipment at \\"massive scale\\", and SpaceX just claims they can't prevent unintended access. I don't like that the US is dependent on SpaceX, and I don't blame Elon for that at all. I do also think SpaceX is a very innovative company and their work has been great for the US space programs. That said, I don't think Elon Musk deserves full credit for their innovation, and he can still very well commit treason or do other terrible acts, even while being owner/founder of a company that creates great value for the US. As commented elsewhere, even if he hasn't specifically committed treason by using Starlink to benefit an adversarial foreign power while hindering a US ally's effort to defend itself, it's still very possible that he shared inappropriate or classified information with Russia, since he has classified clearance, and had numerous private discussions with Russian officials, including discussions with Putin \\"about future technology\\". To your last point, I'm not sure if that's legally how it works or not, since I am to sure how the term \\"Enemies\\" is legally defined in the context of treason.

For someone who claims to study fascism, I fear he seems to know very little about it, poorly cites opinions of scholars.Lets go over the big red flashing signs of Fascism that you should actually look out for.1. Cult of Tradition: Being hell bent on stopping all forward progress, and maintaining the systems in place even if it requires the dismissing of the truth, or accepting two things that cannot be both true. \\n2. Fear of Differences: Outlined by racism, misogyny, and the call to fear the other. Most likely comes in the form of targeting immigrants or small internal populations. \\n3. Too Strong, Too Weak: Political or social opponents are dynamically cast to be overwhelmingly dangerously strong, or completely incompetent and weak at the same time.\\n4. Modernism Rejection: Similar to cult of tradition, but applies on a more cultural level. Views all cultural changes since the enlightenment as depravity and evil. \\n5. Anti-Intellectualism: Attacks on all areas of science and self-reflection, and believes that actions themselves have the merit, not the fore/post thoughts. \\n6. Contempt for Weakness: Everything from name-calling to outright calls to despise those below in rank or status. This manifests itself generally as being part of the in crowd, and seeing anyone not in the group as weak. Also leads to the belief in superiority, mostly without cause or requirement of cause. \\n7. Manosphere: Men dominate the leadership, and the acts of women outside of what is considered norms is condemned. Disdain and disrespect for women and their rights. Huge emphasis is made on manliness. \\n8. To Oppose is Treason: Once given power fascism quickly and brutally locks down powers of the press, social rights, and rights to petition. Political opponents to be jailed without trials or crimes committed. Dissenters within the party are quickly dealt with. \\n9. Hypernationalism and Racial Exclusivity: High demand for the removal of all thoughts that do not directly concern the country of origin. Foreign aid does not exist, other countries are seen as enemies regardless of alliances. This expands into many things like calling for Keeping the blood pure and they are poisoning the blood of our country. There are many purity tests created through this method: gender, race, height, wealth, looks. \\n10: Religious Corruption: The direct involvement of a church and a belief in &lt;insert religion nationalism. Laws surrounding the involvement of the church in politics and the state are openly broken or outright dismissed, and the church begins to take a direct role in the country.\\nThere are a couple others like imperialism that dont apply, but the Republican Party of today (maybe not 10 years ago) is checking WAY too many Fascism boxes for this to not be taken seriously.

Voters deserve to make informed choices, but deceit robs them of that right, manipulating public perception to serve personal ambitions rather than the public good.Punishing these dishonest practices would deter candidates from distorting the truth to gain power and help protect voters from being deceived. Public office isn't a privilege to be achieved at any cost; its a duty to be fulfilled with integrity. Drawing a parallel, while not the central point, military enlistment under false pretenses is illegal because it involves betraying the trust of an institution built on shared values.

This is the most consequential presidential election in a long time, perhaps ever, for the future of science and the United States, reads the [letter](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/cc63ceb024daa433/07c8ab7e-full.pdf), a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. We, the undersigned, strongly support Harris. The letter praises Ms. Harris for understanding that the enormous increases in living standards and life expectancies over the past two centuries are largely the result of advances in science and technology. Former President Donald Trump, by contrast, would jeopardize any advancements in our standards of living, slow the progress of science and technology and impede our responses to climate change, the letter said. Eighty-two Nobel laureates  from a physicist who [helped discover leftover light from the Big Bang](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/wilson/facts/) to an immunologist who [paved the way for one type of Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/weissman/facts/)  have signed the letter. The laureates include the molecular biologist Gary Ruvkun, the chemist David Baker, the physicist John Hopfield and the economist Daron Acemoglu, all of whom won Nobels this month. Joseph Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001, drafted the endorsement. He said he was motivated by the enormous cuts in science budgets Mr. Trump proposed during his presidency, as well as what Dr. Stiglitz described as the former presidents anti-science and anti-university stances. While in office, Mr. Trump [proposed a budget](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5468112/) that would have led to a severe loss of funds for federal health and science agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency. On the campaign trail this year, Mr. Trump has suggested [shutting down the Department of Education.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/shut-down-department-of-education-trump.html) I hope its a wake-up call for people, Dr. Stiglitz said of the letter. A consequence of this election is the really profound impact that his agenda has on science and technology. The letter also praised Ms. Harriss recognition of the role that immigrants play in advancing science and technology, both nationally and on a global scale. Immigration has been a key issue in this years election, with both candidates promising a stricter approach than their prior presidential campaigns. Many scientists are inclined to stick to their knitting, Dr. Stiglitz said  focusing on their research rather than politics, and on knowledge for knowledges sake instead of the real-world applications that result from it. But theyve recognized this is a moment where you cant be silent, he said.","title":"82 American Nobel Prize Winners Endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Hey hey hey heyy ??

If you asked a similarly uncomfortable question in THIS subreddit, you might get a similar reaction. Id say the problem isnt Democrats or Republicans; the problem is Reddit and the way subreddits are set up and run. \\nThat said, you raise a valid point: Why are Black voters expected to vote Democrat? Good question. I dare say no politician or party should expect anyones vote by default. If expect means count on, then thats just bad campaigning because nobodys vote should be taken for granted. If expect means demand, then thats definitely a red flag. IMO, candidates need to EARN my vote. At the very least, they need to persuade and ideally convince me that voting for them is the better option for me than voting for someone else, both now and in the future. \\nOne last thought: even though I think your question was either disingenuous our historically incompletehistorical Southern Democrats arent around anymore, for all intents and purposes, and historical Republicans (as in the actual party of Lincoln, not the party of Lincoln??) arent eitherr/democrats should really not have banned you, unless they have good evidence that youre a spammer or a troll. \\nSorry, that was a longer comment than I planned on.

They combine research from polls and then apply their own spin. They really don't seem to be politically motivated.So all of your points are valid, I while I partly agree, we aren't the intended audience for trump propaganda, I doubt either of us represent swing state America. The popular vote is literally meaningless, its like bitching about passing yards.Those things you mentioned simply don't matter to more than half of the voting electorate.I dont see why Kamala wouldnt win them this election because a vote for Biden back in 2020 was a vote for Kamala.GW Bush, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, Joe Bien, Mike Pence, Kamala Harris, JD Vance, all of our modern party understanding of politics shows that we pick VP candidates not based on popularity, but based on a perceived appeal to a concerned party.I can walk you through each of those VP separately if you'd like, but ALL were chosen because they provided image support to concerned voters or donors, not because they would fair well with independent candidates.Kamala hasn't won a national election ever. She performed worse than Vermin Supreme in 2020, she got such little funding she dropped out before votes were cast.To be honest I think most of DNC leadership full understands the weakness of Harris as a candidate just every other reasonable DNC friendly candidate is waiting to 2028 to run in an effort not to throw their careers away.Shapiro and Newsome are fucking sociopaths but they can afford to sit this election out, Harris had to run now to continue to have the same level of impact.Not conservative but far left.We probably should have had an actual primary where Joe Biden stepped down, and America got to vote.Sorry for the long response.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"It is either that or vote for four more years of a weak president that was the VP of a weak president.

Religion is something that evolves just like the other mythology that exists in a culture, and **no religion is a monolith**.Even _just_ looking at Christianity, there were two massive reformations to an existing religion - Christianity itself is an offshoot of Judaism, which in turn inherited a lot of its stories and tradition from other religions. Christianity explicitly treats the Old Testament as scripture while rejecting the Law of Moses that's _very explicitly_ spelled out therein.There's also the protestant reformation, which was a _major_ rebellion against the corruption in the existing church. Modern American Christianity descends from these roots, and tends to continue in the proud Christian tradition of challenging tradition and evolving (despite how conservative it can appear to those of us on the outside). The top level comment mentions queer friendly and progressive congregations, which is in direct constradiction to Christian tradition. Even the Mormons, who are _famously_ problematic, unified, and staunch, have gone back on a couple of their problematic teachings in the last 50 years.This isn't unique to America and Christianity either - Thai Buddhism and Vietnamese Buddhism share a lot of mythology, figures, and traditions, but at first glance the two versions look impressively different. Traditional elements of Thai Buddhism that may be considered regressive (forbidding women from becoming monks comes to mind) are not just missing but _totally reversed_ in Vietnam - you'll see more statues of the female presented boddhisava Guanyin than you will of the Buddha himself, and find quite a few female monks.We **absolutely should** condemn anybody who uses their religion to justify bad action, and we **absolutely should** condemn people who support them because they're \\"fellow Christians.\\" But we should also be careful not to blame bad behavior (even broad bad behavior) on people who do not share that bad behavior but do share similar faith.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"These strategist accounts always talks to themselves in the same boring sarcastic tone.

But there are just flat out things we will always have to import. In my field we design and build our products in the US. But some of the products need a special coating. And there is only 3 companies that create that costing. None of them in the US. And it wouldn't make sense for a company to open in the US because the business isn't there. So I look at that and say what good does a tariff on that do.If we are going to best China and India the only way is to sell them more in dollar amount. Than we buy.

Even if you dislike the speech/religion, you should be supporting the speech/religion from the standpoint of freedom of speech when the speech/religion comes under attack. But this does not mean you necessarily condone or agree with the speech or religion.   \\nSo if Islam is getting banned in your country, and you feel that the reasoning given is insufficient (i.e. terrorism being pushed by Iran/Saudi Arabia in the name of Islam), you can choose to stand with Islam, but that does not necessarily mean you are converting to Islam just for the sake of it. Your involvement does not need to go any further than simply voicing your disagreement, and perhaps voting for the candidate that's againts the ban. Of course, there's a fine line between those actions, so for instance, Candidate A is an atheist who's for the ban, Candidate B is a christian who's againts the ban, and Candidate C is a muslim with links to organizations known for terrorism who's againts the ban. Its on you to make sure your support does not end up resulting in a situation where worse freedom infringements is the result.   \\nTLDR, you can support a religion's right to exist, but you do not need to agree with them. Same goes with speech. You can support someone's right to march with Nazi flags, but you can at the same time give them the finger and refuse to be associated with them.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Go get 'em, Tiger!

Musk being hypocritical with his own private platform is another issue, however, even then, the censorship on Twitter has decreased (based on my understanding, I don't really use Twitter).trump has praised netanyahu multiple times and elon shared champagne with him at a bombing site... we know their position on Israel. Also, while this is an issue you're right, it's not what the election will pivot on.I never said he was pro-Palestine. Lmao, he's quite the opposite. However, neither is Kamala, so those single-issue voters will either vote Kamala, begrudgingly, or not vote at all.ince trump has stated he will go after anyone that basically disagrees with him, there's that (removal of rights) - if kamala had said those words, just imagine. Eh, you could argue some Dem policies are for the removal of rights, such as certain forms of gun control (e.g., bans based on vibes of the firearm) and linitations on free speech (e.g., hate speech laws). In any case, both sides are arguing the other wants to take their rights away, they just disagree on what rights they're supposed to have. in 2016 trump DID have the benefit of the doubt.That's true, but Kamala also has to fight against incumbency, as Biden dropped out and therefore she will be blamed for any issues regarding the Biden administration.

I generally agree with the Democrats on some issues (e.g., healthcare) and the Republicans on others (e.g., freedom of speech).I don't think Kamala will **_necessarily_** win the election as she was quite unpopular during the 2020 primaries. She wasn't even in the top 3, as far as candidates go.Some of her past actions, such as incarcerating weed users while admitting to smoking weed, make her quite unlikable. Her past as a DA and AG, given her record, is also antithetical to many Democrat policies. Many things that she did would be (and were) strongly criticised by the Democratic establishment, however, as soon as she became the candidate, all was forgotten.I think most of the fervor around her is fabricated, partly due to my Reddit feed being full of pro-Kamala posts from generally non-political subreddits, which usually is a sign of astroturfing.I also believe that the Israel-Palestine issue will be a focus of this election. Neither Kamala nor Trump has a stance that the pro-Palestine voters agree with, but they would generally vote for a Democrat, thus only reducing Kamala's chances.

He left office with the lowest ratings in history and Obama was meant to be a repudiation of the Terror wars and many respects a revitalization of what the CIA called Vietnam Syndrome where many came to the realization that every war since WWII has been a complete disaster with respect to the ends sought AND were sold on lies. Unfortunately Obama represented a redoubling of intervention and disastrous wars. Trump represented (emphasis on representation) a repudiation of both Bush and Obama foreign policy that divided the GOP, and of recent divided Democrats as antiwar Democrats are endorsing Trump, and the Neoconservative Republicans are endorsing Harris; Harris and Trump warmly welcoming these respective endorsements.With this in mind, the specific issues you name: the falsifying of business records is a non-issue to the working class compared to the issue of war, inflation, and immigration; top issues spanning Democrat and Republican voters. The nuance of those cases, and the fact they are not fraud cases brought by the people the falsification of business records would have theoretically impacted negatively, and in the context of an open effort to go after him for anything anyone could possibly find, is a rather pathetic embarrassment for those trying to paint him as a felon. Yes, they ultimately won, but to even call it a Pyrrhic victory is an over statement. The goal wasn't direct punishment for the wrongdoing but to paint a particular narrative, and it has utterly failed. This is because as mentioned, media trust is at an all time low, and while corporate media continues to have excellent message discipline, they fail to adequately account for the fact they do not have the level of dominance in media they had even a decade ago.Democrats won't go after Trump for connections to Epstein for the same reason they won't go after him for war crimes. Both sides are implicated.For January 6th, again, corporate media pushed a very targeted agenda. But between the year of rioting going on before, the zero threat that anything would have actually come of it (for example, compare it to the ousting of Yanukovych, what happened 1/6 is a joke to even call much of anything), the fed involvement as a trap, Corporate media just never sold that narrative to anyone except hard core anti-Trump people.In this respect it is not that he is immune but that the people targeting him, even rightfully so to some degree, 1) out of touch with what people care about, or 2) implicated in the things he has done that are exceptionally terrible. Thus, what you are calling \\"immunity\\" is just politicians playing a losing game for one reason or another.You may believe this argument falls firmly into the category of what you have expressed \\"won't change your view\\", but maybe with some consideration precisely an aspect you may be willing to change your view on.But critically, I strongly believe some acceptance of these key elements are necessary if there is any chance of keeping him out of office, and that the view expressed as it stands is directly contributing to his possible reelection.","title":"CMV: Donald Trump is literally immune to consequences"},{"text":"It was his Supreme Court lmao ??","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"Im Jill Stein and I approve of this message /s","title":"As Harris Courts Republicans, the Left Grows Wary and Alienated"},{"text":"Well, you make the claim \\"there is nothing the left hates more than moderates\\".

After so many years of \\"both sides-ing\\" and normalizing Trump whilst losing vast numbers of readers/viewers to online media, their only claim to being superior to independent online media sites was that they were more \\"credible\\" and \\"objective\\". But at the same time they've also clearly succumbed to the allure of the same clickbait and outrage culture that they've been claiming to be against for so many years.If Harris wins by a reasonably comfortable margin and it turns out it's not as 50/50 as they've been claiming for months, their entire credibility goes out the window and it's not at all unrealistic to say that they'll lose even more readers/viewers as more and more people continue to retreat into their own personal media bubbles and reject the mainstream even more.So they have a real stake here in trying to stoke doubt in the public even as they claim to be against what Trump stands for. They may say they're endorsing Harris, but they've spent so long preparing the public for a Trump government, any result that isn't remotely close to this could do serious damage to the future of mainstream media and legacy outlets like the NYT, CNN, Time Magazine, etc etc.I don't consider this a good thing because I think responsible journalism should still be something we should have out there and people only watching/reading media they want to hear about just further diminishes the idea that responsible journalism actually exists anymore. And NYT's idea of responsible journalism has become so misguided. But in chasing the clickbait/outrage attention, they've largely been responsible for their own decline in standards as well.","title":"As Harris Courts Republicans, the Left Grows Wary and Alienated"},{"text":"Pure copium","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris will win the election."},{"text":"u/RamenEarthgummies C your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 2:  **Don't be rude or hostile to other users.** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.

If so, there are a million concerning ideas and questions that go along with that. What are the criteria for this? If it includes wage/wealth level so they wont be a drain on welfare as you mentioned, then how are you not basically arguing for eugenics based on economic class? Who determines if prospecting parents meet the criteria? The government? For people comparing the overturning of Roe v. Wade as progressing towards a real life Handmaids Tail, a governmental body determining who gets to reproduce sounds pretty damn dystopian. How do you avoid corruption or implicit bias on these child courts? What do you do if someone doesnt meet the criteria but still wants a child? You drag them away kicking and screaming and force them to have an abortion? That doesnt sound like the woman getting her choice with her body at all.

Redfield is low rated. I can check on Quantus and Morning Consult, but I think theyre low rated as well.

Most posts seem to come from self-described radical feminists, and they talk about men like they're some particularly virulent disease or an unusually aggressive kind of hornet; neutral at best but most likely dangerous, no deeper motives or values or thoughts besides base impulses to harm others, and best to avoid. The way they talk about men is dehumanizing and completely devoid of empathy. I actually had to step away from all of this because it was affecting my mental health. I have a young son and I'm really concerned about him growing up in a world where it seems like most women parrot this kind of cartoonishly hostile rhetoric and any pushback, like \\"Hey this seems kind of misandrist\\", seems to get you automatically labeled as part of the problem, or \\"one of the bad ones\\".Like, I've had feminists try to use laundry lists of crime statistics to prove that men are dangerous beasts.

Reaching out to your friends is the best thing you can do, because they're going to listen to what you have to say.  Strangers doing volunteering don't necessarily get that courtesy.* Generally, canvassing and phonebanking have the highest success rates.  Right now, in my opinion, is also a great time to textbank.  If you just want to tell 10,000 Democrats \\"Hey, don't forget to vote, and here's a link with the info you need\\", that's where textbanking shines.* The best volunteering is the one you actually do.

Its nothing new](https://thewarhorse.org/far-right-misinformation-military-policy-lethal-force/). They explain better than me (sort of) Correct. Thank you. The below comment is taken from a previous comment I made on this sub. It was in the middle of the discussion about 5240.01 but Im too lazy to reformat and it gets the point across:\\nThat is a clear misrepresentation of reality and how laws work. This is the premise Im arguing against in case it isnt clear - That the September 27th 2024 DOD directive 5240.01 grants use of lethal force against civilians THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY DIDNT HAVE. 5240.01 is a directive (aka guidelines or standard operating procedure) on how intelligence agencies should collect and disseminate information, who they can work with etc. It is not a law, executive order, etc. Thats not how any of this works. There is clear outline for Military use against civilians in the Constitution, the Insurrection Act, the Posse Comitatus Act, etc. The DOD cant slip a paragraph into a DOD directive and suddenly make it legal for our military to kill civilians. Thats what Im arguing against and not how it works. Under the Constitution, states retain the primary responsibility and authority to provide for civil order and the protection of their citizens lives and property. The federal government 1s responsible for protecting the states against invasion and insurrection, and, if the state legislature (or the governor, if the legislature cannot be convened) requests it, protection against domestic Violence. While Congress is also empowered to authorize the militia to be called forth to execute federal law, historical precedent suggests that such use was meant to be rare.The Constitution permits Congress to authorize the use of the militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions. And it guarantees the states protection against invasion or usurpation of their republican form of government, and, upon the request of the state legislature, against domestic violence. These constitutional provisions are reflected in the Insurrection Acts, which have been invoked numerous times both before and after passage of the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 1385, in 1878. Congress has also enacted a number of statutes that authorize the use of land and naval forces to execute their objective.Source- The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law","title":"Do not riot"},{"text":"Have you actually looked at any of the cases?","title":"Did Kamala Harris lockup thousands of black men and put them in prison as DA District Attorney in California?"},{"text":"These are the same people arrested for voters fraud after voting twice or stealing someone else's ballot and voting twice.

Also, the majority of people who believe in Christianity may not always be a random street preacher or crazy and bigoted evangelical, but rather someone who is normal and generally kind due to the beliefs from Christianity regarding forgiveness and virtues (Im not Christian btw just guessing based on what I know about it). There also Lutheran Churches around my town who display the pride flag openly, so no not every Christian is homophobic either.  The same can be said for Muslims. Yes there are a very tiny amount of extremist Muslims who believe women shouldnt work outside of the home or shouldnt have any rights. Thats shitty. But there are also Muslims that are studious, kind, Muslims that are queer and Muslims who use what they learned from their religion for good purposes. TLDR: yes there may be problematic parts and people in each religion, but that doesnt encompass the entire religion as a whole","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Jeffrey fantasizes about beinging Trump's personal toilet","title":"Suspect Arrested in AZ Campaign Office Shooting"},{"text":"Never was, and definitely Not anymore?https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/trump-on-lgbtq-rights-rolling-back-protections-and-criminalizing-gender-nonconformity","title":"Gay voters are smitten with Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Thank you for voting and growing!!","title":"My first vote!

It's the liberals, progressives, and leftists who are against far-right Jewish contingents in Israel. It's the liberals, progressives, and leftists who are against far-right Islamic contingents in countries like Turkey, for example.The most famous examples of \\"leftism\\" were radically atheist.What progressives aren't OK with is the marginalization of minority groups, which includes Muslims (mentioning them specifically as you opened with this example).To identify as a white supremacist you need to believe in white supremacy. To identify as a Muslim, for example, you essentially just need to believe that Muhammad was Allah's final prophet. The same way that to identify as a Christian you simply need to believe in Jesus. You can be a Christian/Muslim/Jew/etc. without subscribing to the socially unacceptable (and often illegal in the West) parts of these religions.

They need to prove their ideology by putting the lowest white man (they can elect) in and see him do better than the black man. If he wasnt as good, or worse flubbed a global pandemic lost an election and couldnt even hold a Bible upright? Their ideology would be flawed. So they need to put him back in power by any means then gaslight us that he is doing great to preserve their mental framework of the world. Other wise the problem might be in the mirror and they dont have the maturity to consider that. Its not so much that they love trump but he was the lowest white guy they could elect in 2016 and now they are committed because admitting he (a white guy) failed admits their whole ideology is bs.

The DAs job is to represent the state in the best way they can, while the job of the defence attorney is to represent the client.  The DA doesnt make the laws, doesnt arrest people and doesnt lock people upCongress makes the laws, police arrest and investigate and judge and jury determine guilt and sentencing (based on the parameters of the law).  The racial profiling of the accused is on the police and if the law is not just then it needs to be changed.  Harris was competent at her job.As an attorney, emotions and feelings dont come into it.  Both sides argue their case and then the jury/judge decide.  It can feel horrible prosecuting some cases but you have an obligation to your employer (the state and the people) to do it in the best way possible.  If you become a defence attorney it can feel equally horrible defending someone but your obligation is to do it the best way possible.  It is why there is a high degree of burn-out and people often then pivot into something else (Harris into politics, I went corporate).I apologise for the TED talk but saying any DA locks people up is demonstrating a fundamental lack of understanding of the legal system.  Any criminal case in CA is People of the state of California vs name of accused so the DA is representing the people, and has an obligation to prosecute if the evidence is that a crime has been committed.  If she refused to prosecute based on race you have a reason to blame her for something.","title":"Did Kamala Harris lockup thousands of black men and put them in prison as DA District Attorney in California?"},{"text":"So, I do want to first say I get where youre coming from here. I make this comment as somebody who isnt religious.I think theres a few levels of framing to examine here.Firstly, you mention how supporting freedom of religion is more acceptable than supporting hate groups. And youre absolutely correct. But I think one key detail is different here: hate groups are defined by their beliefs against a certain group.Lets say you heard someone say, white people are the smartest and most superior race. It doesnt matter if that person identifies as a white supremacist or engages in any white supremacy groups. You can label them a white supremacist, because (in simplified terms), thats what they are.But lets say you heard someone say Women dont deserve rights. You couldnt look at them and say, Yep, theyre a Muslim! You couldnt even confidently say theyre religious. So if you take a top-down approach, religions topic of focus is broadly defined by what deity they believe in.Do most of those organized religions come with some form of ostracism or hatred? Sadly, thats very true. One could even say in some religions its a foundational principle. And do some people use religion as an excuse for, or even a facade for, hatred? Absolutely.But if all, say, Chinese people suddenly went to an alternative dimension, Sinophobia would no longer exist. Granted, its incredibly likely theyd find another feature to latch onto. But their entire structure would be reorganized. Whereas, conservative Christians would experience very little change.Additionally, there will always be people with religious beliefs who dont buy into hatred towards groups that many or most of those in their religion do. That can be complicit, I agree. But, nonetheless, its not believable for a white supremacist to say, I actually believe all races are equal.And to examine it through the very broadest lens, religion is more acceptable because well, it is. Its a great insulator. Its a major cultural divisor. Its not typically considered select or radical in its widest form. Nonetheless, while its true you wouldnt be as widely accepted for saying that you dont think religion should exist, its still plenty accepted. Ive heard loads of people speak negatively against Christians as a whole. Its not unusual to hear of hatred towards a group, such as the LGBTQ+ community, and for atheists/agnostics to say, gah, I hate Christians. So, while the sheer depth and number of religious individuals alone does affect how its framed, I dont think its considered taboo to eschew it.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"the few remaining Mormons I've met aren't actually hardliners on this","title":"Sen.

And of course that's really never the case.Online voting means more opportunity for fraud, be it domestically or from some international source. All the computer nerds in all the other countries wouldn't be able to figure out how to manipulate the system?It would also require a lot of additional steps, which creates a lot of additional confusions. I've been told black people don't know how to use computers, so wouldn't adding online voting only disenfranchise people?The software used would have to be anonymous, since I can't imagine making the coding public would be a great thing to show hackers and foreign enemies. So now you're just having to trust those who do the coding to be completely honest with their software. I've already seen videos this week where voting machines were changing peoples' votes when it printed out their ballot. Certainly Republicans have problems with Dominion. And I would also flip that around and ask if you all would have any worries if a Trump nominee were in charge of managing the software for online voting.Online voting also requires the voter to verify their identity first, and that raises a lot of issues with telling the government who you are and how you're voting. If I'm to believe what reddit says that Trump is going to track down all democrats and put them in a concentration camp, wouldn't something like verifying your identity in order to vote democrat be a good way of tracking down you pesky democrats?But no I'm sure everything would be on the up-and-up.

The CDC also found that there are 3.3 male suicide deaths for every female suicide death. In contrast, in research studies, women are two to three times more likely to discuss thoughts of suicide than men, and there are approximately [three female suicide attempts per every one male suicide attempt](https://afsp.org/suicide-statistics/).Reporting more suicidal thoughts is not a good indicator as it's well known that men tend to mask those things due to not having any platform or social circle to even open about those thing making these statistic completely irrelevant. I don't know how suicide attempts are comptabilized and classified as well. As far as I know it could be self-declared and hugely biased. Also the link points to a page where none of this statistic are present. It's only stating that female students attempted 1.86 times as often as male students (13% vs. 7%). The link referred might be more up-to-date than the article cited.* One potential reason that men die more by suicide than women is that men, compared to women, appear to be more fearless of death and able to tolerate more physical pain. As such, they may have a higher capability of a lethal suicide attempt if thoughts of suicide develop. This understanding is fairly intuitive. If people do not fear death and can feel confident they can tolerate the pain associated with suicide, they may be more likely to follow through on a plan to [die by suicide](https://youtu.be/DESRIZtUIT4). This concept is a central component of the [Interpersonal Theory of Suicide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072480), which provides clear hypotheses about how the desire and capability for suicide develops and has been researched for almost 15 years.Citing one reason or theory is just that, a reason and theory. It could be that the feeling of helplessness or lack of emotive support is totally absent in the live of alot of males thinking about suicide.* This means that for many men, their first attempt at suicide is fatal, whereas women are more likely to live through a first attempt. In fact, less than half of men who die by suicide have a documented history of one or more previous suicide attempts, whereas well over 50% of women who die by suicide have attempted before.Ayyy! First attempt at suicide is more often fatal for men which leads to a direct decrease of suicide attempts! Who would have thoughts? Especially the fact that 50% of woman who die by suicide are doing more than one attempt bolstering the numbers sadly... Sorry for the passive-aggressive tone but this got me mad.* Another important suicidal driver for women is major Depression. According to a Danish study, major depression is approximately [twice as common in females](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11104395/), and is known to underlie more than half of all suicides which can potentially account for the increased rate of suicidal behaviours in women.Once again Severe Depression being twice as common in females is still a \\"flawed\\" statistic as men tends to not seek help.Those are my main concerns about the articles without even introducing stats like Men being twice likely to be alcoholics and three times more likely to become drug addicts which both usually comes with a severe unhappiness which can lead to even more deaths by self-destructing behavior. That's a cause that touch me alot as the vast majority of my friends and even friends of friends have bad mental health and had even lost some of them to themselves. I didn't like seeing that article that downplay the problem, at least in my immediate environment. I'm biased but the quality of this article is poor.  **That's the only subject I don't agree in the list. Men's mental health are not taken seriously enough even by men.**","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"You still believe in people?","title":"Years ago there was a viral video compilation of Obama, saying he \\"hates America\\" now its scrubbed off the web."},{"text":"They have no shame.","title":"Biden was right."},{"text":"A Marxist Libertarian?

If you are a nazi or a White Supremacist you are so because you believe in X, Y, and Z. That's it. If you are a believer in a religion you might believe in A to Z, or anything in between. If you are from a Christian background, you have Christians that do not give a fuck about the Pope. I swear to you, I have Muslims who drink alcohol. In fact, the only Muslim I can't remember meeting is one that eats porkYes, you can flatten anything, any group: \\"Women are sluts\\", \\"men are abusers\\", \\"Christians are pedos\\", \\"Muslims are bombers\\", but none of them are true. But saying Nazis want a pure nation is true  I don't think we should ever just support a religious group or ideology because of some grand objective. Doing so only helps spread it more. What is that ideology? Slaughtering non-Christians? (They haven't done that since before). What is it?What support are we giving them? Or actually what support do you see that you disagree with? Are we supporting ISIS? Are we supporting paedophiles? Or are we supporting people exactly like yourself to have the freedom to believe in their religion the way some belief in their crystal balls?","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Blimey. Such a fine intellectual and a world-renowned expert on fascism","title":"Is Donald Trump a fascist?

Religion is often lumped in with protected \\"identity\\" as if it's inherent, and we typically allow people to self-ID their religion. But with secular ideologies, we have no problem with ID'ing others, often as an insult. People get called Nazis and Commies all the time without identifying themselves as such. It demonstrates a society-wide respect for religion (no matter how bad) that no secular ideology, (no matter how good) will ever earn. Kinda weird honestly.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"This is why there are different denominations, a Catholic and a Presbyterian and a Baptist have incrediblely different interpretations of the same book and deity. Catholics don't even view the baptisms of the other Christian denominations to be valid, and Baptists don't view infant baptism in the Catholic church valid. Anglicans are ok with divorce, but Catholics aren't. Muslims believe in God and Jesus, just not that Jesus was the son of God. Mormons believe in God and Jesus, but also that there was another prophet in Adam Smith, the rest of Christianity clearly doesn't not believe in a 'modern' day north american prophet or the translation of golden tablets in a hat.And none of this takes into account the many many other religions that exist all around the world. So no, you can't really point to religion as a universal source of shitty behavior, because shitty behavior is just an aspect of humans, not religions. Case in point, I have a cousin who's Catholic beliefs had her vocally worried that if my nephew wasn't baptized that if something happened he would end up in hell. While I have one of my best friends is a Presbyterian minister, who I shop with for clothes to go clubbing in, who is down for my polycule drama updates, who I can chat indepth with about the intricacies of my various casual sex relationships and I can count on to give solid advice on how to navigate any situation regardless of if she personally wants to participate or not. I've helped her with naming a church, and researching potential arguments when she was maybe facing a heresy trial for using the term mother god when that is acceptable in according to the presbytery. The interpretation of a translation of a translation of a translation is messy business. Not everyone is going to take the same messages away from ancient texts. Not everyone is going to take the same moral from the same parable. It's not religions that are the root of the assholery, they are just the lense some use to focus it. Others see religion as inspiration to do more good. To be a Christian just means you believe that Jesus was the son of God, everything else is details. To be a Nazi you have to actually buy into the group goals, participate in it's actions and defend its principles or risk death along with everyone else. I haven't been to a Catholic Church since I was 13 and I don't think I will ever get off their register, no participation necessary.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"As a guy who knows a thing or two about military PsyOps: ?if one of my subordinates came up with something as nutty as this, hed be on guard duty until I got a replacement.","title":"Democrats' Trump-Hitler Fable Is A Military-Grade Psyop"},{"text":"The worse part is the guy got out on bail.

It is easy to discredit someone by calling them a Nazi and associating their ideas and opinions with the scum of the Earth. Most folks arent able to truly distinguish the real characteristics of fascism because the waters have been so muddied. This topic and its complexities are something Ive taken notice of and have chosen to educate myself so as not to engage in inflammatory rhetoric.I will attempt outline below the contributing factors that make up the fascist movement with how best to understand and spot fascism in todays tumultuous and often weird political landscape.Ive found that author Umberto Eco most enlightening in this endeavor because of his direct experience with Mussolinis fascist regime growing up. He wrote about his experience in his 1995 essay: Inventing the Enemy.The 14 points of Fascism:\\nPowerful and Continuing NationalismFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.Disdain for the Recognition of Human RightsBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of need. The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying CauseThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, illegal immigrants etc.Supremacy of the MilitaryEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.Rampant SexismThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.Controlled Mass MediaSometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.Obsession with National SecurityFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. Immigration and border security are common talking points when enforcing this fear.Religion and Government are IntertwinedGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the governments policies or actions.Corporate Power is ProtectedThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.Labor Power is SuppressedBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.Disdain for Intellectuals and the ArtsFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.Obsession with Crime and PunishmentUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.Rampant Cronyism and CorruptionFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.Fraudulent ElectionsSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\\nMaga comfortably embodies 12 of these 14 characteristics.","title":"Is Donald Trump a fascist?

We don't charge as much as some of our neighbors - but we like consistently reliable people that we actually LIKE vs a tenant who may fail in 2 years and the space sits empty for a while. During the pandemic we were fortunate enough to have enough in reserves to help some of our tenants ride out income difficulties, but we've not built them back up to what they were.  They've done a big leap in property taxes where we are - and we've had to tight up on waiting a couple of days or weeks for rent even from tenants we know will eventually be good for it.  If they were to do this kind of thing - penalize us for owning more than one property and raise our costs (when we COULDN'T pass it on to tenants with already established leases).. we'd probably have to try to sell it to someone like those thousands of rentals, or declare bankruptcy.

We shouldn't push reasonable religious people away from reasonable moral positions and towards an uncharitable literal interpretation of their religion.

But the people in power, namely Netanyahu and his political allies, benefit greatly from the conflict. That's why he has repeatedly rejected deals that would have brought all the hostages home. If Israel wanted to destroy the whole Gaza strip wouldn't it be easier to burn the entire city to the ground or flood the area?Gaza is not a single city. So I'm already questioning your knowledge on the situation. But \\"burning the entire place to the ground\\" is really not too far from what's already happened. They've bombed every population center from the north to the south to the east to the west. The destruction and rubble are everywhere. Large portions of the remaining population are currently living in tents, because everything else has been destroyed. If Israel didn't care about the citizens of Gaza why would they warn them in Arabic to vacate the area before its bombed?They do it so that supporters like yourself have a bit of plausible deniability when trying to justify their atrocities. This way they can blame the victims for being in the \\"wrong place\\" (their homes). Furthermore, many Israeli officials and military leaders have made it clear it is their intent to drive fear into the Palestinians in order to coerce them to apply pressure against their foe, Hamas. This is pretty much the textbook definition of terrorism by the way, but I digress. The dropping of paper leaflets informing people to flee in terror is not a pre-emptive measure, it is a core part of the operation. Has their ever been a conflict that didn't result in collateral damage?No there has not, and in this case if there were only isolated examples of inadvertent casualties I probably wouldn't be here arguing with you about this. But after an entire year+ of watching the destruction unfold I believe it's clear they are not behaving within the bounds of international law regarding proportionality.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"I dont need a video of Obama saying he hates America to know he hates America.","title":"Years ago there was a viral video compilation of Obama, saying he \\"hates America\\" now its scrubbed off the web."},{"text":"Lmaooooo if you think Harris is a communist.

I had spent a lot of time in feminist communities before this, but had gradually drifted away from spending as much time in them due to exactly this sort of tenor of hostility. And I told my GF that I had no problem with her sharing stuff from feminist websites with me, but I was a bit uncomfortable because I felt like the tone of the sites she was sharing stuff from was fairly hostile towards men. She said that she didn't feel that the sites were hostile towards men, but when I asked her what she would think of a site which engaged in all the same sort of rhetoric, but flipped around towards women, and I gave her some examples she agreed were analogous, and she concluded that I was right, she would immediately identify sites that talked like that as misogynist. She wasn't deliberately looking for misandrist sites, but it was still an undercurrent in all the places she frequented. I asked if she couldn't find other feminist communities without that element of misandry, and she told me \\"I don't think there are any.\\"I don't think she was right about there being literally none, I think they *were* out there. But they were also in the process of becoming increasingly fringe. She wasn't deliberately looking for communities that were hostile towards men, but it was such a ground-in feature of the environment that she didn't notice it when it was there. There's an easy argument which I appreciate that she didn't make, that it *would* be misogynist to talk about women the way people talked about men in those communities, but it wasn't misandrist to talk about men that way, because men actually *are* privileged, and women are disprivileged, and it's appropriate to account for that in our rhetoric. The problem with that justification is that, setting aside how accurate it is as an analysis of where men's and women's privileges lie, *people notice when you treat them like you don't like them.* If you constantly treat people like you don't like them, and when you're called on it, look for justifications to continue doing it instead of changing your behavior, you can tell those people all you like that your agenda is ultimately on their side, but they're still going to feel disliked and unwanted.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"https://ndss.org/about#:~:text=with%20Down%20syndrome.-,Does%20Down%20syndrome%20run%20in%20families%3F,21%20(nondisjunction)%20and%20mosaicism.I'm reading that 1% down syndrome cases can be considered inherited.

I first stumbled upon the alt right by watching videos on \\"how to talk to girls\\", or \\"how to be more confident\\", or even my favorite \\"workout routines to get big.\\" It's hilarious looking back on it, but as like a 13 year old it made perfect sense that YouTube, with all of its information would have someone that had answers. Wanna know what popped up? The sleezy pickup artist/gymhead videos. Hell, just now I searched \\"Confidence\\" and Jordan Peterson is the third video. Here's the thing, most of the videos I watched were not super crazy! Talking about how women value confidence and being strong, or having money, or being smart will give you more confidence. Like, to a 13 year old, that makes a decent amount of sense. So now, I trust that source of information more. You see Arnold Schwarzenegger for example and think yeah, of course he's confident. You see Bill Gates or other business moguls and it makes sense. Of course they're confident, and because of it (this isn't true btw) women want to be with them, duh! But then it can get nefarious. At that point as a dumbass 13 year old, you're on the very edge of the rabbit hole and everything that you've seen lines up pretty well with your interactions with the world. Then the next video you see pop up from one of these now trusted sources of guidance is talking about how you've got to be careful because other men are your competition, and you've got to be the top dog to get what you want. That implies for the second time that women are fickle, materialistic beings. It's the subtle but persistent ratcheting from trusted sources that creates the pipeline from something as innocuous as \\"how to be more confident\\" to \\"women (or the *other) are going to take advantage of you.\\" But that's not the end of it. You get older, you maybe pick up a job in school, or you graduated and are in the workforce, or maybe you don't have a good home life or are living in poverty already and your material needs are not being met at the same time your emotional needs aren't being met because you've unwittingly isolated yourself from those around you out of fear of being taken advantage of. You find solace in the only community you've got left, which is the same people that led you to isolate yourself in the first place. You're feeling very real, very concrete pain and struggle. You see firsthand that in our society there are those that make it (the top dogs) and those that don't. You've now already been primed to be watchful of the *other that is going to take advantage of you. The worst part about it is that you are being taken advantage of! Just not by the people that you think are doing it. It's the combination of very real material struggle, and lack of a community outside of the other fearful and angry people that also feel the same struggle, that calcifies your world view. This could all be avoided through interventions of those around you, whether it be family, friends, or even educators that validate the struggle you feel while pointing you in the correct direction on why/where that struggle is originating from. This is all not even taking into account generational prejudices and biases that you've been soaking up from those around you since the day you could communicate. TLDR: Slipping into the alt-right is subtle and easy to do, especially when primed, and even easier when you're a child and the almighty algorithms serve it to you like candy. There needs to be active work from society as a whole in order to intervene and properly orient its members, especially its young ones, on where there struggle is originating from and how to deal with it in a healthy, uplifting way that validates their pain while providing off ramps from wherever they may be. I have a young nephew. I've already talked to his parents about when he gets old enough to use the internet that we keep an eye on him and that we need to actively talk to him about things like self-value, empathy, relationships, wealth and how our society creates pressure and pain so that he has the tools to actively manage it all.

Claiming that Democrats are the *real* racists, and that democrats are \\"the party of slavery and the KKK.\\"This is obviously revisionist BS I've even heard from some alleged black voters that they're frustrated because Democrats just \\"expect\\" them to vote blue.But that's not the case. If there's any expectation, it's one that asks American voters of all backgrounds, races and ethnicities to understand an important history, and not just the history of the civil war era, but one that sheds light on the modern Republican party's roots in a conservative movement that exploited racial tensions to thrive. The conservative platform since the 60s and 70s, has contributed to many of the widespread sociocultural issues that have been plaguing black communities for decades.But let's start with \\"Democrats are the party of slavery\\"It's more accurate to view the history of our country's changing political landscape as shifting along a conservative-liberal spectrum. Party platforms can be more correctly characterized by where they fall on that spectrum.Our first party system emerged with the national politics of its time. The issues that split the two major parties, the Federalists and the Democrat-Republicans, were steeped in a divide over early questions about federal powers, economic policy, the constitution, social issues, etc, in other words, it was grounded in the context of the past.But over time that context has changed dramatically, and our major party's platforms have transformed to reflect this change.In the early 19th century, the first party system began unraveling in response to a split within the Democrat-Republicans party, among other things.Several new parties emerged in response to changing ideas and a changing country.But what remained relatively constant, was where Americans fell on that ideological spectrum.This is why calling democrats \\"the party of slavery\\" is extremely dishonest.It was, in fact, the  *CONSERVATIVE* party that was largely pro slavery, made up of many southern whites and biblical literalists who defended their God given right to *own* black people, who later obstructed reconstruction efforts and facilitated the Jim-Crow era and the \\"black codes.\\"It was largely southern white *conservatives* who argued in favor of slavery. Promoting ideas of paternalism, and using the Bible as a justification for slavery.Which party today proudly brandishes their Confederate banners and memorabilia? Appeals most to evangelicals, biblical purists, white supremacist groups? Which party paints the South red on an electoral map? Proudly identifies with their \\"southern heritage,\\" and throws a fit every time a confederate icon's statue is taken down? Hmm?Today's Republican/conservative party has its so called \\"values\\" steeped in limited government policies, religious doctrine, chauvinism and over-the-top nationalistic and nativist attitudes. A party that insulates itself, is intolerant of out-groups and foreigners, and has grown increasingly obsessed with its own culture wars. The Republican party of today doesn't resemble, at all, the Republican party of *strong federal government* founded during the antebellum period.So what happened? Did the parties \\"switch?\\" Well, I prefer to call it a realignment of sorts.In the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of shifting ideologies and political platforms, the Democratic party began departing from its earlier policies. This realignment involved Democrats supporting social justice reforms and the role of the federal government in helping to establish these changes, it also involved new deal Democrats who sought to expand federal power to address economic crisis, labor rights, banking reforms and the emergence of social programs. For all intents and purposes, the Democratic party began adopting more liberal policies. By the mid 20th century, Republicans began shifting towards conservative social policies and staunchly supporting a platform of limited government, deregulation, redistributing wealth to the top, segregation, Christian fundamentalism, and anti-gay and \\"law and order\\" messaging. Democrats on the other hand, became more and more associated with liberal policies, civil rights, welfare, labor reforms, and a stronger federal government.The southern strategy was employed by Republicans, starting in the 1960s, to draw white, southern conservative voters to the party who felt alienated and disarmed by civil rights movements and desegregation policies. The strategy was also successful in appealing to racial tensions and promoting conservative and religious \\"values.\\"The strategy proved very effective.By the 1980s, a new conservative movement had formed. Over the course of two decades, conservative figures like George Wallace, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan of course, used \\"Law and Order,\\" \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric and campaign talking points to engage with aggrieved white conservatives in the south particularly. This language was riddled with dog whistles meant to inflame racial tensions and inculcate conservatives with fears of racial violence and crime in their neighborhoodsOut of this movement also emerged the \\"moral majority,\\" and a Christian fundamentalist revival that drew more and more conservatives to the Republican partyThey also attracted white conservatives to the party by appealing to their grievances around how these deep societal changes were challenging the heteronormativity of a pre racial America and a dominant white culture.The Republican party began ramping up its \\"culture wars,\\" and \\"holy wars\\" that sought to establish a fight between the forces of good and evil, a war threatening the White, Christian hegemony.Politically, the Republican party around this time also began reviving and refashioning for the modern era, policies that previously brought about the Jim Crow era. Including policies that widened the racial wealth gap, that contributed to racial injustice, disparities in generational wealth, that reinforced race-based housing discrimination, policies meant to sequester and neglect black communities, and policies that disproportionately jailed black people and denied loans to black families, farmers, business owners, etc...The Conservative party today has deep roots in this movement and has grown increasingly more ethnocentrist as a result.We don't *expect\\" black people to just vote for Democrats. We just understand that Republicans have been deliberately inattentive to your needs and your problems by undermining efforts to address them.That Republicans *and* conservatives have been demonizing you and your communities for decades, highlighting crime in your neighborhoods to push their agendas, using you as scapegoats, and dismissing the ubiquitousness of race related problems through \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric.Not to mention, minimizing your own experiences by claiming that racism is over, that anti-white discrimination is more prevalent than any other kind of discrimination. That black people have been overly catered to, that any talk of racial injustice is simply the curse of \\"wokeness.\\" We understand that Republicans/conservatives have historically contributed more than most, to the ongoing generational issues that impact black communities in particular. That theyd prefer if you didn't vote at all, and are doing everything within their power to try and make that happen.","title":"Obama to Join Call Rallying Black Men for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Well, theyre literal fascists ??","title":"They're Burning Ballots.

My mom dropped out of school her 10th grade year and never went back, and never got a job. My dad was a drunk, and left when I was 14, and my mom blamed me (at 14) for the divorce, and she had serious mental problems.Later my dad, the cruel drunk that he is, told me they would have aborted me, but he didnt have $150 in 1971, but it wasnt so costly after Roe v Wade when they killed their next unborn child, who would have been my brother or sister.With my dad gone and my mom having never finished the tenth grade or had a job, we were as dirt poor as it gets. Living in a small trailer with no power or water, and usually no food. I started working at 14 to eat, and I have bought all of my clothing since then.This wasnt a good time, after my dad left and our home life fell apart, I went into drinking and marijuana for some years, and pulled out of the tailspin to end up getting a decent job not having finished high school.I say all of that to say this:I am 53 years old, and I am a work from home IT security professional making $100k plus. On a GED, some certs and a lot of hard work.I have been happily married to my wife (who leads a ministry in our church to help single mothers before and after the baby is born) for 21 years.I have a 14 year old son who is 64 and 215 pounds, an elite baseball player with a future. I have an 8 year old daughter who loves life. She dances in ballet, she makes crafts, and she is kind to others.Both are smart and get good grades. We have a stable and loving home.So this is you saying you think I should have been killed in the womb because my parents were messed up, but that wasnt the thing that defined my life.

You are taking a life out of this world. Abortion should be used for extreme cases (incest, rape), medical necessity, and as a last resort when responsibility failed. The problem with the Abortion debate is that the two extremes are the loudest. The government and media promote those voices as they keep the populace divided.

Extreme rhetoric is allowed to fester in smaller leftist communities, without any condemnation from larger, more moderate communities. Very rarely is it acknowledged in leftist communities that men see disproportionate rates court conviction, and more severe sentencing. Very rarely is it discussed that sexual, physical, and emotional abuse directed towards men are taken MUCH less seriously than it is against Women.i mean. i genuinely don't know what you're talking about. i have never seen any actual leftists saying \\"kill all men\\" or \\"all men are bad\\" or anything of the sort. i have seen right wing individuals say that leftists believe this, but i've yet to meet a single person who actually does. i have seen stuff like disproportionately severe sentencing and abuse against men being taken less seriously being considered an important discussion topic. the leftists i speak to are passionate about the unique challenges men face. i'm a woman but i started to get sucked in by the online right around when i was 13/14 years old and one of the main reasons i wasn't was that i went to check how the leftists rationalize being such hypocrites pretending to care about equality but failing to address issues faced by men like not being taken seriously when making rape accusations and i found that they were literally just lying.The issue is at the time there werent online spaces where I could learn about these issues without feeling personally attacked.you said this in a comment. i feel for you and i understand how isolated that must have made you feel. but again, this is simply not a failure of leftists. i know countless men who didn't have this problem because they did find these spaces.i have found no dearth of leftists willing to gently explain to young men that we are not *trying* to blame them, as individuals, for all of society's ills. but for the men, any leftist analysis at all comes with feeling weird and icky and gross about centuries or millenia of men as a class systemically oppressing women to further their own status. this is not just for men, by the way. this is for any privileged class in society. i'm an upper caste north indian woman. the same applies to me when trying to understand the history of casteism in india. it's a horrible feeling.now think about how that holds up to right wingers gently explaining to young men that actually, you're right, and here's the very simple solution that doesn't require you to feel icky and gross at all. you're right, young men. those leftists are crazy. you don't have to examine your place in the world. society should be like in the 1950s or in the 1800s or in ancient rome or whatever and women should be seen and not heard and they should have sex with you because you're awesome and a man and men and women are just inherently different. this is just easier, emotionally speaking. i mean, i'm upper caste by birth, right. that's not something i can change. i don't want to be dealing with being told that i benefit from casteism. i don't want to benefit from injustice. what if casteism just isn't real? what if all those lower caste people deserve being treated like shit? then i don't have to feel bad. then i don't have to realize that i had a leg up in my life that other people didn't. then my psyche is safe and i don't have to change my behaviour to be a better person, because i'm already a good person.could leftists do more to reach out to young men? yes. and we should. and i do genuinely think it would help if more young men were taught about intersectionality and leftism and the concept of patriarchy through the lens of \\"you were taught to not express your emotions because it's considered feminine because the patriarchy is bad for men, too\\". i think we would get through to a lot more men that way. but sooner or later you're gonna have to get to the \\"men are more privileged than women\\" conversation and no matter how you slice it it's going to feel bad to talk about. because no matter what else may be true for a young man, we simply don't raise boys to think that being strong and capable and intelligent are inherently female qualities. and it will have to be a conversation at some point, and that's the point that we start losing people. and i don't think leftists can offer a more comforting alternative than \\"don't worry, you are right, and women are bitches\\". because that would be lying.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"These people lack critical thinking skills","title":"3 Delco town hall participants tell CNN theyre now backing Kamala Harris | If I had to pick right now, I would pick her, said Lauren Holden, who said she voted for Trump in 2020."},{"text":"They have control of a platform that a certain group of people wont stray from, keep the propagamda rolling for those who stay","title":"Tried to ask r/democrat, what do yall think?"},{"text":"538 is not predicting trump will win.

I wont dance around it either. I think religious people recounting what essentially amount to audio-visual hallucinations on a daily basis is ridiculous. I think people attributing their own thoughts to messages from god is not only stupid but is a way of removing responsibility for your own life from the equation. I think good religious people who ignore the insane parts of their religion because they arent socially acceptable are cowards who are too afraid of living in a world where they dont know what happens next to stand up for their morals. I think they would rather participate in a fundamentally damaging belief system than sit with that discomfort. I think the world would fundamentally be a better place if religion never existed, and will be a better place as more and more people continue to abandon it. I think the racism really only comes in to play when people hyper-focus on islam. If you disapprove of one abrahamic religion but dont harp on another its gonna raise eyebrows.

And when you look at Fascist movements, this seems to be the case, Yockey thought that nations come and go in cycles and there needed to be a unification of the civilizational soul that would bring about a lasting pennacle that would eventually decline again, replaced by something new. Ilyn was more concerned with Russia, and was the origin of what he referred to as Christian Fascism, believing that the innate moral purity of Russian culture and institutions would be a guidance for the world, creating an apotheosis and redemption of the world by vanquishing western degeneracy. Evola, perhaps the most influential, believed that a civilization built off personal and civilizational strength, usurping the Christian order that favored the meek and gentle, that he viewed as leading to Communism, and replace it with the concept of the mighty ruling will bring about this greatest civilization.                \\n                                                                                                               \\nWhen you look at nations that have put Fascism into practice, this notion becomes affirmed. Putin himself often quotes and praises Ilyn, and his notion of a pan-Russian apotheosis seems to be affirmed by his moralizing statements, even going as far as to call Ukraine a nation ruled by Satanists, furthermore, he has this notion of Russian moral purity, and a national destiny, and quite obviously utilizes the state as an all conduming structure, having control over buisiness, religion, association, what people read, and what they say. Likewise, such notions of national destiny, ethnic moral purity, a return to some mythical past that will be the guide towards a progressive future( progressive in the sense of moving towards an end, not in the notion of modern vernacular), a moral principle of might makes right, eventual apotheosis, and individual and every aspect of the nation as being one with the state, and the notion of the great man, are very present in Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Franco Spain, and Fascist Romania.                                                                              \\nWith all this out of the way, I think the best definition of Fascism is an ideology defined by the complete envelopment of all aspects of society, religion, and the individual being one with the state, from which man can achieve his ultimate development, bringing about an end to history through expansion, and modeling his actions on a mythologized past, characterized by notions of moral purity, and from this act, can that end of history, or apotheosis become achieved for the world. The issue with your definition is that it was from someone who was not part of the school of thought, who was not fully familiar with the philosophy, but was an outsider looking in from the view of an outsider with all of its limitations. When someone tells you what they are, maybe you should believe them, and not try to define it for them.                 The issue with Trump is that fundamentamentally, he is not conservative, Fascist, or really any other ideology, he is a populist with a somewhat rightist bend on social issues, hectic in matters of foreign policy, and economically liberal, he is a populist first and foremost, thus his rhetoric will be a lot more devisive than his actions alone, which has proven true. I myself am a conservative, in the sense of Edmund Burke or Tolkien, and so I am somewhat alienated from many people who are Republicans, because they too are mostly centre-right, and generally favor Trump's economic and foreign policy. No one I know, and I live in a very Republican area (Alabama), believes in notions of racial moral purity, national destiny, rule of the strong, or the state and person as one, or that there is an achievable end to history in the same sense as Hegelian thought, nor has Trump said or done anything that I am aware of that would indicate such. And there is this notion of idealizing the 1950s as a traditionalist period, when in truth it was socially transformative to decades prior, which is where I clash with a lot of Republicans as a conservative, as my view is that a true notion of traditionalism must be rooted in the idea that we are reliant on the inherited wisdom of the past, the democracy of the dead as Chesterton puts it, we should value the traditions of other peoples, as those withstood the test of time and were generally being improved, which is why I am a staunch anti imperialist, furthermore, our institutions should be localized, suited to become more personal with the governed, and our leaders should be permanently tied to what they rule, its prosperity is their's, its misery is their's as well, which is why I am a monarchist, the issue with American Republicans is that they want to propegate tiny Americas the world over, Americanized culture, American government, American social views, they are not truely conservative or traditionalist because they show no love, knowledge, or respect for the traditions of their own or others, this is why populism is dangerous, because it is fickle, it has no limits or philosophy and encourages the state to bankrupt itself to bribe the electorate, for which politicians will suffer no consequence. This is why I despise both Trump and Harris, the former because he has no underlying philosophy or love for the suppossed values he espouses, and the latter because she seeks to destroy that tradition, silence the memory of the dead, and without that wisdom passed down through the ages, we become a nation of fools and hysterics. Trump is fundamentally not a Fascist, but  a populist, his ife and career will likely be seen with little regard or consequence other than him proving that populism is viable on the national scale, as, ironically, populism is fickle im every matter apart from its permanence, so I consider it foolish to start a moral crusade for or against him, let history judge, and judge by history, but always be honest and vigilant when you say something, as words of such immense danger will be given little weight if overused.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"I have a degree in physics.

Basically, it's defending an anti-natalist position because existing lead to more harm than good for the child.

However, those who are born will, for sure, endure some pain in their life (even simple things like being hungry or cold or sick) but they only MAY live good things. Furthermore, what we enjoy only happens for a short time while there are always plenty of painful things which can last your whole life.From the point of view of someone who want to maximize happiness, not having a child is the most rational choice.

It's generally not cool to disparage any people based on a broad identity, race, nationality, or religion. That's what racism/phobia is. There is a huge spectrum in beliefs and practices from people that self-identify as a Christian/Muslim etc. It is not proper to assume that because an individual identifies as Christian/Muslim that they are anti-gay or whatever. Hate the viewpoint not the person.Supporting their right to coexist in society as long as they coexist with us is how tolerance works. From what I can tell, there are many Muslims living in the U.S. for a long time and this hasn't been an issue. The problem seems to be that the right-wing has convinced a lot of people that all Muslims support extreme views and want to install sharia law but as far as I can tell this just isn't the case. If it was the case or it becomes an issue, then I would expect the left to resist it. There are indeed extreme sects of Islam, just like there are extreme sects of Christianity. The extreme views that those sects believe and push can and should be called out. But this doesn't apply to all members of that religion. The right wants you to believe that all Muslims support an Islamic state. I would agree that ISIS is not compatible with a free democratic society, similarly I would agree that Christian Nationalism is incompatible with a free democratic society. These specific viewpoints can be rejected, because they do not support a secular society that allows all beliefs to exist.White supremacists and Nazi's are not broad religious beliefs. They are fairly narrow view points or movements that advocate for a society that excludes and discriminates against people and religions. So no, they are inherently incompatible with a free democratic society too. At the end of the day, this is a very dishonest conservative talking point. Muslims arent passing anti-gay laws in the US, Christians are. Yet they want you to believe that Muslims are the danger to progressive ideology. TLDR: Religion is too broad a label and being prejudiced against individuals for their membership to a broad group like nationality, religion or race is unfair discrimination. Specific viewpoints like White supremacy, Christian Nationalism, ISIS, Nazi shouldn't be tolerated because they specifically advocate for an intolerant society.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Yes.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"Its going to come down to PA.

Why shouldn't we just enforce sterilizations for the poor, for criminals, and other undesirables? Surely your moral system would view forced sterilization as a moral good, right? If not, then we need to examine your belief that reducing births is a moral good.Following that, why not just execute the poor we already have?

In fact, people often hate them and make terrible comments. But you could never get away with similar comments about Christians or Muslims or any other religion even if their views are similarly abhorrent. Youd be called racist or islamophobic.  Why is it ok to disparage secular ideologies but when it comes to religions that is ground not to be trod upon?Because it isn't comparable.Hate groups base their identity, their idiology, their actions on a central belief that they are (A) superior and (B) entitled to harm those whom they view as inferior.Slap a Swastika on an asshole's arm, and he is immediately identified a cesspit of human excrement. There's no nuance needed, he's identified himself as such and is proud of it.By comparison, people of varying religious faiths, hold a wide variety of nuanced beliefs. Some may hold discriminatory ideas, some might even support violence, who knows? They certainly do not make it easy to identify. They don't wear hate symbols and certainly don't go around proudly spewing vitriol.People deserve to be judged by their actions, not by the stereotypes others assign to them. I might not agree with their faith, but they aren't forcing me to adopt it. So why on earth should I take issue with them? I think the world would be better is we pushed back against any ideology that was harmful to other people.Yes, in theory. But it's honestly not that simple. For example, some people view hijab as a symbol of gender oppression. But women of many cultures cover their hair. (Men too honestly). Would I demand that women remove their headscarves to free themselves of oppression? No, it's her choice if she wishes to wear one, and I have no idea why she chooses to do so. But if she chooses NOT to wear a head covering and someone harasses her for it, THEN it's right to speak up on her behalf. I dont think we should ever just support a religious group or ideology because of some grand objective.

This isnt a religious plot, although it can have religious elements to it, but instead one based off a growing secularized population. Fascisms myth is secular at heart in its implementation, despite Trumps appeals to the Christian nationalists. Paligenetic in this definition is a new birth, which is different than wanting to return to say, the 1950s. Fascism is future oriented ultimately, and so while some movements have made appeals to the past, actualized fascist regimes must implement completely new institutions because the old ones are all decadent.Populist ultranationalism is almost straightforward, but I want to note that ultranationalism goes beyond your run of the mill patriot or nationalist rhetoric. This is often where the purity of the nation comes into play. Outside actors like minorities or immigrants serve as scapegoats for whatever the fascist needs to target in order to consolidate power to the regime. This is because fascism requires a perpetual revolution if a fascist regime takes power it must maintain its revolutionary phase or else it will be seen as decadent// illegitimate.I type all this out and I havent answered your question. I havent read the Eco essay, so Umberto may have said what Roger Griffin is covering, but Griffin is in very depth in terms of regime analysis. Id recommend his work. Lastly, I am pretty much in coordination with your view. The fact that we had a regime change in 2020 and a failed insurrection on January 6th at the very least shows that fascist elements in the Republican Party do existthey just havent been able to violently seize the democratic institutions. Everything else seems to be there in regard to Griffins definition.

It will show the unbeatable will of the American soldiers as well -- showing them to be much more than the weaklings and losers that Trump says they are!Also I think an ad depicting a reenactment of how the German soldiers, including all the top German brass, were forced to pledge undying fealty to Hitler as they crisply, in perfect synchrony, shouting: \\"Sieg Heil!\\" with the German palms-open salute. I'd like to see Hitler's face morphing into a smiling, grinning Trump. I feel such an ad will open the eyes of many, many voters.

In order for there to be an oppressed class, there must be an oppressor.  The problem is, a naive approach to that completely ignores intersectionality.  A young white man who grew up poor, in a single parent home, got student loans to go to community college, lives alone in a one bedroom apartment, worked a few places and somehow manages to land a job at a big 5 tech company **isn't** your oppressor, no matter who you are, and the idea that he is on a rocket ship to management simply because of the color of his skin is *grossly* exaggerated.  The *oppressor* isn't handy-wavy \\"white men,\\" it's *very wealthy white men who oppress everyone else* (classical Marxist theory, not this hand wavy extension of it), and guilt by association, especially association tied to skin color, isn't exactly a good look for the left.  It's also not their *fault* that men tend to be more represented in math and science. It's not like some cabal somewhere got together and said \\"let's keep the girls out of math and science.\\"  I raised two girls.  Neither of them liked math or science that much.  I have no idea why, because God knows I like it, and I *tried* to get them to enjoy it, but their reaction to its puzzles wasn't the same as mine -- for them it was laborious.  For me it was fun.  So what is that?  I didn't *try* to make it happen, but it *happened*.Nor does it mean that *because* there are a lot of young white men in the sciences that they *automatically* have some kind of bond.  They're all lonely together, based on what I see as a 50 something older man about to retire.  I don't exactly understand the dynamics, but *something* has clearly created a *lot* of lonely and frustrated young men, which we did not see a generation ago, at least not in these numbers.I sometimes wonder if it's not the featurelessness of online dating.  Basically you're like a baseball card.  When my generation was dating, I couldn't count how many couples came together that weren't that predictable.

They are mainly chosen based on how well they can help win the election. Often the running mate is chosen primarily because they appeal to demographics who are not likely to otherwise like the candidate. i.e. Trump picking Pence in 2016 because he was a prim and proper evangelical establishment republican. Because every president in history has been a man and all but one have been white, the fact that Harris is non-white and female is perceived as a potential weakness by the democrats. So they were pretty much guaranteed to pick a white man to 'balance out' with voters who might be uncomfortable with that. Walz is also quite popular in his home state, which leans democratic but could still swing. People like to vote for candidates from their state, so Walz pretty much locks down Minnesota. And it is believed that he will appeal to working class Midwesterners because he is from the midwest, isn't rich, and worked as a humble school teacher for many years. Midwest/rust belt states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are pretty much guaranteed to decide this election. Choosing someone who appeals to those voters was crucial, especially given that Harris is from California, which isn't always looked upon favorably here in the Midwest. Clinton has strong qualifications to be president on paper, but she is wildly unpopular. She lost to Trump in 2016 primarily because she was so strongly disliked that many voters from her own party didn't turn up to vote even though they would have preferred her over Trump. Notably, she lost the crucial states Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, so we know she isn't very popular there. One of the biggest criticisms of Harris is that she did not have to win a primary because Biden handed his nomination to her. Some people see this as the elites divvying out power amongst themselves rather than letting voters decide, and Clinton is seen as the paragon example of a Washington elite.TLDR She would have been a bad running mate for Harris because she doesn't balance out Harris' weaknesses.","title":"Why didn't Kamala Harris choose Hillary Clinton as her running mate?\\n"},{"text":"Can you see that one or did Reddit hide it also?","title":"Can someone please explain why this election season is so bad?"},{"text":"Unfortunately?

This is based on my recollection and may or may not be factual.There used to be a time not so long ago when two presidential candidates could differ in policy and still have respect for each other as individuals. You could look back to the 2008 election as an example of this. John McCain and Barack Obama respected each other and McCain famously repudiated the rumor that Obama was a Muslim on national television. McCain 2012 had a few more jabs. Obama hit Romney's character even though Romney was squeaky clean.2016 all hell broke loose. A candidate entered the race who was an expert in stirring controversy and despite ALL of the political establishment from both sides of the aisle agreeing that he should not be elected, the people voted and he won. This marked a new era.President Trump was unlike any other president before him because he seemed to revel in calling people from all walks of life fat, horrible, ugly, nasty, criminals. He also had a seemingly never ending list of people who were actively suing him or attacking him for some past transgression. I'm not here to debate the validity of any of that.Since 2016 we have entered an era where it now seems ok to call politicians from the other side of the aisle treasonous just for belonging to a political party. It has been normalized to claim that the other party is attacking your constitutional rights. It has become normalized to call the other party fascists. This has come as a direct result of the Donald Trump era. Some attribute it to him directly. It could also likely be attributed to the changing media landscape. What is clear is that politics has devolved. Sources of news have become more divided and extreme politically. People are no longer picking between 3 news channels and their local newspaper for their information. People get their news from hyper liberal and hyper conservative websites or YouTube channels that earn their money by being sensationalistic. Mainstream media has followed suit and created a circus of talking head \\"experts\\" that are really just some guy they had lying around in the studio with an uneducated opinion.I would just say. Be careful. Don't fall into a trap of \\"hating\\" one side or the other. If it feels terrible it's because the media makes money by making you feel scared. People get up votes for bullying and putting other people down. It's the nastiness of our own species. You're young enough. Take time. Avoid the more extreme news sources and make good decisions for yourself.","title":"Can someone please explain why this election season is so bad?"},{"text":"I was raised in that one, and it's not just the extremists locked into odd rules.The different branches have different ideas of what it means to be a 'chosen people' (extra responsibility, chosen to suffer, privileged status, right to own land in Israel/Palestine) but definitionally they can't believe in equality.

I created a mental list of all the things I prioritize. I prioritize a good economy, support of the Bill of Rights, strong foreign policy, not being in war if possible (I understand a defensive war, but no one is attacking America are they?). All of these are hits against Harris and positives for Trump in my view. I dont like welfare, unemployment checks, or social security, but those issues are not on the ballot so its a toss up . I dont like Tariffs, so that would be a mark against Trump as far as I know, Harris has neither supported or declined support of Tariffs so neutral here. Both of them want to decrease taxes and get rid of taxes on tips. I like the idea, but this notion also incentivizes more businesses to go toward a tip pay program instead of hourly wage/salary. In a system without welfare, I wouldnt have a problem with immigration. However, our system pays illegal immigrants to live here, at the expense of taxpayers so, since our system has welfare, I have to support strong borders lest more immigrants get on the dull. If the system were properly set up, immigration would be good since it would only be immigrants that are coming to become Americans rather than immigrants coming here to get on welfare. So, another mark for Trump.","title":"Can someone please explain why this election season is so bad?"},{"text":"Do you believe if Trump is imprisoned as a result of at least one of his trials, it would be a catalyst for the Republican party to reform itself?","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

So there are a great many people who refuse to participate in polls, and usually it's because they don't feel it's worth their time. This skews the data in a vatiety of ways. The elderly are likely to be retired and have an abundance of free time. Political activists recognize the importance of polls, and are more likely to contribute. CEOs, buisness owners, and working class people may feel like it's only worth it if they're getting paid for it, and these are the same people who are likely to vote conservatively.The second problem is liars. There are some people who will take a survey and intentionally lie in the hopes of sabotaging the data. Or because they fear their responses being leaked. For example, many of the polls i took in highschool asked about pornography, sexual activity, alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, all things that normally get underage teenagers into trouble. Despite assurances that these were anonymous, it still wouldn't be unreasonable for a highschool student to lie or abstain from answering out of fear. And there really is no way to determine if someone lied in a poll.The third problem is that people's political opinions are extreemly fickle. Despite an increasingly polarized political landscape, lots of people still aren't 100% sure who they're going to vote for. If you ask them right now, the answer they give you might be different from what they actually choose on election day.The fourth problem is cause and effect. The poll itself can have an impact on the way people vote. This has been particularly problematic among democrats, who are prone to having apathetic voters who don't turn out if the polls are predicting a decisive outcome. Which is precisely what happend with the clinton campaign. Most popular polls predicted a decisive victory for her, but many democrats chose not to vote, and trump won by a narrow margin. Similarly, both sides often use polls that show them losing to determine where to have rallies &amp; voting drives, which raises turnout among their constituents.Fifth, you actually gave your own reason for why polling is unreliable. Because pollsters don't poll voting blocks that have a consistent voting history, despite the fact that those trends could change at any moment, and if pollsters aren't looking for it, they're going to miss it.Sixth is bias. Some polls are apolitical and trustworthy, but these are not the only polls that exist, or the only ones that voters look at. Because of what i stated in my fourth point, many political polls are conducted with an incentive to skew the data in certain ways in order to influence the actual vote in their favor.Finally, there's just pure chaos. A random polling of any given population will never give you a complete picture of the data, there's always going to be a certain amount of error. Political polling is considered unreliable because the error margin is usually large enough that it can't be used to accurately predict a close election. But, that's exactly what most voters *want* it to do. Because most people don't like uncertainty in political elections.","title":"CMV: The unreliability of polls has been overstated."},{"text":"Didn't it already do that?","title":"Navalnaya's message to Americans: Don't take democracy for granted"},{"text":"I would say that there is reason to believe that introverts who don't like people and don't like talking to or interacting with people may have consistent voting tendancies that are outside the norm for other demographic groups to which they belong.","title":"CMV: The unreliability of polls has been overstated."},{"text":"Youre pro Trump, who is much much worse.

It's not who WE are and it's not acceptable.\\" I think I would also worry that someone defending Nuzzi, maybe even Nuzzi herself, would say, \\"You don't know what it's like, even now, to be a woman in journalism and how hard it is to get access, yadda, yadda, yadda...\\" So I think it would have more impact if it was women who reacted to this. (I used to drink but I've been sober for 20 years. As a result, I've told people who drink, \\"I can be your best friend because I understand and I've been there. On the other hand, none of the BS that you can get away with when talking to the normies will fly with me because I've lived the life.\\")","title":"Im Amanda Marcotte, a Salon journalist who has covered the Christian right and now the MAGA movement for almost two decades.

For what the left should do, I think it goes beyond anything political. I think the content pipeline needs to change. That would change a lot of the way men see things online. I mean look at body image issues popping up for men more and more. It's cause fitness influencers and people online think certain body types are the ideal and anything less is a failure. They also assume what women want and this leads to men feeling less masculine. Jeff Nippard recently went into how men and women view male bodies and attractiveness. Right now there's too much of one type of content being served to men and not enough of the alternative. That can be for multiple reasons. I have no solution for the content thing at the moment. It takes a shift overall of what is profitable. I am also curious to what extent the online left can listen and in what ways? There will be left leaning creators who speak to them. There will be spaces for them. However, will any discussion of introspection be met kindly by everyone online? That's not gender specific here either. Not to mention, there is an inherent flaw in all this. It's not the same people in these forums. We have tons of randos who end up being used as the poster child for XYZ. Plus these men rotate. They age. They leave platforms. So it's not like you can work with them consistently.  There was an incel discord leader who left once he got a gf a year or two ago and on Twitter he announced it. People in that group were mad. With negative spaces online the people who don't improve themselves or try to get out of that space stay there. The incel content is not there to help them. They sell you pain and suffering as well as here give me some photos of your face and I will rate you on some weird scale. The thing is once the men who improve themselves and feel happier with the world get out, they are no longer welcomed and they don't often stay. So we just get a new crop of teens/young men. Think about it this way. Incels have existed online since the 2000s in some form or another. The incels online now aren't all in their 30s and 40s. They're mostly in their teens and early 20s. And it may have expanded globally. So it can involve multiple different types of men and varying degree of issues. The issues impacting men in one area of the world may not be of any concern in another. And the content that tells them to blame all their problems on feminism is attractive when their favorite content creators repeat it. I don't have one specific answer here or a good one. People can say police any negativity towards men as a comment below says. But I mean are the same men going to view women or muslims or any other group that way? Idk how we get through to anyone if we have to carve out exceptions either. I think that leads to frustration and not feeling heard. Obviously people shouldn't generalize, but written comments online can only be so long.It's not a one way street either. Everyone must practice empathy. But giving men space to talk may mean that some men say some fucked up shit and I don't think it's the job of other people to listen to strangers online harass them either. So idk if every person can be listened to. The people running specific spaces need to draw a line somewhere. Some people come into spaces to argue too. I think spaces that aren't inherently political are better. Encouraging people to bond with others IRL is better.I think the online left can encourage people to act with more empathy and compassion. Advocate for things that help everyone and create spaces for each group to feel heard. However, there must be respect shown by people entering these spaces for others around them. It's not easy to create a space to help people who are seeped in hateful content because you have to spend time unwinding those views. People also run into so many people who are not going to change their mind that it's hard to even know who is willing to listen.","title":"CMV: The online left has failed young men"},{"text":"What \\"holding pattern\\"?

It's just white people were naive enough to make their tribalism 'illegal' while basically letting everyone else keep their tribalism.Yes, there is a serious complexity in what is a tribe in terms of race/ethnicity/religion. But at the end of the day, it is basically tribalism. For example some people say white isn't an ethnicity because Irish or Scottish is. But that's not really true. It's different layers of identity. Like Indian/Brown identity isn't really different than a 'white' identity. Indian is a huge country with so many different tribes (Punjabi, Gujurati...) that is similar to European countries. So you have greater identities and lesser ones. Then you layer in religions which also is partly tribal. It just is. As an immigrant, I first noticed this in my highschool in Canada.\\nIn school we'd be taught about how bad racism is and this and that. So a white person should be equally willing to date a black person and anything else is racism. I noticed, this rule simply didn't apply to 'ethnic' people. Us brown people were basically allowed to protect our women. If a white/black guy tried to date an Indian girl, it was okay to threaten/beat him up. I say 'our' but I was a bit of an odd ball and a social observer. I just noticed these things.I have serious doubts today in Canada. I don't know how this plays out. We're not going as hard on other tribes as we do on white/christian people. Some might say that's just because it is okay as whites are on top. But I don't know about that. Depending on what area you are in in Canada, that's not even the case anymore. My highschool was eventually majority Indian. The power dynamic was definitely not... whites on top. I'm very curious about this personally to see how it plays out.","title":"CMV: Supporting a particular religious group because you support freedom of religion is a fundamentally bad idea."},{"text":"A Hitler is someone they write Hit pieces about.","title":"I put together a list of everyone the Left has labeled Hitler.

It very easily becomes more about the person than the argument. But, and more to the CMV, when people say they support a religion, they often mean that we must tolerate a playground of ideas, but not that we must endorse all of them.

The party in control is the only one in control. They self-select who they feel are the best candidates in each and every position in government and take over certain private sectors such as the media in an effort to control propaganda and seize production capacity in a similar way to communism (as well as numerous other systems of government).From this definition, fascism could be extended to DT but not as easily to the rest of the Republican Party. DT has made efforts to self-select many officials in the government, although all of those actions are prescribed by our own laws.Counterpoint: the Democratic Party is fascist by this definition as it eschewed the established presidential nomination process in favor of self-selecting its own preferred candidate. They did not allow a democratic nomination of their candidate like the GOP did.","title":"CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party"},{"text":"Cool. He's a terrorist.

On one hand, our research provides some evidence that particular Trump-leaning voters are less likely to participate in surveys over time. If this is true more widely, the polls could be understating GOP support.
